16490,the content of fat oil and grease fog in the sewer network sediments is the key indicator for diagnosing sewer blockage and overflow however the traditional fog detection is time consuming and costly and the establishment of mathematical models based on statistical methods to predict the content of fog fail to provide satisfactory accuracy herein a deep learning algorithm used a data driven fog content prediction model is proposed to achieve a more accurate prediction of fog content meanwhile global sensitivity analysis gsa is exploited to evaluate the contribution of input indicators to the output indicator fog in the model so that some input indicators that have less impact on the prediction performance can be screened out the best combination of input indicators can be determined and the operation cost of the model can be reduced to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model a case study was conducted in a city in southern china the experimental results indicate that the prediction model obtains good fog estimations and performs well from a single site to multiple sites with a mean r2 of 0 922 showing a good generalization performance through gsa the key input indicators in the model were identified as ph water temperature t relative humidity rh sewage flow flow drinking water supply dws velocity v and conductivity σ and the input indicators such as air pressure ap population pop and liquid level lv can be reduced without affecting the prediction accuracy of the model graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fat oil and grease fog sewer networks deep learning algorithm gated recurrent unit gru multi source data global sensitivity analysis gsa 1 introduction as an important municipal infrastructure urban sewer network is responsible for the collection and transportation of urban sewage and its operation has a direct impact on the urban production and living environment however as the number and density of commercial food preparation and service facilities increase in the city so do the amounts of fat oil and grease fog discharged into the sewer networks he et al 2011 murali et al 2019 wang et al 2021 the fog in sewage is easy to react with other wastewater components and form insoluble solid sediments he et al 2017 kusum et al 2020 exhibiting adhesion and accumulating in the interior of the sewer the deposits eventually reduce the capacity of sewers to drain water and caused sanitary sewer overflows ssos ducoste et al 2017 he et al 2013 to better prevent and control the accumulation of fog sediments it is necessary to detect and monitor the content of the fog wallace et al 2017 however the detection is time consuming and costly which brings challenges to the management and research of fog at present the previous reports on this topic can be divided into two types the first type is the direct detection method that mainly applies chemical methods to conduct measurement which aims to improve the stability and accuracy and or simplifying the procedure over the standard reference methods nieuwenhuis et al 2018 the commonly used methods for qualitative or quantitative analysis of fog include fourier transform infrared ftir analysis iasmin et al 2014 thermogravimetric analysis tga kusum et al 2020 and gas chromatography flame ionization detector gc fid lee et al 2017 the advantage of these methods is that they can produce relatively accurate fog content and the overall process is very stable however these methods need much time and high costs and their applicability is still limited the second type is the indirect detection method that uses the statistical method to establish the mapping relationship between multiple indicators and the target indicators for example nieuwenhuis et al 2018 proposed a generalized linear mixed model glmm to predict the accumulation of fog based on the catchment demographics the accumulation of fog in pump sumps and the pump sump geometry however the modeling accuracy and the prediction results are not satisfactory with the rapid development of artificial intelligence deep learning has become one of the most popular technologies in smart cities and water management lyu et al 2019 recently some studies have used deep learning technology to predict bod5 in the harbor water and chlorophyll in the lake based on big data and satisfactory results have been achieved ma et al 2020 yu et al 2020 to explore the advanced performance of the deep learning technology this study intends to apply the technology to predicting fog in sewer networks the performance of deep learning models is affected by the data set that is chosen for training the learning models hwangbo et al 2021 thus it is crucial to identify some key indicators for training the models and remove the input indicators that contribute less to the prediction effect of the models without significantly reducing their performance chen et al 2020 however few studies have evaluated and identified the key indicators from training data sets that affect the performance of learning models therefore this study aims to demonstrate the application of data driven methods based on deep learning algorithms to soft detect the fog content of the sewer networks in urban commercial districts first a proper deep learning artificial neural network i e the gated recurrent unit gru network was used as the prediction model then global sensitivity analysis gsa was conducted for different time nodes to effectively determine the input indicators that have a greater impact on the fog content prediction and identify the key indicators in the model input to further improve the prediction efficiency and reduce the prediction cost to achieve these objectives the water samples were collected from the sewer networks in a commercial district of a city in southern china and some numerical experiments were conducted 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data collection the study site is a catchment served by the ns wastewater treatment plant ns wwtp located in a city in southern china covering a total area of 146 14 km2 it is a typical urban commercial area with large population mobility and there are many commercial outlets large department stores as well as headquarters or institutions of large commercial enterprises in this area significantly the drainage network is a rain and sewage diversion system and the drainage facilities are well laid in this area moreover according to the time series of sewage flow and rainfall in this study area figure s1 it is obvious that the operation of the sewer network is almost not affected by rainfall runoff in this study six monitoring sites in the sewer network of the entire ns wwtp service area were selected including sites a b c d e and f as shown in fig 1 and the areas served by these six sites are shopping malls that integrate dining entertainment and shopping detailed information for the six sites was provided in supplementary material text s3 some researchers have revealed that the level and velocity of sewage in the urban sewer networks show an obvious daily variation pattern and there will be a peak at noon 10 00 14 00 or evening 18 00 22 00 every day zhao et al 2020 shi et al 2018 similarly the water quality bod5 cod nh4 n tn tp and conductivity of sewer networks also shows a similar fluctuation pattern jiang et al 2021 based on this phenomenon this study considers dividing a day into six periods for monitoring and data collection at the six sites i e from 6 00 to 10 00 from 10 00 to 14 00 from 14 00 to 18 00 from 18 00 to 22 00 from 22 00 to 2 00 the next day and from 2 00 to 6 00 the next day for fog content prediction we consider the following data sources fog content data the samples of sewer networks were collected at different monitoring sites in different periods and transported to the laboratory in time for testing the detailed analytical procedure for fog content was provided in supporting material text s4 water quantity indicator data drinking water supply dws sewage flow flow velocity v and liquid level lv the dws data were obtained from the water supply records of the water supply service stations in the street where the monitoring sites are located which were authorized by the local municipality the flow and v and lv were conducted using the portable doppler ultrasonic flowmeter dx lsx 2 dexi china water quality indicator data water temperature t ph and conductivity σ these indicators in the sewer network were obtained by measuring with the portable instrument hq40d hach usa where t and ph were measured using ph electrode probe ph301 hach usa and σ was measured using conductivity electrode probe cdc404 hach usa social indicator data population pop the pop in the shopping malls served by the six sites was collected at different times of the day the data were obtained from the passenger flow records collected by the shopping malls pedestrian flow dynamic statistics systems which were authorized by the management departments of the shopping malls air environment indicator data relative humidity rh and air pressure ap these two indicators were monitored in the sewer network using the air quality monitor advancedsense pro graywolf usa the data of 11 indicators in six sites for 70 consecutive days from october 21 2019 to december 29 2019 were collected and 2520 observations 6 sites 70 days 6 times day were collected for each indicator resulting in a total of 27 720 data points 2520 observations 11 indicators the maximum minimum mean and standard deviation values of each indicator at the six sites during the six periods of the day are listed in table s2 in addition it is necessary to analyze the correlation between the input indicators before developing the model because indicators with strong correlation will lead to information overlap of input ke et al 2021 in this study the correlation of input indexes was analyzed by pearson correlation coefficient which was carried out using spss 22 0 ibm usa the results in figure s2 show that the correlation between input indicators is weak and the strongest positive correlation and negative correlation are only 0 327 between flow and v and 0 332 between rh and t respectively this indicates that there is no information overlap between the input indexes selected in this study 2 2 deep learning algorithm gated recurrent unit gru among deep learning networks the gru model has an excellent performance in time series prediction and regression processing gao et al 2020 this model solves the problem that the gradient disappears of traditional recurrent neural network rnn in the time series prediction hossain et al 2020 cheng et al 2020 also its internal structure is more concise than that of long short term memory lstm which can reduce the parameters of the network model to shorten the training time liu et al 2020 the gru neural network selectively transmits information through the gate structure as shown in fig 2 each gru unit contains two gates update gate and reset gate and a state hidden state for controlling and transmitting the information the update gate controls the scope of status information the larger the value of the update gate the more state information is introduced from the previous moment the reset gate is a threshold that controls how much past moment information is forgotten the smaller the value of the reset gate the less information is written to the previous state liu et al 2020 the forward propagation of the gru model is described by equations s1 s7 in the supplementary material text s1 the specific process is as follows 1 the gate values of reset gate rt and update gate zt are calculated by combining the input vector xt with the hidden state vector ht 1 and activated by sigmoid function equations s1 s2 and s6 2 then xt rt and ht 1 are combined and the combination is activated through the tanh function equation s7 to create the candidate hidden state vector ht equation s3 3 next the zt is taken as the weight parameter and the hidden state vector at the current time ht is obtained by the weighted average of ht and ht 1 equation s4 4 finally the output value yt is obtained by multiplying ht by the weight and adding the bias of the output layer equation s5 the gru model was established by using keras the advanced deep learning library in tensorflow gao et al 2020 to determine the optimal parameters of the model the back propagation algorithm is exploited to train the gru network the root mean square error rmse was used as the loss function to obtain the optimal weight and bias more details about gru can refer to the work conducted by choe et al 2021 the input variables of the model are ten indicators including pop rh ap dws flow v lv t ph and σ the output variable is fog content the model aims to minimize the difference between the actual fog content in sewer networks and the value from the output layer and it provides a gru based model for soft detection of fog 2 3 model training evaluation and optimization the data with ten columns of input indicators and one column of output indicator were divided into a training set october 21 2019 to december 8 2019 49 days and a testing set december 9 2019 to december 29 2019 21 days accounting for 70 and 30 of the whole data respectively a synchronized training of the model was conducted for all the sites using the data in the same training set the model performance was evaluated based on the data from the testing set in this study rmse and r2 were used as the performance evaluation indexes of the model lagesse et al 2020 rmse measures the existing error of the model and a smaller value of rmse indicates a better model performance r2 measures the accuracy of the model and a larger value of r2 indicates a better model performance the calculation of rmse and r2 are shown in eq 1 2 1 rmse 1 n t 1 n y t o b s y t p r e 2 2 r 2 t 1 n y t p r e y p r e y t o b s y o b s 2 t 1 n y t p r e y p r e 2 t 1 n y t o b s y o b s 2 where yt pre and yt obs are respectively model prediction and observation ȳpre and ȳobs are respectively the average values of model prediction and observation n is the total number of paired model prediction and observation in the testing set the model performance may be affected by the network structure of the model ma et al 2019 therefore the number of gru layers and the number of neurons in each gru layer are optimized for the model grid search is used for parameter optimization the candidates for the number of gru layers were selected from 1 2 3 4 5 following the study of zhou et al 2019 the number of neurons in each gru layer is set to be the same the candidate values include 50 51 52 69 70 rmse was exploited to evaluate the model performance to determine the optimal network structure 2 4 global sensitivity analysis sobol method sobol method is a variance decomposition based global sensitivity analysis technique nossent et al 2011 it can evaluate the contributions of input variables to the output in the nonlinear functions and models also it measures the sensitivity across the whole input space huang et al 2021 significantly it can evaluate the effects of interactions in non additive systems when dealing with nonlinear responses lai et al 2021 additional details of the sobol method can refer to the work described in supplementary material text s2 the sobol method provides the first order sobol indices s1i and the total sobol indices sti for each input indicator in the model to evaluate the main and the total effects mukherjee et al 2021 these two indices are defined for the output result y of the model based on the independence of the input indicators the s1i measures the direct contribution of each change in the input indicators to the output indicator and the sti reveals the total contribution of each indicator and the interaction between the indicators chen et al 2021 s1i and sti are both in the range of 0 to 1 but sti is always greater than s1i because it includes the effects of interactions between uncertainty indicators if the value of sti is close to zero the effect on the output result is minimal otherwise if the value of sti is close to one xi has a very important effect on the output result the theoretical computation of s1i and sti are shown in eqs 3 4 3 s 1 i v a r i v a r y 4 s t i 1 v a r i v a r y where vari represents the amount of variance due to the input variable xi var i denotes the variance of all input variables except xi var y represents the variance of the output result of the model due to the complexity and nonlinearity of the model it is difficult to calculate the variance through analytic integration to address this issue monte carlo simulation was exploited to calculate the conditional and unconditional variances in eqs 3 and 4 thus obtaining the values of s1i and sti chen et al 2021 wang et al 2017 the detailed calculation process is described in supplementary material text s2 meanwhile these computations were implemented based on the python salib package hu et al 2021 besides the input spatial sampling for sobol sensitivity analysis was achieved by using a quasi random sobol sequence with high spatial efficiency carta et al 2020 3 results 3 1 determination of the model structure for a straightforward observation the grid search results of the two indexes the number of gru layers and the number of neurons in each gru layer are visualized in fig 3 it can be observed that when the number of gru layers is 4 and the number of neurons in each layer is 58 the rmse value of the model is the lowest 0 0026 to achieve the optimal performance of the model the gru model with 4 gru layers and 58 neurons in each gru layer is constructed in this study although the deep neural network achieves higher computing energy consumption than the shallow network the experimental results indicate that deep learning obtains better performance it can be seen that the rmse value of the case with fewer layers and neurons layer 1 neurons 50 can be two times larger than the optimal value layer 4 neurons 58 indicating the importance of adjusting the network structural parameters for neural network models 3 2 spatiotemporal variation of fog content in commercial sewer networks and model performance as shown in fig 4 the average fog content in the sewer networks fluctuates daily it is usually higher in the noon period 10 00 14 00 and the highest 0 30 0 60 g g in the evening period 18 00 22 00 the lowest average fog content appears at night 02 00 06 00 and the average fog content in this period 0 10 0 15 g g is less than one third of the highest this result is consistent with the law of drainage in the urban commercial area meanwhile the daily variation of fog at the six monitoring sites shows the same trend indicating that the variation of fog at different drainage outlets is similar in the same area this model achieves satisfactory performance for the prediction evaluation of fog content at the six sites it can be seen from the learning curves in fig 5 a and figure s3 that the model converges fast in the training process and reaches convergence after 2000 epochs this indicates that the gru model is a suitable and efficient fog content prediction model as shown in fig 5 b c and figure s3 the results of the model indicate that the variation trend of the predicted fog content is close to that of the measured results the average and highest r2 of the six sites respectively reached 0 922 and 0 952 site b however the predicted results at sites c and e have a high degree of fluctuation as shown in figure s3 b and d the prediction at site c overestimated the peak of fog content while the prediction at site e underestimated the peak in general the model can capture the trend of fog content well and achieve a high prediction performance 3 3 the fog prediction performance based on different indicator sets to identify the key input indicator combinations that affect the prediction results of fog content the gru model is used to predict fog content based on any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 of the ten input indicators the number of indicator combinations is listed in table 1 and the details of the indicator combinations are listed in table s3 s11 here the data from the same training period at all sites were used to train the unified model and the data from the same testing period at all sites were used to evaluate the performance of the model with r2 as the predictive performance evaluation metric it can be seen from table 1 and fig 6 that the performance of predicting fog content based on any combination of less than ten input indicators is worse than that predicted by ten input indicators meanwhile the average value of r2 increases with the number of input indicators indicating that the number of input indicators is positively correlated with the prediction performance of the model particularly the change in the combination from 1 indicator to 7 indicators is significant with the mean value of r2 increasing more than twice from 0 323 to 0 878 table 1 the change in the combination from seven indicators to ten indicators contributes to a small increase in the prediction performance with the mean value of r2 increasing only by about 0 048 this indicates that the combinations of seven indicators table s9 eight indicators table s10 and nine indicators table s11 can achieve a good performance in predicting fog content which is close to the prediction performance achieved by the combination of ten indicators besides the results shown in fig 6 and tables s3 s11 indicate that different indicator combinations lead to different predictive performance under the same number of indicator combinations table s9 and s10 show that some combinations with seven indicators or eight combinations lead to better prediction performance with the value of r2 higher than 0 90 and some even higher than 0 91 this result is close to the prediction performance achieved by the combination of ten indicators fully indicating that the contribution of each input indicator to the model prediction results differs significantly 3 4 gsa for understanding the relationship between urban multi resource data and fog in this section the contribution of each input indicator to the model prediction results is further investigated based on the sobol indices the input indicator sample matrix consisting of 1200 rows and 10 columns was generated from the sobol sequence and the corresponding gru model outputs were used to calculate the sobol indices the model outputs for the six periods were exploited to identify the differences in the sensitivities of each indicator at different times of the day in this way six time varying values were obtained for each sobol indices the specific results are shown in fig 7 a and b the s1i results shown in fig 7 a reveal that ph t rh and flow contribute the most to the prediction of fog content in the urban sewer networks the amplitude of each period differs slightly but the sti still significantly indicates that these four same input indicators mainly drive the variance of their outputs fig 7 b also the most significant result shown in fig 7 a and b is that s1i is significantly lower than sti and the sum of the values of sti is much higher than 1 indicating a strong interaction of the input indicators on the fog dynamics in the model in other words the combined interaction between ph t rh flow dws v σ ap pop and lv drives the change in fog besides it can be seen from fig 7 a and b that s1i and sti change significantly with time the sensitivity indices s1i and sti of all indicators had similar changes with higher values in the noon period 10 00 14 00 and evening period 18 00 22 00 and the lowest values in the night period 02 00 06 00 this result indicates that the sensitivity indices of the analyzed model are time varying that is the sensitivity indices vary in different periods of the day however this does not affect the contribution of each input indicator to the output of the model i e each indicator contributed similarly to the output across the six periods to further explore the influence of interaction between input indicators on model prediction performance the input indicators were added one by one according to the sensitivity indices from large to small in order to verify the changes in the prediction performance of the model the results of site a are shown in fig 7 c and the other five sites in figure s4 it can be seen that the prediction performance of the model with ph t rh and flow as the input is significantly improved compared with a single indicator as the input and the value of r2 increases from less than 0 40 to more than 0 82 this indicates that there is a strong interaction between these four indicators more importantly the prediction performance of the model with seven indicators as inputs i e ph t rh flow dws v and σ is very similar to that with ten indicators as inputs this result is consistent with the results shown in table s9 and table 1 it is revealed that the combination of these seven indicators is the optimal input combination for the model and the three indicators including ap pop and lv have little influence on the prediction performance of the model 4 discussion 4 1 can the model predict fog content in the drainage network using easy to measure data the deep learning network model developed in this paper realizes the nonlinear mapping relationship between the multi source data ph t rh flow dws v σ ap pop and lv and the target indicator fog and it can predict the fog content in the sewer networks of the urban commercial area at the six typical monitoring sites of the commercial drainage network the variation pattern of fog predicted by the model is generally consistent with that observed and the mean value of r2 is as high as 0 922 it is worth noting that this model can quantify the dependence of fog on the input indicators from the sparse fog data this is significant because the input data in this model including air environment data rh and ap social environment data pop easily measurable water quality data ph t and σ and water quantity data dws v flow and lv can be monitored at a much higher frequency ma et al 2020 spatial resolution zhi et al 2021 and coverage than the fog data currently the hourly or even minutely data can be achieved with online monitoring and transmission equipment rodriguez perez et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 which enables a high frequency prediction of fog content and reduces the time and cost of fog detection however it is surprising that the model cannot predict the fog content well at sites a and b during the peak and trough periods which may be caused by a variety of reasons firstly the representativeness of the fog data in peak and trough periods is insufficient so the model fails to adequately learn the dynamics and dependence of fog in the training process newhart et al 2020 secondly the fog content is detected by chemical methods from manually collected samples the samples may undergo some changes during the collection and transportation process and there may be certain measurement errors in the sample detection process thirdly the peaks and troughs of the fog content often appear in the non working periods noon and evening in the working periods a large flow of people and service industries such as catering are more active in this commercial area as a result the t ph σ flow v and lv change more than those in other periods table s2 moreover it can be clearly seen from figures s5 and s6 that the daily peak value of σ and the low value of ph tend to occur at the same time during the evening peak of the floating population however it can be seen from figure s7 that there is no obvious similar trend between pop and t in addition the change of rh and ap is usually affected by the geographical location and the buried depth of the pipe network and it may also be affected by climate change jiang et al 2014 obviously a variety of anomalies will reduce the accuracy of input indicator data which may affect the accuracy of model prediction herein we expect that the monitoring of input indicators needs to have high accuracy when the model is used so that the model will be more accurate 4 2 potential to reduce model prediction costs in this study soft detection of fog was realized by the gru model based on ten indicators with low monitoring cost and fast acquisition speed compared with the traditional fog detection method the method proposed in this paper not only overcomes the time limitation of sample collection analysis and detection process but also greatly reduces the consumption of manpower financial and material resources however as for those indicators that can be measured from a few minutes to a day the cost of using a sensor with a high temporal resolution is also relatively high especially the maintenance of the instrument probe therefore it is crucial to identify some key indicators for model training without significantly reducing the prediction performance this can significantly improve the operation efficiency of the model and reduce computational power consumption as well as the prediction cost chen et al 2020 ahmed et al 2020 the experimental results indicate that the prediction model using a single input output mode is not effective enough to achieve a good prediction of fog content also the method for selecting the input combination with the best fog content prediction accuracy by increasing the input indicators one by one requires a large amount of time and operation cost as shown in tables s3 s11 instead a multi indicator control system based on gsa can determine several input indicators with strong interaction which contributes greatly to the output of the model chen et al 2021 hwangbo et al 2021 for example ph t rh and flow are necessary to be considered in this study as shown in fig 7 therefore the combination of the input indicators can be adjusted according to the order of the sensitivity indices and the best combination of the input indicators can be determined according to the prediction effect as shown in figs 7 c and s4 using ph t rh flow dws v and σ as input indictors for fog prediction the learning model is used to verify the prediction effect and the prediction results are close to those of the ten indicators as input this indicates that the data acquisition of ap pop and lv can be reduced and the economic cost of the instruments and the equipment required for the detection of these three indicators can be avoided thus significantly reducing the prediction cost of this model in other words the fewest and easy to detect indicators can be used to accurately predict the fog content and timely issue a warning of high fog content which is essential to timely handling or preventing accidents such as blockage of urban sewer networks caused by excessive fog content 5 conclusion in this study a data driven fog prediction model was proposed using a deep learning algorithm the proposed model realizes the soft detection of fog content in the sewer networks of urban commercial areas the main contributions of this study are summarized as follows 1 exploratory studies are conducted to examine the capabilities of deep learning techniques to fog detection the results show that the data driven fog prediction model achieves good generalization ability and performs well from a single site to multiple sites with an average r2 of 0 922 2 network structure optimization is a procedure that is often ignored by the research using deep learning algorithms this study shows its significance and the results indicate that the proper network structure can improve the performance of the model 3 the gsa of the model provides insight into the contribution of multiple input indicators to the output indicator and it identifies three non crucial indicators including ap pop and lv that can be eliminated without affecting the performance of the model this not only further enhances the operational efficiency of the model but also reduces the cost of fog soft detection the proposed data driven fog detection method can avoid the time and cost of the traditional fog detection methods and all the input indicators of the proposed model are easy to obtain at a low cost therefore it provides a feasible scheme for the early warning of high fog content in the sewer networks of the urban commercial areas and helps the sewerage maintenance departments to formulate maintenance plans for cleaning the sections of the sewer systems that may accumulate fog at the same time it can help management departments to formulate relevant emission policies to reduce the occurrence of ssos future research on soft detection of fog content in urban sewer networks will be conducted from two aspects one is to find other valuable environmental indicators to improve the accuracy of fog prediction the other is to extend data driven fog prediction models on different time scales declaration of competing interest the authors

16490,the content of fat oil and grease fog in the sewer network sediments is the key indicator for diagnosing sewer blockage and overflow however the traditional fog detection is time consuming and costly and the establishment of mathematical models based on statistical methods to predict the content of fog fail to provide satisfactory accuracy herein a deep learning algorithm used a data driven

pressure ap population pop and liquid level lv can be reduced without affecting the prediction accuracy of the model graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fat oil and grease fog sewer networks deep learning algorithm gated recurrent unit gru multi source data global sensitivity analysis gsa 1 introduction as an important municipal infrastructure urban sewer network is responsible for the collection and transportation of urban sewage and its operation has a direct impact on the urban production and living environment however as the number and density of commercial food preparation and service facilities increase in the city so do the amounts of fat oil and grease fog discharged into the sewer networks he et al 2011 murali et al 2019 wang et al 2021 the fog in sewage is easy to react with other wastewater components and form insoluble solid sediments he et al 2017 kusum et al 2020 exhibiting adhesion and accumulating in the interior of the sewer the deposits eventually reduce the capacity of sewers to drain water and caused sanitary sewer overflows ssos ducoste et al 2017 he et al 2013 to better prevent and control the accumulation of fog sediments it is necessary to detect and monitor the content of the fog wallace et al 2017 however the detection is time consuming and costly which brings challenges to the management and research of fog at present the previous reports on this topic can be divided into two types the first type is the direct detection method that mainly applies chemical methods to conduct measurement which aims to improve the stability and accuracy and or simplifying the procedure over the standard reference methods nieuwenhuis et al 2018 the commonly used methods for qualitative or quantitative analysis of fog include fourier transform infrared ftir analysis iasmin et al 2014 thermogravimetric analysis tga kusum et al 2020 and gas chromatography flame ionization detector gc fid lee et al 2017 the advantage of these methods is that they can produce relatively accurate fog content and the overall process is very stable however these methods need much time and high costs and their applicability is still limited the second type is the indirect detection method that uses the statistical method to establish the mapping relationship between multiple indicators and the target indicators for example nieuwenhuis et al 2018 proposed a generalized linear mixed model glmm to predict the accumulation of fog based on the catchment demographics the accumulation of fog in pump sumps and the pump sump geometry however the modeling accuracy and the prediction results are not satisfactory with the rapid development of artificial intelligence deep learning has become one of the most popular technologies in smart cities and water management lyu et al 2019 recently some studies have used deep learning technology to predict bod5 in the harbor water and chlorophyll in the lake based on big data and satisfactory results have been achieved ma et al 2020 yu et al 2020 to explore the advanced performance of the deep learning technology this study intends to apply the technology to predicting fog in sewer networks the performance of deep learning models is affected by the data set that is chosen for training the learning models hwangbo et al 2021 thus it is crucial to identify some key indicators for training the models and remove the input indicators that contribute less to the prediction effect of the models without significantly reducing their performance chen et al 2020 however few studies have evaluated and identified the key indicators from training data sets that affect the performance of learning models therefore this study aims to demonstrate the application of data driven methods based on deep learning algorithms to soft detect the fog content of the sewer networks in urban commercial districts first a proper deep learning artificial neural network i e the gated recurrent unit gru network was used as the prediction model then global sensitivity analysis gsa was conducted for different time nodes to effectively determine the input indicators that have a greater impact on the fog content prediction and identify the key indicators in the model input to further improve the prediction efficiency and reduce the prediction cost to achieve these objectives the water samples were collected from the sewer networks in a commercial district of a city in southern china and some numerical experiments were conducted 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data collection the study site is a catchment served by the ns wastewater treatment plant ns wwtp located in a city in southern china covering a total area of 146 14 km2 it is a typical urban commercial area with large population mobility and there are many commercial outlets large department stores as well as headquarters or institutions of large commercial enterprises in this area significantly the drainage network is a rain and sewage diversion system and the drainage facilities are well laid in this area moreover according to the time series of sewage flow and rainfall in this study area figure s1 it is obvious that the operation of the sewer network is almost not affected by rainfall runoff in this study six monitoring sites in the sewer network of the entire ns wwtp service area were selected including sites a b c d e and f as shown in fig 1 and the areas served by these six sites are shopping malls that integrate dining entertainment and shopping detailed information for the six sites was provided in supplementary material text s3 some researchers have revealed that the level and velocity of sewage in the urban sewer networks show an obvious daily variation pattern and there will be a peak at noon 10 00 14 00 or evening 18 00 22 00 every day zhao et al 2020 shi et al 2018 similarly the water quality bod5 cod nh4 n tn tp and conductivity of sewer networks also shows a similar fluctuation pattern jiang et al 2021 based on this phenomenon this study considers dividing a day into six periods for monitoring and data collection at the six sites i e from 6 00 to 10 00 from 10 00 to 14 00 from 14 00 to 18 00 from 18 00 to 22 00 from 22 00 to 2 00 the next day and from 2 00 to 6 00 the next day for fog content prediction we consider the following data sources fog content data the samples of sewer networks were collected at different monitoring sites in different periods and transported to the laboratory in time for testing the detailed analytical procedure for fog content was provided in supporting material text s4 water quantity indicator data drinking water supply dws sewage flow flow velocity v and liquid level lv the dws data were obtained from the water supply records of the water supply service stations in the street where the monitoring sites are located which were authorized by the local municipality the flow and v and lv were conducted using the portable doppler ultrasonic flowmeter dx lsx 2 dexi china water quality indicator data water temperature t ph and conductivity σ these indicators in the sewer network were obtained by measuring with the portable instrument hq40d hach usa where t and ph were measured using ph electrode probe ph301 hach usa and σ was measured using conductivity electrode probe cdc404 hach usa social indicator data population pop the pop in the shopping malls served by the six sites was collected at different times of the day the data were obtained from the passenger flow records collected by the shopping malls pedestrian flow dynamic statistics systems which were authorized by the management departments of the shopping malls air environment indicator data relative humidity rh and air pressure ap these two indicators were monitored in the sewer network using the air quality monitor advancedsense pro graywolf usa the data of 11 indicators in six sites for 70 consecutive days from october 21 2019 to december 29 2019 were collected and 2520 observations 6 sites 70 days 6 times day were collected for each indicator resulting in a total of 27 720 data points 2520 observations 11 indicators the maximum minimum mean and standard deviation values of each indicator at the six sites during the six periods of the day are listed in table s2 in addition it is necessary to analyze the correlation between the input indicators before developing the model because indicators with strong correlation will lead to information overlap of input ke et al 2021 in this study the correlation of input indexes was analyzed by pearson correlation coefficient which was carried out using spss 22 0 ibm usa the results in figure s2 show that the correlation between input indicators is weak and the strongest positive correlation and negative correlation are only 0 327 between flow and v and 0 332 between rh and t respectively this indicates that there is no information overlap between the input indexes selected in this study 2 2 deep learning algorithm gated recurrent unit gru among deep learning networks the gru model has an excellent performance in time series prediction and regression processing gao et al 2020 this model solves the problem that the gradient disappears of traditional recurrent neural network rnn in the time series prediction hossain et al 2020 cheng et al 2020 also its internal structure is more concise than that of long short term memory lstm which can reduce the parameters of the network model to shorten the training time liu et al 2020 the gru neural network selectively transmits information through the gate structure as shown in fig 2 each gru unit contains two gates update gate and reset gate and a state hidden state for controlling and transmitting the information the update gate controls the scope of status information the larger the value of the update gate the more state information is introduced from the previous moment the reset gate is a threshold that controls how much past moment information is forgotten the smaller the value of the reset gate the less information is written to the previous state liu et al 2020 the forward propagation of the gru model is described by equations s1 s7 in the supplementary material text s1 the specific process is as follows 1 the gate values of reset gate rt and update gate zt are calculated by combining the input vector xt with the hidden state vector ht 1 and activated by sigmoid function equations s1 s2 and s6 2 then xt rt and ht 1 are combined and the combination is activated through the tanh function equation s7 to create the candidate hidden state vector ht equation s3 3 next the zt is taken as the weight parameter and the hidden state vector at the current time ht is obtained by the weighted average of ht and ht 1 equation s4 4 finally the output value yt is obtained by multiplying ht by the weight and adding the bias of the output layer equation s5 the gru model was established by using keras the advanced deep learning library in tensorflow gao et al 2020 to determine the optimal parameters of the model the back propagation algorithm is exploited to train the gru network the root mean square error rmse was used as the loss function to obtain the optimal weight and bias more details about gru can refer to the work conducted by choe et al 2021 the input variables of the model are ten indicators including pop rh ap dws flow v lv t ph and σ the output variable is fog content the model aims to minimize the difference between the actual fog content in sewer networks and the value from the output layer and it provides a gru based model for soft detection of fog 2 3 model training evaluation and optimization the data with ten columns of input indicators and one column of output indicator were divided into a training set october 21 2019 to december 8 2019 49 days and a testing set december 9 2019 to december 29 2019 21 days accounting for 70 and 30 of the whole data respectively a synchronized training of the model was conducted for all the sites using the data in the same training set the model performance was evaluated based on the data from the testing set in this study rmse and r2 were used as the performance evaluation indexes of the model lagesse et al 2020 rmse measures the existing error of the model and a smaller value of rmse indicates a better model performance r2 measures the accuracy of the model and a larger value of r2 indicates a better model performance the calculation of rmse and r2 are shown in eq 1 2 1 rmse 1 n t 1 n y t o b s y t p r e 2 2 r 2 t 1 n y t p r e y p r e y t o b s y o b s 2 t 1 n y t p r e y p r e 2 t 1 n y t o b s y o b s 2 where yt pre and yt obs are respectively model prediction and observation ȳpre and ȳobs are respectively the average values of model prediction and observation n is the total number of paired model prediction and observation in the testing set the model performance may be affected by the network structure of the model ma et al 2019 therefore the number of gru layers and the number of neurons in each gru layer are optimized for the model grid search is used for parameter optimization the candidates for the number of gru layers were selected from 1 2 3 4 5 following the study of zhou et al 2019 the number of neurons in each gru layer is set to be the same the candidate values include 50 51 52 69 70 rmse was exploited to evaluate the model performance to determine the optimal network structure 2 4 global sensitivity analysis sobol method sobol method is a variance decomposition based global sensitivity analysis technique nossent et al 2011 it can evaluate the contributions of input variables to the output in the nonlinear functions and models also it measures the sensitivity across the whole input space huang et al 2021 significantly it can evaluate the effects of interactions in non additive systems when dealing with nonlinear responses lai et al 2021 additional details of the sobol method can refer to the work described in supplementary material text s2 the sobol method provides the first order sobol indices s1i and the total sobol indices sti for each input indicator in the model to evaluate the main and the total effects mukherjee et al 2021 these two indices are defined for the output result y of the model based on the independence of the input indicators the s1i measures the direct contribution of each change in the input indicators to the output indicator and the sti reveals the total contribution of each indicator and the interaction between the indicators chen et al 2021 s1i and sti are both in the range of 0 to 1 but sti is always greater than s1i because it includes the effects of interactions between uncertainty indicators if the value of sti is close to zero the effect on the output result is minimal otherwise if the value of sti is close to one xi has a very important effect on the output result the theoretical computation of s1i and sti are shown in eqs 3 4 3 s 1 i v a r i v a r y 4 s t i 1 v a r i v a r y where vari represents the amount of variance due to the input variable xi var i denotes the variance of all input variables except xi var y represents the variance of the output result of the model due to the complexity and nonlinearity of the model it is difficult to calculate the variance through analytic integration to address this issue monte carlo simulation was exploited to calculate the conditional and unconditional variances in eqs 3 and 4 thus obtaining the values of s1i and sti chen et al 2021 wang et al 2017 the detailed calculation process is described in supplementary material text s2 meanwhile these computations were implemented based on the python salib package hu et al 2021 besides the input spatial sampling for sobol sensitivity analysis was achieved by using a quasi random sobol sequence with high spatial efficiency carta et al 2020 3 results 3 1 determination of the model structure for a straightforward observation the grid search results of the two indexes the number of gru layers and the number of neurons in each gru layer are visualized in fig 3 it can be observed that when the number of gru layers is 4 and the number of neurons in each layer is 58 the rmse value of the model is the lowest 0 0026 to achieve the optimal performance of the model the gru model with 4 gru layers and 58 neurons in each gru layer is constructed in this study although the deep neural network achieves higher computing energy consumption than the shallow network the experimental results indicate that deep learning obtains better performance it can be seen that the rmse value of the case with fewer layers and neurons layer 1 neurons 50 can be two times larger than the optimal value layer 4 neurons 58 indicating the importance of adjusting the network structural parameters for neural network models 3 2 spatiotemporal variation of fog content in commercial sewer networks and model performance as shown in fig 4 the average fog content in the sewer networks fluctuates daily it is usually higher in the noon period 10 00 14 00 and the highest 0 30 0 60 g g in the evening period 18 00 22 00 the lowest average fog content appears at night 02 00 06 00 and the average fog content in this period 0 10 0 15 g g is less than one third of the highest this result is consistent with the law of drainage in the urban commercial area meanwhile the daily variation of fog at the six monitoring sites shows the same trend indicating that the variation of fog at different drainage outlets is similar in the same area this model achieves satisfactory performance for the prediction evaluation of fog content at the six sites it can be seen from the learning curves in fig 5 a and figure s3 that the model converges fast in the training process and reaches convergence after 2000 epochs this indicates that the gru model is a suitable and efficient fog content prediction model as shown in fig 5 b c and figure s3 the results of the model indicate that the variation trend of the predicted fog content is close to that of the measured results the average and highest r2 of the six sites respectively reached 0 922 and 0 952 site b however the predicted results at sites c and e have a high degree of fluctuation as shown in figure s3 b and d the prediction at site c overestimated the peak of fog content while the prediction at site e underestimated the peak in general the model can capture the trend of fog content well and achieve a high prediction performance 3 3 the fog prediction performance based on different indicator sets to identify the key input indicator combinations that affect the prediction results of fog content the gru model is used to predict fog content based on any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 of the ten input indicators the number of indicator combinations is listed in table 1 and the details of the indicator combinations are listed in table s3 s11 here the data from the same training period at all sites were used to train the unified model and the data from the same testing period at all sites were used to evaluate the performance of the model with r2 as the predictive performance evaluation metric it can be seen from table 1 and fig 6 that the performance of predicting fog content based on any combination of less than ten input indicators is worse than that predicted by ten input indicators meanwhile the average value of r2 increases with the number of input indicators indicating that the number of input indicators is positively correlated with the prediction performance of the model particularly the change in the combination from 1 indicator to 7 indicators is significant with the mean value of r2 increasing more than twice from 0 323 to 0 878 table 1 the change in the combination from seven indicators to ten indicators contributes to a small increase in the prediction performance with the mean value of r2 increasing only by about 0 048 this indicates that the combinations of seven indicators table s9 eight indicators table s10 and nine indicators table s11 can achieve a good performance in predicting fog content which is close to the prediction performance achieved by the combination of ten indicators besides the results shown in fig 6 and tables s3 s11 indicate that different indicator combinations lead to different predictive performance under the same number of indicator combinations table s9 and s10 show that some combinations with seven indicators or eight combinations lead to better prediction performance with the value of r2 higher than 0 90 and some even higher than 0 91 this result is close to the prediction performance achieved by the combination of ten indicators fully indicating that the contribution of each input indicator to the model prediction results differs significantly 3 4 gsa for understanding the relationship between urban multi resource data and fog in this section the contribution of each input indicator to the model prediction results is further investigated based on the sobol indices the input indicator sample matrix consisting of 1200 rows and 10 columns was generated from the sobol sequence and the corresponding gru model outputs were used to calculate the sobol indices the model outputs for the six periods were exploited to identify the differences in the sensitivities of each indicator at different times of the day in this way six time varying values were obtained for each sobol indices the specific results are shown in fig 7 a and b the s1i results shown in fig 7 a reveal that ph t rh and flow contribute the most to the prediction of fog content in the urban sewer networks the amplitude of each period differs slightly but the sti still significantly indicates that these four same input indicators mainly drive the variance of their outputs fig 7 b also the most significant result shown in fig 7 a and b is that s1i is significantly lower than sti and the sum of the values of sti is much higher than 1 indicating a strong interaction of the input indicators on the fog dynamics in the model in other words the combined interaction between ph t rh flow dws v σ ap pop and lv drives the change in fog besides it can be seen from fig 7 a and b that s1i and sti change significantly with time the sensitivity indices s1i and sti of all indicators had similar changes with higher values in the noon period 10 00 14 00 and evening period 18 00 22 00 and the lowest values in the night period 02 00 06 00 this result indicates that the sensitivity indices of the analyzed model are time varying that is the sensitivity indices vary in different periods of the day however this does not affect the contribution of each input indicator to the output of the model i e each indicator contributed similarly to the output across the six periods to further explore the influence of interaction between input indicators on model prediction performance the input indicators were added one by one according to the sensitivity indices from large to small in order to verify the changes in the prediction performance of the model the results of site a are shown in fig 7 c and the other five sites in figure s4 it can be seen that the prediction performance of the model with ph t rh and flow as the input is significantly improved compared with a single indicator as the input and the value of r2 increases from less than 0 40 to more than 0 82 this indicates that there is a strong interaction between these four indicators more importantly the prediction performance of the model with seven indicators as inputs i e ph t rh flow dws v and σ is very similar to that with ten indicators as inputs this result is consistent with the results shown in table s9 and table 1 it is revealed that the combination of these seven indicators is the optimal input combination for the model and the three indicators including ap pop and lv have little influence on the prediction performance of the model 4 discussion 4 1 can the model predict fog content in the drainage network using easy to measure data the deep learning network model developed in this paper realizes the nonlinear mapping relationship between the multi source data ph t rh flow dws v σ ap pop and lv and the target indicator fog and it can predict the fog content in the sewer networks of the urban commercial area at the six typical monitoring sites of the commercial drainage network the variation pattern of fog predicted by the model is generally consistent with that observed and the mean value of r2 is as high as 0 922 it is worth noting that this model can quantify the dependence of fog on the input indicators from the sparse fog data this is significant because the input data in this model including air environment data rh and ap social environment data pop easily measurable water quality data ph t and σ and water quantity data dws v flow and lv can be monitored at a much higher frequency ma et al 2020 spatial resolution zhi et al 2021 and coverage than the fog data currently the hourly or even minutely data can be achieved with online monitoring and transmission equipment rodriguez perez et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 which enables a high frequency prediction of fog content and reduces the time and cost of fog detection however it is surprising that the model cannot predict the fog content well at sites a and b during the peak and trough periods which may be caused by a variety of reasons firstly the representativeness of the fog data in peak and trough periods is insufficient so the model fails to adequately learn the dynamics and dependence of fog in the training process newhart et al 2020 secondly the fog content is detected by chemical methods from manually collected samples the samples may undergo some changes during the collection and transportation process and there may be certain measurement errors in the sample detection process thirdly the peaks and troughs of the fog content often appear in the non working periods noon and evening in the working periods a large flow of people and service industries such as catering are more active in this commercial area as a result the t ph σ flow v and lv change more than those in other periods table s2 moreover it can be clearly seen from figures s5 and s6 that the daily peak value of σ and the low value of ph tend to occur at the same time during the evening peak of the floating population however it can be seen from figure s7 that there is no obvious similar trend between pop and t in addition the change of rh and ap is usually affected by the geographical location and the buried depth of the pipe network and it may also be affected by climate change jiang et al 2014 obviously a variety of anomalies will reduce the accuracy of input indicator data which may affect the accuracy of model prediction herein we expect that the monitoring of input indicators needs to have high accuracy when the model is used so that the model will be more accurate 4 2 potential to reduce model prediction costs in this study soft detection of fog was realized by the gru model based on ten indicators with low monitoring cost and fast acquisition speed compared with the traditional fog detection method the method proposed in this paper not only overcomes the time limitation of sample collection analysis and detection process but also greatly reduces the consumption of manpower financial and material resources however as for those indicators that can be measured from a few minutes to a day the cost of using a sensor with a high temporal resolution is also relatively high especially the maintenance of the instrument probe therefore it is crucial to identify some key indicators for model training without significantly reducing the prediction performance this can significantly improve the operation efficiency of the model and reduce computational power consumption as well as the prediction cost chen et al 2020 ahmed et al 2020 the experimental results indicate that the prediction model using a single input output mode is not effective enough to achieve a good prediction of fog content also the method for selecting the input combination with the best fog content prediction accuracy by increasing the input indicators one by one requires a large amount of time and operation cost as shown in tables s3 s11 instead a multi indicator control system based on gsa can determine several input indicators with strong interaction which contributes greatly to the output of the model chen et al 2021 hwangbo et al 2021 for example ph t rh and flow are necessary to be considered in this study as shown in fig 7 therefore the combination of the input indicators can be adjusted according to the order of the sensitivity indices and the best combination of the input indicators can be determined according to the prediction effect as shown in figs 7 c and s4 using ph t rh flow dws v and σ as input indictors for fog prediction the learning model is used to verify the prediction effect and the prediction results are close to those of the ten indicators as input this indicates that the data acquisition of ap pop and lv can be reduced and the economic cost of the instruments and the equipment required for the detection of these three indicators can be avoided thus significantly reducing the prediction cost of this model in other words the fewest and easy to detect indicators can be used to accurately predict the fog content and timely issue a warning of high fog content which is essential to timely handling or preventing accidents such as blockage of urban sewer networks caused by excessive fog content 5 conclusion in this study a data driven fog prediction model was proposed using a deep learning algorithm the proposed model realizes the soft detection of fog content in the sewer networks of urban commercial areas the main contributions of this study are summarized as follows 1 exploratory studies are conducted to examine the capabilities of deep learning techniques to fog detection the results show that the data driven fog prediction model achieves good generalization ability and performs well from a single site to multiple sites with an average r2 of 0 922 2 network structure optimization is a procedure that is often ignored by the research using deep learning algorithms this study shows its significance and the results indicate that the proper network structure can improve the performance of the model 3 the gsa of the model provides insight into the contribution of multiple input indicators to the output indicator and it identifies three non crucial indicators including ap pop and lv that can be eliminated without affecting the performance of the model this not only further enhances the operational efficiency of the model but also reduces the cost of fog soft detection the proposed data driven fog detection method can avoid the time and cost of the traditional fog detection methods and all the input indicators of the proposed model are easy to obtain at a low cost therefore it provides a feasible scheme for the early warning of high fog content in the sewer networks of the urban commercial areas and helps the sewerage maintenance departments to formulate maintenance plans for cleaning the sections of the sewer systems that may accumulate fog at the same time it can help management departments to formulate relevant emission policies to reduce the occurrence of ssos future research on soft detection of fog content in urban sewer networks will be conducted from two aspects one is to find other valuable environmental indicators to improve the accuracy of fog prediction the other is to extend data driven fog prediction models on different time scales declaration of competing interest the authors

16491,due to the wide presence of organic amines in natural waters organic chloramines are commonly formed during pre chlorination with the increasing application of uv disinfection in water treatment both the activation mechanism of organic chloramine by uv photolysis and its subsequent impact on water quality are not clear using sarcosine sar as an amine group containing compound it was found that organic chloramines i e cl sar would be firstly formed during chlorination even in the presence of natural organic matter compared with self decay of cl sar uv photolysis accelerated cl sar decomposition and induced ncl bond cleavage using metoprolol mtp as a model micro pollutant uv activated cl sar uv cl sar can accelerate micro pollutant degradation attributed to reactive radicals formation ho and cl were important contributors with a total contribution of 45 64 moreover the degradation rate of mtp by uv cl sar was ph dependent which monotonically increased from 0 044 to 0 065 min 1 under phs 5 5 8 5 although the activation of organic chloramine by uv could accelerate micro pollutant degradation uv cl sar treatment could also enhance disinfection by products formation trichloromethane tcm formation was observed during mtp degradation by uv cl sar after post chlorination tcm 1 1 dichloropropanone 1 1 1 trichloropropanone and dichloroacetonitrile were detected their individual and total concentrations were all positively proportional to uv cl sar treatment time the total concentration with 30 min treatment 66 93 μg l 1 was about 2 3 times that with 1 min treatment 28 76 μg l 1 finally the accelerated effect was verified with cl glycine and cl alanine it is expected to unravel the non negligible role of organic chloramine on water quality during uv disinfection graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organic amine uv photolysis kinetics mechanism disinfection by products formation 1 introduction algae blooms how et al 2018 and anthropogenic inputs shah et al 2011 lead to the ubiquity of organic amines in natural waters organic amines can reactively react with free chlorine hocl ocl fc with rates of 107 108 m 1 s 1 to form organic chloramines deborde and von gunten 2008 shah et al 2011 considering self decay by hydrolysis only the stabilities of organic chloramines are generally higher than those of inorganic chloramines and fc how et al 2017 during drinking water treatment organic chloramines are inevitably formed during pre chlorination process and likely present in subsequent treatment and distribution systems zhang et al 2016 uv based processes have been extensively used for disinfection and micro pollutants degradation yang et al 2021 thereby the photolysis of organic chloramines can be unintentionally conducted organic chloramines have attracted considerable attention they are potentially toxic can serve as disinfection by product dbp precursors and interfere with fc determination guo et al 2021 liu et al 2022 additionally organic chloramines are known to be weak in sterilization and oxidation donnermair and blatchley 2003 zhang et al 2018 for example amiri et al 2010 noted that no measurable e coli inactivation was observed at ph 8 1 for all tested organic chloramines heeb et al 2017 found that the apparent second order rate constants k app for the reactions of phenolic compounds with organic chloramines were 103 105 lower than those for the reactions of phenolic compounds with fc however many researches reported that uv photolysis of inorganic chloramines mainly nh2cl analogues to organic chloramines generated reactive radicals to degrade micro pollutants wu et al 2021 soltermann et al 2013 presented that the nature of ncl bond in chlorinated dimethylamine was similar to that in nh2cl uv photolysis of organic chloramines can also induce ncl bond cleavage and generated cl and aminyl radicals ruan et al 2021 soltermann et al 2013 hence uv activated organic chloramines could offer a possibility for micro pollutants degradation wu et al 2022 despite its potential the systematic investigation on the degradation kinetics and mechanism of micro pollutants by uv organic chloramine is still limited the types of organic amines include primary secondary and tertiary amines among them primary and secondary amines react with fc to form negatively charged organic chloramines but tertiary amines react with fc to form positively charged chlorammonium species shah et al 2011 amino acids are an important group of organic amines the total concentration of amino acids accounts for 75 of dissolved organic nitrogen westerhoff and mash 2002 among amino acids sarcosine sar is the secondary amine of the simplest structure it reactively reacts with fc to form the organic monochloramine i e cl sar but not organic dichloramine deborde and von gunten 2008 although the abundance in aquatic systems was hardly reported sar is likely present in natural waters due to its wide use in biochemical field kumar and kishore 2013 hence sar was used as an amine group containing compound to investigate the activation of organic chloramine by uv photolysis metoprolol mtp a commonly used β blocker gao et al 2020 is of high detection frequency and concentration in aquatic systems cantwell et al 2018 it was the most dominant β blocker with 100 detection frequency and a maximum concentration of 10 μg l 1 in hospital wastewaters xu et al 2019 meanwhile mtp has been detected in natural waters mtp concentration in hudson river usa can reach

conventional water treatment processes e g chlorination was limited barazesh et al 2016 hence the organic chloramine i e cl sar formation during chlorination and its decomposition by uv photolysis were first investigated then the effect of uv activated cl sar uv cl sar on micro pollutant using mtp as a model degradation was evaluated in detail specially the degradation kinetics was assessed the degradation mechanism was then revealed via determination of reactive species contribution and transformation products tps of mtp besides disinfection by products dbps formation during mtp degradation

chemical reagents and their relative providers are listed in text s1 2 2 experimental procedures to investigate the chlorine substances variation during chlorination ultrapure water containing 2 5 mg c l 1 humic acid ha was used as the simulated natural organic matter nom containing water sar as a model organic amine was subsequently added or not and fc was dosed to initiate the reactions samples at different chlorination time were withdrawn to determine fc and total chlorine concentrations the photochemistry experiments were conducted in a magnetically stirred cylindrical quartz uv reactor diameter height 11 23 cm wang et al 2020 a low pressure hg uv lamp comwin zw10d15w z212 10 w 254 nm was fixed in the uv reactor center the average uv fluence rate was determined to be 2 5 mw cm 2 zhu et al 2015 to investigate the degradation kinetics of mtp fig s1 by uv cl sar 5 mm phosphate buffer was applied to adjust ph unless otherwise specified the test solution 1 l was added with 5 μm mtp and 70 μm cl sar and synchronously exposed to uv irradiation samples 1 ml were withdrawn at preset time intervals and quenched with excessive na2s2o3 to determine mtp concentration to evaluate the effect of water matrix nom hco3 cl and no3 were added in the forms of ha nahco3 nacl and nano3 respectively to determine the dbps formation during mtp degradation by uv cl sar aliquots of sample at different uv cl sar treatment durations were withdrawn and stored in amber glasses 50 ml to determine the dbps formation after post chlorination additional 0 28 mm fc was dosed to the uv cl sar treated samples all samples were incubated with headspace free in the dark at 25 2 c for 7 days after the contact time samples were quenched and extracted to determine dbps concentration all experiments were replicated at least twice and the reported data present the average of experimental results 2 3 analysis methods the detailed analysis methods are summarized in text s2 the related limits of quantification loq are listed in table s1 2 4 quantum chemistry calculations details on the quantum chemistry calculations are shown in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation and uv photolysis of cl sar in fig 1 pre chlorination process is widely applied to promote algae removal dong et al 2021 where organic chloramines are formed via the reactions of organic amines e g amino acids contained in algae organic matter with fc when uv disinfection is applied subsequently yang et al 2021 uv photolysis of organic chloramines can be unintentionally conducted besides chlorine disinfection is a commonly used drinking water treatment process uv process as the best proposal of second disinfecting can be applied at points of entry to disinfect drinking water after distribution in this case uv photolysis of organic chloramines can also be conducted in order to verify the reactivity of organic amines using sar as a model with fc to form organic chloramines the chlorine substances variation during chlorination of simulated nom containing water was investigated fig 2 a due to no additional nh4 in the experimental system the detected combined chlorine was regarded as organic chloramines in the absence of sar fc rapidly decreased by nearly 23 within 20 s meanwhile organic chloramines were formed 0 3 mg l 1 this was likely attributed to the amine moieties contained in nom component then fc concentration decreased more slowly until 10 min residual fc was 50 in the presence of sar fc was almost depleted within 20 s congruently organic chloramines were formed and reached the maximum concentration the molar ratio of organic chloramines to the initial fc dose was 95 the results were consistent with that the reaction rate of organic amines with fc was several orders of magnitude higher than that of nom deborde and von gunten 2008 zhai et al 2014 accordingly a kinetic model was developed text s4 to fit the experimentally measured chlorine substances variation three types of nom reaction sites presented in the previous study zhai et al 2014 and amine moieties contained in nom were defined hence the reactions of sar with fc nom with fc and nom with cl sar were involved in the model table s2 chlorine substances variation in the presence of sar with various concentrations were further modelled fig s2 sar always reactively consumed fc to form cl sar and a higher concentration of sar lead to a higher proportion of organic chloramine zhang et al 2016 reported organic chloramines formation during chlor am ination of water samples from yangtze river and huangpu river these results verified that organic amines can compete for fc against nom to form organic chloramines during pre chlorination the stabilities of organic chloramines and the water residence time determined whether organic chloramines formed during pre chlorination can be present in the subsequent uv process chlorinated dipeptides have been clearly detected from tap water and most of them were reported to be stable in water 10 days huang et al 2017 this reflected that some stable organic chloramines are potentially transported to uv process during drinking water treatment then the decomposition of cl sar via self decay and uv photolysis was comparatively determined fig s3 the self decay and uv photolysis of cl sar all followed a first order degradation reaction the first order degradation rate constants k obs of cl sar via self decay were kind of stable in the range of 0 002 0 005 min 1 under phs 5 5 8 5 this indicated that ph had little impact on the stability of cl sar which was consistent with the results in a previous study armesto et al 1993 the proportion of cl sar decomposed by self decay after 30 min was 20 because the hydrolysis of organic chloramines was quite slow how et al 2017 however upon 20 min uv irradiation more than 95 of cl sar was decomposed the decomposition rate of cl sar by uv photolysis reached to 0 185 0 189 min 1 under phs 5 5 8 5 consistently ruan et al 2021 found that uv irradiation significantly accelerated cl amino acids decomposition uv photolysis of organic chloramine can induce ncl bond breakage and the resulting reactive radicals formation ra and lee 2021 soltermann et al 2013 yang et al 2021 hence the effect of uv photolysis of cl sar on micro pollutant degradation was then evaluated 3 2 accelerated degradation of mtp by uv cl sar in fig 2 b mtp degradation by uv cl sar and uv cl sar was comparatively investigated mtp was recalcitrant towards cl sar which was ascribed to the weak oxidation potential of cl sar zhang et al 2018 and low reactivity of mtp towards chlorine species acero et al 2010 meanwhile because of the low molar absorption coefficient 560 m 1 cm 1 and quantum yield 0 005 mol e 1 of mtp gao et al 2020 the uv photolysis of mtp was limited with a removal ratio of 5 at a fluence of 1500 mj cm 2 uv cl sar can accelerate mtp degradation the linear relationship between ln mtp mtp 0 and treatment time t eq 1 indicated that the degradation kinetics of mtp could be fitted well with pseudo first order kinetics the degradation rate of mtp by uv cl sar 0 055 min 1 was 10 times higher than the sum of those by cl sar negligible and uv alone 0 005 min 1 the formation of reactive radicals under uv photolysis of cl sar accounted for the significantly accelerated mtp degradation 1 ln mtp mtp 0 k obs t where mtp 0 and mtp are the initial and residual concentrations of mtp after t min treatment respectively t is the preset treatment time min ph has an important effect on micro pollutants degradation by uv based aops tian et al 2020 in fig s4 mtp degradation by uv cl sar was ph dependent as ph increased from 5 5 to 8 5 the total k obs in uv cl sar monotonically increased from 0 044 to 0 065 min 1 organic chloramines can absorb uv photos to generate primary radicals of both cl and aminyl radicals ra and lee 2021 ruan et al 2021 ho is rapidly formed due to the strong interaction of cl with hydroxide zhang et al 2019 besides secondary radicals e g clo and cl2 can be further formed via the reactions involved cl sun et al 2019 ho as a non selective oxidant can degrade lots of micro pollutants while reactive chlorine species rcss were relatively selective and preferentially degrade certain micro pollutants guo et al 2017 the second order rate constants of mtp with ho k h o mtp and cl k c l mtp were 8 39 109 and 1 71 1010 m 1 s 1 respectively pan et al 2020 hence the ph dependence of mtp degradation by uv cl sar was mainly attributed to the variation of reactive radicals contribution under different phs 3 3 reactive species contribution in mtp degradation by uv cl sar the roles of ho and cl in micro pollutants degradation have been widely studied guo et al 2017 nevertheless other reactive radicals were also formed during mtp degradation by uv cl sar aminyl radicals formed from the cleavage of ncl bond have been proposed to play an important role in bisphenol a degradation wu et al 2022 in uv nh2cl process no and no2 can be formed from the reaction of nh2 and the dissolved oxygen and are involved in micro pollutants degradation wu et al 2021 wu et al 2019 it is not clear whether aminyl radicals can transform to them but this is enough to indicate that reactive nitrogen radicals rnss possibly contributed to mtp degradation in uv cl sar process additionally the steady state concentrations of cl2 cl2 ss were 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than cl ss under uv photolysis of cl gly cl tyrosine and cl ala ruan et al 2021 the second order rate constant of cl2 with mtp was reported to be 2 6 108 m 1 s 1 pan et al 2020 clo can also react with mtp with a rate of 1 34 108 m 1s 1 guo et al 2018 rcss besides cl likely contributed to mtp degradation hence in uv cl sar process reactive species included uv cl sar ho cl and other formed radicals e g aminyl radicals cl2 and clo due to the negligible reactivity of cl sar towards mtp the degradation kinetics of mtp by uv cl sar can be presented as eq 2 according to text s5 ho ss and cl ss were collectively obtained they exhibited completely adverse ph dependent trends because cl was more easily transformed to ho at higher ph weng et al 2013 ho ss gradually increased but cl ss decreased as ph increased the contribution rates of reactive species to mtp degradation were then calculated text s5 and found to be ph dependent fig 3 a consistent with the previous research guo et al 2017 the photolysis rate of mtp by uv irradiation 0 004 0 005 min 1 kept constant under different phs nevertheless the contribution rates of reactive radicals varied at ph 5 5 ho was the dominant contributor to mtp degradation the contribution rates of ho cl and other unidentified radicals were 0 018 0 010 and 0 012 min 1 respectively with ph increasing the contribution rates of ho and other unidentified radicals increased but that of cl decreased at ph 8 5 the contribution rates of ho cl and other unidentified radicals were 0 023 0 007 and 0 031 min 1 respectively 2 k obs total mtp k obs uv mtp k obs h o mtp k obs c l mtp k obs other mtp where k obs total mtp represents the total pseudo first order rate constant of mtp degradation by uv cl sar min 1 k obs uv mtp k obs h o mtp k obs c l mtp and k obs other mtp are defined as the pseudo first order rate constants of mtp degradation by uv ho cl and other identified radicals respectively namely the contribution rate of each species to mtp degradation next the removal ratio of mtp by each reactive species as a function of treatment time was calculated via integration eqs 3 6 after 10 min uv cl sar treatment the total removal ratios of mtp at ph 5 5 fig 3 b 7 2 fig 3 c and 8 5 fig 3 d were 35 42 and 48 respectively the contribution of a certain reactive species was calculated as the removal ratio of mtp by the reactive species divided by the total removal ratio of mtp by uv cl sar hence the contributions of uv ho cl and other identified radicals to mtp degradation at ph 5 5 were 8 41 23 and 28 respectively at ph 7 2 were 9 38 15 and 38 respectively and at ph 8 5 were 7 35 10 and 48 respectively the results indicated that ho and cl were main contributors to degrade mtp as the sum of removal ratios by ho and cl accounted for 45 64 of the total removal ratio by uv cl sar other identified radicals such as rcss other than cl and rnss also played roles in mtp degradation guo et al 2017 presented that micro pollutants transformation from their neutral cationic form to anionic neutral form favored the electrophilic reaction with rcss increasing ph from 5 5 to 8 5 promoted the transformation of mtp pk a1 9 43 pk a2 13 89 from cationic form to neutral form and the latter form is more electron rich lian et al 2017 besides rnss were selective with preference for electron rich moieties sun et al 2019 in a previous study the contribution rate of rnss to phenol degradation in uv nh2cl process increased with ph increasing from 7 to 10 which was partly attributed to the increasing no concentration chen et al 2021 3 r uv 0 t k obs uv mtp mtp d t mtp 0 100 where

are widespread matrix components in real waters hence their effects on mtp degradation by uv cl sar in synthetic solutions were evaluated in fig 4 a with the nom concentration ranging from 0 5 mg l 1 the k obs of mtp in uv cl sar process gradually decreased from 0 055 to 0 040 min 1 the result was attributed to the competitive consumption of reactive radicals by nom and its uv adsorption effect for example the reaction rates of nom with ho cl and clo were 2 5 104 1 3 104 and 4 5 104 mg l 1 s 1 respectively guo et al 2017 meanwhile nom as an inner uv filter can adsorb uv254 with the extinction coefficient of 3 15 l m 1 mg 1 pan et al 2020 in fig 4 b the inhibitory effect of hco3 on mtp degradation was observed in the presence of 300 mg l 1 hco3 the k obs of mtp significantly decreased to 0 032 min 1 hco3 is the major inorganic carbon in natural waters with the concentration ranging from dozen to hundred mg l 1 xie et al 2015 hco3 can scavenge ho cl and cl2 with reaction rates of 2 2 108 8 5 106 and 2 2 108 m 1 s 1 respectively zhang et al 2019 it was considered as an important scavenging factor during uv based aops although co3 can be formed during above reactions its effect on mtp degradation was limited due to the low oxidation potential in fig 4 c mtp degradation rates were kind of stable 0 052 0 055 min 1 in the presence of 50 mg l 1 cl but increased to 0 064 min 1 in the presence of 100 mg l 1 cl the rate constants for the forward and backward reactions of cl with ho were 4 3 109 and 6 1 109 m 1 s 1 respectively zhang et al 2019 thus the effect of cl on ho ss was negligible while cl can react with cl to form cl2 with a rate constant of 8 0 109 m 1 s 1 and the rate constant for its backward reaction was several orders of magnitude lower zhang et al 2019 it has been reported that cl accelerated mtp degradation by uv fc due to the increasing formation of cl2 pan et al 2020 in fig 4 d the addition of no3 accelerated mtp degradation by uv cl sar the k obs increased to 0 064 min 1 in the presence of 10 mg l 1 no3 uv photolysis of no3 is well known to form ho and many literatures reported its accelerated effect on micro pollutants photodegradation sun et al 2014 xiao et al 2014 besides rnss primarily no2 can also be formed from uv photolysis of no3 sun et al 2014 and it moderately reacts with electron rich moieties sun et al 2019 when no3 concentration increased to 20 and even 50 mg l 1 the degradation rate of mtp was basically unchanged this may be attributed to the self quenching of no2 4 5 108 m 1 s 1 and its combining reaction with ho 1 3 109 m 1 s 1 sun et al 2014 3 4 2 degradation of mtp in real waters mtp degradation by uv cl sar was further evaluated in two real waters which were biological activated carbon bac and sand filtration sf effluents respectively they were withdrawn from a drinking water treatment plant in jiangsu china their major quality parameters were listed in table s3 in fig s5 the degradation rates of mtp by uv cl sar were 0 032 and 0 024 min 1 in bac and sf effluent respectively much lower than that in ultrapure water 0 055 min 1 previous works reported the inhibited micro pollutants photodegradation in real waters gao et al 2020 yin et al 2018 since the ph values of three waters 7 1 7 5 were almost identical the ph effect on mtp degradation could be excluded according to fig 3 51 mg l 1 cl and 2 44 mg l 1 no3 had limited effects on mtp degradation by uv cl sar hence the inhibited degradation efficiency of mtp in two real waters could be attributed to the presence of nom 2 2 mg l 1 and hco3 120 mg l 1 meanwhile due to the effective removal of nom the degradation rate of mtp in bac effluent was 33 higher than that in sf effluent the effect of water matrix should be considered into mtp degradation by uv cl sar 3 5 dbps formation after mtp degradation by uv cl sar considering dbps formation likely last for several days dbps formation during mtp degradation by uv cl sar was analyzed after 7 days fig 5 a it should be noted that the uv cl sar treatment time of 0 min means cl sar was dosed without uv irradiation thus the detected dbps at 0 min was resulting from chlorination of sar trichloromethane tcm was the only detected species during mtp degradation and its concentration in the presence of uv irradiation uv cl sar treatment time 0 min was higher than that in the absence of uv irradiation uv cl sar treatment time 0 min with uv cl sar treatment time extending from 1 to 10 min tcm concentration gradually increased from 2 72 to 3 50 μg l 1 this was mainly attributed to the accelerated degradation of mtp by reactive radicals formed in uv cl sar it has been widely reported that the formed reactive radicals such as rcss and ho can enhance dbps formation during micro pollutants degradation by uv fc and uv nh2cl wang et al 2020 wu et al 2016 however with uv cl sar treatment time further extending to 20 and 30 min tcm concentration decreased to 3 23 and 2 86 μg l 1 respectively this was probably because the residual cl sar was negligible after uv photolysis for 20 min 0 2 mg l 1 which inhibited the simultaneous tcm formation from the attack of reactive radicals during mtp degradation by uv cl sar and the subsequent tcm formation from the reaction of mtp intermediates with cl sar during the 7 day incubation post chlorination is a commonly used method to maintain residual protection for water distribution system hence dbps formation after post chlorination following mtp degradation by uv cl sar was further investigated as shown in fig 5 b tcm 1 1 dichloropropanone 1 1 dcp 1 1 1 trichloropropanone 1 1 1 tcp and dichloroacetonitrile dcan were detected similarly the presence of uv irradiation significantly enhanced dbps formation after post chlorination among all the detected dbps tcm was the major dbp species and its concentration monotonically increased with prolonging uv cl sar treatment time tcm concentration with 30 min uv cl sar treatment 49 88 μg l 1 was about 1 7 times that with 1 min uv cl sar treatment 28 72 μg l 1 similar trend was observed for 1 1 dcp its concentration increased from loq to 16 86 μg l 1 1 1 1 tcp was only detected with 30 min uv cl sar treatment of which the concentration 0 10 μg l 1 ho could attack mtp via hydroxylation to form hydroxylated products and rcss could attack mtp via oxidation and electrophilic halogenation gao et al 2020 the results indicated that the mtp tps were more prone to provide carbon source than mtp to form tcm 1 1 dcp and 1 1 1 tcp cl sar and its photolysis by products also contributed to the above dbps formation but was of a relatively minor contribution because only 4 52 μg l 1 tcm and 0 07 μg l 1 1 1 dcp was formed after post chlorination of cl sar the result was not shown dcan was the only detected species of nitrogenous n dbps with a concentration of loq 0 12 μg l 1 mtp and cl sar both likely provided nitrogen source to form n dbps but dcan was not detected after prost chlorination of cl sar only meanwhile it has been reported that uv photolysis of organic chloramines e g cl ethanolamine and cl urea can release nh4 and no3 ra and lee 2021 yang et al 2021 therefore the increasing formation of dcan was mainly attributed to mtp degradation the total concentration of these four dbps was positively proportional to uv cl sar treatment time the total dbps concentration with 30 min uv cl sar treatment 66 93 μg l 1 was about 2 3 times that with 1 min uv cl sar treatment 28 76 μg l 1 the enhanced dbps formation in the presence of uv irradiation warrants further attention 3 6 proposed degradation pathways of mtp by uv cl sar as shown in fig s6 the removal ratio of total organic carbon toc after 30 min uv cl sar treatment was 15 it indicated that the degradation of mtp by uv cl sar was mainly achieved via transformation to tps rather than mineralization hence the degradation pathways of mtp by uv cl sar were then proposed via analysis of tps fig 6 the major fragment ions of mtp tps and the proposed molecular formulas are summarized in table s4 the total ion chromatogram m z 100 350 and selected ion monitoring chromatograms are shown in fig s7 and fig s8 respectively because the effects of cl sar oxidation and uv photolysis on mtp degradation in uv cl sar process were negligible transformation reactions were mainly initiated by the attack of reactive radicals e g ho and cl different transformation reactions such as hydroxylation oxidation dealkylation h abstraction and dehydration could take place in this system the main reactive sites of mtp were predicted through quantum chemical calculation the highest occupied molecular orbital homo isosurface and the contribution of each atom to the composition of homo are shown in fig s9 and table s5 respectively the homo of mtp was dominated by the c atoms on the aromatic ring the contributions of c5 c7 and c8 on the aromatic ring to the composition of homo were calculated as 18 663 10 814 and 15 556 respectively these results indicated that the reactive sites of mtp were mainly located on the aromatic ring the addition of one hydroxyl group to the aromatic ring led to the formation of tp 284 1 after further hydroxylation tp 300 and tp 316 could be formed romero et al 2016 ho could also attack the ether moiety via h abstraction to form tp 284 2 which has been widely detected and defined as α hydroxymetoprolol α hmtp rubirola et al 2014 desaturation reactions subsequently occurred involving the oh moiety which contributed to the formation of tp 224 and tp 282 tp 226 was likely formed from the cleavage of terminal methyl group under ho attack o9 located on the aminopropanol moiety also contributed to the homo its contribution to the composition of homo was up to 18 681 hence o9 also was prone to be attacked by reactive radicals consistently tp 134 was formed through the bond breaking in the aliphatic part cavalcante et al 2015 tp 342 has been reported to be formed in uv fc process via the substitution of cl into mtp nam et al 2015 cl was selective and prone to substitute the hydrogen atom from aromatic ring pan et al 2020 thereby tp 376 was probably formed open ring tp 274 has been observed in other photodegradation processes but its formation was without the involvement of ho filipe et al 2020 oxidation is an important mechanism for micro pollutants degradation by reactive radicals the formation of tp 254 known as o desmethylmetoprolol o dmtp rubirola et al 2014 was initiated from the terminal methyl moiety and then it can be oxidized by ho to form tp 268 and tp 238 of note tp 268 namely metoprolol acid mtpa is regarded as the major human metabolite of mtp rubirola et al 2014 under the continuous attack of reactive radicals the side chain could be broken down to form some low molecular weight by products such as tp 121 and tp 190 in a previous work tp 121 was predicted to exhibit higher acute toxicity for green algae daphnia and fish than the parent compound mtp meanwhile tp 282 and tp 254 were potentially developmental toxic and resistant to biodegradation jaen gil et al 2019 hence although the parent compound mtp was degraded the potential risk caused by the formation of tps cannot be neglected 3 7 accelerated degradation of mtp by uv activated other organic chloramines gly is the primary amine most similar in structure to sar it is of high abundance in natural waters and of high reactivity towards fc the formation of corresponding organic monochloramine cl gly is significant for drinking water systems due to its toxicity and stability how et al 2016 ala is also a highly abundant primary amine in natural waters how et al 2016 of which the ch3 group replaces a h atom of gly the accelerated effect of uv activated organic chloramine on mtp degradation was further verified with cl gly and cl ala fig 7 similar to cl sar cl gly and cl ala exhibited negligible effects on mtp degradation uv cl gly and uv cl ala both significantly accelerated mtp degradation and the degradation kinetics were also fitted well with pseudo first order kinetics the degradation rates of mtp by three uv activated organic chloramine processes at ph 7 2 followed the order of uv cl ala 0 086 min 1 uv cl gly 0 069 min 1 uv cl sar 0 055 min 1 for the same primary amine its corresponding monochloramine and dichloramine species are of different molar absorption coefficients and quantum yields ra and lee 2021 different quantum yields can also be found for monochloramine species formed from different organic amines ra et al 2019 weng et al 2013 hence different mtp degradation rates by three uv photodegradation processes may be attributed to the various molar absorption coefficients and quantum yields of these organic chloramines 4 conclusion during chlorination of simulated nom containing water sar competitively consumed fc to form cl sar then uv photolysis significantly accelerated the decomposition of resulting cl sar uv cl sar can accelerate mtp degradation attributed to reactive radicals formation ho and cl contributed to 45 64 of mtp degradation by uv cl sar the contribution rate of ho increased but that of cl decreased with the increasing ph uv cl sar treatment can enhance dbps formation tcm was the only detected dbp species during mtp degradation after post chlorination tcm 1 1 dcp 1 1 1 tcp and dcan were detected and their concentrations were positively proportional to uv cl sar treatment time the pathways of mtp degradation by uv cl sar were proposed the accelerated effect of uv activated organic chloramine on mtp degradation was finally verified with cl gly and cl ala the results indicated that organic amines can compete for fc against nom to form organic chloramine regardless of available fc after pre chlorination reactive radicals can be formed during the subsequent uv process via organic chloramines photolysis despite of the weak oxidation potential of organic chloramines uv activated organic chloramines lead to changes in water chemistry e g micro pollutants fate dbps formation and toxicity these results remind us to pay attention to the role of organic chloramine on water quality during uv disinfection of drinking water besides the results could also be relevant in water reuse

16491,due to the wide presence of organic amines in natural waters organic chloramines are commonly formed during pre chlorination with the increasing application of uv disinfection in water treatment both the activation mechanism of organic chloramine by uv photolysis and its subsequent impact on water quality are not clear using sarcosine sar as an amine group containing compound it was found that organic chloramines i e cl sar would be firstly formed during chlorination even in the presence of natural organic matter compared with self decay of cl sar uv photolysis accelerated cl sar decomposition and induced ncl bond cleavage using metoprolol mtp as a model micro pollutant uv activated cl sar uv cl sar can accelerate micro pollutant degradation attributed to reactive radicals formation ho and cl were important contributors with a total contribution of 45 64 moreover the degradation rate of mtp by uv cl sar was ph dependent which monotonically increased from 0 044 to 0 065 min 1 under phs 5 5 8 5 although the activation of organic chloramine by uv could accelerate micro pollutant degradation uv cl sar treatment could also enhance disinfection by products formation trichloromethane tcm formation was observed during mtp degradation by uv cl sar after post chlorination tcm 1 1 dichloropropanone 1 1 1 trichloropropanone and dichloroacetonitrile were detected their individual and total concentrations were all positively proportional to uv cl sar treatment time the total concentration with 30 min treatment 66 93 μg l 1 was about 2 3 times that with 1 min treatment 28 76 μg l 1 finally the accelerated effect was verified with cl glycine and cl alanine it is expected to unravel the non negligible role of organic chloramine on water quality during uv disinfection graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organic amine uv photolysis kinetics mechanism disinfection by products formation 1 introduction algae blooms how et al 2018 and anthropogenic inputs shah et al 2011 lead to the ubiquity of organic amines in natural waters organic amines can reactively react with free chlorine hocl ocl fc with rates of 107 108 m 1 s 1 to form organic chloramines deborde and von gunten 2008 shah et al 2011 considering self decay by hydrolysis only the stabilities of organic chloramines are generally higher than those of inorganic chloramines and fc how et al 2017 during drinking water treatment organic chloramines are inevitably formed during pre chlorination process and likely present in subsequent treatment and distribution systems zhang et al 2016 uv based processes have been extensively used for disinfection and micro pollutants degradation yang et al 2021 thereby the photolysis of organic chloramines can be unintentionally conducted organic chloramines have attracted considerable attention they are potentially toxic can serve as disinfection by product dbp precursors and interfere with fc determination guo et al 2021 liu et al 2022 additionally organic chloramines are known to be weak in sterilization and oxidation donnermair and blatchley 2003 zhang et al 2018 for example amiri et al 2010 noted that no measurable e coli inactivation was observed at ph 8 1 for all tested organic chloramines heeb et al 2017 found that the apparent second order rate constants k app for the reactions of phenolic compounds with organic chloramines were 103 105 lower than those for the reactions of phenolic compounds with fc however many researches reported that uv photolysis of inorganic chloramines mainly nh2cl analogues to organic chloramines generated reactive radicals to degrade micro pollutants wu et al 2021 soltermann et al 2013 presented that the nature of ncl bond in chlorinated dimethylamine was similar to that in nh2cl uv photolysis of organic chloramines can also induce ncl bond cleavage and generated cl and aminyl radicals ruan et al 2021 soltermann et al 2013 hence uv activated organic chloramines could offer a possibility for micro pollutants degradation wu et al 2022 despite its potential the systematic investigation on the degradation kinetics and mechanism of micro pollutants by uv organic chloramine is still limited the types of organic amines include primary secondary and tertiary amines among them primary and secondary amines react with fc to form negatively charged organic chloramines but tertiary amines react with fc to form positively charged chlorammonium species shah et al 2011 amino acids are an important group of organic amines the total concentration of amino acids accounts for 75 of dissolved organic nitrogen westerhoff and mash 2002 among amino acids sarcosine sar is the secondary amine of the simplest structure it reactively reacts with fc to form the organic monochloramine i e cl sar but not organic dichloramine deborde and von gunten 2008 although the abundance in aquatic systems was hardly reported sar is likely present in natural waters due to its wide use in biochemical field kumar and kishore 2013 hence sar was used as an amine group containing compound to investigate the activation of organic chloramine by uv photolysis metoprolol mtp a commonly used β blocker gao et al 2020 is of high detection frequency and concentration in aquatic systems cantwell et al 2018 it was the most dominant β blocker with 100 detection frequency and a maximum concentration of 10 μg l 1 in hospital wastewaters xu et al 2019 meanwhile mtp has been detected in natural waters mtp concentration in hudson river usa can reach 2 0 μg l 1 cantwell et al 2018 mtp was relatively stable in aqueous solution compared with other β blockers e g atenolol and propranolol gao et al 2020 the degradation efficiency of mtp by conventional water treatment processes e g chlorination was limited barazesh et al 2016 hence the organic chloramine i e cl sar formation during chlorination and its decomposition by uv photolysis were first investigated then the effect of uv activated cl sar uv cl sar on micro pollutant using mtp as a model degradation was evaluated in detail specially the degradation kinetics was assessed the degradation mechanism was then revealed via determination of reactive species contribution and transformation products tps of mtp besides disinfection by products dbps formation during mtp degradation and after post chlorination was determined finally the accelerated effect of uv activated organic chloramine was verified with cl glycine gly and cl alanine ala 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals chemical reagents and their relative providers are listed in text s1 2 2 experimental procedures to investigate the chlorine substances variation during chlorination ultrapure water containing 2 5 mg c l 1 humic acid ha was used as the simulated natural organic matter nom containing water sar as a model organic amine was subsequently added or not and fc was dosed to initiate the reactions samples at different chlorination time were withdrawn to determine fc and total chlorine concentrations the photochemistry experiments were conducted in a magnetically stirred cylindrical quartz uv reactor diameter height 11 23 cm wang et al 2020 a low pressure hg uv lamp comwin zw10d15w z212 10 w 254 nm was fixed in the uv reactor center the average uv fluence rate was determined to be 2 5 mw cm 2 zhu et al 2015 to investigate the degradation kinetics of mtp fig s1 by uv cl sar 5 mm phosphate buffer was applied to adjust ph unless otherwise specified the test solution 1 l was added with 5 μm mtp and 70 μm cl sar and synchronously exposed to uv irradiation samples 1 ml were withdrawn at preset time intervals and quenched with excessive na2s2o3 to determine mtp concentration to evaluate the effect of water matrix nom hco3 cl and no3 were added in the forms of ha nahco3 nacl and nano3 respectively to determine the dbps formation during mtp degradation by uv cl sar aliquots of sample at different uv cl sar treatment durations were withdrawn and stored in amber glasses 50 ml to determine the dbps formation after post chlorination additional 0 28 mm fc was dosed to the uv cl sar treated samples all samples were incubated with headspace free in the dark at 25 2 c for 7 days after the contact time samples were quenched and extracted to determine dbps concentration all experiments were replicated at least twice and the reported data present the average of experimental results 2 3 analysis methods the detailed analysis methods are summarized in text s2 the related limits of quantification loq are listed in table s1 2 4 quantum chemistry calculations details on the quantum chemistry calculations are shown in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation and uv photolysis of cl sar in fig 1 pre chlorination process is widely applied to promote algae removal dong et al 2021 where organic chloramines are formed via the reactions of organic amines e g amino acids contained in algae organic matter with fc when uv disinfection is applied subsequently yang et al 2021 uv photolysis of organic chloramines can be unintentionally conducted besides chlorine disinfection is a commonly used drinking water treatment process uv process as the best proposal of second disinfecting can be applied at points of entry to disinfect drinking water after distribution in this case uv photolysis of organic chloramines can also be conducted in order to verify the reactivity of organic amines using sar as a model with fc to form organic chloramines the chlorine substances variation during chlorination of simulated nom containing water was investigated fig 2 a due to no additional nh4 in the experimental system the detected combined chlorine was regarded as organic chloramines in the absence of sar fc rapidly decreased by nearly 23 within 20 s meanwhile organic chloramines were formed 0 3 mg l 1 this was likely attributed to the amine moieties contained in nom component then fc concentration decreased more slowly until 10 min residual fc was 50 in the presence of sar fc was almost depleted within 20 s congruently organic chloramines were formed and reached the maximum concentration the molar ratio of organic chloramines to the initial fc dose was 95 the results were consistent with that the reaction rate of organic amines with fc was several orders of magnitude higher than that of nom deborde and von gunten 2008 zhai et al 2014 accordingly a kinetic model was developed text s4 to fit the experimentally measured chlorine substances variation three types of nom reaction sites presented in the previous study zhai et al 2014 and amine moieties contained in nom were defined hence the reactions of sar with fc nom with fc and nom with cl sar were involved in the model table s2 chlorine substances variation in the presence of sar with various concentrations were further modelled fig s2 sar always reactively consumed fc to form cl sar and a higher concentration of sar lead to a higher proportion of organic chloramine zhang et al 2016 reported organic chloramines formation during chlor am ination of water samples from yangtze river and huangpu river these results verified that organic amines can compete for fc against nom to form organic chloramines during pre chlorination the stabilities of organic chloramines and the water residence time determined whether organic chloramines formed during pre chlorination can be present in the subsequent uv process chlorinated dipeptides have been clearly detected from tap water and most of them were reported to be stable in water 10 days huang et al 2017 this reflected that some stable organic chloramines are potentially transported to uv process during drinking water treatment then the decomposition of cl sar via self decay and uv photolysis was comparatively determined fig s3 the self decay and uv photolysis of cl sar all followed a first order degradation reaction the first order degradation rate constants k obs of cl sar via self decay were kind of stable in the range of 0 002 0 005 min 1 under phs 5 5 8 5 this indicated that ph had little impact on the stability of cl sar which was consistent with the results in a previous study armesto et al 1993 the proportion of cl sar decomposed by self decay after 30 min was 20 because the hydrolysis of organic chloramines was quite slow how et al 2017 however upon 20 min uv irradiation more than 95 of cl sar was decomposed the decomposition rate of cl sar by uv photolysis reached to 0 185 0 189 min 1 under phs 5 5 8 5 consistently ruan et al 2021 found that uv irradiation significantly accelerated cl amino acids decomposition uv photolysis of organic chloramine can induce ncl bond breakage and the resulting reactive radicals formation ra and lee 2021 soltermann et al 2013 yang et al 2021 hence the effect of uv photolysis of cl sar on micro pollutant degradation was then evaluated 3 2 accelerated degradation of mtp by uv cl sar in fig 2 b mtp degradation by uv cl sar and uv cl sar was comparatively investigated mtp was recalcitrant towards cl sar which was ascribed to the weak oxidation potential of cl sar zhang et al 2018 and low reactivity of mtp towards chlorine species acero et al 2010 meanwhile because of the low molar absorption coefficient 560 m 1 cm 1 and quantum yield 0 005 mol e 1 of mtp gao et al 2020 the uv photolysis of mtp was limited with a removal ratio of 5 at a fluence of 1500 mj cm 2 uv cl sar can accelerate mtp degradation the linear relationship between ln mtp mtp 0 and treatment time t eq 1 indicated that the degradation kinetics of mtp could be fitted well with pseudo first order kinetics the degradation rate of mtp by uv cl sar 0 055 min 1 was 10 times higher than the sum of those by cl sar negligible and uv alone 0 005 min 1 the formation of reactive radicals under uv photolysis of cl sar accounted for the significantly accelerated mtp degradation 1 ln mtp mtp 0 k obs t where mtp 0 and mtp are the initial and residual concentrations of mtp after t min treatment respectively t is the preset treatment time min ph has an important effect on micro pollutants degradation by uv based aops tian et al 2020 in fig s4 mtp degradation by uv cl sar was ph dependent as ph increased from 5 5 to 8 5 the total k obs in uv cl sar monotonically increased from 0 044 to 0 065 min 1 organic chloramines can absorb uv photos to generate primary radicals of both cl and aminyl radicals ra and lee 2021 ruan et al 2021 ho is rapidly formed due to the strong interaction of cl with hydroxide zhang et al 2019 besides secondary radicals e g clo and cl2 can be further formed via the reactions involved cl sun et al 2019 ho as a non selective oxidant can degrade lots of micro pollutants while reactive chlorine species rcss were relatively selective and preferentially degrade certain micro pollutants guo et al 2017 the second order rate constants of mtp with ho k h o mtp and cl k c l mtp were 8 39 109 and 1 71 1010 m 1 s 1 respectively pan et al 2020 hence the ph dependence of mtp degradation by uv cl sar was mainly attributed to the variation of reactive radicals contribution under different phs 3 3 reactive species contribution in mtp degradation by uv cl sar the roles of ho and cl in micro pollutants degradation have been widely studied guo et al 2017 nevertheless other reactive radicals were also formed during mtp degradation by uv cl sar aminyl radicals formed from the cleavage of ncl bond have been proposed to play an important role in bisphenol a degradation wu et al 2022 in uv nh2cl process no and no2 can be formed from the reaction of nh2 and the dissolved oxygen and are involved in micro pollutants degradation wu et al 2021 wu et al 2019 it is not clear whether aminyl radicals can transform to them but this is enough to indicate that reactive nitrogen radicals rnss possibly contributed to mtp degradation in uv cl sar process additionally the steady state concentrations of cl2 cl2 ss were 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than cl ss under uv photolysis of cl gly cl tyrosine and cl ala ruan et al 2021 the second order rate constant of cl2 with mtp was reported to be 2 6 108 m 1 s 1 pan et al 2020 clo can also react with mtp with a rate of 1 34 108 m 1s 1 guo et al 2018 rcss besides cl likely contributed to mtp degradation hence in uv cl sar process reactive species included uv cl sar ho cl and other formed radicals e g aminyl radicals cl2 and clo due to the negligible reactivity of cl sar towards mtp the degradation kinetics of mtp by uv cl sar can be presented as eq 2 according to text s5 ho ss and cl ss were collectively obtained they exhibited completely adverse ph dependent trends because cl was more easily transformed to ho at higher ph weng et al 2013 ho ss gradually increased but cl ss decreased as ph increased the contribution rates of reactive species to mtp degradation were then calculated text s5 and found to be ph dependent fig 3 a consistent with the previous research guo et al 2017 the photolysis rate of mtp by uv irradiation 0 004 0 005 min 1 kept constant under different phs nevertheless the contribution rates of reactive radicals varied at ph 5 5 ho was the dominant contributor to mtp degradation the contribution rates of ho cl and other unidentified radicals were 0 018 0 010 and 0 012 min 1 respectively with ph increasing the contribution rates of ho and other unidentified radicals increased but that of cl decreased at ph 8 5 the contribution rates of ho cl and other unidentified radicals were 0 023 0 007 and 0 031 min 1 respectively 2 k obs total mtp k obs uv mtp k obs h o mtp k obs c l mtp k obs other mtp where k obs total mtp represents the total pseudo first order rate constant of mtp degradation by uv cl sar min 1 k obs uv mtp k obs h o mtp k obs c l mtp and k obs other mtp are defined as the pseudo first order rate constants of mtp degradation by uv ho cl and other identified radicals respectively namely the contribution rate of each species to mtp degradation next the removal ratio of mtp by each reactive species as a function of treatment time was calculated via integration eqs 3 6 after 10 min uv cl sar treatment the total removal ratios of mtp at ph 5 5 fig 3 b 7 2 fig 3 c and 8 5 fig 3 d were 35 42 and 48 respectively the contribution of a certain reactive species was calculated as the removal ratio of mtp by the reactive species divided by the total removal ratio of mtp by uv cl sar hence the contributions of uv ho cl and other identified radicals to mtp degradation at ph 5 5 were 8 41 23 and 28 respectively at ph 7 2 were 9 38 15 and 38 respectively and at ph 8 5 were 7 35 10 and 48 respectively the results indicated that ho and cl were main contributors to degrade mtp as the sum of removal ratios by ho and cl accounted for 45 64 of the total removal ratio by uv cl sar other identified radicals such as rcss other than cl and rnss also played roles in mtp degradation guo et al 2017 presented that micro pollutants transformation from their neutral cationic form to anionic neutral form favored the electrophilic reaction with rcss increasing ph from 5 5 to 8 5 promoted the transformation of mtp pk a1 9 43 pk a2 13 89 from cationic form to neutral form and the latter form is more electron rich lian et al 2017 besides rnss were selective with preference for electron rich moieties sun et al 2019 in a previous study the contribution rate of rnss to phenol degradation in uv nh2cl process increased with ph increasing from 7 to 10 which was partly attributed to the increasing no concentration chen et al 2021 3 r uv 0 t k obs uv mtp mtp d t mtp 0 100 where

was defined as the total removal ratio of mtp by uv cl sar 3 4 effect of water matrix on mtp degradation by uv cl sar 3 4 1 degradation of mtp in simulated matrix containing waters nom hco3 cl and no3 are widespread matrix components in real waters hence their effects on mtp degradation by uv cl sar in synthetic solutions were evaluated in fig 4 a with the nom concentration ranging from 0 5 mg l 1 the k obs of mtp in uv cl sar process gradually decreased from 0 055 to 0 040 min 1 the result was attributed to the competitive consumption of reactive radicals by nom and its uv adsorption effect for example the reaction rates of nom with ho cl and clo were 2 5 104 1 3 104 and 4 5 104 mg l 1 s 1 respectively guo et al 2017 meanwhile nom as an inner uv filter can adsorb uv254 with the extinction coefficient of 3 15 l m 1 mg 1 pan et al 2020 in fig 4 b the inhibitory effect of hco3 on mtp degradation was observed in the presence of 300 mg l 1 hco3 the k obs of mtp significantly decreased to 0 032 min 1 hco3 is the major inorganic carbon in natural waters with the concentration ranging from dozen to hundred mg l 1 xie et al 2015 hco3 can scavenge ho cl and cl2 with reaction rates of 2 2 108 8 5 106 and 2 2 108 m 1 s 1 respectively zhang et al 2019 it was considered as an important scavenging factor during uv based aops although co3 can be formed during above reactions its effect on mtp degradation was limited due to the low oxidation potential in fig 4 c mtp degradation rates were kind of stable 0 052 0 055 min 1 in the presence of 50 mg l 1 cl but increased to 0 064 min 1 in the presence of 100 mg l 1 cl the rate constants for the forward and backward reactions of cl with ho were 4 3 109 and 6 1 109 m 1 s 1 respectively zhang et al 2019 thus the effect of cl on ho ss was negligible while cl can react with cl to form cl2 with a rate constant of 8 0 109 m 1 s 1 and the rate constant for its backward reaction was several orders of magnitude lower zhang et al 2019 it has been reported that cl accelerated mtp degradation by uv fc due to the increasing formation of cl2 pan et al 2020 in fig 4 d the addition of no3 accelerated mtp degradation by uv cl sar the k obs increased to 0 064 min 1 in the presence of 10 mg l 1 no3 uv photolysis of no3 is well known to form ho and many literatures reported its accelerated effect on micro pollutants photodegradation sun et al 2014 xiao et al 2014 besides rnss primarily no2 can also be formed from uv photolysis of no3 sun et al 2014 and it moderately reacts with electron rich moieties sun et al 2019 when no3 concentration increased to 20 and even 50 mg l 1 the degradation rate of mtp was basically unchanged this may be attributed to the self quenching of no2 4 5 108 m 1 s 1 and its combining reaction with ho 1 3 109 m 1 s 1 sun et al 2014 3 4 2 degradation of mtp in real waters mtp degradation by uv cl sar was further evaluated in two real waters which were biological activated carbon bac and sand filtration sf effluents respectively they were withdrawn from a drinking water treatment plant in jiangsu china their major quality parameters were listed in table s3 in fig s5 the degradation rates of mtp by uv cl sar were 0 032 and 0 024 min 1 in bac and sf effluent respectively much lower than that in ultrapure water 0 055 min 1 previous works reported the inhibited micro pollutants photodegradation in real waters gao et al 2020 yin et al 2018 since the ph values of three waters 7 1 7 5 were almost identical the ph effect on mtp degradation could be excluded according to fig 3 51 mg l 1 cl and 2 44 mg l 1 no3 had limited effects on mtp degradation by uv cl sar hence the inhibited degradation efficiency of mtp in two real waters could be attributed to the presence of nom 2 2 mg l 1 and hco3 120 mg l 1 meanwhile due to the effective removal of nom the degradation rate of mtp in bac effluent was 33 higher than that in sf effluent the effect of water matrix should be considered into mtp degradation by uv cl sar 3 5 dbps formation after mtp degradation by uv cl sar considering dbps formation likely last for several days dbps formation during mtp degradation by uv cl sar was analyzed after 7 days fig 5 a it should be noted that the uv cl sar treatment time of 0 min means cl sar was dosed without uv irradiation thus the detected dbps at 0 min was resulting from chlorination of sar trichloromethane tcm was the only detected species during mtp degradation and its concentration in the presence of uv irradiation uv cl sar treatment time 0 min was higher than that in the absence of uv irradiation uv cl sar treatment time 0 min with uv cl sar treatment time extending from 1 to 10 min tcm concentration gradually increased from 2 72 to 3 50 μg l 1 this was mainly attributed to the accelerated degradation of mtp by reactive radicals formed in uv cl sar it has been widely reported that the formed reactive radicals such as rcss and ho can enhance dbps formation during micro pollutants degradation by uv fc and uv nh2cl wang et al 2020 wu et al 2016 however with uv cl sar treatment time further extending to 20 and 30 min tcm concentration decreased to 3 23 and 2 86 μg l 1 respectively this was probably because the residual cl sar was negligible after uv photolysis for 20 min 0 2 mg l 1 which inhibited the simultaneous tcm formation from the attack of reactive radicals during mtp degradation by uv cl sar and the subsequent tcm formation from the reaction of mtp intermediates with cl sar during the 7 day incubation post chlorination is a commonly used method to maintain residual protection for water distribution system hence dbps formation after post chlorination following mtp degradation by uv cl sar was further investigated as shown in fig 5 b tcm 1 1 dichloropropanone 1 1 dcp 1 1 1 trichloropropanone 1 1 1 tcp and dichloroacetonitrile dcan were detected similarly the presence of uv irradiation significantly enhanced dbps formation after post chlorination among all the detected dbps tcm was the major dbp species and its concentration monotonically increased with prolonging uv cl sar treatment time tcm concentration with 30 min uv cl sar treatment 49 88 μg l 1 was about 1 7 times that with 1 min uv cl sar treatment 28 72 μg l 1 similar trend was observed for 1 1 dcp its concentration increased from loq to 16 86 μg l 1 1 1 1 tcp was only detected with 30 min uv cl sar treatment of which the concentration 0 10 μg l 1 ho could attack mtp via hydroxylation to form hydroxylated products and rcss could attack mtp via oxidation and electrophilic halogenation gao et al 2020 the results indicated that the mtp tps were more prone to provide carbon source than mtp to form tcm 1 1 dcp and 1 1 1 tcp cl sar and its photolysis by products also contributed to the above dbps formation but was of a relatively minor contribution because only 4 52 μg l 1 tcm and 0 07 μg l 1 1 1 dcp was formed after post chlorination of cl sar the result was not shown dcan was the only detected species of nitrogenous n dbps with a concentration of loq 0 12 μg l 1 mtp and cl sar both likely provided nitrogen source to form n dbps but dcan was not detected after prost chlorination of cl sar only meanwhile it has been reported that uv photolysis of organic chloramines e g cl ethanolamine and cl urea can release nh4 and no3 ra and lee 2021 yang et al 2021 therefore the increasing formation of dcan was mainly attributed to mtp degradation the total concentration of these four dbps was positively proportional to uv cl sar treatment time the total dbps concentration with 30 min uv cl sar treatment 66 93 μg l 1 was about 2 3 times that with 1 min uv cl sar treatment 28 76 μg l 1 the enhanced dbps formation in the presence of uv irradiation warrants further attention 3 6 proposed degradation pathways of mtp by uv cl sar as shown in fig s6 the removal ratio of total organic carbon toc after 30 min uv cl sar treatment was 15 it indicated that the degradation of mtp by uv cl sar was mainly achieved via transformation to tps rather than mineralization hence the degradation pathways of mtp by uv cl sar were then proposed via analysis of tps fig 6 the major fragment ions of mtp tps and the proposed molecular formulas are summarized in table s4 the total ion chromatogram m z 100 350 and selected ion monitoring chromatograms are shown in fig s7 and fig s8 respectively because the effects of cl sar oxidation and uv photolysis on mtp degradation in uv cl sar process were negligible transformation reactions were mainly initiated by the attack of reactive radicals e g ho and cl different transformation reactions such as hydroxylation oxidation dealkylation h abstraction and dehydration could take place in this system the main reactive sites of mtp were predicted through quantum chemical calculation the highest occupied molecular orbital homo isosurface and the contribution of each atom to the composition of homo are shown in fig s9 and table s5 respectively the homo of mtp was dominated by the c atoms on the aromatic ring the contributions of c5 c7 and c8 on the aromatic ring to the composition of homo were calculated as 18 663 10 814 and 15 556 respectively these results indicated that the reactive sites of mtp were mainly located on the aromatic ring the addition of one hydroxyl group to the aromatic ring led to the formation of tp 284 1 after further hydroxylation tp 300 and tp 316 could be formed romero et al 2016 ho could also attack the ether moiety via h abstraction to form tp 284 2 which has been widely detected and defined as α hydroxymetoprolol α hmtp rubirola et al 2014 desaturation reactions subsequently occurred involving the oh moiety which contributed to the formation of tp 224 and tp 282 tp 226 was likely formed from the cleavage of terminal methyl group under ho attack o9 located on the aminopropanol moiety also contributed to the homo its contribution to the composition of homo was up to 18 681 hence o9 also was prone to be attacked by reactive radicals consistently tp 134 was formed through the bond breaking in the aliphatic part cavalcante et al 2015 tp 342 has been reported to be formed in uv fc process via the substitution of cl into mtp nam et al 2015 cl was selective and prone to substitute the hydrogen atom from aromatic ring pan et al 2020 thereby tp 376 was probably formed open ring tp 274 has been observed in other photodegradation processes but its formation was without the involvement of ho filipe et al 2020 oxidation is an important mechanism for micro pollutants degradation by reactive radicals the formation of tp 254 known as o desmethylmetoprolol o dmtp rubirola et al 2014 was initiated from the terminal methyl moiety and then it can be oxidized by ho to form tp 268 and tp 238 of note tp 268 namely metoprolol acid mtpa is regarded as the major human metabolite of mtp rubirola et al 2014 under the continuous attack of reactive radicals the side chain could be broken down to form some low molecular weight by products such as tp 121 and tp 190 in a previous work tp 121 was predicted to exhibit higher acute toxicity for green algae daphnia and fish than the parent compound mtp meanwhile tp 282 and tp 254 were potentially developmental toxic and resistant to biodegradation jaen gil et al 2019 hence although the parent compound mtp was degraded the potential risk caused by the formation of tps cannot be neglected 3 7 accelerated degradation of mtp by uv activated other organic chloramines gly is the primary amine most similar in structure to sar it is of high abundance in natural waters and of high reactivity towards fc the formation of corresponding organic monochloramine cl gly is significant for drinking water systems due to its toxicity and stability how et al 2016 ala is also a highly abundant primary amine in natural waters how et al 2016 of which the ch3 group replaces a h atom of gly the accelerated effect of uv activated organic chloramine on mtp degradation was further verified with cl gly and cl ala fig 7 similar to cl sar cl gly and cl ala exhibited negligible effects on mtp degradation uv cl gly and uv cl ala both significantly accelerated mtp degradation and the degradation kinetics were also fitted well with pseudo first order kinetics the degradation rates of mtp by three uv activated organic chloramine processes at ph 7 2 followed the order of uv cl ala 0 086 min 1 uv cl gly 0 069 min 1 uv cl sar 0 055 min 1 for the same primary amine its corresponding monochloramine and dichloramine species are of different molar absorption coefficients and quantum yields ra and lee 2021 different quantum yields can also be found for monochloramine species formed from different organic amines ra et al 2019 weng et al 2013 hence different mtp degradation rates by three uv photodegradation processes may be attributed to the various molar absorption coefficients and quantum yields of these organic chloramines 4 conclusion during chlorination of simulated nom containing water sar competitively consumed fc to form cl sar then uv photolysis significantly accelerated the decomposition of resulting cl sar uv cl sar can accelerate mtp degradation attributed to reactive radicals formation ho and cl contributed to 45 64 of mtp degradation by uv cl sar the contribution rate of ho increased but that of cl decreased with the increasing ph uv cl sar treatment can enhance dbps formation tcm was the only detected dbp species during mtp degradation after post chlorination tcm 1 1 dcp 1 1 1 tcp and dcan were detected and their concentrations were positively proportional to uv cl sar treatment time the pathways of mtp degradation by uv cl sar were proposed the accelerated effect of uv activated organic chloramine on mtp degradation was finally verified with cl gly and cl ala the results indicated that organic amines can compete for fc against nom to form organic chloramine regardless of available fc after pre chlorination reactive radicals can be formed during the subsequent uv process via organic chloramines photolysis despite of the weak oxidation potential of organic chloramines uv activated organic chloramines lead to changes in water chemistry e g micro pollutants fate dbps formation and toxicity these results remind us to pay attention to the role of organic chloramine on water quality during uv disinfection of drinking water besides the results could also be relevant in water reuse

16492,the application of oxidants for disinfection or micropollutant abatement during drinking water and wastewater treatment is accompanied by oxidation of matrix components such as dissolved organic matter dom to improve predictions of the efficiency of oxidation processes and the formation of oxidation products methods to determine concentrations of oxidant reactive phenolic olefinic or amine type dom moieties are critical here a novel selective oxidative titration approach is presented which is based on reaction kinetics of oxidation reactions towards certain dom moieties phenolic moieties were determined by oxidative titration with clo2 and o3 for five dom isolates and two secondary wastewater effluent samples the determined concentrations of phenolic moieties correlated with the electron donating capacity edc and the formation of inorganic clo2 byproducts hocl clo2 clo3 clo2 byproduct yields from phenol and dom isolates and changes due to the application of molecular tagging for phenols revealed a better understanding of oxidant reactive structures within dom overall oxidative titrations with clo2 and o3 provide a novel and promising tool to quantify oxidant reactive moieties in complex mixtures such as dom and can be expanded to other matrices or oxidants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter oxidative titration chlorine dioxide ozone electron donating capacity molecular tagging electron rich moieties phenols oxidation byproducts 1 introduction chemical oxidants such as ozone chlorine and chlorine dioxide are applied in water treatment to improve the microbial and chemical water quality von gunten 2018 during oxidative water and wastewater treatment dissolved organic matter dom reacts with chemical oxidants thereby dom oxidant interactions not only decrease the efficiency of oxidation processes but also contribute to the formation of potentially toxic oxidation byproducts obps li and mitch 2018 liu et al 2020 sedlak and von gunten 2011 von gunten 2003a these problems may be aggravated when applying such processes for micropollutant abatement during enhanced wastewater treatment or water reuse because of higher concentrations and different types of dom von gunten 2018 the complexity and heterogeneity of dom complicate the prediction of the extent of oxidant consumption and consequently their exposure determining parameter for oxidation and disinfection efficiency von gunten 2003a 2003b and also the formation of obps to improve the prediction of the efficiency of oxidation processes and the formation of obps methods to quantify oxidant reactive dom moieties are needed in previous studies semi quantitative methods have been applied including surrogate parameters such as the specific uv absorption at 254 nm e g suva254 which has been used to estimate the formation of obps during chlorination korshin et al 1997 and the abatement of micropollutants or disinfection efficiency during ozonation bahr et al 2007 buffle et al 2006 wert et al 2009 wittmer et al 2015 in recent years measurements of the electron donating capacity edc have been used to assess relative changes of the antioxidant properties of dom in response to reactions with chemical oxidants önnby et al 2018a remucal et al 2020 walpen et al 2020 wenk et al 2013 typically the edc was used as a measure for the phenolic content of dom aeschbacher et al 2012 walpen et al 2016 in combination with uv measurements edc is a useful parameter to assess relative changes in the content of reactive dom moieties and formation of obps from the reactions with various oxidants such as chlorine dioxide chlorine or ozone önnby et al 2018a wenk et al 2013 relative changes in edc during ozonation have also been applied as a proxy for micropollutant abatement during enhanced wastewater treatment chon et al 2015 remucal et al 2020 walpen et al 2021 2020 and changes due to pre oxidation

liu et al 2020 maizel and remucal 2017 remucal et al 2020 these and reemtsma 2005 in this study contrasting to the semiquantitative methods described above we propose oxidative titration as a novel quantitative method to assess dom oxidant interactions the oxidative titration is based on the selectivity of oxidants towards certain moieties past studies have shown that oxidants such as ozone chlorine dioxide or chlorine are selective towards different moieties in model compounds and micropollutants lee and von gunten 2010 which may also depend on the ph due to the speciation of the oxidant and or reactive moiety this selectivity is illustrated by the apparent second order rate constants for various oxidants and moieties in model compounds which have been determined previously fig 1 at ph 7 0 deborde and von gunten 2008 gan et al 2020 hoigné and bader 1994 1983 lee and von gunten 2012 li et al 2020 lim et al 2019 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 ozone reacts mainly with olefins and activated aromatic systems with second order rate constants which span over a range of 10 orders of magnitude von gunten 2003a von sonntag and von gunten 2012 fig 1a the reactions between ozone and β diketones have not been studied to date even though they are also potential precursors of disinfection byproducts arnold et al 2008 jiang et al 2020 zeng and arnold 2014 the apparent second order rate constant for the reaction of acetylacetone with ozone at ph 7 0 determined in this study is shown in fig 1a and figure s17 and also in results and discussion section 3 2 2 chlorine mainly reacts with amine moieties fig 1b but also β diketones deborde and von gunten 2008 lee and von gunten 2010 chlorine dioxide is a very selective oxidant fig 1c and has the highest second order rate constants for the reactions with phenols gan et al 2020 hoigné and bader 1994 for β diketones only one second order rate constant for dimedone was previously determined which is comparable to phenols at circumneutral ph k 2 1 0 4 m 1 s 1 hoigné and bader 1994 dom is a complex assembly of subunits containing electron withdrawing and donating substituents with a wide range of oxidant reactive moieties including phenols β diketones amines and olefins consequently the selectivity of oxidants towards dom moieties should be reflected in distinct kinetic behavior for different oxidant reactive moieties in dom fig 1 with the novel concept of oxidative titration proposed in this study a specific group of oxidant reactive moieties in dom can be quantified by a selected oxidant as titrant in a time controlled reaction with increasing oxidant doses instead of determining the endpoint with an indicator a residual oxidant is measured after the targeted oxidant reactive moiety is depleted in addition to oxidative titration molecular tagging approaches can be used to reduce the complexity of mixtures or selectively modify them york and bell 2020 dom moieties responsible for the high reactivity with an oxidant can be blocked by molecular tagging to better understand and quantify the oxidant reactive moieties by comparison of titration results before and after modification the objective of this study was to develop and validate oxidative titration as a method to quantify phenolic moieties in dom they were chosen as analytes with clo2 as titrant because they represent the major fraction of oxidant reactive moieties in dom von gunten 2018 oxidative titrations with clo2 and o3 from a model system and dom were combined with a molecular tagging method for phenols which allowed to assess the importance of other carbonous moieties including olefins and β diketones in dom the results were related to changes in uv absorbance and edc as well as the formation of inorganic byproducts from clo2 reactions moreover edc measurements from non tagged and tagged dom model compounds helped to evaluate the results in a companion study a similar approach with chlorine and ozone was applied to quantify organic nitrogen containing dom moieties essaïed et al 2021 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and solutions a list of the chemicals used in this study with information on their purity and suppliers dom isolates and sample collection of wastewater and generation of oxidant stock solutions are provided in section s1 all aqueous solutions were prepared in ultrapurified water with a resistivity of 18 2 mω cm arium pro ultrapure water systems sartorius ag goettingen germany 2 1 1 selection of dom model compounds twenty seven model compounds that are representative for dom electron rich moieties fig 2 were chosen based on their i chemical properties and ii reactivity with the oxidants clo2 and o3 the first category of compounds are phenols i e aromatic compounds with mono and polyhydroxy moieties fig 2 1 13 this category is further divided into the sub categories simple and bulky phenols depending on the degree of steric hindrance the second category are aliphatic and aromatic β diketones fig 2 14 19 and the third category includes other activated aromatic compounds fig 2 20 22 olefins fig 2 23 24 and a primary secondary and tertiary amine fig 2 25 27 phenol was used as a simple model compound in oxidative titration described in section 2 2 and edc experiments described in section 2 3 while all the other model compounds were only used in edc experiments section 2 3 chemical names pk a values and k app clo2 at ph 6 0 if available and measured edcs are listed in table s1 2 1 2 preparation of tagged phenols and dom solutions a molecular tagging approach was selected to convert phenolic moieties to phenylacetates section s2 acetic anhydride and nahco3 were added to a phenolic model compound or a dom sample dissolved in acetonitrile lugemwa et al 2013 the mix was stirred overnight under n2 to avoid oxygenation of phenolic dom moieties due to the higher ph caused by nahco3 after this procedure the samples were evaporated under a constant n2 stream and re dissolved in 50 ml acidified ultrapurified water to achieve a ph around 6 and used within one day untagged controls were prepared in the same fashion in absence of acetic anhydride the apparent tagging efficiency for phenol was confirmed using hplc fluorescence detection fld with authentic standards to determine the identity of tagged products additional measurements by lc hrms section s2 were performed for selected model compounds example in figure s1 finally the edc demonstrated to be a successful indicator for tagging efficiency figure s2 and section s2 in the case of dom an untagged sample underwent the same procedure and its edc was compared to a standard dom solution without any treatment to account for changes in dom due to the procedure example in figure s3a 2 2 oxidative titration experiments 2 2 1 general procedure of an oxidative titration experiment the procedure for an oxidative titration experiment is illustrated in scheme 1 the oxidative titration experiments with clo2 are based on the assumption that the residual oxidant concentration will increase when phenolic moieties are depleted the consumed oxidant is a measure for the concentration of reacted phenolic moieties based on the known reaction stoichiometry oxidative titrations with the model compound phenol were performed to test the feasibility of this approach representing a simple model system and was then applied to the more complex dom solutions kinetic modeling the reaction times which depend on the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions between phenol and the oxidants clo2 and o3 were obtained by kinetic modeling using kintecus ianni 2003 for details see section s3 oxidative titration solutions with varying ratios of oxidant to phenol or dom were reacted for a predetermined duration at defined timepoints after adding the oxidant an aliquot of the titrated solution was quenched by indigo to quantify the residual oxidant terhalle et al 2018 or purged by n2 for further analyses other endpoints quantification phenol concentrations were obtained by analyzing the slope and x intercept from direct residual oxidant clo2 or transformed residual oxidant o3 for details see section s3 2 2 2 oxidative titration with clo2 oxidative titration experiments with clo2 were performed in solutions containing phenol 10 μm triethylamine 5 μm or dom 3 mgc l 1 glycine 100 μm was added to quench intrinsically formed free available chlorine fac rougé et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 phosphate buffer 10 mm was added to obtain a ph of 6 0 0 05 the oxidant dose was increased from 0 to 40 μm clo2 and added to batch reactors yielding molar ratios of clo2 to phenol of 0 2 1 5 the two compounds phenol and triethylamine were chosen because of their differing apparent second order rate constants for the reaction with clo2 at ph 6 0 phenol 6 103 m 1s 1 triethylamine 10 m 1s 1 fig 1 under these conditions triethylamine does not consume clo2 and thus for the defined reaction times should not consume any of the increasing clo2 residual after depletion of phenols deactivated benzenes are expected to have a very low apparent second order rate constant with clo2 e g phenyl acetate 10 5 m 1s 1 lee and von gunten 2012 thus a tagged phenol served as negative control for the oxidative titration the molecular tagging of phenols and phenolic moieties in dom is described in section 2 1 2 residual clo2 was quenched by indigo terhalle et al 2018 after defined reaction times between 1 and 8 min for details see figure s4 and section s3 to measure the formed inorganic byproducts fac clo2 clo3 and changes in edc and uv due to oxidation clo2 was purged by n2 with a teflon frit for 60 120 s residual clo2 was completely purged within 10 30 s figure s6 the applied methods are described in sections 2 3 and 2 4 2 2 3 oxidative titration with ozone oxidative titration with o3 was performed similarly because of faster reactions between o3 and phenol a quench flow set up biologic sfm 400 q was applied criquet et al 2015 for practical reasons the phenol concentration was varied and the ozone dose remained constant oxidative titration experiments were performed at ph 7 0 0 05 in 10 mm phosphate buffer in solutions containing 10 μm phenol or 3 mgc l 1 dom solutions and in presence of 2 mm tertiary butanol t buoh to quench oh radical 20 μm o3 was dosed yielding molar ratios of phenol to o3 of 0 2 1 5 and the residual o3 was quenched by indigo after defined timepoints 200 600 ms determined by kinetic modeling using kintecus for details see section s3 in contrast to clo2 oxidative titrations the applied oxidant dose was constant in o3 oxidative titrations therefore data transformation was necessary to obtain a similar data visualization as with the clo2 oxidative titration section s3 2 3 electron donating capacities of model compounds and dom the electron donating capacities edcs of model compounds and dom were analyzed before and after molecular tagging section 2 1 2 using a method described in walpen et al 2020 in brief an abts containing reagent solution was prepared by combining a 1 mm chlorine solution with a 1 mm abts solution at ph 2 0 which led to the oxidation of abts to abts an aliquot of a sample containing a model compound concentration range between 1 50 μm or dom solution 0 5 7 4 mgc l 1 was added to a phosphate buffer solution final concentration 25 mm in a disposable cuvette an aliquot of the abts solution final concentration of around 85 μm was added and the combined solutions were mixed with a polystyrene stirring spatula after exactly 15 min reaction time the absorbance was measured at 728 nm depending on the experiment the edc was determined by two different approaches 1 the edc was obtained from replicates with increasing concentrations of either model compound or dom by linear regression models fitted to the measured residual abts concentration versus the corresponding concentration the absolute values for the slopes of these model fits represent the edc values walpen et al 2020 2 the edc was obtained from duplicate measurements as edc a 728 a 728 blank ε 728 abts c 0 where ε 728 abts 14 000 m 1cm 1 is the molar extinction coefficient of abts at 728 nm walpen et al 2016 c 0 is the initial concentration of the model compound or dom sample and a 728 blank is the abts solution absorbance of a blank sample interferences to the edc in wastewater samples were negligible compared to the contribution of the dom walpen et al 2020 cosolvents or salts did not significantly impact the edc measurements table s4 2 4 analytical methods residual clo2 was quenched using indigo trisulfonate 50 μm final concentration and quantified using the apparent molar absorption coefficient 9955 m 1cm 1 determined in terhalle et al 2018 chlorine assay intrinsically formed chlorine was selectively quenched by glycine resulting in the formation of n chloroglycine abdighahroudi et al 2020 armesto et al 1993 terhalle et al 2018 n chloroglycine hereafter noted as fac was determined photometrically in presence of a large excess of i 0 1 m at ph 7 0 and thereby producing i 3 in a 1 1 reaction which can be quantified by its absorption at 352 nm with a molar absorption coefficient of 26 000 m 1cm 1 bichsel and von gunten 1999 section s6 the measurement range was 0 10 μm with limits of detection lod and quantification loq of 0 2 and 0 7 μm n chloroglycine respectively fac concentrations were matrix corrected figure s7a and table s5 and always analysed directly after the oxidation 5 min to avoid significant losses over time figure s7b ion chromatography a dionex ionpac as19 4 μm capillary column with an oh gradient was used for separation chlorite and chlorate were detected by conductivity measurement all samples were diluted 5 10 times prior to measurement to be in the measurement range of 0 1 2 μm lod and loq were 0 05 and 0 16 μm for chlorite and chlorate in the diluted sample the matrix effect of buffered dom solutions for chlorite and chlorate was negligible if diluted cooled and stabilized by ethylendiamine within 30 min table s5 and analysed within 24 h uv measurements the absorption spectra of all samples were measured with a spectrophotometer cary 100 varian usa using i a 20 mm quartz cuvette hellma germany for indigo measurements ii a 10 mm quartz cuvette hellma germany for uv visible measurements in the range of 200 500 nm and iii disposable semi micro cuvettes pmma brand germany for edc and fac measurements at 728 nm and 352 nm respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxidative titration with clo2 to quantify phenolic moieties 3 1 1 validation of oxidative titration of phenols with clo2 the novel oxidative titration approach was validated using phenol as analyte and clo2 as titrant fig 3 a shows the residual concentration of clo2 during an oxidative titration of phenol blue circles and phenyl acetate tagged phenol tag phenol purple triangles with clo2 at ph 6 0 in the presence of triethylamine and glycine for a 10 μm phenol solution the absence of residual clo2 for doses 20 μm agrees with the suggested reaction stoichiometry of 2 fig 3a for clo2 doses 20 μm residual clo2 increases proportionally to the dose 1 1 which demonstrates that there is no interference from the matrix 5 μm triethylamine 100 μm glycine and phosphate buffer at 10 mm these results can be explained by the mechanism for the reaction between clo2 and phenol shown in eqs 1 2 rougé et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 wajon et al 1982 phenols react with clo2 by a two step mechanism where in a first step phenolate and clo2 react by a 1 electron transfer to a phenoxyl radical and clo 2 eq 1 as a consequence coupling reactions between the phenoxyl radicals may happen in a second step a phenoxyl oclo adduct is formed followed by a rapid decay to quinone and hocl eq 2 on average two moles of clo2 per mole of phenol are consumed rougé et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 wajon et al 1982 1 2 as a negative control tagged phenol was also subject to oxidative titration fig 3a the molecular tagging of phenol leads to the unreactive phenyl acetate validation of molecular tagging is described in section s2 which does not consume clo2 to a significant extent in the same experimental set up purple triangles in fig 3a overall the novel oxidative titration is successful in quantifying phenols in a defined phenol solution and can be tested for a more complex matrix besides the indication by the residual oxidant further indicators support this approach fig 3b illustrates the simultaneous changes in uv absorbance at 254 nm and decrease in edc first the increase in uv absorbance at 254 nm agrees well with the formation of benzoquinone λ max 247 nm εbenzoquinone 19 045 m 1cm 1 vs εphenol 200 m 1cm 1 önnby et al 2018a the major product of phenol oxidation by clo2 yield 84 2 figure s8 second the edc decreases in parallel to the clo2 addition which is expected because phenols are major contributors to the edc aeschbacher et al 2012 önnby et al 2018a residual edc of about 30 40 may result from coupling products which can be formed from the self reactions of phenoxyl radicals eq 1 hotta et al 2001 finally fig 3c shows the formation of inorganic clo2 byproducts chlorite and fac during the oxidative titration of phenol with clo2 chlorite and fac account for 50 0 01 and 45 0 03 of the consumed clo2 respectively fig 3c and remain stable after phenols are depleted this finding agrees well with the known reaction mechanisms and reported yields hupperich et al 2020 rougé et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 3 1 2 application of oxidative titration with clo2 to phenolic moieties in dom solutions after successful validation of oxidative titration with phenol the approach is applied to complex matrices such as dom fig 3d illustrates the residual clo2 concentration for increasing clo2 doses during the oxidative titration of the dom isolate srfa the reaction times were chosen to fit with the reaction kinetics of phenolic model compounds section s1 blue circles and purple triangles represent the measured clo2 residual after a predetermined reaction time for untreated srfa and for tagged srfa tag srfa respectively assuming a stoichiometry of 2 clo2 per phenol eqs 1 2 a phenol concentration of 8 52 0 60 μm for the 3 mgc l 1 srfa solution is obtained corresponding to 2 84 0 20 mmol phenol gc which is in line to previous estimations of the phenol content in srfa 2 86 0 71 mmol phenol gc aeschbacher et al 2012 ihss 2020 önnby et al 2018a walpen et al 2016 consequently oxidative titration can also be applied to more complex matrices evidence from other measured endpoints discussed below support this finding fig 3e illustrates the decrease in edc and uv254 over the course of the oxidative titration in parallel with the decrease in edc which is comparable to the model phenol fig 3b a decrease at an absorbance of 254 nm was observed fig 3e the decrease in uv254 is opposite to the model compound phenol which is caused by the loss of various uv light absorbing moieties önnby et al 2018a the smaller relative decrease in uv compared to edc is consistent with previous observations of dom oxidized by a variety of oxidants önnby et al 2018b rougé et al 2020a wenk et al 2013 similarly to phenol also inorganic byproducts are formed but with different patterns for details see section 3 1 4 the corresponding results are shown for the dom isolates umrnom srha and efom in figures s10 s12 phenol concentrations were determined by oxidative titration with clo2 for five dom isolates and two wastewater effluent samples werdhölzli and neugut table s3 fig 4 a shows the phenol concentrations in mmol phenol gc plotted against the measured edc table s6 two phenol concentrations were obtained for srha two different batches of this isolate the determined phenol concentrations mmol phenol gc decrease in the order of srha a 3 72 0 46 and b 4 13 0 43 srfa 2 84 0 20 srnom 2 47 0 21 efom 1 69 0 19 umrnom 1 64 0 08 the secondary wastewater effluent samples from the wwtps neugut and werdhölzli lie between the srnom and efom isolates with phenol concentrations of 2 17 0 20 and 2 00 0 20 mmol phenol gc respectively and fit in the relationship r2 0 990 furthermore edc values agreed well within 3 10 with previously published values for srha a srnom umrnom and werdhölzli table s6 walpen et al 2020 2018 for efom and neugut wastewater effluent an edc of 2 60 0 05 and 3 63 0 47 mmole gc was obtained respectively table s6 for the second batch of srha b edc values obtained in this study were more than 10 lower compared to previously published values 6 46 0 79 vs 7 27 mole mol walpen et al 2018 conceivably due to errors 10 deviation is common in doc measurements that were conducted independent from the other isolates consequently this leads to an uncertainty of 10 15 in the determined edc values if the edc of srha b is omitted a slope of 2 10 0 24 with a y intercept of 0 96 0 60 is obtained the slope in this study 2 10 0 24 is different from the slopes obtained from acid base titrated phenols in ihss nom samples 1 5 aeschbacher et al 2012 or 2 37 walpen et al 2018 which may be attributed to the inclusion of other dom isolates but mostly to uncertainties from the determination of the phenol content by acid base titration previously some dom isolates e g umrnom or srnom were excluded from the relationship between edc and phenolic content because they were outliers aeschbacher et al 2010 walpen et al 2016 in the present study all dom isolates and two secondary wastewater effluent samples could be included in the relationship reinforcing the advantage of this novel quantification method in terms of accuracy of the results compared to previous attempts of phenol quantification these results demonstrate that oxidative titration with clo2 is a robust method to determine oxidant reactive phenolic moieties in dom even when applied to dom in real wastewater samples further evidence for the validity of this approach is provided by the fact that residual clo2 concentrations increased with a slope of about 1 for all tested isolates indicating that the contribution of slower reacting groups is negligible and overall two equivalents of clo2 are consumed per mol phenol in the future oxidative titrations could be refined to selectively determine ortho and para dihydroxybenzenes and other fast reacting phenols table s1 by decreasing the reaction times hoigné and bader 1994 3 1 3 application of oxidative titration with clo2 to tagged phenolic moieties in dom solutions molecular tagging was applied to transform phenolic moieties to the corresponding phenylacetates a comparison between tagged and non tagged solutions provides further evidence of the fate of phenols during oxidative titration molecularly tagged phenol followed the expected loss of reactivity during titration by clo2 purple triangles in fig 3a but only a partial loss of phenols was observed for molecularly tagged dom purple triangles in fig 3e this observation is unexpected assuming that the applied tagging procedure would block all phenolic moieties for oxidation therefore it is hypothesized that the molecular tagging is incomplete for certain phenolic compounds section 3 3 2 or other moieties with similar reactivities could be responsible for this observation as depicted in fig 1 some other compounds react in a similar kinetic range as phenols in particular olefins for the oxidant o3 and β diketones for clo2 and o3 even though both groups are of minor importance compared to phenols arnold et al 2008 von gunten 2018 dimedone and acetylacetone lead to a similar clo2 residual during an oxidative titration which is optimized for phenol figure s9 and consequently they may contribute to the quantified phenol concentrations therefore β diketones are discussed along phenols in terms of the formation of clo2 induced inorganic byproducts section 3 1 4 and the edc section 3 3 3 1 4 formation of inorganic byproducts during oxidative titration with clo2 to better understand the characeristics of the quantified phenolic moieties in dom during oxidative titration the clo2 induced byproducts were 1 related to the concentration of phenolic moieties and 2 assessed for a complete chlorine mass balance phenol fig 3c and 4c show the two main products chlorite 50 0 01 and fac 45 0 03 from the oxidation of phenol by clo2 as expected the products remain constant after phenol is completely depleted clo2 concentration 20 μm overall these results are well aligned with previous studies and the known reaction mechanism hupperich et al 2020 rougé et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 wajon et al 1982 phenolic moieties in dom solutions fig 3f shows the formation of the inorganic byproducts chlorite chlorate and fac as a function of the clo2 dose for srfa similar to chlorite and fac formation for phenol there is an increase in product formation chlorite fac and chlorate with a plateau for clo2 doses larger than the concentration of the oxidant reactive moieties 17 04 µm for a 3 mgc l 1 srfa solution the corresponding trend is also observed for the dom isolates umrnom srha and efom figures s10 s12 consequently the pattern for the increase in clo2 byproducts is the same for phenol and dom solutions however the clo2 induced byproduct distribution from the dom isolates differ from phenol clo2 induced byproduct yields for phenol and average dom solutions are shown in fig 4c and for the individual dom isolates in figure s13 the chlorine mass balance for phenol is almost complete 95 and the individual dom isolates show chlorine mass balances ranging between 82 101 the product distribution for the clo2 dose with complete phenol depletion is in a similar range for all isolates i e 63 7 0 04 for chlorite 9 4 0 01 for chlorate and 18 0 0 05 for fac chloride and adsorbable organic chlorine aocl were not quantified in this study for the dom because they seem to be minor gan et al 2019 but could explain the gap to 100 the overall observed product distribution aligns with previous measurements for srnom hupperich et al 2020 rougé et al 2018 figure s14 in general chlorate yields were slightly higher compared to previous studies which could be attributed to the lower ph used in the current study ph 6 0 vs 7 0 and 8 1 in the previous studies compared to phenol dom isolates usually have higher yields of chlorite lower yields of fac and yield chlorate which is not formed from the clo2 phenol reaction higher yields of chlorite can be explained by the contribution of dihydroxybenzenes in ortho and para positions hydroquinone or catechol like as they form up to 90 chlorite and are expected in dom gan et al 2019 the yield of fac depends on the possible formation of an unstable phenoxyl radical which reacts further with clo2 releasing fac wajon et al 1982 hydroxybenzenes might be substituted at different positions in the ring varying the formation of a phenoxyl radical amenable to clo2 oxidation besides hydroquinone or catechols an example of a phenol without fac formation and slight chlorate formation is vanillin chlorite 50 chloride 35 chlorate 5 hupperich et al 2020 which has a substituent in ortho and para position potentially influencing the reaction mechanism vanillin like structures with such substituent patterns are likely present in dom among other hydroxylated aromatic structures as has been shown by jiang et al 2020 and could lead to the overall lower fac formation that was observed in dom oxidation compared to phenol chlorate formation which was observed in dom solutions in contrast to phenol can be explained by two potential mechanisms vanillin type and other structures might contribute to chlorate formation as exemplified by yields up to 60 for model compounds gan et al 2019 structures such as resorcinol or β diketones may contribute as well in contrast to phenol they form chlorate in addition to chlorite and only small amounts of fac with mass balances that additionally contain chloride and aocl pointing towards the presence of other reactive species which lead to direct chlorination during clo2 oxidation hocl was quenched by glycine section s11 and figure s15 alternatively chlorate may be formed by disproportionation reactions from clo2 or clo2 the dom matrix may contain complexes with transition metals that favor such disproportionation reactions gordon et al 1995 liu et al 2012 the selected doms are very similar in the relative clo2 byproduct distribution fig 4c but differ in the absolute yields the inorganic byproduct formation for several dom isolates is shown in fig 4b as a function of the quantified phenol concentration by oxidative titration all three inorganic byproducts are correlated to the clo2 derived phenol concentration chlorite r2 0 962 chlorate r2 0 849 and fac r2 0 955 a previous study also obtained a correlation r2 0 77 between chlorite formed after 5 min clo2 oxidation doc 2 mgc l 1 clo2 0 06 mm ph 7 0 gan et al 2019 and the phenol content ihss 2020 in the present study the optimized times for the reaction between dom isolates and clo2 for chlorite quantification and the determined phenol content improved this correlation significantly a previous study also compared the molar yields of clo2 byproducts e g fac relative to the phenol concentration rougé et al 2018 rougé et al 2018 observed the molar yields of fac per mol phenol were 1 for the isolate srnom in this study a much lower molar yield of fac relative to the phenol concentration of about 38 13 was observed among the dom isolates however in oxidative titration experiments the reaction was stopped after phenol depletion and thus the lower measured fac is directly linked to reactions of phenol with clo2 and further formation of fac would come from other slower reacting moieties in dom in line with previous interpretations in contrast to the previous study gan et al 2019 also a relationship between edc and the inorganic byproducts chlorite chlorate and fac is observed here chlorite r2 0 973 chlorate r2 0 819 and fac r2 0 932 figure s16 this difference can be explained by the different methods used to quantify the antioxidant capacity folin ciocalteu as used in gan et al 2020 vs edc by abts as used in the present study highlighting the advantages of the abts assay the good correlation between edc and inorganic byproducts is a further evidence for the suitability of edc as surrogate parameter in water and wastewater treatment processes walpen et al 2021 3 2 oxidative titrations with o3 3 2 1 oxidative titration of phenol a similar approach for an oxidative titration was also tested using o3 as the oxidant instead of clo2 fig 5 a shows the calculated residual ozone concentration observed during oxidative titration of phenol with o3 as a function of the calculated ozone dose at ph 7 0 information about data transformation to retrieve the calculated o3 residual concentrations and doses are provided in section s3 during the oxidative titration experiments for reaction times leading to a 99 abatement of phenol 200 600 ms a stoichiometry of 2 2 5 is expected ramseier and von gunten 2009 however considering the complex mechanism of the ozone phenol reactions the stoichiometry is not trivial as many products are formed such as hydroquinones benzoquinones catechols organic acids aldehydes and ketones which in some cases show similar reactivities with o3 as phenol mvula and von sonntag 2003 ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 the x intercept of 23 3 1 59 μm for a phenol solution of 10 μm leads to an apparent stoichiometry of 2 31 0 16 which is in the expected range for phenol furthermore a slope of 1 01 0 04 indicates that no significant side reactions occur overall the data in fig 5a represent a proof of concept for oxidative titrations of phenol with o3 3 2 2 oxidative titrations of phenolic moieties in dom solutions oxidative titrations with o3 were also performed with various dom isolates during ozonation of dom olefinic and β diketone moieties are expected to react with similar kinetics as phenols fig 1 a large number of second order rate constants for the reactions of olefins with o3 is available von sonntag and von gunten 2012 whereas for β diketones no information exists therefore the apparent second order rate constant for the reaction of acetylacetone was determined in this study as k app ph 7 5 11 0 58 105 m 1 s 1 section s12 with the knowledge from quantified phenolic moieties from oxidative titration with clo2 we can estimate the concentrations of such structures fig 5b shows the increase of residual o3 after the phenolic structures in dom are oxidized slopes are between 1 05 and 1 11 indicating no considerable side reactions with olefins or β diketones the reaction stoichiometry lies between 1 90 0 21 and 2 11 0 16 mol o3 per mol phenol which is comparable to pure phenol solutions stoichiometry of 2 31 0 16 these results are slightly lower compared to phenol but indicate no substantial concentrations of other electron rich moieties than phenols in principle olefins could contribute to the obtained lower stoichiometries as they usually only consume one mol o3 per mol olefin however the current data do not allow for a quantitative estimate and further research is warranted overall these results corroborate the applicability of oxidative titration as a quantitative method also for other oxidants 3 3 model dom compounds and their electron donating potential from the oxidative titration experiments of dom solutions with clo2 it can be concluded that other moieties than phenols may contribute because i clo2 induced byproduct distributions differ between phenol and dom fig 4c ii moieties such as β diketones or olefins have similar reaction kinetics with the applied oxidants fig 1a and c and iii oxidative titration with clo2 for tagged dom did not reveal the expected residual oxidant pattern fig 3d to further elucidate these aspects both oxidative titration and molecular tagging were related to changes in the edc consequently the edc was measured for dom model compounds without and with tagging to further evaluate the observed results validation of molecular tagging is described in section s2 3 3 1 edc of electron rich dom model compounds and dom the edc of dom has been discussed previously aeschbacher et al 2012 2011 but has not been measured for a large selection of model compounds thus a range of electron rich model compounds was tested for their electron donating capacity including phenols n 13 β diketones n 6 amines n 3 olefins n 2 and activated benzenes e g anisole n 3 figs 6 a and s18 19 and table s1 at ph 7 0 and ph 9 0 for amines data not shown all of the phenolic model compounds showed electron donating capacities edc values between 2 and 11 mole mol fig 6a except 4 hydroxyacetophenone edc value of 0 2 0 01 mole mol which has a high reduction potential of 0 94 v at ph 7 0 li and hoffman 1999 for trolox an edc of 2 mole mol was determined previously walpen et al 2016 which agrees well with the value obtained in this study 1 94 0 04 mole mol n 4 previous studies also reported the edc of resorcinol 3 3 mole mol wang et al 2020 and 4 6 mole mol de vera et al 2017 vs 5 73 0 31 mole mol n 5 present study phenol 2 7 mole mol wang et al 2020 vs 2 19 0 06 mole mol n 3 present study and hydroquinone 1 2 wang et al 2020 vs 1 95 0 23 mole mol n 3 present study both previous studies used mediated electrochemical oxidation meo for quantification which could be responsible for these differences de vera et al 2017 wang et al 2020 the general trend in edc of our study hydroquinone phenol resorcinol is comparable to previous studies wang et al 2020 however hydroquinone should be able to transfer exactly 2 mole mol to obtain benzoquinone which is not reflected in the value determined in the previous study wang et al 2020 besides phenols and β diketones no other model compounds showed electron donating character under the applied conditions ph 7 0 eh 0 71 v fig 6a in contrast to phenols the edc of β diketones has not been discussed in the context of dom in the past however their antioxidant character has been noticed previously pandhair and sekhon 2006 and very low eh values are reported acetylacetone 1 097 v at ph 2 0 chen et al 2017 edc values are usually obtained using an operationally defined reaction time i e 15 min between abts and the dom solution because of lack of an obvious end point walpen et al 2020 2016 considering the kinetics of the reactions between model compounds and abts at 728 nm the contribution of different compound classes to the edc can potentially be differentiated such measurements revealed different kinetics for the different model compounds figure s20a and can be grouped in 3 categories i high reaction rates for phenol 2 4 6 trimethylphenol 2 4 6 tmp and trolox ii moderate reaction rates for acetylacetone and dimedone and iii low reaction rates for 4 hydroxyacetophenone as noted previously reactivity of dom solutions could be categorized in two phases figure s20b with a first fast reacting phase followed by a moderately reacting phase reflecting the variety of edc contributing moieties finally the edc of dom solutions was also related to their phenol concentration designated by the white diamonds in fig 6a and lies between 1 2 mole molphenol 3 3 2 influence of molecular tagging on the edc only phenols β diketones and dom samples were subjected to molecular tagging fig 6b shows the effect of molecular tagging for selected model compounds on the edc fig 6c shows a compilation of the relative edc ratio of edc after tagging and before tagging for various model compounds and doms 10 phenols 5 β diketones and 3 dom sources for the majority of phenols the edc is completely lost after molecular tagging simple phenols such as phenol or hydroquinone but some bulky phenols butylhydroxytoluol or 2 4 6 trimethyl phenol remain partially redox active and contribute to the edc this reduced tagging efficiency may be a consequence of steric hindrance for the tagging reagent meanwhile for the majority of β diketones the edc is not affected by molecular tagging fig 6c and s18 application of molecular tagging to dom showed an overall loss in edc of 48 58 in dom isolates figs 6c and s19 among the phenolic compounds studied certain substituents may reduce the efficiency of tagging and thus application of this method to dom can lead to residual concentrations of phenols which still react with oxidants and or contribute to edc as discussed in the previous sections β diketones are another compound class which can contribute to the edc but in contrast to phenols their redox reactivity is not affected by molecular tagging hence these moieties can still contribute to the edc of tagged dom and may lead to an overestimation of phenols as stated in the section above β diketones cannot be neglected during oxidative titration because i they show comparable reaction kinetics and stoichiometry with clo2 as phenols fig 1 and ii their presence cannot be excluded due to their contribution to the edc overall the partial tagging of phenol and thus the quantification of oxidant reactive moieties in the tagged srfa solution fig 3d may be explained by the contribution of sterically hindered phenolic moieties which are not tagged and or the presence of β diketone like structures nevertheless molecular tagging of phenols provided useful additional information on the oxidant reactive moieties found in dom 4 conclusion phenolic structures are among other electron rich moieties major components in dom and responsible for a significant consumption of oxidants during oxidation processes a novel approach was developed to quantify oxidant reactive moieties in complex mixtures such as dom based on their selective reactivity with oxidants in this study we i quantified phenolic moieties with chlorine dioxide clo2 and ozone o3 by a novel oxidative titration ii evaluated the clo2 reacted samples in terms of the electron donating capacity edc uv absorption and inorganic clo2 byproducts and iii evaluated changes due to a novel molecular tagging for phenols in oxidative titration experiments and with edc measurements the main findings of this study are the concentrations of phenolic moieties in five nom isolates and two wastewater effluent samples were quantified by oxidative titration with clo2 and a relationship to the electron donating capacity edc and inorganic clo2 byproducts was obtained the quantified phenol concentrations by clo2 were confirmed in oxidative titrations with o3 exemplifying the applicability of the novel method for various oxidants differences between phenol and dom isolates for clo2 byproduct yields and changes due to a novel molecular tagging for phenols revealed a better understanding of reactive structures within dom the edc was determined for a wide selection of 27 model compounds comprising phenols activated aromatic compounds olefins and β diketones edc values 11 mole mol were measured showing a significant variability for different potential dom moieties additionally measurements of edc after molecular tagging of phenols to phenylacetates revealed the

16492,the application of oxidants for disinfection or micropollutant abatement during drinking water and wastewater treatment is accompanied by oxidation of matrix components such as dissolved organic matter dom to improve predictions of the efficiency of oxidation processes and the formation of oxidation products methods to determine concentrations of oxidant reactive phenolic olefinic or amine type dom moieties are critical here a novel selective oxidative titration approach is presented which is based on reaction kinetics of oxidation reactions towards certain dom moieties phenolic moieties were determined by oxidative titration with clo2 and o3 for five dom isolates and two secondary wastewater effluent samples the determined concentrations of phenolic moieties correlated with the electron donating capacity edc and the formation of inorganic clo2 byproducts hocl clo2 clo3 clo2 byproduct yields from phenol and dom isolates and changes due to the application of molecular tagging for phenols revealed a better understanding of oxidant reactive structures within dom overall oxidative titrations with clo2 and o3 provide a novel and promising tool to quantify oxidant reactive moieties in complex mixtures such as dom and can be expanded to other matrices or oxidants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter oxidative titration chlorine dioxide ozone electron donating capacity molecular tagging electron rich moieties phenols oxidation byproducts 1 introduction chemical oxidants such as ozone chlorine and chlorine dioxide are applied in water treatment to improve the microbial and chemical water quality von gunten 2018 during oxidative water and wastewater treatment dissolved organic matter dom reacts with chemical oxidants thereby dom oxidant interactions not only decrease the efficiency of oxidation processes but also contribute to the formation of potentially toxic oxidation byproducts obps li and mitch 2018 liu et al 2020 sedlak and von gunten 2011 von gunten 2003a these problems may be aggravated when applying such processes for micropollutant abatement during enhanced wastewater treatment or water reuse because of higher concentrations and different types of dom von gunten 2018 the complexity and heterogeneity of dom complicate the prediction of the extent of oxidant consumption and consequently their exposure determining parameter for oxidation and disinfection efficiency von gunten 2003a 2003b and also the formation of obps to improve the prediction of the efficiency of oxidation processes and the formation of obps methods to quantify oxidant reactive dom moieties are needed in previous studies semi quantitative methods have been applied including surrogate parameters such as the specific uv absorption at 254 nm e g suva254 which has been used to estimate the formation of obps during chlorination korshin et al 1997 and the abatement of micropollutants or disinfection efficiency during ozonation bahr et al 2007 buffle et al 2006 wert et al 2009 wittmer et al 2015 in recent years measurements of the electron donating capacity edc have been used to assess relative changes of the antioxidant properties of dom in response to reactions with chemical oxidants önnby et al 2018a remucal et al 2020 walpen et al 2020 wenk et al 2013 typically the edc was used as a measure for the phenolic content of dom aeschbacher et al 2012 walpen et al 2016 in combination with uv measurements edc is a useful parameter to assess relative changes in the content of reactive dom moieties and formation of obps from the reactions with various oxidants such as chlorine dioxide chlorine or ozone önnby et al 2018a wenk et al 2013 relative changes in edc during ozonation have also been applied as a proxy for micropollutant abatement during enhanced wastewater treatment chon et al 2015 remucal et al 2020 walpen et al 2021 2020 and changes due to pre oxidation by a variety of oxidants rougé et al 2020b 2020a furthermore high resolution mass spectrometry hrms has been applied to investigate molecular level changes induced by oxidation of dom jiang et al 2020 liu et al 2020 maizel and remucal 2017 remucal et al 2020 these and reemtsma 2005 in this study contrasting to the semiquantitative methods described above we propose oxidative titration as a novel quantitative method to assess dom oxidant interactions the oxidative titration is based on the selectivity of oxidants towards certain moieties past studies have shown that oxidants such as ozone chlorine dioxide or chlorine are selective towards different moieties in model compounds and micropollutants lee and von gunten 2010 which may also depend on the ph due to the speciation of the oxidant and or reactive moiety this selectivity is illustrated by the apparent second order rate constants for various oxidants and moieties in model compounds which have been determined previously fig 1 at ph 7 0 deborde and von gunten 2008 gan et al 2020 hoigné and bader 1994 1983 lee and von gunten 2012 li et al 2020 lim et al 2019 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 ozone reacts mainly with olefins and activated aromatic systems with second order rate constants which span over a range of 10 orders of magnitude von gunten 2003a von sonntag and von gunten 2012 fig 1a the reactions between ozone and β diketones have not been studied to date even though they are also potential precursors of disinfection byproducts arnold et al 2008 jiang et al 2020 zeng and arnold 2014 the apparent second order rate constant for the reaction of acetylacetone with ozone at ph 7 0 determined in this study is shown in fig 1a and figure s17 and also in results and discussion section 3 2 2 chlorine mainly reacts with amine moieties fig 1b but also β diketones deborde and von gunten 2008 lee and von gunten 2010 chlorine dioxide is a very selective oxidant fig 1c and has the highest second order rate constants for the reactions with phenols gan et al 2020 hoigné and bader 1994 for β diketones only one second order rate constant for dimedone was previously determined which is comparable to phenols at circumneutral ph k 2 1 0 4 m 1 s 1 hoigné and bader 1994 dom is a complex assembly of subunits containing electron withdrawing and donating substituents with a wide range of oxidant reactive moieties including phenols β diketones amines and olefins consequently the selectivity of oxidants towards dom moieties should be reflected in distinct kinetic behavior for different oxidant reactive moieties in dom fig 1 with the novel concept of oxidative titration proposed in this study a specific group of oxidant reactive moieties in dom can be quantified by a selected oxidant as titrant in a time controlled reaction with increasing oxidant doses instead of determining the endpoint with an indicator a residual oxidant is measured after the targeted oxidant reactive moiety is depleted in addition to oxidative titration molecular tagging approaches can be used to reduce the complexity of mixtures or selectively modify them york and bell 2020 dom moieties responsible for the high reactivity with an oxidant can be blocked by molecular tagging to better understand and quantify the oxidant reactive moieties by comparison of titration results before and after modification the objective of this study was to develop and validate oxidative titration as a method to quantify phenolic moieties in dom they were chosen as analytes with clo2 as titrant because they represent the major fraction of oxidant reactive moieties in dom von gunten 2018 oxidative titrations with clo2 and o3 from a model system and dom were combined with a molecular tagging method for phenols which allowed to assess the importance of other carbonous moieties including olefins and β diketones in dom the results were related to changes in uv absorbance and edc as well as the formation of inorganic byproducts from clo2 reactions moreover edc measurements from non tagged and tagged dom model compounds helped to evaluate the results in a companion study a similar approach with chlorine and ozone was applied to quantify organic nitrogen containing dom moieties essaïed et al 2021 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and solutions a list of the chemicals used in this study with information on their purity and suppliers dom isolates and sample collection of wastewater and generation of oxidant stock solutions are provided in section s1 all aqueous solutions were prepared in ultrapurified water with a resistivity of 18 2 mω cm arium pro ultrapure water systems sartorius ag goettingen germany 2 1 1 selection of dom model compounds twenty seven model compounds that are representative for dom electron rich moieties fig 2 were chosen based on their i chemical properties and ii reactivity with the oxidants clo2 and o3 the first category of compounds are phenols i e aromatic compounds with mono and polyhydroxy moieties fig 2 1 13 this category is further divided into the sub categories simple and bulky phenols depending on the degree of steric hindrance the second category are aliphatic and aromatic β diketones fig 2 14 19 and the third category includes other activated aromatic compounds fig 2 20 22 olefins fig 2 23 24 and a primary secondary and tertiary amine fig 2 25 27 phenol was used as a simple model compound in oxidative titration described in section 2 2 and edc experiments described in section 2 3 while all the other model compounds were only used in edc experiments section 2 3 chemical names pk a values and k app clo2 at ph 6 0 if available and measured edcs are listed in table s1 2 1 2 preparation of tagged phenols and dom solutions a molecular tagging approach was selected to convert phenolic moieties to phenylacetates section s2 acetic anhydride and nahco3 were added to a phenolic model compound or a dom sample dissolved in acetonitrile lugemwa et al 2013 the mix was stirred overnight under n2 to avoid oxygenation of phenolic dom moieties due to the higher ph caused by nahco3 after this procedure the samples were evaporated under a constant n2 stream and re dissolved in 50 ml acidified ultrapurified water to achieve a ph around 6 and used within one day untagged controls were prepared in the same fashion in absence of acetic anhydride the apparent tagging efficiency for phenol was confirmed using hplc fluorescence detection fld with authentic standards to determine the identity of tagged products additional measurements by lc hrms section s2 were performed for selected model compounds example in figure s1 finally the edc demonstrated to be a successful indicator for tagging efficiency figure s2 and section s2 in the case of dom an untagged sample underwent the same procedure and its edc was compared to a standard dom solution without any treatment to account for changes in dom due to the procedure example in figure s3a 2 2 oxidative titration experiments 2 2 1 general procedure of an oxidative titration experiment the procedure for an oxidative titration experiment is illustrated in scheme 1 the oxidative titration experiments with clo2 are based on the assumption that the residual oxidant concentration will increase when phenolic moieties are depleted the consumed oxidant is a measure for the concentration of reacted phenolic moieties based on the known reaction stoichiometry oxidative titrations with the model compound phenol were performed to test the feasibility of this approach representing a simple model system and was then applied to the more complex dom solutions kinetic modeling the reaction times which depend on the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions between phenol and the oxidants clo2 and o3 were obtained by kinetic modeling using kintecus ianni 2003 for details see section s3 oxidative titration solutions with varying ratios of oxidant to phenol or dom were reacted for a predetermined duration at defined timepoints after adding the oxidant an aliquot of the titrated solution was quenched by indigo to quantify the residual oxidant terhalle et al 2018 or purged by n2 for further analyses other endpoints quantification phenol concentrations were obtained by analyzing the slope and x intercept from direct residual oxidant clo2 or transformed residual oxidant o3 for details see section s3 2 2 2 oxidative titration with clo2 oxidative titration experiments with clo2 were performed in solutions containing phenol 10 μm triethylamine 5 μm or dom 3 mgc l 1 glycine 100 μm was added to quench intrinsically formed free available chlorine fac rougé et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 phosphate buffer 10 mm was added to obtain a ph of 6 0 0 05 the oxidant dose was increased from 0 to 40 μm clo2 and added to batch reactors yielding molar ratios of clo2 to phenol of 0 2 1 5 the two compounds phenol and triethylamine were chosen because of their differing apparent second order rate constants for the reaction with clo2 at ph 6 0 phenol 6 103 m 1s 1 triethylamine 10 m 1s 1 fig 1 under these conditions triethylamine does not consume clo2 and thus for the defined reaction times should not consume any of the increasing clo2 residual after depletion of phenols deactivated benzenes are expected to have a very low apparent second order rate constant with clo2 e g phenyl acetate 10 5 m 1s 1 lee and von gunten 2012 thus a tagged phenol served as negative control for the oxidative titration the molecular tagging of phenols and phenolic moieties in dom is described in section 2 1 2 residual clo2 was quenched by indigo terhalle et al 2018 after defined reaction times between 1 and 8 min for details see figure s4 and section s3 to measure the formed inorganic byproducts fac clo2 clo3 and changes in edc and uv due to oxidation clo2 was purged by n2 with a teflon frit for 60 120 s residual clo2 was completely purged within 10 30 s figure s6 the applied methods are described in sections 2 3 and 2 4 2 2 3 oxidative titration with ozone oxidative titration with o3 was performed similarly because of faster reactions between o3 and phenol a quench flow set up biologic sfm 400 q was applied criquet et al 2015 for practical reasons the phenol concentration was varied and the ozone dose remained constant oxidative titration experiments were performed at ph 7 0 0 05 in 10 mm phosphate buffer in solutions containing 10 μm phenol or 3 mgc l 1 dom solutions and in presence of 2 mm tertiary butanol t buoh to quench oh radical 20 μm o3 was dosed yielding molar ratios of phenol to o3 of 0 2 1 5 and the residual o3 was quenched by indigo after defined timepoints 200 600 ms determined by kinetic modeling using kintecus for details see section s3 in contrast to clo2 oxidative titrations the applied oxidant dose was constant in o3 oxidative titrations therefore data transformation was necessary to obtain a similar data visualization as with the clo2 oxidative titration section s3 2 3 electron donating capacities of model compounds and dom the electron donating capacities edcs of model compounds and dom were analyzed before and after molecular tagging section 2 1 2 using a method described in walpen et al 2020 in brief an abts containing reagent solution was prepared by combining a 1 mm chlorine solution with a 1 mm abts solution at ph 2 0 which led to the oxidation of abts to abts an aliquot of a sample containing a model compound concentration range between 1 50 μm or dom solution 0 5 7 4 mgc l 1 was added to a phosphate buffer solution final concentration 25 mm in a disposable cuvette an aliquot of the abts solution final concentration of around 85 μm was added and the combined solutions were mixed with a polystyrene stirring spatula after exactly 15 min reaction time the absorbance was measured at 728 nm depending on the experiment the edc was determined by two different approaches 1 the edc was obtained from replicates with increasing concentrations of either model compound or dom by linear regression models fitted to the measured residual abts concentration versus the corresponding concentration the absolute values for the slopes of these model fits represent the edc values walpen et al 2020 2 the edc was obtained from duplicate measurements as edc a 728 a 728 blank ε 728 abts c 0 where ε 728 abts 14 000 m 1cm 1 is the molar extinction coefficient of abts at 728 nm walpen et al 2016 c 0 is the initial concentration of the model compound or dom sample and a 728 blank is the abts solution absorbance of a blank sample interferences to the edc in wastewater samples were negligible compared to the contribution of the dom walpen et al 2020 cosolvents or salts did not significantly impact the edc measurements table s4 2 4 analytical methods residual clo2 was quenched using indigo trisulfonate 50 μm final concentration and quantified using the apparent molar absorption coefficient 9955 m 1cm 1 determined in terhalle et al 2018 chlorine assay intrinsically formed chlorine was selectively quenched by glycine resulting in the formation of n chloroglycine abdighahroudi et al 2020 armesto et al 1993 terhalle et al 2018 n chloroglycine hereafter noted as fac was determined photometrically in presence of a large excess of i 0 1 m at ph 7 0 and thereby producing i 3 in a 1 1 reaction which can be quantified by its absorption at 352 nm with a molar absorption coefficient of 26 000 m 1cm 1 bichsel and von gunten 1999 section s6 the measurement range was 0 10 μm with limits of detection lod and quantification loq of 0 2 and 0 7 μm n chloroglycine respectively fac concentrations were matrix corrected figure s7a and table s5 and always analysed directly after the oxidation 5 min to avoid significant losses over time figure s7b ion chromatography a dionex ionpac as19 4 μm capillary column with an oh gradient was used for separation chlorite and chlorate were detected by conductivity measurement all samples were diluted 5 10 times prior to measurement to be in the measurement range of 0 1 2 μm lod and loq were 0 05 and 0 16 μm for chlorite and chlorate in the diluted sample the matrix effect of buffered dom solutions for chlorite and chlorate was negligible if diluted cooled and stabilized by ethylendiamine within 30 min table s5 and analysed within 24 h uv measurements the absorption spectra of all samples were measured with a spectrophotometer cary 100 varian usa using i a 20 mm quartz cuvette hellma germany for indigo measurements ii a 10 mm quartz cuvette hellma germany for uv visible measurements in the range of 200 500 nm and iii disposable semi micro cuvettes pmma brand germany for edc and fac measurements at 728 nm and 352 nm respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxidative titration with clo2 to quantify phenolic moieties 3 1 1 validation of oxidative titration of phenols with clo2 the novel oxidative titration approach was validated using phenol as analyte and clo2 as titrant fig 3 a shows the residual concentration of clo2 during an oxidative titration of phenol blue circles and phenyl acetate tagged phenol tag phenol purple triangles with clo2 at ph 6 0 in the presence of triethylamine and glycine for a 10 μm phenol solution the absence of residual clo2 for doses 20 μm agrees with the suggested reaction stoichiometry of 2 fig 3a for clo2 doses 20 μm residual clo2 increases proportionally to the dose 1 1 which demonstrates that there is no interference from the matrix 5 μm triethylamine 100 μm glycine and phosphate buffer at 10 mm these results can be explained by the mechanism for the reaction between clo2 and phenol shown in eqs 1 2 rougé et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 wajon et al 1982 phenols react with clo2 by a two step mechanism where in a first step phenolate and clo2 react by a 1 electron transfer to a phenoxyl radical and clo 2 eq 1 as a consequence coupling reactions between the phenoxyl radicals may happen in a second step a phenoxyl oclo adduct is formed followed by a rapid decay to quinone and hocl eq 2 on average two moles of clo2 per mole of phenol are consumed rougé et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 wajon et al 1982 1 2 as a negative control tagged phenol was also subject to oxidative titration fig 3a the molecular tagging of phenol leads to the unreactive phenyl acetate validation of molecular tagging is described in section s2 which does not consume clo2 to a significant extent in the same experimental set up purple triangles in fig 3a overall the novel oxidative titration is successful in quantifying phenols in a defined phenol solution and can be tested for a more complex matrix besides the indication by the residual oxidant further indicators support this approach fig 3b illustrates the simultaneous changes in uv absorbance at 254 nm and decrease in edc first the increase in uv absorbance at 254 nm agrees well with the formation of benzoquinone λ max 247 nm εbenzoquinone 19 045 m 1cm 1 vs εphenol 200 m 1cm 1 önnby et al 2018a the major product of phenol oxidation by clo2 yield 84 2 figure s8 second the edc decreases in parallel to the clo2 addition which is expected because phenols are major contributors to the edc aeschbacher et al 2012 önnby et al 2018a residual edc of about 30 40 may result from coupling products which can be formed from the self reactions of phenoxyl radicals eq 1 hotta et al 2001 finally fig 3c shows the formation of inorganic clo2 byproducts chlorite and fac during the oxidative titration of phenol with clo2 chlorite and fac account for 50 0 01 and 45 0 03 of the consumed clo2 respectively fig 3c and remain stable after phenols are depleted this finding agrees well with the known reaction mechanisms and reported yields hupperich et al 2020 rougé et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 3 1 2 application of oxidative titration with clo2 to phenolic moieties in dom solutions after successful validation of oxidative titration with phenol the approach is applied to complex matrices such as dom fig 3d illustrates the residual clo2 concentration for increasing clo2 doses during the oxidative titration of the dom isolate srfa the reaction times were chosen to fit with the reaction kinetics of phenolic model compounds section s1 blue circles and purple triangles represent the measured clo2 residual after a predetermined reaction time for untreated srfa and for tagged srfa tag srfa respectively assuming a stoichiometry of 2 clo2 per phenol eqs 1 2 a phenol concentration of 8 52 0 60 μm for the 3 mgc l 1 srfa solution is obtained corresponding to 2 84 0 20 mmol phenol gc which is in line to previous estimations of the phenol content in srfa 2 86 0 71 mmol phenol gc aeschbacher et al 2012 ihss 2020 önnby et al 2018a walpen et al 2016 consequently oxidative titration can also be applied to more complex matrices evidence from other measured endpoints discussed below support this finding fig 3e illustrates the decrease in edc and uv254 over the course of the oxidative titration in parallel with the decrease in edc which is comparable to the model phenol fig 3b a decrease at an absorbance of 254 nm was observed fig 3e the decrease in uv254 is opposite to the model compound phenol which is caused by the loss of various uv light absorbing moieties önnby et al 2018a the smaller relative decrease in uv compared to edc is consistent with previous observations of dom oxidized by a variety of oxidants önnby et al 2018b rougé et al 2020a wenk et al 2013 similarly to phenol also inorganic byproducts are formed but with different patterns for details see section 3 1 4 the corresponding results are shown for the dom isolates umrnom srha and efom in figures s10 s12 phenol concentrations were determined by oxidative titration with clo2 for five dom isolates and two wastewater effluent samples werdhölzli and neugut table s3 fig 4 a shows the phenol concentrations in mmol phenol gc plotted against the measured edc table s6 two phenol concentrations were obtained for srha two different batches of this isolate the determined phenol concentrations mmol phenol gc decrease in the order of srha a 3 72 0 46 and b 4 13 0 43 srfa 2 84 0 20 srnom 2 47 0 21 efom 1 69 0 19 umrnom 1 64 0 08 the secondary wastewater effluent samples from the wwtps neugut and werdhölzli lie between the srnom and efom isolates with phenol concentrations of 2 17 0 20 and 2 00 0 20 mmol phenol gc respectively and fit in the relationship r2 0 990 furthermore edc values agreed well within 3 10 with previously published values for srha a srnom umrnom and werdhölzli table s6 walpen et al 2020 2018 for efom and neugut wastewater effluent an edc of 2 60 0 05 and 3 63 0 47 mmole gc was obtained respectively table s6 for the second batch of srha b edc values obtained in this study were more than 10 lower compared to previously published values 6 46 0 79 vs 7 27 mole mol walpen et al 2018 conceivably due to errors 10 deviation is common in doc measurements that were conducted independent from the other isolates consequently this leads to an uncertainty of 10 15 in the determined edc values if the edc of srha b is omitted a slope of 2 10 0 24 with a y intercept of 0 96 0 60 is obtained the slope in this study 2 10 0 24 is different from the slopes obtained from acid base titrated phenols in ihss nom samples 1 5 aeschbacher et al 2012 or 2 37 walpen et al 2018 which may be attributed to the inclusion of other dom isolates but mostly to uncertainties from the determination of the phenol content by acid base titration previously some dom isolates e g umrnom or srnom were excluded from the relationship between edc and phenolic content because they were outliers aeschbacher et al 2010 walpen et al 2016 in the present study all dom isolates and two secondary wastewater effluent samples could be included in the relationship reinforcing the advantage of this novel quantification method in terms of accuracy of the results compared to previous attempts of phenol quantification these results demonstrate that oxidative titration with clo2 is a robust method to determine oxidant reactive phenolic moieties in dom even when applied to dom in real wastewater samples further evidence for the validity of this approach is provided by the fact that residual clo2 concentrations increased with a slope of about 1 for all tested isolates indicating that the contribution of slower reacting groups is negligible and overall two equivalents of clo2 are consumed per mol phenol in the future oxidative titrations could be refined to selectively determine ortho and para dihydroxybenzenes and other fast reacting phenols table s1 by decreasing the reaction times hoigné and bader 1994 3 1 3 application of oxidative titration with clo2 to tagged phenolic moieties in dom solutions molecular tagging was applied to transform phenolic moieties to the corresponding phenylacetates a comparison between tagged and non tagged solutions provides further evidence of the fate of phenols during oxidative titration molecularly tagged phenol followed the expected loss of reactivity during titration by clo2 purple triangles in fig 3a but only a partial loss of phenols was observed for molecularly tagged dom purple triangles in fig 3e this observation is unexpected assuming that the applied tagging procedure would block all phenolic moieties for oxidation therefore it is hypothesized that the molecular tagging is incomplete for certain phenolic compounds section 3 3 2 or other moieties with similar reactivities could be responsible for this observation as depicted in fig 1 some other compounds react in a similar kinetic range as phenols in particular olefins for the oxidant o3 and β diketones for clo2 and o3 even though both groups are of minor importance compared to phenols arnold et al 2008 von gunten 2018 dimedone and acetylacetone lead to a similar clo2 residual during an oxidative titration which is optimized for phenol figure s9 and consequently they may contribute to the quantified phenol concentrations therefore β diketones are discussed along phenols in terms of the formation of clo2 induced inorganic byproducts section 3 1 4 and the edc section 3 3 3 1 4 formation of inorganic byproducts during oxidative titration with clo2 to better understand the characeristics of the quantified phenolic moieties in dom during oxidative titration the clo2 induced byproducts were 1 related to the concentration of phenolic moieties and 2 assessed for a complete chlorine mass balance phenol fig 3c and 4c show the two main products chlorite 50 0 01 and fac 45 0 03 from the oxidation of phenol by clo2 as expected the products remain constant after phenol is completely depleted clo2 concentration 20 μm overall these results are well aligned with previous studies and the known reaction mechanism hupperich et al 2020 rougé et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 wajon et al 1982 phenolic moieties in dom solutions fig 3f shows the formation of the inorganic byproducts chlorite chlorate and fac as a function of the clo2 dose for srfa similar to chlorite and fac formation for phenol there is an increase in product formation chlorite fac and chlorate with a plateau for clo2 doses larger than the concentration of the oxidant reactive moieties 17 04 µm for a 3 mgc l 1 srfa solution the corresponding trend is also observed for the dom isolates umrnom srha and efom figures s10 s12 consequently the pattern for the increase in clo2 byproducts is the same for phenol and dom solutions however the clo2 induced byproduct distribution from the dom isolates differ from phenol clo2 induced byproduct yields for phenol and average dom solutions are shown in fig 4c and for the individual dom isolates in figure s13 the chlorine mass balance for phenol is almost complete 95 and the individual dom isolates show chlorine mass balances ranging between 82 101 the product distribution for the clo2 dose with complete phenol depletion is in a similar range for all isolates i e 63 7 0 04 for chlorite 9 4 0 01 for chlorate and 18 0 0 05 for fac chloride and adsorbable organic chlorine aocl were not quantified in this study for the dom because they seem to be minor gan et al 2019 but could explain the gap to 100 the overall observed product distribution aligns with previous measurements for srnom hupperich et al 2020 rougé et al 2018 figure s14 in general chlorate yields were slightly higher compared to previous studies which could be attributed to the lower ph used in the current study ph 6 0 vs 7 0 and 8 1 in the previous studies compared to phenol dom isolates usually have higher yields of chlorite lower yields of fac and yield chlorate which is not formed from the clo2 phenol reaction higher yields of chlorite can be explained by the contribution of dihydroxybenzenes in ortho and para positions hydroquinone or catechol like as they form up to 90 chlorite and are expected in dom gan et al 2019 the yield of fac depends on the possible formation of an unstable phenoxyl radical which reacts further with clo2 releasing fac wajon et al 1982 hydroxybenzenes might be substituted at different positions in the ring varying the formation of a phenoxyl radical amenable to clo2 oxidation besides hydroquinone or catechols an example of a phenol without fac formation and slight chlorate formation is vanillin chlorite 50 chloride 35 chlorate 5 hupperich et al 2020 which has a substituent in ortho and para position potentially influencing the reaction mechanism vanillin like structures with such substituent patterns are likely present in dom among other hydroxylated aromatic structures as has been shown by jiang et al 2020 and could lead to the overall lower fac formation that was observed in dom oxidation compared to phenol chlorate formation which was observed in dom solutions in contrast to phenol can be explained by two potential mechanisms vanillin type and other structures might contribute to chlorate formation as exemplified by yields up to 60 for model compounds gan et al 2019 structures such as resorcinol or β diketones may contribute as well in contrast to phenol they form chlorate in addition to chlorite and only small amounts of fac with mass balances that additionally contain chloride and aocl pointing towards the presence of other reactive species which lead to direct chlorination during clo2 oxidation hocl was quenched by glycine section s11 and figure s15 alternatively chlorate may be formed by disproportionation reactions from clo2 or clo2 the dom matrix may contain complexes with transition metals that favor such disproportionation reactions gordon et al 1995 liu et al 2012 the selected doms are very similar in the relative clo2 byproduct distribution fig 4c but differ in the absolute yields the inorganic byproduct formation for several dom isolates is shown in fig 4b as a function of the quantified phenol concentration by oxidative titration all three inorganic byproducts are correlated to the clo2 derived phenol concentration chlorite r2 0 962 chlorate r2 0 849 and fac r2 0 955 a previous study also obtained a correlation r2 0 77 between chlorite formed after 5 min clo2 oxidation doc 2 mgc l 1 clo2 0 06 mm ph 7 0 gan et al 2019 and the phenol content ihss 2020 in the present study the optimized times for the reaction between dom isolates and clo2 for chlorite quantification and the determined phenol content improved this correlation significantly a previous study also compared the molar yields of clo2 byproducts e g fac relative to the phenol concentration rougé et al 2018 rougé et al 2018 observed the molar yields of fac per mol phenol were 1 for the isolate srnom in this study a much lower molar yield of fac relative to the phenol concentration of about 38 13 was observed among the dom isolates however in oxidative titration experiments the reaction was stopped after phenol depletion and thus the lower measured fac is directly linked to reactions of phenol with clo2 and further formation of fac would come from other slower reacting moieties in dom in line with previous interpretations in contrast to the previous study gan et al 2019 also a relationship between edc and the inorganic byproducts chlorite chlorate and fac is observed here chlorite r2 0 973 chlorate r2 0 819 and fac r2 0 932 figure s16 this difference can be explained by the different methods used to quantify the antioxidant capacity folin ciocalteu as used in gan et al 2020 vs edc by abts as used in the present study highlighting the advantages of the abts assay the good correlation between edc and inorganic byproducts is a further evidence for the suitability of edc as surrogate parameter in water and wastewater treatment processes walpen et al 2021 3 2 oxidative titrations with o3 3 2 1 oxidative titration of phenol a similar approach for an oxidative titration was also tested using o3 as the oxidant instead of clo2 fig 5 a shows the calculated residual ozone concentration observed during oxidative titration of phenol with o3 as a function of the calculated ozone dose at ph 7 0 information about data transformation to retrieve the calculated o3 residual concentrations and doses are provided in section s3 during the oxidative titration experiments for reaction times leading to a 99 abatement of phenol 200 600 ms a stoichiometry of 2 2 5 is expected ramseier and von gunten 2009 however considering the complex mechanism of the ozone phenol reactions the stoichiometry is not trivial as many products are formed such as hydroquinones benzoquinones catechols organic acids aldehydes and ketones which in some cases show similar reactivities with o3 as phenol mvula and von sonntag 2003 ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 the x intercept of 23 3 1 59 μm for a phenol solution of 10 μm leads to an apparent stoichiometry of 2 31 0 16 which is in the expected range for phenol furthermore a slope of 1 01 0 04 indicates that no significant side reactions occur overall the data in fig 5a represent a proof of concept for oxidative titrations of phenol with o3 3 2 2 oxidative titrations of phenolic moieties in dom solutions oxidative titrations with o3 were also performed with various dom isolates during ozonation of dom olefinic and β diketone moieties are expected to react with similar kinetics as phenols fig 1 a large number of second order rate constants for the reactions of olefins with o3 is available von sonntag and von gunten 2012 whereas for β diketones no information exists therefore the apparent second order rate constant for the reaction of acetylacetone was determined in this study as k app ph 7 5 11 0 58 105 m 1 s 1 section s12 with the knowledge from quantified phenolic moieties from oxidative titration with clo2 we can estimate the concentrations of such structures fig 5b shows the increase of residual o3 after the phenolic structures in dom are oxidized slopes are between 1 05 and 1 11 indicating no considerable side reactions with olefins or β diketones the reaction stoichiometry lies between 1 90 0 21 and 2 11 0 16 mol o3 per mol phenol which is comparable to pure phenol solutions stoichiometry of 2 31 0 16 these results are slightly lower compared to phenol but indicate no substantial concentrations of other electron rich moieties than phenols in principle olefins could contribute to the obtained lower stoichiometries as they usually only consume one mol o3 per mol olefin however the current data do not allow for a quantitative estimate and further research is warranted overall these results corroborate the applicability of oxidative titration as a quantitative method also for other oxidants 3 3 model dom compounds and their electron donating potential from the oxidative titration experiments of dom solutions with clo2 it can be concluded that other moieties than phenols may contribute because i clo2 induced byproduct distributions differ between phenol and dom fig 4c ii moieties such as β diketones or olefins have similar reaction kinetics with the applied oxidants fig 1a and c and iii oxidative titration with clo2 for tagged dom did not reveal the expected residual oxidant pattern fig 3d to further elucidate these aspects both oxidative titration and molecular tagging were related to changes in the edc consequently the edc was measured for dom model compounds without and with tagging to further evaluate the observed results validation of molecular tagging is described in section s2 3 3 1 edc of electron rich dom model compounds and dom the edc of dom has been discussed previously aeschbacher et al 2012 2011 but has not been measured for a large selection of model compounds thus a range of electron rich model compounds was tested for their electron donating capacity including phenols n 13 β diketones n 6 amines n 3 olefins n 2 and activated benzenes e g anisole n 3 figs 6 a and s18 19 and table s1 at ph 7 0 and ph 9 0 for amines data not shown all of the phenolic model compounds showed electron donating capacities edc values between 2 and 11 mole mol fig 6a except 4 hydroxyacetophenone edc value of 0 2 0 01 mole mol which has a high reduction potential of 0 94 v at ph 7 0 li and hoffman 1999 for trolox an edc of 2 mole mol was determined previously walpen et al 2016 which agrees well with the value obtained in this study 1 94 0 04 mole mol n 4 previous studies also reported the edc of resorcinol 3 3 mole mol wang et al 2020 and 4 6 mole mol de vera et al 2017 vs 5 73 0 31 mole mol n 5 present study phenol 2 7 mole mol wang et al 2020 vs 2 19 0 06 mole mol n 3 present study and hydroquinone 1 2 wang et al 2020 vs 1 95 0 23 mole mol n 3 present study both previous studies used mediated electrochemical oxidation meo for quantification which could be responsible for these differences de vera et al 2017 wang et al 2020 the general trend in edc of our study hydroquinone phenol resorcinol is comparable to previous studies wang et al 2020 however hydroquinone should be able to transfer exactly 2 mole mol to obtain benzoquinone which is not reflected in the value determined in the previous study wang et al 2020 besides phenols and β diketones no other model compounds showed electron donating character under the applied conditions ph 7 0 eh 0 71 v fig 6a in contrast to phenols the edc of β diketones has not been discussed in the context of dom in the past however their antioxidant character has been noticed previously pandhair and sekhon 2006 and very low eh values are reported acetylacetone 1 097 v at ph 2 0 chen et al 2017 edc values are usually obtained using an operationally defined reaction time i e 15 min between abts and the dom solution because of lack of an obvious end point walpen et al 2020 2016 considering the kinetics of the reactions between model compounds and abts at 728 nm the contribution of different compound classes to the edc can potentially be differentiated such measurements revealed different kinetics for the different model compounds figure s20a and can be grouped in 3 categories i high reaction rates for phenol 2 4 6 trimethylphenol 2 4 6 tmp and trolox ii moderate reaction rates for acetylacetone and dimedone and iii low reaction rates for 4 hydroxyacetophenone as noted previously reactivity of dom solutions could be categorized in two phases figure s20b with a first fast reacting phase followed by a moderately reacting phase reflecting the variety of edc contributing moieties finally the edc of dom solutions was also related to their phenol concentration designated by the white diamonds in fig 6a and lies between 1 2 mole molphenol 3 3 2 influence of molecular tagging on the edc only phenols β diketones and dom samples were subjected to molecular tagging fig 6b shows the effect of molecular tagging for selected model compounds on the edc fig 6c shows a compilation of the relative edc ratio of edc after tagging and before tagging for various model compounds and doms 10 phenols 5 β diketones and 3 dom sources for the majority of phenols the edc is completely lost after molecular tagging simple phenols such as phenol or hydroquinone but some bulky phenols butylhydroxytoluol or 2 4 6 trimethyl phenol remain partially redox active and contribute to the edc this reduced tagging efficiency may be a consequence of steric hindrance for the tagging reagent meanwhile for the majority of β diketones the edc is not affected by molecular tagging fig 6c and s18 application of molecular tagging to dom showed an overall loss in edc of 48 58 in dom isolates figs 6c and s19 among the phenolic compounds studied certain substituents may reduce the efficiency of tagging and thus application of this method to dom can lead to residual concentrations of phenols which still react with oxidants and or contribute to edc as discussed in the previous sections β diketones are another compound class which can contribute to the edc but in contrast to phenols their redox reactivity is not affected by molecular tagging hence these moieties can still contribute to the edc of tagged dom and may lead to an overestimation of phenols as stated in the section above β diketones cannot be neglected during oxidative titration because i they show comparable reaction kinetics and stoichiometry with clo2 as phenols fig 1 and ii their presence cannot be excluded due to their contribution to the edc overall the partial tagging of phenol and thus the quantification of oxidant reactive moieties in the tagged srfa solution fig 3d may be explained by the contribution of sterically hindered phenolic moieties which are not tagged and or the presence of β diketone like structures nevertheless molecular tagging of phenols provided useful additional information on the oxidant reactive moieties found in dom 4 conclusion phenolic structures are among other electron rich moieties major components in dom and responsible for a significant consumption of oxidants during oxidation processes a novel approach was developed to quantify oxidant reactive moieties in complex mixtures such as dom based on their selective reactivity with oxidants in this study we i quantified phenolic moieties with chlorine dioxide clo2 and ozone o3 by a novel oxidative titration ii evaluated the clo2 reacted samples in terms of the electron donating capacity edc uv absorption and inorganic clo2 byproducts and iii evaluated changes due to a novel molecular tagging for phenols in oxidative titration experiments and with edc measurements the main findings of this study are the concentrations of phenolic moieties in five nom isolates and two wastewater effluent samples were quantified by oxidative titration with clo2 and a relationship to the electron donating capacity edc and inorganic clo2 byproducts was obtained the quantified phenol concentrations by clo2 were confirmed in oxidative titrations with o3 exemplifying the applicability of the novel method for various oxidants differences between phenol and dom isolates for clo2 byproduct yields and changes due to a novel molecular tagging for phenols revealed a better understanding of reactive structures within dom the edc was determined for a wide selection of 27 model compounds comprising phenols activated aromatic compounds olefins and β diketones edc values 11 mole mol were measured showing a significant variability for different potential dom moieties additionally measurements of edc after molecular tagging of phenols to phenylacetates revealed the

16493,atomic hydrogen h is highly reactive for the hydrodechlorination of trichloroethylene tce in this work we found that the coprecipitation of ni2 and fe2 at neutral ph led to an unprecedented catalytic generation of h the generated h effectively dechlorinate tce to nontoxic ethylene and ethane and fe2 is the only electron donor the abundant adsorbed h produced with a ni fe ratio of 0 4 enhances hydrogen evolution reaction causing a low efficiency for hydrodechlorination in contrast the active absorbed h is generated in the crystal lattice of ni fe hydroxides with a ni fe ratio of 3 0 causing highly efficient hydrodechlorination of tce this work not only reveals the mechanism of catalytic hydrodechlorination by ni fe hydroxides at neutral ph but also provides a novel approach to detoxify tce in contaminated water using facile precipitated ni fe hydroxides graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ni fe hydroxides hydrodechlorination active hydrogen species electron transfer 1 introduction trichloroethylene tce as one of the most frequently used chlorinated organic solvent has been released into environment for decades jia et al 2018 tian et al 2018 due to the strong migration capability tce with a trace concentration is widely detected in soils and groundwater huang et al 2014 moran et al 2007 tce brings potential damages to the nervous system and reproductive system of human watson et al 2006 zenick et al 1984 reductive dechlorination of tce to non chlorinated products is an efficient way to detoxify tce since the ph of groundwater is usually neutral dechlorinating tce at neutral ph is desired for the remediation of tce contaminated groundwater some natural occurring minerals show dechlorination activity towards tce in soil and aquatic environment jeong and hayes 2007 kim et al 2008 however these minerals are limited by their weak reductive capability for tce which lead to the formation of toxic incomplete dechlorination products such as dichloroethylene dce and vinyl chloride vc drake et al 2006 han et al 2012 the formation of complete dechlorination products is favored in the presence of atomic hydrogen h which is a highly reactive reductant e0 2 1 v vs rhe for dechlorination liu et al 2018 lots of transition metals such as cu ni pd ag etc are reported to catalyze the formation of h parshetti and doong 2009 ran et al 2019 wang et al 2008 wu and feng 2016 these transition metals show high electrocatalytic hydrodechlorination performance by generating h avoiding the production of toxic incomplete dechlorination products lee et al 2013 lou et al 2019 however the fabrication of electrocatalytic cathode is complex and the electrochemical process needs additional electricity input which restricts their practical applications skadberg and geoly horn 1999 yao et al 2019 the bimetallic nanoparticles consisting of nano zero valent iron nzvi and a second catalytic metal also catalyze the generation of h in water which is promising for groundwater remediation fang et al 2018 he et al 2018 however nanoparticles such as nzvi is relatively expensive yang et al 2020 also a passive metal oxide layer readily forms on the surface of nanoparticles in water which inhibit the electron transfer and reduce the yield of h doong and lai 2005 shen et al 2018 therefore finding an efficient stable and easy to operate technique for h generation is urgent for tce removal ni atoms in synthesized ni fe layered double hydroxides ldh can provide h adsorption sites to enhance the dissociation of water gong et al 2014 liu

transferred by ni fe hydroxides framework inspired by this ni fe ldh catalyzed her process we speculated that electrons might also be donated by fe2 which lead to the generation of h by ni fe hydroxides with fe2 and ni2 in the metal framework the cooccurrence of ni2 and fe2 in anoxic groundwater has been reported larsen and postma 1997 lee et al 2007 although the cooccurrence of ni2 and fe2 is not common and the concentration of fe2 is usually higher than that of ni2 if they cooccur due to the abundance of iron minerals in subsurface environment wang et al 2021 the hydroxylation of fe2 and ni2 causing the formation of ni fe hydroxides in natural environment at near neutral ph cannot be ignored natural occurring iron based ldh mostly have fe3 in the metal framework because fe2 is readily oxidized in an ambient environment due to its strong reducibility fang et al 2019b huang et al 2018 the generation of h during the electron release process from ni fe hydroxides is rarely investigated it has been reported that tce usually coexists with heavy metals such as fe and ni in groundwater jeong and hayes 2007 however the natural attenuation of tce in the presence of ni2 and fe2 under neutral conditions has been scarcely studied in this work h involved dechlorination of tce by ni fe hydroxides at neutral ph was reported for the first time the generation of h was confirmed by electrochemical analysis and quenching experiments the utilization and selectivity efficiency of electrons were calculated and the morphological change of ni fe hydroxides after the hydrodechlorination was studied the mechanism of h involved hydrodechlorination is revealed by various crystallographic microscopic and surface chemistry methods 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals

hydroxides were synthesized in anoxic glovebox the synthesis method of ni fe hydroxides was detailed in text s1 ni fe hydroxides suspension 1 0 ml was moved into 10 ml glass vials and 4 0 ml oxygen free ultrapure water was added into glass vials the ph value of solution in glass vials was adjusted using 10 mm naoh twenty five µl saturated aqueous solution of tce 8 37 mm was injected into the 5 0 ml ni fe hydroxides suspensions to obtain a tce concentration of 42 µm which was then immediately capped with teflon lined lids all the experiments were conducted in an anoxic glovebox the reaction vials were shaken in a rotary agitator at 40 rpm the transformation from c2h4 to c2h6 was observed in a 50 ml glass vials with 25 ml ni fe hydroxides suspension and 25 ml headspace the injection port

hydroxides at neutral ph was fast with the removal efficiency reached 80 9 after 110 min of reaction fig 1 a the mass normalized pseudo first order rate constants km was 1 4 0 1 l h 1 g 1 which was higher than most of the reported iron based reductants supplementary table s1 during tce reduction trace concentrations of intermediates such as cis dce and 1 1 dichloroethylene 1 1 dce were detected supplementary fig s1 ethylene c2h4 and ethane c2h6 as the complete dechlorination products of tce were identified supplementary fig s2 whose contents were 29 3 and 35 8 after 110 min of reaction respectively the hydroxylation of fe2 or ni2 at neutral ph leads to the formation of fe oh 2 or ni oh 2 tce removal was negligible in the presence of fe oh 2 ni oh 2 or the physical mixture of fe oh 2 and ni oh 2 after 24 h supplementary fig s3 demonstrating fe oh 2 or ni oh 2 alone cannot reduce tce effectively in contrast the efficient transformation from tce to c2h4 and c2h6 demonstrated the extremely strong reducing activity of ni fe hydroxides the precipitated particles formed after reaction were collected for characterization tem image of the particles shows a typical hexagonal morphology of layered double hydroxide ldh with a lateral size of 600 nm fig 1b fang et al 2019c yin et al 2018 the edx spectra confirmed the ni fe ratio of the as formed ni fe hydroxide is 3 0 fig 1c supplementary table s2 xrd patterns fig 1d shows the diffraction peaks at 11 1 21 8 30 6 and 43 7 corresponding to 003 006 012 and 018 reflections of ni fe ldh interlayered with cl anions jcpds no 40 0216 duo et al 2018 fang et al 2019a in addition the two diffraction peaks at 13 5 and 26 9 can be assigned to fe oh 3 jcpds no 38 0032 high resolution ni 2p xps fig 1e shows the peaks at 855 7 and 861 8 ev belonging to ni2 shen et al 2018 high resolution fe 2p xps fig 1f indicates fe2 710 6 and 723 9 ev and fe3 712 5 and 725 9 ev existed in the particles after reaction gan et al 2020 these results demonstrate that fe2 is the only electron donor during the hydrodechlorination of tce after electrons transferring from ni fe hydroxides to tce ni fe hydroxides were transformed to ni fe ldh and fe oh 3 was also formed as confirmed by xrd data fig 1d it should be noted that the ni2 and fe2 cations at neutral ph may undergo very fast transformation from hydroxylated polycations ni fe hydroxide to ni fe ldh one can see the immediate color change and formation of precipitations during the aging process of ni2 and fe2 cations at neutral ph supplementary fig s4 although the characterization of the materials before reaction was done as fast as possible only ni fe ldh as the final transformed product was observed supplementary fig s5 thus ex situ solid state characterization could not capture the structural information of these ultrafast involved materials before reaction and sophisticated in situ characterization techquies are required 3 2 effect of metal dosage and ph hydrodechlorination of tce by ni fe hydroxides with various metal dosages was investigated supplementary fig s6 tce removal efficiency increased greatly with increasing the metal dosage the pseudo first order kinetics reaction rate constants k with different metal dosages were 0 006 min 1 ni 3 mm fe 1 mm 0 017 min 1 ni 6 mm fe 2 mm 0 047 min 1 ni 12 mm fe 3 mm and 0 127 min 1 ni 18 mm fe 6 mm the k values increase linearly with the metal dosage fig 2 a demonstrating high concentration of ni fe hydroxides enhance the removal of tce the concentration of dce was extremely low indicating the half life of chlorinated intermediates were short during the tce hydrodechlorination process fig 2b also the peak of dce concentration moved forward with increasing metal dosage which was attribute to the accelerated hydrodechlorination rates for the reduction of tce to dce the yield of c2h6 increased significantly with increasing metal dosage from 4 8 16 to 24 mm which were 9 3 35 8 70 5 and 84 5 after 110 min respectively fig 2c the production of c2h4 increased with reaction time when metal dosages were 4 and 8 mm fig 2d however the concentration of c2h4 increased firstly and then decreased when the metal dosage was 16 and 24 mm therefore h may be involved during the tce reduction leading to the hydrogenation of c2h4 to form c2h6 eq 1 furthermore pure c2h4 gas was injected into the reaction vials to verify the hydrogenation of c2h4 as shown in supplementary fig s7 c2h4 was continuously converted to c2h6 confirming the generation of h by ni fe hydroxides at neutral ph 1 c2h4 2h c2h6 the h can be produced via the catalytic reduction of h whose concentration is greatly influenced by the ph value therefore the effect of ph on tce reduction by ni fe hydroxides was investigated tce removal efficiency decreased significantly under acidic condition supplementary fig s8 because acidic environment inhibits the formation of metal hydroxides thus the transformation from free metal cations to metal hydroxides precipitates is vital for the electron transfer from fe2 to h and the subsequent h generation under the neutral and alkaline condition tce removal efficiency decreased with increasing ph value fig 3 a also the generation of complete dechlorination products including c2h4 and c2h6 was inhibited at alkaline conditions fig 3c d the highest concentration of dce during tce reduction increased from ph 7 0 to ph 9 5 due to the accumulation of dce intermediate which resulted from the weakened dechlorination activity at alkaline conditions fig 3b when the ph value increased from 9 5 to 11 5 the reduction of tce to dce was inhibited significantly although the dominant oh accelerate the formation of ni fe hydroxides h generated from the reduction of h may play a more critical role in the hydrodechlorination process of tce h obtained electron to form h according to eq 2 as an electron carrier h transfer electrons from fe2 to tce for hydrodechlorination 2 h e h it should be noted that the ph value did not change before and after reaction it is hypothesized that h is reduced to h h2 and oh could coordinate with the produced fe3 to form fe oh 3 as shown by the xrd data fig 1d as a result the ph is relatively constant along the reaction course 3 3 identification of h methanol and tba can effectively react with h to form h2 which were widely used as a h quencher eqs 3 4 chuang et al 1999 ran et al 2019 as shown in supplementary fig s9 the dechlorination of tce was inhibited significantly in the presence of 600 mm tba and methanol the carbon balance is 100 along the reaction course indicating the solvent effect may have little influence on the reaction since c2h4 and c2h6 are the dechlorination products and h is the only possible reductant that can reduce c2h4 to c2h6 in the system the c2h4 to c2h6 conversion was used as a probe reaction to further confirm the h quenching effect by methanol supplementary fig s10 shows the c2h4 to c2h6 conversion was greatly inhibited in the presence of 600 mm methanol and the conversion efficiency from c2h4 to c2h6 decreased 49 9 after 110 min of reaction thus the inhibited tce reduction in the presence of methanol is due to the quenching effect of methanol rather than the solvent effect due to the stronger h quenching effect of methanol than that of tba methanol with various concentrations was added into the reaction system to study the role of h tce removal efficiency decreased gradually with the increase of methanol concentration fig 4 a which demonstrated the scavenging of h by methanol in addition the production of c2h4 and c2h6 was also greatly inhibited by methanol demonstrating that h contribute to the hydrodechlorination of tce fig 4b the concentration of dce increased with the increase of methanol concentration proving that the insufficient amount of h results in the accumulation of incomplete dechlorination products therefore h contribute to the hydrodechlorination of tce 3 ch3oh h h2 ch3oh 4 c4h10o h h2 c4h9o electrochemical analysis was conducted to further identify the h species jiang et al 2017 cyclic voltammogram cv showed a prominent peak at 0 40 to 0 20 v fig 5 a text s5 corresponding to the oxidation peak of absorbed h bastide et al 2013 singh et al 2016 the oxidation peak of absorbed h disappeared once tce was added fig 5b demonstrating absorbed h can react with tce also h2 was detected during the coprecipitation of ni2 and fe2 at neutral ph supplementary fig s11 which can be attributed to the combination of h eq 5 thus the precipitated ni fe hydroxides can donate electrons to h in an aqueous solution which lead to the generation of h to hydrodechlorinate tce 5 h h h2 3 4 mechanism of h generation fe2 acts as an electron donor for tce reduction and the role of ni2 for tce hydrodechlorination needs further investigation thus tce dechlorination by ni fe hydroxides at neutral ph with different ni2 dosages and a fixed fe2 dosage 2 mm was investigated supplementary fig s12 ni fe ldh and fe oh 3 was formed as the oxidation products of ni fe hydroxides after reaction supplementary fig s13 the intensity of the xrd peaks for ni fe ldh increased with ni fe ratio due to the increased ni dosage but that for fe oh 3 remains constant since the fe dosage is constant supplementary fig s13 xps spectra show the presence of ni2 supplementary fig s14 and the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 after reaction supplementary fig s15 thus ni2 act as a catalyst rather than an electron donor during tce reduction hydrodechlorination of one carbon chlorine bond needs two electrons ai et al 2019 thus effective electrons for h involved tce hydrodechlorination was calculated based on the amount of hydrodechlorination intermediates and products the generation of dce needs two electrons and the formation of ethylene need six electrons the presence of ethane was attributed to the hydrogenation of ethylene the formation of which from tce reduction need eight electrons thus the effective electrons can be calculated according to eq 6 6 e e 2 c dce 6 c ethylene 8 c ethane c represents the concentration ee represents effective electrons the calculated ee value increased with time demonstrating the continuous hydrodechlorination of tce by ni fe hydroxides fig 6 a the utilized electrons eu are designated as the fraction of fe2 consumed after the reaction supplementary fig s16 thus the electron selectivity es can be calculated according to ee and eu values eq 7 which is used to assess the efficiency of consumed electrons for tce hydrodechlorination 7 e s e e e u as shown in fig 6b dechlorination by ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratio of 0 4 showed an extremely low es the es value increased greatly with the ni fe ratio increased from 0 4 to 2 0 in the initial reaction stage es with the ni fe ratio of 2 0 was high which quickly decreased with time for the ni fe ratio of 3 0 and 4 0 es was relatively low initially but increased with time notably the number of utilized electrons with different ni fe ratios are close supplementary fig s16 thus the difference in es value is most likely attributed to the different active species resulted from various ni fe ratios cvs of ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratio of 0 4 showed a prominent peak at 0 20 to 0 v corresponding to the oxidation of adsorbed h fig 7 a bastide et al 2013 singh et al 2016 the intensity of adsorbed h peak was higher than absorbed h peak indicating adsorbed h was dominant during the structure evolution of ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratio of 0 4 in water although the adsorbed h may be more active for hydrodechlorination reaction jiang et al 2017 the adsorbed h are readily combined to form h2 because the total metal concentration of ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratio of 0 4 was low the average sizes of particles were relatively small compared with the other ni fe hydroxides supplementary fig s17 although ni fe hydroxides with small particles size tent to collide more frequently a low dosage contrarily means a low collide frequency the net effect favored the combination of adsorbed h to form h2 which is in line with the low es of ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratio of 0 4 thus the electron efficiency for tce reduction was relatively low with the ni fe ratio of 0 4 which lead to the low es value with the ni fe ratio increased from 0 4 to 2 0 the oxidation peak of adsorbed h was weakened gradually fig 7b c although the production of adsorbed h decreased it is speculated that her was also weakened because the particle size of ni fe hydroxides was increased supplementary fig s17 more active adsorbed h can effectively act on the hydrodechlorination of tce therefore the es value was high in the initial stage of reaction with the ni fe ratio of 2 0 however the oxidation of fe2 in ni fe hydroxides accelerated the formation of ni fe ldh with a layer structure thereby reducing the surface area for the generation of adsorbed h as shown in supplementary fig s18 the arc radius in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis of ni fe hydroxides increased gradually with aging time demonstrating that the interfacial electron transfer rate slowed down along with the formation of ni fe ldh zhang et al 2019 therefore the es value decreased rapidly over time with the ni fe ratio of 2 0 as shown in figs 5a and 7d only absorbed h oxidation peak was detected with the ni fe ratios of 3 0 and 4 0 for the ni fe ratio of 3 0 the nyquist plot diameters of the ni fe hydroxides formed at 5 min 30 min and 80 min were similar demonstrating the interfacial electron transfer rate remained relatively constant supplementary fig s19 the formation of ldh structure leads to a decreased amount of active surface for the generation of adsorbed h however the absorbed h in ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratio of 3 0 was more efficient for tce dechlorination in the late stage of the reaction comparing with that with the ni fe ratio of 2 0 in order to fully reveal the atomic scale mechanism for the h generation on the ni fe hydroxides surface theoretical calculations were performed via dft the conformations of ni fe hydroxides with ni fe ratios of 1 3 2 2 and 3 1 each unit cell contains four metal atoms were optimized supplementary fig s20 when the ni fe ratio was 1 3 the length of fe o bonds 2 1 å and ni o bonds 2 4 å were similar when the ni fe ratio was 2 2 a part of fe o bonds were stretched to 3 1 å and a part of fe o bonds were compressed to 1 8 å while the length of ni o bonds was 2 1 å when the ni fe ratio was 3 1 the fe o bonds 2 0 å and ni o bonds 2 4 å were evenly distributed subsequently one h atom was added to the optimized configurations of ni fe hydroxides followed by re optimization as shown in fig 8 the conformation of ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratio of 3 1 was relatively stable after adding h atom comparing with ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratios of 1 3 and 2 2 the added h atom was located nearby ni atoms with a distance of 1 5 å when the ni fe ratio were 1 3 and 2 2 interestingly when the ni fe ratio was 3 1 the added h atom combined with the o atom of fe o bond to form a new ho bond according to previous publications the absorbed h located in the crystal lattice was inert for hydrodechlorination jiang et al 2017 however the added h atom in ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratio of 3 1 was further away from the central metal atoms because the charge between ni2 and fe2 was redistributed the electrons were transferred from fe2 to the ho bond and form absorbed h subsequently the absorbed h continuously contribute to the hydrodechlorination of tce along with the formation of ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratio of 3 1 when the ni fe ratio reaches 4 0 the excessive ni atoms may disperse the electrons of fe atoms inhibiting the electron transfer from fe2 to the ho bond thus the es of ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratio of 4 1 was lower than that of 3 1 fig 9 a summarized the structure evolution of ni2 and fe2 cation at neutral aqueous solution during the hydrodechlorination process dissolved fe2 and ni2 cations cannot lead to the generation of h because the free cations cannot transfer electrons to h at neutral or alkaline conditions ni oh 2 and fe oh 2 molecule is formed due to the effect of hydroxylation in aqueous solution christiansen et al 2009 jolivet et al 2004 the relatively weak reduction potentials of ni oh 2 and fe oh 2 did not result in any dechlorination process of tce then ni oh 2 and fe oh 2 combine to form ni fe hydroxides via olation during the olation process the electron could jump from fe2 to ni2 within the ni fe hydroxides due to galvanic effect which activate ni fe hydroxides for the catalytic reduction of h to form h because ni fe hydroxides with various ni fe ratios have different intrinsic properties the types of catalytically formed h are different for the low ni fe ratios of 0 4 and 1 adsorbed h on the surface of ni fe hydroxides is dominant which enhances her while inhibiting the hydrodechlorination process with the ni fe ratio increase to 2 0 the relatively weakened adsorbed h favor the tce dechlorination process when a part of fe2 is transformed to fe3 after reductive hydrodechlorination the ni fe hydroxides layer become positive thus charge compensating anions were inserted between the ni fe hydroxides layers forming ni fe ldh the formation of ldh reduces the surface area for the generation of adsorbed h which is unfavorable for the hydrodechlorination of tce when the ni fe ratio is lower than 2 0 the generated absorbed h is inert for hydrodechlorination in contrast absorbed h is activated in ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratio of 3 0 due to the unique conformation of h on ni fe hydroxides fig 9b although the amount of adsorbed h is relatively small in ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratio of 3 0 absorbed h results in a highly efficient hydrodechlorination of tce 3 5 application the secondary ni pollution could be of great concern in future application thus the concentration of the dissolved ni after reaction was determined after tce reduction a fraction of ni 10 65 0 01 mg l 1 and fe 5 10 0 10 mg l 1 were released into the reaction solution due to the possible dissolution of ni fe hydroxides although relatively high concentration was observed in the studied experimental conditions the concentration of the dissolved ni was only 1 5 of the total ni dosage nevertheless low ni dosage is recommended in practical application to avoid secondary ni pollution which could lead to a longer remediation time than that reported in this work dioxygen may be introduced into the subsurface environment due to natural and anthropogenic perturbations as a common environmental oxidant dissolved oxygen may exert great influence on the reductive dechlorination of tce by ni fe hydroxides when ultrapure water with 10 53 mg l 1 of dissolved oxygen was used the tce removal efficiency reached 97 5 and the c2h4 generation reached 47 3 after 200 min of reaction supplementary fig s21a although the presence of dissolved oxygen inhibited the tce reduction due to the scavenger of h the remaining h can still completely dechlorinate tce after 200 min of reaction to further evaluate the applicability of ni fe hydroxides in groundwater remediation the dechlorination reaction was carried out in real groundwater the parameters of the real groundwater were listed in supplementary table s3 as shown in supplementary fig s21b 55 5 of tce was dechlorinated by ni fe hydroxides in the real groundwater matrix the presence of no3 in real groundwater can react with h to form nh4 chen et al 2020 which may inhibits the tce reduction by ni fe hydroxides the oxygenation of groundwater further inhibits the tce reduction supplementary fig s21c still 26 3 of tce was dechlorinated demonstrating the high selectivity of the produced h towards tce reduction in the presence of environmental oxidants i e dissolved oxygen and no3 nevertheless the absence of environmental oxidants is strongly desired since their presence significantly inhibit the tce reduction by ni fe hydroxides lower concentrations of ni and fe ions were observed in the groundwater than ultrapure water which could be attributed to the sorption of metal cations by dissolved organic matters that exist in the groundwater supplementary table s4 4 conclusions in this work we found that h can be efficiently generated during the transformation of ni2 and fe2 to ni fe hydroxides in water at neutral ph the as formed h contribute to the hydrodechlorination of tce in aqueous solution nontoxic ethane and ethylene were the dechlorination products due to the high reductive activity of h for ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratio of 0 4 the presence of dominant adsorbed h enhances her causing a low efficiency for hydrodechlorination when the ni fe ratio was 2 0 the weakly adsorbed h results in efficient hydrodechlorination of tce in the initial stage of reaction notably the active absorbed h is generated in the crystal lattice of ni fe hydroxides with the 3 0 ni fe ratio causing continuous and efficient hydrodechlorination of tce fe2 and ni2 may exist together in anoxic subsurface environment thus ni fe hydroxides can be formed in some area of groundwater under neutral and alkaline condition this work provides new evidence for the fate and transformation of tce in subsurface environment also injection of fe2 and ni2 into polluted plume could be a promising strategy for the remediation of tce contaminated groundwater declaration of competing interest the authors declare

16493,atomic hydrogen h is highly reactive for the hydrodechlorination of trichloroethylene tce in this work we found that the coprecipitation of ni2 and fe2 at neutral ph led to an unprecedented catalytic generation of h the generated h effectively dechlorinate tce to nontoxic ethylene and ethane and fe2 is the only electron donor the abundant adsorbed h produced with a ni fe ratio of 0 4 enhances hydrogen evolution reaction causing a low efficiency for hydrodechlorination in contrast the active absorbed h is generated in the crystal lattice of ni fe hydroxides with a ni fe ratio of 3 0 causing highly efficient hydrodechlorination of tce this work not only reveals the mechanism of catalytic hydrodechlorination by ni fe hydroxides at neutral ph but also provides a novel approach to detoxify tce in contaminated water using facile precipitated ni fe hydroxides graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ni fe hydroxides hydrodechlorination active hydrogen species electron transfer 1 introduction trichloroethylene tce as one of the most frequently used chlorinated organic solvent has been released into environment for decades jia et al 2018 tian et al 2018 due to the strong migration capability tce with a trace concentration is widely detected in soils and groundwater huang et al 2014 moran et al 2007 tce brings potential damages to the nervous system and reproductive system of human watson et al 2006 zenick et al 1984 reductive dechlorination of tce to non chlorinated products is an efficient way to detoxify tce since the ph of groundwater is usually neutral dechlorinating tce at neutral ph is desired for the remediation of tce contaminated groundwater some natural occurring minerals show dechlorination activity towards tce in soil and aquatic environment jeong and hayes 2007 kim et al 2008 however these minerals are limited by their weak reductive capability for tce which lead to the formation of toxic incomplete dechlorination products such as dichloroethylene dce and vinyl chloride vc drake et al 2006 han et al 2012 the formation of complete dechlorination products is favored in the presence of atomic hydrogen h which is a highly reactive reductant e0 2 1 v vs rhe for dechlorination liu et al 2018 lots of transition metals such as cu ni pd ag etc are reported to catalyze the formation of h parshetti and doong 2009 ran et al 2019 wang et al 2008 wu and feng 2016 these transition metals show high electrocatalytic hydrodechlorination performance by generating h avoiding the production of toxic incomplete dechlorination products lee et al 2013 lou et al 2019 however the fabrication of electrocatalytic cathode is complex and the electrochemical process needs additional electricity input which restricts their practical applications skadberg and geoly horn 1999 yao et al 2019 the bimetallic nanoparticles consisting of nano zero valent iron nzvi and a second catalytic metal also catalyze the generation of h in water which is promising for groundwater remediation fang et al 2018 he et al 2018 however nanoparticles such as nzvi is relatively expensive yang et al 2020 also a passive metal oxide layer readily forms on the surface of nanoparticles in water which inhibit the electron transfer and reduce the yield of h doong and lai 2005 shen et al 2018 therefore finding an efficient stable and easy to operate technique for h generation is urgent for tce removal ni atoms in synthesized ni fe layered double hydroxides ldh can provide h adsorption sites to enhance the dissociation of water gong et al 2014 liu

transferred by ni fe hydroxides framework inspired by this ni fe ldh catalyzed her process we speculated that electrons might also be donated by fe2 which lead to the generation of h by ni fe hydroxides with fe2 and ni2 in the metal framework the cooccurrence of ni2 and fe2 in anoxic groundwater has been reported larsen and postma 1997 lee et al 2007 although the cooccurrence of ni2 and fe2 is not common and the concentration of fe2 is usually higher than that of ni2 if they cooccur due to the abundance of iron minerals in subsurface environment wang et al 2021 the hydroxylation of fe2 and ni2 causing the formation of ni fe hydroxides in natural environment at near neutral ph cannot be ignored natural occurring iron based ldh mostly have fe3 in the metal framework because fe2 is readily oxidized in an ambient environment due to its strong reducibility fang et al 2019b huang et al 2018 the generation of h during the electron release process from ni fe hydroxides is rarely investigated it has been reported that tce usually coexists with heavy metals such as fe and ni in groundwater jeong and hayes 2007 however the natural attenuation of tce in the presence of ni2 and fe2 under neutral conditions has been scarcely studied in this work h involved dechlorination of tce by ni fe hydroxides at neutral ph was reported for the first time the generation of h was confirmed by electrochemical analysis and quenching experiments the utilization and selectivity efficiency of electrons were calculated and the morphological change of ni fe hydroxides after the hydrodechlorination was studied the mechanism of h involved hydrodechlorination is revealed by various crystallographic microscopic and surface chemistry methods 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals

hydroxides were synthesized in anoxic glovebox the synthesis method of ni fe hydroxides was detailed in text s1 ni fe hydroxides suspension 1 0 ml was moved into 10 ml glass vials and 4 0 ml oxygen free ultrapure water was added into glass vials the ph value of solution in glass vials was adjusted using 10 mm naoh twenty five µl saturated aqueous solution of tce 8 37 mm was injected into the 5 0 ml ni fe hydroxides suspensions to obtain a tce concentration of 42 µm which was then immediately capped with teflon lined lids all the experiments were conducted in an anoxic glovebox the reaction vials were shaken in a rotary agitator at 40 rpm the transformation from c2h4 to c2h6 was observed in a 50 ml glass vials with 25 ml ni fe hydroxides suspension and 25 ml headspace the injection port

by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes730 agilent usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 fast dechlorination of tce by ni fe hydroxides at neutral ph the removal of tce by ni fe hydroxides at neutral ph was fast with the removal efficiency reached 80 9 after 110 min of reaction fig 1 a the mass normalized pseudo first order rate constants km was 1 4 0 1 l h 1 g 1 which was higher than most of the reported iron based reductants supplementary table s1 during tce reduction trace concentrations of intermediates such as cis dce and 1 1 dichloroethylene 1 1 dce were detected supplementary fig s1 ethylene c2h4 and ethane c2h6 as the complete dechlorination products of tce were identified supplementary fig s2 whose contents were 29 3 and 35 8 after 110 min of reaction respectively the hydroxylation of fe2 or ni2 at neutral ph leads to the formation of fe oh 2 or ni oh 2 tce removal was negligible in the presence of fe oh 2 ni oh 2 or the physical mixture of fe oh 2 and ni oh 2 after 24 h supplementary fig s3 demonstrating fe oh 2 or ni oh 2 alone cannot reduce tce effectively in contrast the efficient transformation from tce to c2h4 and c2h6 demonstrated the extremely strong reducing activity of ni fe hydroxides the precipitated particles formed after reaction were collected for characterization tem image of the particles shows a typical hexagonal morphology of layered double hydroxide ldh with a lateral size of 600 nm fig 1b fang et al 2019c yin et al 2018 the edx spectra confirmed the ni fe ratio of the as formed ni fe hydroxide is 3 0 fig 1c supplementary table s2 xrd patterns fig 1d shows the diffraction peaks at 11 1 21 8 30 6 and 43 7 corresponding to 003 006 012 and 018 reflections of ni fe ldh interlayered with cl anions jcpds no 40 0216 duo et al 2018 fang et al 2019a in addition the two diffraction peaks at 13 5 and 26 9 can be assigned to fe oh 3 jcpds no 38 0032 high resolution ni 2p xps fig 1e shows the peaks at 855 7 and 861 8 ev belonging to ni2 shen et al 2018 high resolution fe 2p xps fig 1f indicates fe2 710 6 and 723 9 ev and fe3 712 5 and 725 9 ev existed in the particles after reaction gan et al 2020 these results demonstrate that fe2 is the only electron donor during the hydrodechlorination of tce after electrons transferring from ni fe hydroxides to tce ni fe hydroxides were transformed to ni fe ldh and fe oh 3 was also formed as confirmed by xrd data fig 1d it should be noted that the ni2 and fe2 cations at neutral ph may undergo very fast transformation from hydroxylated polycations ni fe hydroxide to ni fe ldh one can see the immediate color change and formation of precipitations during the aging process of ni2 and fe2 cations at neutral ph supplementary fig s4 although the characterization of the materials before reaction was done as fast as possible only ni fe ldh as the final transformed product was observed supplementary fig s5 thus ex situ solid state characterization could not capture the structural information of these ultrafast involved materials before reaction and sophisticated in situ characterization techquies are required 3 2 effect of metal dosage and ph hydrodechlorination of tce by ni fe hydroxides with various metal dosages was investigated supplementary fig s6 tce removal efficiency increased greatly with increasing the metal dosage the pseudo first order kinetics reaction rate constants k with different metal dosages were 0 006 min 1 ni 3 mm fe 1 mm 0 017 min 1 ni 6 mm fe 2 mm 0 047 min 1 ni 12 mm fe 3 mm and 0 127 min 1 ni 18 mm fe 6 mm the k values increase linearly with the metal dosage fig 2 a demonstrating high concentration of ni fe hydroxides enhance the removal of tce the concentration of dce was extremely low indicating the half life of chlorinated intermediates were short during the tce hydrodechlorination process fig 2b also the peak of dce concentration moved forward with increasing metal dosage which was attribute to the accelerated hydrodechlorination rates for the reduction of tce to dce the yield of c2h6 increased significantly with increasing metal dosage from 4 8 16 to 24 mm which were 9 3 35 8 70 5 and 84 5 after 110 min respectively fig 2c the production of c2h4 increased with reaction time when metal dosages were 4 and 8 mm fig 2d however the concentration of c2h4 increased firstly and then decreased when the metal dosage was 16 and 24 mm therefore h may be involved during the tce reduction leading to the hydrogenation of c2h4 to form c2h6 eq 1 furthermore pure c2h4 gas was injected into the reaction vials to verify the hydrogenation of c2h4 as shown in supplementary fig s7 c2h4 was continuously converted to c2h6 confirming the generation of h by ni fe hydroxides at neutral ph 1 c2h4 2h c2h6 the h can be produced via the catalytic reduction of h whose concentration is greatly influenced by the ph value therefore the effect of ph on tce reduction by ni fe hydroxides was investigated tce removal efficiency decreased significantly under acidic condition supplementary fig s8 because acidic environment inhibits the formation of metal hydroxides thus the transformation from free metal cations to metal hydroxides precipitates is vital for the electron transfer from fe2 to h and the subsequent h generation under the neutral and alkaline condition tce removal efficiency decreased with increasing ph value fig 3 a also the generation of complete dechlorination products including c2h4 and c2h6 was inhibited at alkaline conditions fig 3c d the highest concentration of dce during tce reduction increased from ph 7 0 to ph 9 5 due to the accumulation of dce intermediate which resulted from the weakened dechlorination activity at alkaline conditions fig 3b when the ph value increased from 9 5 to 11 5 the reduction of tce to dce was inhibited significantly although the dominant oh accelerate the formation of ni fe hydroxides h generated from the reduction of h may play a more critical role in the hydrodechlorination process of tce h obtained electron to form h according to eq 2 as an electron carrier h transfer electrons from fe2 to tce for hydrodechlorination 2 h e h it should be noted that the ph value did not change before and after reaction it is hypothesized that h is reduced to h h2 and oh could coordinate with the produced fe3 to form fe oh 3 as shown by the xrd data fig 1d as a result the ph is relatively constant along the reaction course 3 3 identification of h methanol and tba can effectively react with h to form h2 which were widely used as a h quencher eqs 3 4 chuang et al 1999 ran et al 2019 as shown in supplementary fig s9 the dechlorination of tce was inhibited significantly in the presence of 600 mm tba and methanol the carbon balance is 100 along the reaction course indicating the solvent effect may have little influence on the reaction since c2h4 and c2h6 are the dechlorination products and h is the only possible reductant that can reduce c2h4 to c2h6 in the system the c2h4 to c2h6 conversion was used as a probe reaction to further confirm the h quenching effect by methanol supplementary fig s10 shows the c2h4 to c2h6 conversion was greatly inhibited in the presence of 600 mm methanol and the conversion efficiency from c2h4 to c2h6 decreased 49 9 after 110 min of reaction thus the inhibited tce reduction in the presence of methanol is due to the quenching effect of methanol rather than the solvent effect due to the stronger h quenching effect of methanol than that of tba methanol with various concentrations was added into the reaction system to study the role of h tce removal efficiency decreased gradually with the increase of methanol concentration fig 4 a which demonstrated the scavenging of h by methanol in addition the production of c2h4 and c2h6 was also greatly inhibited by methanol demonstrating that h contribute to the hydrodechlorination of tce fig 4b the concentration of dce increased with the increase of methanol concentration proving that the insufficient amount of h results in the accumulation of incomplete dechlorination products therefore h contribute to the hydrodechlorination of tce 3 ch3oh h h2 ch3oh 4 c4h10o h h2 c4h9o electrochemical analysis was conducted to further identify the h species jiang et al 2017 cyclic voltammogram cv showed a prominent peak at 0 40 to 0 20 v fig 5 a text s5 corresponding to the oxidation peak of absorbed h bastide et al 2013 singh et al 2016 the oxidation peak of absorbed h disappeared once tce was added fig 5b demonstrating absorbed h can react with tce also h2 was detected during the coprecipitation of ni2 and fe2 at neutral ph supplementary fig s11 which can be attributed to the combination of h eq 5 thus the precipitated ni fe hydroxides can donate electrons to h in an aqueous solution which lead to the generation of h to hydrodechlorinate tce 5 h h h2 3 4 mechanism of h generation fe2 acts as an electron donor for tce reduction and the role of ni2 for tce hydrodechlorination needs further investigation thus tce dechlorination by ni fe hydroxides at neutral ph with different ni2 dosages and a fixed fe2 dosage 2 mm was investigated supplementary fig s12 ni fe ldh and fe oh 3 was formed as the oxidation products of ni fe hydroxides after reaction supplementary fig s13 the intensity of the xrd peaks for ni fe ldh increased with ni fe ratio due to the increased ni dosage but that for fe oh 3 remains constant since the fe dosage is constant supplementary fig s13 xps spectra show the presence of ni2 supplementary fig s14 and the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 after reaction supplementary fig s15 thus ni2 act as a catalyst rather than an electron donor during tce reduction hydrodechlorination of one carbon chlorine bond needs two electrons ai et al 2019 thus effective electrons for h involved tce hydrodechlorination was calculated based on the amount of hydrodechlorination intermediates and products the generation of dce needs two electrons and the formation of ethylene need six electrons the presence of ethane was attributed to the hydrogenation of ethylene the formation of which from tce reduction need eight electrons thus the effective electrons can be calculated according to eq 6 6 e e 2 c dce 6 c ethylene 8 c ethane c represents the concentration ee represents effective electrons the calculated ee value increased with time demonstrating the continuous hydrodechlorination of tce by ni fe hydroxides fig 6 a the utilized electrons eu are designated as the fraction of fe2 consumed after the reaction supplementary fig s16 thus the electron selectivity es can be calculated according to ee and eu values eq 7 which is used to assess the efficiency of consumed electrons for tce hydrodechlorination 7 e s e e e u as shown in fig 6b dechlorination by ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratio of 0 4 showed an extremely low es the es value increased greatly with the ni fe ratio increased from 0 4 to 2 0 in the initial reaction stage es with the ni fe ratio of 2 0 was high which quickly decreased with time for the ni fe ratio of 3 0 and 4 0 es was relatively low initially but increased with time notably the number of utilized electrons with different ni fe ratios are close supplementary fig s16 thus the difference in es value is most likely attributed to the different active species resulted from various ni fe ratios cvs of ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratio of 0 4 showed a prominent peak at 0 20 to 0 v corresponding to the oxidation of adsorbed h fig 7 a bastide et al 2013 singh et al 2016 the intensity of adsorbed h peak was higher than absorbed h peak indicating adsorbed h was dominant during the structure evolution of ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratio of 0 4 in water although the adsorbed h may be more active for hydrodechlorination reaction jiang et al 2017 the adsorbed h are readily combined to form h2 because the total metal concentration of ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratio of 0 4 was low the average sizes of particles were relatively small compared with the other ni fe hydroxides supplementary fig s17 although ni fe hydroxides with small particles size tent to collide more frequently a low dosage contrarily means a low collide frequency the net effect favored the combination of adsorbed h to form h2 which is in line with the low es of ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratio of 0 4 thus the electron efficiency for tce reduction was relatively low with the ni fe ratio of 0 4 which lead to the low es value with the ni fe ratio increased from 0 4 to 2 0 the oxidation peak of adsorbed h was weakened gradually fig 7b c although the production of adsorbed h decreased it is speculated that her was also weakened because the particle size of ni fe hydroxides was increased supplementary fig s17 more active adsorbed h can effectively act on the hydrodechlorination of tce therefore the es value was high in the initial stage of reaction with the ni fe ratio of 2 0 however the oxidation of fe2 in ni fe hydroxides accelerated the formation of ni fe ldh with a layer structure thereby reducing the surface area for the generation of adsorbed h as shown in supplementary fig s18 the arc radius in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis of ni fe hydroxides increased gradually with aging time demonstrating that the interfacial electron transfer rate slowed down along with the formation of ni fe ldh zhang et al 2019 therefore the es value decreased rapidly over time with the ni fe ratio of 2 0 as shown in figs 5a and 7d only absorbed h oxidation peak was detected with the ni fe ratios of 3 0 and 4 0 for the ni fe ratio of 3 0 the nyquist plot diameters of the ni fe hydroxides formed at 5 min 30 min and 80 min were similar demonstrating the interfacial electron transfer rate remained relatively constant supplementary fig s19 the formation of ldh structure leads to a decreased amount of active surface for the generation of adsorbed h however the absorbed h in ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratio of 3 0 was more efficient for tce dechlorination in the late stage of the reaction comparing with that with the ni fe ratio of 2 0 in order to fully reveal the atomic scale mechanism for the h generation on the ni fe hydroxides surface theoretical calculations were performed via dft the conformations of ni fe hydroxides with ni fe ratios of 1 3 2 2 and 3 1 each unit cell contains four metal atoms were optimized supplementary fig s20 when the ni fe ratio was 1 3 the length of fe o bonds 2 1 å and ni o bonds 2 4 å were similar when the ni fe ratio was 2 2 a part of fe o bonds were stretched to 3 1 å and a part of fe o bonds were compressed to 1 8 å while the length of ni o bonds was 2 1 å when the ni fe ratio was 3 1 the fe o bonds 2 0 å and ni o bonds 2 4 å were evenly distributed subsequently one h atom was added to the optimized configurations of ni fe hydroxides followed by re optimization as shown in fig 8 the conformation of ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratio of 3 1 was relatively stable after adding h atom comparing with ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratios of 1 3 and 2 2 the added h atom was located nearby ni atoms with a distance of 1 5 å when the ni fe ratio were 1 3 and 2 2 interestingly when the ni fe ratio was 3 1 the added h atom combined with the o atom of fe o bond to form a new ho bond according to previous publications the absorbed h located in the crystal lattice was inert for hydrodechlorination jiang et al 2017 however the added h atom in ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratio of 3 1 was further away from the central metal atoms because the charge between ni2 and fe2 was redistributed the electrons were transferred from fe2 to the ho bond and form absorbed h subsequently the absorbed h continuously contribute to the hydrodechlorination of tce along with the formation of ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratio of 3 1 when the ni fe ratio reaches 4 0 the excessive ni atoms may disperse the electrons of fe atoms inhibiting the electron transfer from fe2 to the ho bond thus the es of ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratio of 4 1 was lower than that of 3 1 fig 9 a summarized the structure evolution of ni2 and fe2 cation at neutral aqueous solution during the hydrodechlorination process dissolved fe2 and ni2 cations cannot lead to the generation of h because the free cations cannot transfer electrons to h at neutral or alkaline conditions ni oh 2 and fe oh 2 molecule is formed due to the effect of hydroxylation in aqueous solution christiansen et al 2009 jolivet et al 2004 the relatively weak reduction potentials of ni oh 2 and fe oh 2 did not result in any dechlorination process of tce then ni oh 2 and fe oh 2 combine to form ni fe hydroxides via olation during the olation process the electron could jump from fe2 to ni2 within the ni fe hydroxides due to galvanic effect which activate ni fe hydroxides for the catalytic reduction of h to form h because ni fe hydroxides with various ni fe ratios have different intrinsic properties the types of catalytically formed h are different for the low ni fe ratios of 0 4 and 1 adsorbed h on the surface of ni fe hydroxides is dominant which enhances her while inhibiting the hydrodechlorination process with the ni fe ratio increase to 2 0 the relatively weakened adsorbed h favor the tce dechlorination process when a part of fe2 is transformed to fe3 after reductive hydrodechlorination the ni fe hydroxides layer become positive thus charge compensating anions were inserted between the ni fe hydroxides layers forming ni fe ldh the formation of ldh reduces the surface area for the generation of adsorbed h which is unfavorable for the hydrodechlorination of tce when the ni fe ratio is lower than 2 0 the generated absorbed h is inert for hydrodechlorination in contrast absorbed h is activated in ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratio of 3 0 due to the unique conformation of h on ni fe hydroxides fig 9b although the amount of adsorbed h is relatively small in ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratio of 3 0 absorbed h results in a highly efficient hydrodechlorination of tce 3 5 application the secondary ni pollution could be of great concern in future application thus the concentration of the dissolved ni after reaction was determined after tce reduction a fraction of ni 10 65 0 01 mg l 1 and fe 5 10 0 10 mg l 1 were released into the reaction solution due to the possible dissolution of ni fe hydroxides although relatively high concentration was observed in the studied experimental conditions the concentration of the dissolved ni was only 1 5 of the total ni dosage nevertheless low ni dosage is recommended in practical application to avoid secondary ni pollution which could lead to a longer remediation time than that reported in this work dioxygen may be introduced into the subsurface environment due to natural and anthropogenic perturbations as a common environmental oxidant dissolved oxygen may exert great influence on the reductive dechlorination of tce by ni fe hydroxides when ultrapure water with 10 53 mg l 1 of dissolved oxygen was used the tce removal efficiency reached 97 5 and the c2h4 generation reached 47 3 after 200 min of reaction supplementary fig s21a although the presence of dissolved oxygen inhibited the tce reduction due to the scavenger of h the remaining h can still completely dechlorinate tce after 200 min of reaction to further evaluate the applicability of ni fe hydroxides in groundwater remediation the dechlorination reaction was carried out in real groundwater the parameters of the real groundwater were listed in supplementary table s3 as shown in supplementary fig s21b 55 5 of tce was dechlorinated by ni fe hydroxides in the real groundwater matrix the presence of no3 in real groundwater can react with h to form nh4 chen et al 2020 which may inhibits the tce reduction by ni fe hydroxides the oxygenation of groundwater further inhibits the tce reduction supplementary fig s21c still 26 3 of tce was dechlorinated demonstrating the high selectivity of the produced h towards tce reduction in the presence of environmental oxidants i e dissolved oxygen and no3 nevertheless the absence of environmental oxidants is strongly desired since their presence significantly inhibit the tce reduction by ni fe hydroxides lower concentrations of ni and fe ions were observed in the groundwater than ultrapure water which could be attributed to the sorption of metal cations by dissolved organic matters that exist in the groundwater supplementary table s4 4 conclusions in this work we found that h can be efficiently generated during the transformation of ni2 and fe2 to ni fe hydroxides in water at neutral ph the as formed h contribute to the hydrodechlorination of tce in aqueous solution nontoxic ethane and ethylene were the dechlorination products due to the high reductive activity of h for ni fe hydroxides with the ni fe ratio of 0 4 the presence of dominant adsorbed h enhances her causing a low efficiency for hydrodechlorination when the ni fe ratio was 2 0 the weakly adsorbed h results in efficient hydrodechlorination of tce in the initial stage of reaction notably the active absorbed h is generated in the crystal lattice of ni fe hydroxides with the 3 0 ni fe ratio causing continuous and efficient hydrodechlorination of tce fe2 and ni2 may exist together in anoxic subsurface environment thus ni fe hydroxides can be formed in some area of groundwater under neutral and alkaline condition this work provides new evidence for the fate and transformation of tce in subsurface environment also injection of fe2 and ni2 into polluted plume could be a promising strategy for the remediation of tce contaminated groundwater declaration of competing interest the authors declare

16494,in this study a commonly used reducing agent hydroxylamine ha was introduced into fe ii paa process to improve its oxidation capacity the ha fe ii paa process possessed high oxidation performance for diclofenac degradation even with trace fe ii dosage i e 1 μm at ph of 3 0 to 6 0 based on electron paramagnetic resonance technology methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso based probe experiments and alcohol quenching experiments feivo2 and carbon centered radicals r o were considered as the primary reactive species responsible for diclofenac elimination ha accelerated the redox cycle of fe iii fe ii and itself was gradually decomposed to n2 n2o no2 and no3 and the environmentally friendly gas of n2 was considered as the major decomposition product of ha four possible degradation pathways of diclofenac were proposed based on seven detected intermediate products both elevated dosages of fe ii and paa promoted diclofenac removal cl hco3 and so4 2 had negligible impacts on diclofenac degradation while humic acid exhibited an inhibitory effect the oxidation capacity of ha fe ii paa process in natural water matrices and its application to degrade various micropollutants were also investigated this study proposed a promising strategy for improving the fe ii paa process and highlighted its potential application in water treatment graphical abstract

irradiation cai et al 2017 zhang and huang 2020 heat cai et al 2022 wang et al 2020a transition metals e g metal oxides and metal ions chen et al 2020 kim et al 2020 2019 lin et al 2021 wang et al 2021a 2021b 2020b wang et al 2020c 2020d wu et al 2020 and activated carbon fibers zhou et al 2015 among these activation methods fe ii is considered to be an excellent activator for paa due to the fact that fe ii is low toxic environmentally ubiquitious inexpensive and highly reactive carlos et al 2021 ghanbari et al 2021 kim et al 2019 fe ii activated paa could produce multiple reactive

effective for degrading various micropollutants in wastewater treatment nevertheless being restricted to the slow transformation from fe iii to fe ii k 2 72 0 38 m 1 s 1 kim et al 2019 fe ii paa process has some intrinsic drawbacks including the need for high fe ii dosage and the accumulation of ferric oxide sludge several strategies have been proposed to accelerate the redox of fe iii fe ii and enhance the oxidation capacity of fe ii paa process chen et al 2020 ghanbari et al 2021 lin et al 2021 nevertheless the extra energy input of uv could extremely limit the application of uv enhanced fe ii paa process in actual water treatment meanwhile the addition of 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenz othiazoline 6 sulfonate abts as electron shuttle into fe ii paa process would turn the color of reaction solution green therefore it is of great significance to search cost effective and environmental friendly strategies to improve the oxidation capacity of fe ii paa process hydroxylamine ha a well known fe iii reducing agent has been commonly used to reduce fe iii to fe ii rapidly in the determination of total iron herrera et al 1989 recently researches have demonstrated that ha could act as a promoter to enhance the degradation of micropollutants in fenton and fenton like processes by accelerating the recycle of fe iii fe ii chen et al 2011 dai et al 2021 li et al 2020 liu et al 2020 zou et al 2013 unlike abts as electron shuttle in abts enhanced fe ii paa process ha would be continually decomposed and its main decomposition product is eco friendly n2 in ha enhanced fenton and fenton like processes duan et al 2021 liu et al 2017 zou et al 2013 considering the similar drawback i e slow recycle of fe iii fe ii in fe ii paa process and fenton process it is rational to speculate that the addition of ha could also enhance the oxidation capacity of fe ii paa process by accelerating the transformation from fe iii to fe ii nevertheless to our best knowledge there is no report about the addition of ha to enhance the oxidation capacity of fe ii paa process herein ha enhanced fe ii paa process was proposed for the first time and diclofenac dcf a typical pharmaceutical pollutant was selected as the target compound to investigate the oxidation capacity of ha fe ii paa process the details of this study mainly focused on i the enhanced degradation efficiency of dcf ii the identification of primary reactive species iii the reaction mechanism iv the effects of reaction parameters and coexistent constituents and v the applicability of ha fe ii paa process in natural water matrices and for the treatment of various micropollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals paa stock solution around 15 paa was prepared by the reaction of 20 ml a solution acetic acid and 10 ml b solution h2o2 and stored at 4 c before use solutions of a and b were all purchased from xiya chemical technology co ltd shandong china concentrations of paa and coexistent h2o2 in paa stock solution were determined with our previously reported iodometric spectrophotometry wang et al 2021c xiao et al 2019 and the molar ratio of paa h2o2 and paa acetic acid in the prepared paa stock solution were around 2 5 and 0 19 respectively iron sulfate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china hydroxylamine sulfate nh2oh 2 h2so4 ha and diclofenac c14h11c12no2 dcf were obtained from aladdin bio chem technology co ltd shanghai china other chemicals and reagents were listed in text s1 in the supporting information si 2 2 experimental procedures dcf degradation experiments were all performed in 100 ml conical flasks with constant magnetic stirring at a temperature of 25 1 c desired dosages of reagents except for fe ii were firstly added into flask then the reaction was initiated by adding desired fe ii dosage into the solution the initial ph of reaction solution was adjusted with 1 m of sodium hydroxide and 1 m of perchloric acid without adding any ph buffer solutions during the reaction process values of ph almost remained unchanged under acidic conditions and were dropped slightly in the ph range of 6 0 9 0 fig s1 note that the natural water samples used for dcf degradation were firstly acidized to ph around 4 5 by adding 200 μl 1 m of perchloric acid into 50 ml natural water samples sample aliquots 1 ml were withdrawn from flasks at predetermined time intervals and put into glass vials containing excess sodium thiosulfate na 2s2o3 peroxide 10 where peroxide means the total concentrations of paa and coexistent h2o2 to quench dcf degradation to explore the role of feivo2 r o and oh quenching experiments with different alcohols i e tert butyl alcohol tba and methanol meoh were conducted by adding desired alcohols dosage into the reaction solution before fe ii addition tba reacts more rapidly with oh k 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 than with feivo2 k 6 0 101 m 1 s 1 zong et al 2021 and has no effect on r o cai et al 2017 meoh could scavenge both r o wang et al 2020d and feivo2 k 2 5 103 m 1 s 1 pestovsky and bakac 2004 all experiments were performed at least twice and the errors representing the standard deviation were shown in figures 2 3 analytical methods the quantification of dcf was determined by a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc agilent 1220 equipped with an agilent tcc18 2 column 5 μm 150 mm 4 6 mm huang et al 2021 the mobile phases were 0 1 acetic acid solution a and acetonitrile b with a ratio of 35 65 v v at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 the column temperature and detection wavelength were set at 35 c and 274 nm respectively degradation products of dcf were analyzed by ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uplc q tof ms and the detailed parameters were described in our previous study lin et al 2021 the concentration of ha was measured by a spectrophotometric method frear and burrell 1955 the concentration of fe iii was directly measured by a spectrophotometric method at 300 nm scharf 1971 using a 5 cm quartz cell with an uv vis spectrophotometer tu 1901 persee instruments china the concentration of total dissolved nitrogen tdn was measured by a multi n c 3100 analyzer jena germany the concentrations of no2 and no3 were measured by an ion chromatography 930 compact ic china and the detailed parameters were shown in si text s2 other analytical methods are also described in si text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhanced degradation efficiency of dcf in ha fe ii paa process to explore the oxidation capacity of ha fe ii paa process the degradation of dcf was comparatively conducted in different processes as shown in fig 1 a there was almost no dcf removal in both paa alone and ha fe ii process which could be due to the negligible generation of reactive species meanwhile neither fe ii paa nor ha paa process could effectively degrade dcf with the removal efficiency of 6 and 4 respectively the low degradation efficiency of dcf in fe ii paa process could be ascribed to the extremely low dosage of fe ii i e 1 μm increasing the dosage of fe ii to 5 μm the degradation efficiency of dcf was also increased to about 20 fig s2 indeed dcf degradation in fe ii paa process experienced two stage i e the rapid stage and the slow stage the rapid stage is mainly ascribed to the fast reaction between fe ii and paa and the slow stage is mainly ascribed to the slow transformation of fe iii to fe ii therefore the aim of the addition of ha into fe ii paa process is to accelerate the recycle of fe iii fe ii and thus enhance the oxidation capacity of fe ii paa process as expected the addition of ha into fe ii paa process remarkably enhanced the degradation of dcf nearly 95 dcf was removed within 10 min in ha fe ii paa process suggesting that ha could improve the oxidation capacity of fe ii paa process it was further observed that ha fe ii paa process possessed much higher dcf degradation rate compared with our previously reported abts fe ii paa process lin et al 2021 indicating that ha might be superior to abts for enhancing fe ii paa process further the degradation efficiencies of dcf were also investigated in several common seen ha enhanced aops i e ha fe ii h2o2 ha fe ii peroxymonosulfate pms ha fe ii peroxydisulfate pds and ha fe ii sodium percarbonate spc chen et al 2011 li et al 2021a miao et al 2015 zou et al 2013 as shown in fig 1 b ha fe ii paa process far outperformed ha fe ii h2o2 ha fe ii pds and ha fe ii spc under current conditions and the removal efficiency of dcf in ha fe ii paa process was comparable to that in ha fe ii pms process the various degradation efficiencies for dcf in these aops might be mainly ascribed to the different reaction rate between fe ii and peroxides namely k fe ii h2o2 41 76 m 1 s 1 k fe ii pms 3 0 104 m 1 s 1 k fe ii pds 12 26 m 1 s 1 and k fe ii paa 1 10 105 1 56 104 m 1 s 1 brandt et al 1995 kim et al 2019 overall the proposed ha fe ii paa process might be an alternative and promising aop in water treatment considering that paa solution is a quaternary equilibrium mixture in which another peroxide h2o2 also exists zhang et al 2018 it was also essential to explore the possible contribution of h2o2 for dcf degradation in ha fe ii paa process in our used paa stock solution around 40 μm h2o2 was coexisted when 100 μm paa was added into ha fe ii paa process fig s3a shows that almost no dcf degradation was observed in fe ii h2o2 process and only less than 15 dcf was degraded within 10 min in ha fe ii h2o2 process in addition fig s3b shows that paa was rapidly decomposed along with dcf degradation while the concentration of the coexistent h2o2 was almost unchanged in ha fe ii paa process these results demonstrated that it was paa rather than the coexistent h2o2 in paa solution was the primary peroxide accounting for dcf degradation in ha fe ii paa process 3 2 identification of primary reactive species in ha fe ii paa process multiple reactive species including feivo2 r o and oh may exist in fe ii paa process according to previous report kim et al 2019 possible reactions eqs 1 6 are as follows 1 ch3c o ooh fe ii ch3c o oh feivo2 2 ch3c o ooh fe ii ch3c o o fe iii oh 3 ch3c o ooh fe ii ch3c o o fe iii oh 4 ch3c o ooh ch3c o o ch3c o oo ch3c o oh 5 h2o2 fe ii oh fe iii oh 6 h2o2 fe ii h2o feivo2 it seems likely that the abovementioned reactive species could also be produced in ha fe ii paa process methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso was used to investigate the occurrence of feivo2 considering the fact that pmso can be oxidized by feivo2 to methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 which is different from radical based reaction e g oh and r o liu et al 2021 pang et al 2011 moreover paa and h2o2 were not effective to pmso fig s4 which was consistent with previous report liu et al 2021 therefore as shown in fig 2 around 75 of the yield of pmso2 i e η pmso2 δ pmso2 δ pmso greatly suggested the generation of feivo2 in ha fe ii paa process to further ascertain the reactive species in ha fe ii paa process electron paramagnetic resonance epr experiments using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrolin n oxide dmpo as a spin trapping reagent were performed as illustrated in fig 3 a specific spectrum hyperfine splitting constants of an ah 14 9 g with intensities ratio of 1 2 2 1 were obtained in both fe ii paa and ha fe ii paa processes the intensity in ha fe ii paa process was much stronger than that in fe ii paa process suggesting the promoted generation of reactive species with the addition of ha in fe ii paa process this signal was generally consistent with that of dmpooh adduct chen et al 2011 wang et al 2020a zou et al 2013 suggesting the probable occurrence of oh in ha fe ii paa process nevertheless previous reports demonstrated that the formation of dmpooh adduct might also be attributed to the oxidation of dmpo by feivo2 liang et al 2020 wang et al 2018 zong et al 2021 tba has a high rate constant with oh k 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 but relatively lower rate constant with feivo2 k 6 0 101 m 1 s 1 zong et al 2021 while dimethyl sulfoxide dmso is highly reactive to both oh k 6 6 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 and feivo2 k 1 4 105 m 1 s 1 zong et al 2021 accordingly tba and dmso were used to further distinguish the contributions of feivo2 and oh on the formation of dmpooh adduct surprisingly the dmpooh signal was still very strong in the presence of 2500 mm tba while the addition of 250 mm dmso almost completely reduced the dmpooh signal fig 3 the epr results demonstrated that both feivo2 and oh might contribute to the dmpooh while feivo2 makes more contribution than oh since tba could react with feivo2 at k 6 0 101 m 1 s 1 zong et al 2021 the added 2500 mm tba might also scavenge partial feivo2 and thus led to the reduction of the intensity of dmpooh signal to some extent as a result the epr results observed in fig 3 was still insufficient for us to verify or exclude the production of oh in ha fe ii paa process in addition there was another weak dmpox signal in ha fe ii paa process which was also observed in other paa based oxidation processes wang et al 2021b 2020d the dmpox signal might be generated via the oxidation of dmpo by r o i e ch3c o o and ch3c o oo unfortunately the contribution of r o for dmpox signal generation is still largely unknown and is also a challenge in paa based oxidation processes to further identify the primary reactive species accounting for dcf degradation tba and meoh were used as the alcohols to conduct quenching experiments tba was used to differentiate the contribution of feivo2 r o and oh on dcf degradation due to the fact that tba has a higher rate constant with oh k 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 than with feivo2 k 6 0 101 m 1 s 1 zong et al 2021 and tba has no effect on r o cai et al 2017 the reaction rate constant of dcf reacting with oh is 7 5 109 m 1 s 1 huber et al 2003 thus 10 mm tba is sufficient to quench the reaction between 5 μm dcf and the possible existence of oh as shown in fig 4 there was no inhibitory effect on dcf degradation with the addition of 10 mm tba further increasing the concentration of tba to 1000 mm still exhibited no obvious inhibitory effect this phenomenon indicated that oh was not the primary reactive species in current study in addition benzoic acid ba a common probe of oh chen et al 2011 was slightly degraded in ha fe ii paa process fig s5 which could be another evidence for the minor role of oh in dcf degradation meoh a powerful scavenger for both r o wang et al 2020d and feivo2 k 2 5 103 m 1 s 1 pestovsky and bakac 2004 was added to further assess the contributions of feivo2 and r o on dcf degradation fig 4 shows that there was an obvious inhibitory effect on dcf degradation in the presence of 10 mm meoh and the addition of 1000 mm meoh completely inhibited dcf degradation these results indicated that feivo2 and or r o made primary contribution on dcf degradation according to the relatively high value of η pmso2 about 75 fig 2 feivo2 might play a more important role for dcf degradation than r o in ha fe ii paa process unfortunately due to the lack of k r o meoh k r o dcf and k fe iv o 2 dcf currently the addition of meoh was still hard to exactly differentiate the respective contribution of feivo2 and r o on dcf degradation more efforts should be made to differentiate the contribution of feivo2 and r o on dcf degradation in future study in summary based on above results and analysis it could make a conclusion that feivo2 and r o rather than oh were major reactive species responsible for dcf degradation in current study 3 3 reaction mechanism of ha fe ii paa process 3 3 1 role of ha the addition of ha into fe ii paa process is expected to alleviate the accumulation of fe iii and promote the regeneration of fe ii thus the variations of fe iii concentration were monitored in fe ii paa process with and without ha as shown in fig 5 a almost all of fe ii was rapidly transformed to fe iii within 15 s in fe ii paa process and then fe iii concentration kept relatively unchanged this phenomenon could be ascribed to the fast reaction between fe ii and paa but extremely slow reduction from fe iii to fe ii in fe ii paa process as expected in ha fe ii paa process only about 90 of fe ii was fastly transformed into fe iii within 15 s and then fe iii concentration kept relatively constant within 5 min however after 5 min the fe iii concentration began to decrease slowly which could be ascribed to the rapid paa decomposition and extremely low residual paa concentration after 5 min inset in fig 5 a it was worth noting that 1 μm of fe iii rapidly decreased to almost zero with 100 μm ha at ph 4 5 when no paa existed fig s6 hence the fe iii concentration was in dynamic circulation i e fe ii fe iii cycle in ha fe ii paa process and would be changed with the variations of ha and paa concentrations correspondingly the decrease of paa in ha fe ii paa process was also much more faster than that in ha paa and fe ii paa processes inset in fig 5 a these results demonstrated that the addition of ha into fe ii paa process promoted paa decomposition leading to more reactive species generation and faster dcf degradation to better understand the role of ha the degradation of dcf with different ha concentration in ha fe ii paa process was also studied as shown in fig 5 b the degradation efficiency of dcf increased markedly from 5 to 95 within 10 min by increasing ha dosage from 0 μm to 100 μm however further elevating ha dosage to 400 μm exhibited an inhibitory effect on dcf degradation interestingly paa decomposition was continually accelerated along with the increase of ha dosage over the range of 0 μm to 400 μm fig s7 these results demonstrated that excess ha could be a competitor with dcf for reactive species although the generation of reactive species was accelerated therefore a proper dosage of ha should be applied in ha fe ii paa process to obtain the best oxidation performance 3 3 2 decomposition of ha and its end products as shown in fig 6 a ha was also gradually decomposed along with dcf degradation fig 1 and paa decomposition fig 5 a in ha fe ii paa process note that the reaction between ha and paa could be ignored according to the extremely slight decomposition of paa in ha paa process fig 5 a therefore ha should be mainly decomposed by reducing fe iii to fe ii via eq 7 chen et al 2011 zou et al 2013 in addition ha might also be decomposed by reacting with reactive species e g feivo2 via eq 8 johnson and hornstein 2003 n2 n2o no2 and no3 are commonly considered as the major end decomposition products of ha when ha reacts with fe iii and feivo2 via eqs 7 13 duan et al 2021 johnson and hornstein 2003 zou et al 2013 7 fe iii nh2oh nh2o fe ii h 8 feivo2 nh2oh nho fe ii 9 2nh2o n2 2h2o 10 fe iii nh2o nho fe ii h 11 2nho n2o h2o 12 5fe iii nh2o 2h2o no3 5fe ii 6h 13 no3 nh2oh oh no no2 h2o to identify the final decomposition products of ha in ha fe ii paa process the concentrations of total dissolved nitrogen tdn kjeldahl nitrogen ha no2 and no3 were determined and the concentrations of n2 and n2o were calculated according to text s3 as shown in fig 6 b ha was decomposed to n2 n2o no2 and no3 and the eco friendly gas of n2 was the primary product of ha in ha fe ii paa process although the greenhouse gas of n2o is sometimes considered as the main end product of the reaction between ha and fe iii butler and gordon 1986 chen et al 2011 many reports have demonstrated that n2 is the main end product of ha when ha concentration is higher than fe iii concentration bengtsson et al 2002 zou et al 2013 as illustrated in figs 5 a and 6 a ha concentration was ranged in 30 100 μm while fe iii concentration was less than 1 μm namely ha concentration invariably exceeded fe iii concentration during the degradation of dcf with ha fe ii paa process in addition the concentration of nitrate and nitrite after reaction was calculated to be around 0 31 mg l 1 and 0 11 mg l 1 respectively both of them are much lower than the regulation limits for nitrate and nitrite set by the united state environmental protection agency usepa 10 mg l 1 and 1 mg l 1 respectively usepa 2009 nevertheless given that ha at the initial concentration of 100 μm was not completely decomposed in current study the concentration of nitrate and nitrite might be increased after ha complete decomposition and would be higher if the initial dosage of ha was increased therefore an appropriate concentration of ha should be applied in ha fe ii paa process to avoid the secondary contamination 3 3 3 degradation products and pathways of dcf uplc q tof ms was employed to investigated the degradation products of dcf in ha fe ⅱ paa process seven products were identified and their detailed information including the chemical formula and mass over charge ratio m z were provided in table s1 these products were formulated as tp1 to tp7 respectively based on the identified seven products four possible degradation pathways were proposed and presented in fig 7 in pathway 1 tp1 was produced via decarboxylation from acetic acid group in the lateral chain of dcf through electron transfer the decarboxylation might result from the attack on phenylacetic acid structure on dcf by organic radicals which was similar to that in cu ii activated paa for dcf degradation wang et al 2021d similar products were also observed in other dcf oxidation processes using the fe ii paa and ferrate vi wang et al 2020c zhao et al 2018 tp2 was then produced by the hydroxylation of tp1 the hydroxylation might result from the attack on aromatic ring which has high electron density through electron transfer wang et al 2020c formylation occurred where the methyl group in tp2 was further oxidized to produce formyl group and tp3 was formed indeed tp3 was also detected in the degradation of dcf by uv paa process zhang et al 2020 in pathway 2 tp4 was produced via dechlorination cyclization which underwent intramolecular electron transfer and subsequently tp5 was produced by replacing chlorine atom with hydroxyl group via dechlorination hydroxylation from tp4 moreover this pathway might also be supported by the fact that chloride ion around 0 16 mg l 1 was detected after reaction similar pathway was also reported in uv paa process during dcf degradation zhang et al 2020 for pathways 3 and 4 the detected products of tp6 and tp7 were proposed to be produced by the cleavage of active radicals in cn bond from the hydroxylation products of dcf i e tp8 and tp9 tp6 and tp7 were also detected in the degradation of dcf using ferrate vi zhao et al 2018 and fe ii paa process wang et al 2020c though tp8 and tp9 were not detected in current study they have been found in other dcf oxidation processes e g fe ii paa and uv paa wang et al 2020c zhang et al 2020 according to a previous report the amine nitrogen of dcf was attacked via o3 addition during ozonation process sein et al 2008 however no similar products were detected in this study which might need further exploration in addition to evaluate the mineralization of dcf the change of total organic carbon toc concentration during the reaction was determined however no obvious decrease on toc was observed within 10 min data not shown 3 3 4 proposed ha enhanced mechanism according to the above results and discussion the possible ha enhanced mechanism during dcf degradation with ha fe ii paa process was proposed and summarized in scheme 1 firstly paa was rapidly activated by fe ii producing feivo2 r o and fe iii via eqs 1 3 dcf was then degraded by the produced feivo2 and r o fe ii was regenerated by reducing fe iii and feivo2 with ha via eqs 7 and 8 and ha was decomposed to n2 n2o no2 and no3 though ha might be a scavenger of feivo2 for competing with dcf the positive role of ha of promoting the regeneration of fe ii predominates under current study in summary the addition of ha into fe ii paa process promoted the redox cycle of fe iii fe ii and the generation of feivo2 and r o leading to an enhanced performance of dcf degradation 3 4 effects of reaction parameters and coexistent constituents 3 4 1 effect of ph it has been reported in previous researches that the oxidation performance of iron based aops is greatly affected by ph values because of the fe iii precipitation chen et al 2011 2020 zou et al 2013 hence it is of great necessity to evaluate the effect of solution ph on dcf degradation in ha fe ii paa process as displayed in fig 8 a the degradation efficiency of dcf was strongly increased from 15 to 95 with the increase of ph from 2 0 to 4 5 correspondingly the pseudo first order reaction rate k obs of dcf degradation increased significantly from 0 034 to 0 582 min 1 fig s8 however further increasing the ph from 5 0 to 9 0 showed inhibitory effects on dcf degradation with the degradation efficiency of dcf and corresponding k obs decreased from 90 to 1 and 0 523 to 0 001 min 1 respectively the inhibition phenomenon could be mainly ascribed to the formation of fe iii precipitation at elevated ph stefánsson 2007 which was difficult to regenerate fe ii in the presence of ha via eq 7 as shown in fig s9 the decomposition of paa increased with ph increased from 2 0 to 4 5 implying that more reactive species i e feivo2 and r o were produced with the increase of ph as expected paa decomposition decreased with the further increase of ph from 5 0 to 9 0 demonstrating the less production of feivo2 and r o with the further increase of ph moreover since the pk a value of ha is 5 96 duan et al 2021 nh2oh became the predominant form of ha with ph increasing up from 5 0 to 9 0 fig s10 compared with the protonated form of ha i e nh3oh nh2oh is commonly considered to be more prone to reacting with various reactive species e g oh and so4 buxton et al 1988 zou et al 2013 hence at elevated ph more reactive species generated in ha fe ii paa process would be ineffectively consumed by ha 3 4 2 effects of fe ii paa and coexistent h2o2 and acetic acid fe ii and paa concentrations play an important role in ha fe ii paa process since the formation reactive species are closely related to the reaction between fe ii and paa as fig 8 b shows with the increase of fe ii concentration from 0 00 to 5 00 μm the removal efficiency of dcf increased significantly from 5 to nearly 100 and the corresponding k obs increased from 0 009 to 1 607 min 1 fig s11a it is worth noting that trace iron e g 0 5 μm could still exhibit a high degradation efficiency of dcf such low concentration of iron exists extensively in actual water bodies liu et al 2020 sekomo et al 2012 similarly the enhanced performance of dcf degradation were also observed when increasing paa concentrations fig 8 c the removal of dcf was enhanced remarkably from 48 to nearly 100 when paa concentration increased from 25 μm to 200 μm with the corresponding k obs increasing from 0 192 to 0 689 min 1 fig s11b the enhanced degradation of dcf at higher fe ii and paa concentrations was likely ascribed to the more formation of reactive species i e feivo2 and r o additionally considering the coexistence of h2o2 and acetic acid in paa solution the impacts of h2o2 and acetic acid concentrations on dcf removal were also evaluated as shown in figs s12a and s12b there was no obvious effect on dcf degradation when additional h2o2 40 160 μm or acetic acid 0 2 2 0 mm was added these phenomena indicated that the relatively low concentrations of coexistent h2o2 and acetic acid in paa solution played a negligible role on dcf elimination in ha fe ii paa process 3 4 3 effects of cl hco3 so4 2 and humic acid to assess the applicability of ha fe ii paa process the effects of common constituents in water e g cl hco3 so4 2 and humic acid on dcf degradation were investigated interestingly cl hco3 and so4 2 all showed a negligible impact on dcf degradation figs s13 s14 and s15 these results indicated that ha fe ii paa process was insusceptible to these inorganic anions in many radicals e g oh and so4 mediated aops the presence of cl and hco3 could quench radicals and inhibit the degradation of micropollutants wang and wang 2021 thus ha fe ii paa process might be a promising aop for micropollutants elimination in real water treatment nevertheless humic acid a representative of natural organic matter nom in water showed an inhibitory effect on dcf degradation the degradation efficiency of dcf greatly decreased from 95 to 5 as the concentration of humic acid increased from 0 to 10 mg l 1 fig 8 d and the corresponding k obs decreased from 0 582 to 0 004 min 1 fig s16 the inhibition of humic acid on dcf degradation might be mainly ascribed to the complexation of iron by humic acid karlsson and persson 2012 ritter et al 2006 and the scavenging of feivo2 and r o by humic acid chen et al 2019 shao et al 2018 zong et al 2021 as can be seen in fig s17 paa decomposition indeed decreased with the increase of humic acid concentration this result demonstrated that the complexation of iron by humic acid should be the major reason for the inhibition of humic acid on dcf degradation as expected increasing fe ii concentration significantly improved dcf degradation and alleviated the inhibition effect of humic acid on dcf degradation in ha fe ii paa process fig s18 vs fig 8 d this phenomenon indicated that higher dosage of fe ii is imperative for the rapid degradation of micropollutants in actual waters containing high concentration of nom 3 5 applicability of ha fe ii paa process 3 5 1 degradation of dcf in natural water samples the degradation of dcf with ha fe ii paa process in two different natural water samples was further evaluated as shown in fig 9 a it was observed that dcf degradation in natural water matrices was inhibited to different extent and the degradation efficiency of dcf in reservoir water was much lower than that in underground water note that the concentration of toc in reservoir water was much higher than that in underground water table s2 based on the facts that toc represents the content of nom and humic acid could inhibit the degradation of dcf fig 8 d it was rational to infer that the inhibition of natural water matrices on dcf degradation was mainly ascribed to the complexation of iron by the coexistent nom expectedly with higher fe ii concentration i e 5 μm vs 1 μm ha fe ii paa process was highly efficient for degrading dcf in real water matrices accordingly to obtain a better degradation efficiency of pollutants with ha fe ii paa process in real water matrices an appropriate fe ii concentration should be applied 3 5 2 degradation of different micropollutants to further evaluate the applicability of ha fe ii paa process experiments for degrading other micropollutants including indole naproxen npx acetaminophen ace ibuprofen ibp and carbamazepine cbz were conducted as shown in fig 9 b ha fe ii paa process had an outstanding oxidation performance on dcf indole and npx with degradation efficiencies of 95 90 and 68 respectively however only approximately 22 of ace 15 of ibp and 10 of cbz were oxidized within 10 min the selective oxidation of micropollutants with ha fe ii paa process could be ascribed to the high selectivity of feivo2 and r o cai et al 2017 dong et al 2020 zong et al 2021 thus unlike oh and so4 mediated ha fe ii pms process and oh mediated ha fenton process chen et al 2011 li et al 2021b zou et al 2013 ha fe ii paa process possessed high selectivity to micropollutants which is similar to our previously reported abts enhanced fe ii paa process lin et al 2021 unfortunately due to the lack of detailed rate constants of feivo2 and r o with these selected micropollutants more efforts should be made in the future to better understand the selective oxidation ability of ha fe ii paa process it could also be noted that cbz and ibp which could both easily react with oh k ohcbz 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 k oh ibp 3 43 109 m 1 s 1 cai et al 2021 yang et al 2017 were slightly degraded in ha fe ii paa process these results also supported our previous conclusion section 3 2 that oh played a negligible role in this study 4 conclusions this study proposed a novel strategy i e adding ha to enhance the oxidation capacity of fe ii paa process by accelerating the redox cycle of fe iii fe ii the proposed ha fe ii paa process was highly efficient for dcf elimination over the ph range of 3 0 6 0 feivo2 and r o were identified as primary reactive species responsible for dcf elimination via experiments of epr pmso oxidation and alcohols quenching seven different intermediate products of dcf were identified by uplc q tof ms and four corresponding degradation pathways were proposed reaction mechanism of ha fe ii paa process was proposed feivo2 r o and fe iii were firstly produced via the rapid reaction of fe ii and paa and then dcf was degraded by feivo2 and r o fe ii was regenerated via the reactions of fe iii and feivo2 with ha elevated dosages of fe ii and paa were beneficial for dcf removal the coexistent h2o2 and acetic acid in paa solution and the common inorganic anions e g cl hco3 and so4 2 showed negligible impacts on dcf removal though dcf degradation was inhibited in the presence of humic acid the inhibition effect could be greatly alleviated by increasing the dosage of fe ii ha fe ii paa process possessed high selectivity towards micropollutants and was highly efficient to degrade dcf in natural water matrices in addition ha was gradually decomposed to n2 n2o no2 and no3 and the eco friendly gas of n2 was its major decomposition product overall ha fe ii paa process is a promising approach and has potential

16494,in this study a commonly used reducing agent hydroxylamine ha was introduced into fe ii paa process to improve its oxidation capacity the ha fe ii paa process possessed high oxidation performance for diclofenac degradation even with trace fe ii dosage i e 1 μm at ph of 3 0 to 6 0 based on electron paramagnetic resonance technology methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso based probe experiments and alcohol quenching experiments feivo2 and carbon centered radicals r o were considered as the primary reactive species responsible for diclofenac elimination ha accelerated the redox cycle of fe iii fe ii and itself was gradually decomposed to n2 n2o no2 and no3 and the environmentally friendly gas of n2 was considered as the major decomposition product of ha four possible degradation pathways of diclofenac were proposed based on seven detected intermediate products both elevated dosages of fe ii and paa promoted diclofenac removal cl hco3 and so4 2 had negligible impacts on diclofenac degradation while humic acid exhibited an inhibitory effect the oxidation capacity of ha fe ii paa process in natural water matrices and its application to degrade various micropollutants were also investigated this study proposed a promising strategy for improving the fe ii paa process and highlighted its potential application in water treatment graphical abstract

fact that fe ii is low toxic environmentally ubiquitious inexpensive and highly reactive carlos et al 2021 ghanbari et al 2021 kim et al 2019 fe ii activated paa could produce multiple reactive

process has some intrinsic drawbacks including the need for high fe ii dosage and the accumulation of ferric oxide sludge several strategies have been proposed to accelerate the redox of fe iii fe ii and enhance the oxidation capacity of fe ii paa process chen et al 2020 ghanbari et al 2021 lin et al 2021 nevertheless the extra energy input of uv could extremely limit the application of uv enhanced fe ii paa process in actual water treatment meanwhile the addition of 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenz othiazoline 6 sulfonate abts as electron shuttle into fe ii paa process would turn the color of

well known fe iii reducing agent has been commonly used to reduce fe iii to fe ii rapidly in the determination of total iron herrera et al 1989 recently researches have demonstrated that ha could act as a promoter to enhance the degradation of micropollutants in fenton and fenton like processes by accelerating the recycle of fe iii fe ii chen et al 2011 dai et al 2021 li et al 2020 liu et al 2020

fenton like processes duan et al 2021 liu et al 2017 zou et al 2013 considering the similar drawback i e slow recycle of fe iii fe ii in fe ii paa process and fenton process it is rational to speculate that the addition of ha could also enhance the oxidation capacity of fe ii paa process by accelerating the transformation from fe iii to fe ii nevertheless to our best knowledge there is no report about the addition of ha to enhance the oxidation capacity of fe ii paa process herein ha enhanced fe ii paa process was proposed for the first time and diclofenac dcf a typical pharmaceutical pollutant was selected as the target compound to investigate the oxidation capacity of ha fe ii paa process the details of this study mainly focused on i the enhanced degradation efficiency of dcf ii the identification of primary reactive species iii the reaction mechanism iv the effects of reaction parameters and coexistent constituents and v the applicability of ha fe ii paa process in natural water matrices and for the treatment of various micropollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals paa stock solution around 15 paa was prepared by the reaction of 20 ml a solution acetic acid and 10 ml b solution h2o2 and stored at 4 c before use solutions of a and b were all purchased from xiya chemical technology co ltd shandong china concentrations of paa and coexistent h2o2 in paa stock solution were determined with our previously reported iodometric spectrophotometry wang et al 2021c xiao et al 2019 and the molar ratio of paa h2o2 and paa acetic acid in the prepared paa stock solution were around 2 5 and 0 19 respectively iron sulfate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china hydroxylamine sulfate nh2oh 2 h2so4 ha and diclofenac c14h11c12no2 dcf were obtained from aladdin bio chem technology co ltd shanghai china other chemicals and reagents were listed in text s1 in the supporting information si 2 2 experimental procedures dcf degradation experiments were all performed in 100 ml conical flasks with constant magnetic stirring at a temperature of 25 1 c desired dosages of reagents except for fe ii were firstly added into flask then the reaction was initiated by adding desired fe ii dosage into the solution the initial ph of reaction solution was adjusted with 1 m of sodium hydroxide and 1 m of perchloric acid without adding any ph buffer solutions during the reaction process values of ph almost remained unchanged under acidic conditions and were dropped slightly in the ph range of 6 0 9 0 fig s1 note that the natural water samples used for dcf degradation were firstly acidized to ph around 4 5 by adding 200 μl 1 m of perchloric acid into 50 ml natural water samples sample aliquots 1 ml were withdrawn from flasks at predetermined time intervals and put into glass vials containing excess sodium thiosulfate na 2s2o3 peroxide 10 where peroxide means the total concentrations of paa and coexistent h2o2 to quench dcf degradation to explore the role of feivo2 r o and oh quenching experiments with different alcohols i e tert butyl alcohol tba and methanol meoh were conducted by adding desired alcohols dosage into the reaction solution before fe ii addition tba reacts more rapidly with oh k 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 than with feivo2 k 6 0 101 m 1 s 1 zong et al 2021 and has no effect on r o cai et al 2017 meoh could scavenge both r o wang et al 2020d and feivo2 k 2 5 103 m 1 s 1 pestovsky and bakac 2004 all experiments were performed at least twice and the errors representing the standard deviation were shown in figures 2 3 analytical methods the quantification of dcf was determined by a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc agilent 1220 equipped with an agilent tcc18 2 column 5 μm 150 mm 4 6 mm huang et al 2021 the mobile phases were 0 1 acetic acid solution a and acetonitrile b with a ratio of 35 65 v v at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 the column temperature and detection wavelength were set at 35 c and 274 nm respectively degradation products of dcf were analyzed by ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uplc q tof ms and the detailed parameters were described in our previous study lin et al 2021 the concentration of ha was measured by a spectrophotometric method frear and burrell 1955 the concentration of fe iii was directly measured by a spectrophotometric method at 300 nm scharf 1971 using a 5 cm quartz cell with an uv vis spectrophotometer tu 1901 persee instruments china the concentration of total dissolved nitrogen tdn was measured by a multi n c 3100 analyzer jena germany the concentrations of no2 and no3 were measured by an ion chromatography 930 compact ic china and the detailed parameters were shown in si text s2 other analytical methods are also described in si text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhanced degradation efficiency of dcf in ha fe ii paa process to explore the oxidation capacity of ha fe ii paa process the degradation of dcf was comparatively conducted in different processes as shown in fig 1 a there was almost no dcf removal in both paa alone and ha fe ii process which could be due to the negligible generation of reactive species meanwhile neither fe ii paa nor ha paa process could effectively degrade dcf with the removal efficiency of 6 and 4 respectively the low degradation efficiency of dcf in fe ii paa process could be ascribed to the extremely low dosage of fe ii i e 1 μm increasing the dosage of fe ii to 5 μm the degradation efficiency of dcf was also increased to about 20 fig s2 indeed dcf degradation in fe ii paa process experienced two stage i e the rapid stage and the slow stage the rapid stage is mainly ascribed to the fast reaction between fe ii and paa and the slow stage is mainly ascribed to the slow transformation of fe iii to fe ii therefore the aim of the addition of ha into fe ii paa process is to accelerate the recycle of fe iii fe ii and thus enhance the oxidation capacity of fe ii paa process as expected the addition of ha into fe ii paa process remarkably enhanced the degradation of dcf nearly 95 dcf was removed within 10 min in ha fe ii paa process suggesting that ha could improve the oxidation capacity of fe ii paa process it was further observed that ha fe ii paa process possessed much higher dcf degradation rate compared with our previously reported abts fe ii paa process lin et al 2021 indicating that ha might be superior to abts for enhancing fe ii paa process further the degradation efficiencies of dcf were also investigated in several common seen ha enhanced aops i e ha fe ii h2o2 ha fe ii peroxymonosulfate pms ha fe ii peroxydisulfate pds and ha fe ii sodium percarbonate spc chen et al 2011 li et al 2021a miao et al 2015 zou et al 2013 as shown in fig 1 b ha fe ii paa process far outperformed ha fe ii h2o2 ha fe ii pds and ha fe ii spc under current conditions and the removal efficiency of dcf in ha fe ii paa process was comparable to that in ha fe ii pms process the various degradation efficiencies for dcf in these aops might be mainly ascribed to the different reaction rate between fe ii and peroxides namely k fe ii h2o2 41 76 m 1 s 1 k fe ii pms 3 0 104 m 1 s 1 k fe ii pds 12 26 m 1 s 1 and k fe ii paa 1 10 105 1 56 104 m 1 s 1 brandt et al 1995 kim et al 2019 overall the proposed ha fe ii paa process might be an alternative and promising aop in water treatment considering that paa solution is a quaternary equilibrium mixture in which another peroxide h2o2 also exists zhang et al 2018 it was also essential to explore the possible contribution of h2o2 for dcf degradation in ha fe ii paa process in our used paa stock solution around 40 μm h2o2 was coexisted when 100 μm paa was added into ha fe ii paa process fig s3a shows that almost no dcf degradation was observed in fe ii h2o2 process and only less than 15 dcf was degraded within 10 min in ha fe ii h2o2 process in addition fig s3b shows that paa was rapidly decomposed along with dcf degradation while the concentration of the coexistent h2o2 was almost unchanged in ha fe ii paa process these results demonstrated that it was paa rather than the coexistent h2o2 in paa solution was the primary peroxide accounting for dcf degradation in ha fe ii paa process 3 2 identification of primary reactive species in ha fe ii paa process multiple reactive species including feivo2 r o and oh may exist in fe ii paa process according to previous report kim et al 2019 possible reactions eqs 1 6 are as follows 1 ch3c o ooh fe ii ch3c o oh feivo2 2 ch3c o ooh fe ii ch3c o o fe iii oh 3 ch3c o ooh fe ii ch3c o o fe iii oh 4 ch3c o ooh ch3c o o ch3c o oo ch3c o oh 5 h2o2 fe ii oh fe iii oh 6 h2o2 fe ii h2o feivo2 it seems likely that the abovementioned reactive species could also be produced in ha fe ii paa process methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso was used to investigate the occurrence of feivo2 considering the fact that pmso can be oxidized by feivo2 to methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 which is different from radical based reaction e g oh and r o liu et al 2021 pang et al 2011 moreover paa and h2o2 were not effective to pmso fig s4 which was consistent with previous report liu et al 2021 therefore as shown in fig 2 around 75 of the yield of pmso2 i e η pmso2 δ pmso2 δ pmso greatly suggested the generation of feivo2 in ha fe ii paa process to further ascertain the reactive species in ha fe ii paa process electron paramagnetic resonance epr experiments using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrolin n oxide dmpo as a spin trapping reagent were performed as illustrated in fig 3 a specific spectrum hyperfine splitting constants of an ah 14 9 g with intensities ratio of 1 2 2 1 were obtained in both fe ii paa and ha fe ii paa processes the intensity in ha fe ii paa process was much stronger than that in fe ii paa process suggesting the promoted generation of reactive species with the addition of ha in fe ii paa process this signal was generally consistent with that of dmpooh adduct chen et al 2011 wang et al 2020a zou et al 2013 suggesting the probable occurrence of oh in ha fe ii paa process nevertheless previous reports demonstrated that the formation of dmpooh adduct might also be attributed to the oxidation of dmpo by feivo2 liang et al 2020 wang et al 2018 zong et al 2021 tba has a high rate constant with oh k 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 but relatively lower rate constant with feivo2 k 6 0 101 m 1 s 1 zong et al 2021 while dimethyl sulfoxide dmso is highly reactive to both oh k 6 6 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 and feivo2 k 1 4 105 m 1 s 1 zong et al 2021 accordingly tba and dmso were used to further distinguish the contributions of feivo2 and oh on the formation of dmpooh adduct surprisingly the dmpooh signal was still very strong in the presence of 2500 mm tba while the addition of 250 mm dmso almost completely reduced the dmpooh signal fig 3 the epr results demonstrated that both feivo2 and oh might contribute to the dmpooh while feivo2 makes more contribution than oh since tba could react with feivo2 at k 6 0 101 m 1 s 1 zong et al 2021 the added 2500 mm tba might also scavenge partial feivo2 and thus led to the reduction of the intensity of dmpooh signal to some extent as a result the epr results observed in fig 3 was still insufficient for us to verify or exclude the production of oh in ha fe ii paa process in addition there was another weak dmpox signal in ha fe ii paa process which was also observed in other paa based oxidation processes wang et al 2021b 2020d the dmpox signal might be generated via the oxidation of dmpo by r o i e ch3c o o and ch3c o oo unfortunately the contribution of r o for dmpox signal generation is still largely unknown and is also a challenge in paa based oxidation processes to further identify the primary reactive species accounting for dcf degradation tba and meoh were used as the alcohols to conduct quenching experiments tba was used to differentiate the contribution of feivo2 r o and oh on dcf degradation due to the fact that tba has a higher rate constant with oh k 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 than with feivo2 k 6 0 101 m 1 s 1 zong et al 2021 and tba has no effect on r o cai et al 2017 the reaction rate constant of dcf reacting with oh is 7 5 109 m 1 s 1 huber et al 2003 thus 10 mm tba is sufficient to quench the reaction between 5 μm dcf and the possible existence of oh as shown in fig 4 there was no inhibitory effect on dcf degradation with the addition of 10 mm tba further increasing the concentration of tba to 1000 mm still exhibited no obvious inhibitory effect this phenomenon indicated that oh was not the primary reactive species in current study in addition benzoic acid ba a common probe of oh chen et al 2011 was slightly degraded in ha fe ii paa process fig s5 which could be another evidence for the minor role of oh in dcf degradation meoh a powerful scavenger for both r o wang et al 2020d and feivo2 k 2 5 103 m 1 s 1 pestovsky and bakac 2004 was added to further assess the contributions of feivo2 and r o on dcf degradation fig 4 shows that there was an obvious inhibitory effect on dcf degradation in the presence of 10 mm meoh and the addition of 1000 mm meoh completely inhibited dcf degradation these results indicated that feivo2 and or r o made primary contribution on dcf degradation according to the relatively high value of η pmso2 about 75 fig 2 feivo2 might play a more important role for dcf degradation than r o in ha fe ii paa process unfortunately due to the lack of k r o meoh k r o dcf and k fe iv o 2 dcf currently the addition of meoh was still hard to exactly differentiate the respective contribution of feivo2 and r o on dcf degradation more efforts should be made to differentiate the contribution of feivo2 and r o on dcf degradation in future study in summary based on above results and analysis it could make a conclusion that feivo2 and r o rather than oh were major reactive species responsible for dcf degradation in current study 3 3 reaction mechanism of ha fe ii paa process 3 3 1 role of ha the addition of ha into fe ii paa process is expected to alleviate the accumulation of fe iii and promote the regeneration of fe ii thus the variations of fe iii concentration were monitored in fe ii paa process with and without ha as shown in fig 5 a almost all of fe ii was rapidly transformed to fe iii within 15 s in fe ii paa process and then fe iii concentration kept relatively unchanged this phenomenon could be ascribed to the fast reaction between fe ii and paa but extremely slow reduction from fe iii to fe ii in fe ii paa process as expected in ha fe ii paa process only about 90 of fe ii was fastly transformed into fe iii within 15 s and then fe iii concentration kept relatively constant within 5 min however after 5 min the fe iii concentration began to decrease slowly which could be ascribed to the rapid paa decomposition and extremely low residual paa concentration after 5 min inset in fig 5 a it was worth noting that 1 μm of fe iii rapidly decreased to almost zero with 100 μm ha at ph 4 5 when no paa existed fig s6 hence the fe iii concentration was in dynamic circulation i e fe ii fe iii cycle in ha fe ii paa process and would be changed with the variations of ha and paa concentrations correspondingly the decrease of paa in ha fe ii paa process was also much more faster than that in ha paa and fe ii paa processes inset in fig 5 a these results demonstrated that the addition of ha into fe ii paa process promoted paa decomposition leading to more reactive species generation and faster dcf degradation to better understand the role of ha the degradation of dcf with different ha concentration in ha fe ii paa process was also studied as shown in fig 5 b the degradation efficiency of dcf increased markedly from 5 to 95 within 10 min by increasing ha dosage from 0 μm to 100 μm however further elevating ha dosage to 400 μm exhibited an inhibitory effect on dcf degradation interestingly paa decomposition was continually accelerated along with the increase of ha dosage over the range of 0 μm to 400 μm fig s7 these results demonstrated that excess ha could be a competitor with dcf for reactive species although the generation of reactive species was accelerated therefore a proper dosage of ha should be applied in ha fe ii paa process to obtain the best oxidation performance 3 3 2 decomposition of ha and its end products as shown in fig 6 a ha was also gradually decomposed along with dcf degradation fig 1 and paa decomposition fig 5 a in ha fe ii paa process note that the reaction between ha and paa could be ignored according to the extremely slight decomposition of paa in ha paa process fig 5 a therefore ha should be mainly decomposed by reducing fe iii to fe ii via eq 7 chen et al 2011 zou et al 2013 in addition ha might also be decomposed by reacting with reactive species e g feivo2 via eq 8 johnson and hornstein 2003 n2 n2o no2 and no3 are commonly considered as the major end decomposition products of ha when ha reacts with fe iii and feivo2 via eqs 7 13 duan et al 2021 johnson and hornstein 2003 zou et al 2013 7 fe iii nh2oh nh2o fe ii h 8 feivo2 nh2oh nho fe ii 9 2nh2o n2 2h2o 10 fe iii nh2o nho fe ii h 11 2nho n2o h2o 12 5fe iii nh2o 2h2o no3 5fe ii 6h 13 no3 nh2oh oh no no2 h2o to identify the final decomposition products of ha in ha fe ii paa process the concentrations of total dissolved nitrogen tdn kjeldahl nitrogen ha no2 and no3 were determined and the concentrations of n2 and n2o were calculated according to text s3 as shown in fig 6 b ha was decomposed to n2 n2o no2 and no3 and the eco friendly gas of n2 was the primary product of ha in ha fe ii paa process although the greenhouse gas of n2o is sometimes considered as the main end product of the reaction between ha and fe iii butler and gordon 1986 chen et al 2011 many reports have demonstrated that n2 is the main end product of ha when ha concentration is higher than fe iii concentration bengtsson et al 2002 zou et al 2013 as illustrated in figs 5 a and 6 a ha concentration was ranged in 30 100 μm while fe iii concentration was less than 1 μm namely ha concentration invariably exceeded fe iii concentration during the degradation of dcf with ha fe ii paa process in addition the concentration of nitrate and nitrite after reaction was calculated to be around 0 31 mg l 1 and 0 11 mg l 1 respectively both of them are much lower than the regulation limits for nitrate and nitrite set by the united state environmental protection agency usepa 10 mg l 1 and 1 mg l 1 respectively usepa 2009 nevertheless given that ha at the initial concentration of 100 μm was not completely decomposed in current study the concentration of nitrate and nitrite might be increased after ha complete decomposition and would be higher if the initial dosage of ha was increased therefore an appropriate concentration of ha should be applied in ha fe ii paa process to avoid the secondary contamination 3 3 3 degradation products and pathways of dcf uplc q tof ms was employed to investigated the degradation products of dcf in ha fe ⅱ paa process seven products were identified and their detailed information including the chemical formula and mass over charge ratio m z were provided in table s1 these products were formulated as tp1 to tp7 respectively based on the identified seven products four possible degradation pathways were proposed and presented in fig 7 in pathway 1 tp1 was produced via decarboxylation from acetic acid group in the lateral chain of dcf through electron transfer the decarboxylation might result from the attack on phenylacetic acid structure on dcf by organic radicals which was similar to that in cu ii activated paa for dcf degradation wang et al 2021d similar products were also observed in other dcf oxidation processes using the fe ii paa and ferrate vi wang et al 2020c zhao et al 2018 tp2 was then produced by the hydroxylation of tp1 the hydroxylation might result from the attack on aromatic ring which has high electron density through electron transfer wang et al 2020c formylation occurred where the methyl group in tp2 was further oxidized to produce formyl group and tp3 was formed indeed tp3 was also detected in the degradation of dcf by uv paa process zhang et al 2020 in pathway 2 tp4 was produced via dechlorination cyclization which underwent intramolecular electron transfer and subsequently tp5 was produced by replacing chlorine atom with hydroxyl group via dechlorination hydroxylation from tp4 moreover this pathway might also be supported by the fact that chloride ion around 0 16 mg l 1 was detected after reaction similar pathway was also reported in uv paa process during dcf degradation zhang et al 2020 for pathways 3 and 4 the detected products of tp6 and tp7 were proposed to be produced by the cleavage of active radicals in cn bond from the hydroxylation products of dcf i e tp8 and tp9 tp6 and tp7 were also detected in the degradation of dcf using ferrate vi zhao et al 2018 and fe ii paa process wang et al 2020c though tp8 and tp9 were not detected in current study they have been found in other dcf oxidation processes e g fe ii paa and uv paa wang et al 2020c zhang et al 2020 according to a previous report the amine nitrogen of dcf was attacked via o3 addition during ozonation process sein et al 2008 however no similar products were detected in this study which might need further exploration in addition to evaluate the mineralization of dcf the change of total organic carbon toc concentration during the reaction was determined however no obvious decrease on toc was observed within 10 min data not shown 3 3 4 proposed ha enhanced mechanism according to the above results and discussion the possible ha enhanced mechanism during dcf degradation with ha fe ii paa process was proposed and summarized in scheme 1 firstly paa was rapidly activated by fe ii producing feivo2 r o and fe iii via eqs 1 3 dcf was then degraded by the produced feivo2 and r o fe ii was regenerated by reducing fe iii and feivo2 with ha via eqs 7 and 8 and ha was decomposed to n2 n2o no2 and no3 though ha might be a scavenger of feivo2 for competing with dcf the positive role of ha of promoting the regeneration of fe ii predominates under current study in summary the addition of ha into fe ii paa process promoted the redox cycle of fe iii fe ii and the generation of feivo2 and r o leading to an enhanced performance of dcf degradation 3 4 effects of reaction parameters and coexistent constituents 3 4 1 effect of ph it has been reported in previous researches that the oxidation performance of iron based aops is greatly affected by ph values because of the fe iii precipitation chen et al 2011 2020 zou et al 2013 hence it is of great necessity to evaluate the effect of solution ph on dcf degradation in ha fe ii paa process as displayed in fig 8 a the degradation efficiency of dcf was strongly increased from 15 to 95 with the increase of ph from 2 0 to 4 5 correspondingly the pseudo first order reaction rate k obs of dcf degradation increased significantly from 0 034 to 0 582 min 1 fig s8 however further increasing the ph from 5 0 to 9 0 showed inhibitory effects on dcf degradation with the degradation efficiency of dcf and corresponding k obs decreased from 90 to 1 and 0 523 to 0 001 min 1 respectively the inhibition phenomenon could be mainly ascribed to the formation of fe iii precipitation at elevated ph stefánsson 2007 which was difficult to regenerate fe ii in the presence of ha via eq 7 as shown in fig s9 the decomposition of paa increased with ph increased from 2 0 to 4 5 implying that more reactive species i e feivo2 and r o were produced with the increase of ph as expected paa decomposition decreased with the further increase of ph from 5 0 to 9 0 demonstrating the less production of feivo2 and r o with the further increase of ph moreover since the pk a value of ha is 5 96 duan et al 2021 nh2oh became the predominant form of ha with ph increasing up from 5 0 to 9 0 fig s10 compared with the protonated form of ha i e nh3oh nh2oh is commonly considered to be more prone to reacting with various reactive species e g oh and so4 buxton et al 1988 zou et al 2013 hence at elevated ph more reactive species generated in ha fe ii paa process would be ineffectively consumed by ha 3 4 2 effects of fe ii paa and coexistent h2o2 and acetic acid fe ii and paa concentrations play an important role in ha fe ii paa process since the formation reactive species are closely related to the reaction between fe ii and paa as fig 8 b shows with the increase of fe ii concentration from 0 00 to 5 00 μm the removal efficiency of dcf increased significantly from 5 to nearly 100 and the corresponding k obs increased from 0 009 to 1 607 min 1 fig s11a it is worth noting that trace iron e g 0 5 μm could still exhibit a high degradation efficiency of dcf such low concentration of iron exists extensively in actual water bodies liu et al 2020 sekomo et al 2012 similarly the enhanced performance of dcf degradation were also observed when increasing paa concentrations fig 8 c the removal of dcf was enhanced remarkably from 48 to nearly 100 when paa concentration increased from 25 μm to 200 μm with the corresponding k obs increasing from 0 192 to 0 689 min 1 fig s11b the enhanced degradation of dcf at higher fe ii and paa concentrations was likely ascribed to the more formation of reactive species i e feivo2 and r o additionally considering the coexistence of h2o2 and acetic acid in paa solution the impacts of h2o2 and acetic acid concentrations on dcf removal were also evaluated as shown in figs s12a and s12b there was no obvious effect on dcf degradation when additional h2o2 40 160 μm or acetic acid 0 2 2 0 mm was added these phenomena indicated that the relatively low concentrations of coexistent h2o2 and acetic acid in paa solution played a negligible role on dcf elimination in ha fe ii paa process 3 4 3 effects of cl hco3 so4 2 and humic acid to assess the applicability of ha fe ii paa process the effects of common constituents in water e g cl hco3 so4 2 and humic acid on dcf degradation were investigated interestingly cl hco3 and so4 2 all showed a negligible impact on dcf degradation figs s13 s14 and s15 these results indicated that ha fe ii paa process was insusceptible to these inorganic anions in many radicals e g oh and so4 mediated aops the presence of cl and hco3 could quench radicals and inhibit the degradation of micropollutants wang and wang 2021 thus ha fe ii paa process might be a promising aop for micropollutants elimination in real water treatment nevertheless humic acid a representative of natural organic matter nom in water showed an inhibitory effect on dcf degradation the degradation efficiency of dcf greatly decreased from 95 to 5 as the concentration of humic acid increased from 0 to 10 mg l 1 fig 8 d and the corresponding k obs decreased from 0 582 to 0 004 min 1 fig s16 the inhibition of humic acid on dcf degradation might be mainly ascribed to the complexation of iron by humic acid karlsson and persson 2012 ritter et al 2006 and the scavenging of feivo2 and r o by humic acid chen et al 2019 shao et al 2018 zong et al 2021 as can be seen in fig s17 paa decomposition indeed decreased with the increase of humic acid concentration this result demonstrated that the complexation of iron by humic acid should be the major reason for the inhibition of humic acid on dcf degradation as expected increasing fe ii concentration significantly improved dcf degradation and alleviated the inhibition effect of humic acid on dcf degradation in ha fe ii paa process fig s18 vs fig 8 d this phenomenon indicated that higher dosage of fe ii is imperative for the rapid degradation of micropollutants in actual waters containing high concentration of nom 3 5 applicability of ha fe ii paa process 3 5 1 degradation of dcf in natural water samples the degradation of dcf with ha fe ii paa process in two different natural water samples was further evaluated as shown in fig 9 a it was observed that dcf degradation in natural water matrices was inhibited to different extent and the degradation efficiency of dcf in reservoir water was much lower than that in underground water note that the concentration of toc in reservoir water was much higher than that in underground water table s2 based on the facts that toc represents the content of nom and humic acid could inhibit the degradation of dcf fig 8 d it was rational to infer that the inhibition of natural water matrices on dcf degradation was mainly ascribed to the complexation of iron by the coexistent nom expectedly with higher fe ii concentration i e 5 μm vs 1 μm ha fe ii paa process was highly efficient for degrading dcf in real water matrices accordingly to obtain a better degradation efficiency of pollutants with ha fe ii paa process in real water matrices an appropriate fe ii concentration should be applied 3 5 2 degradation of different micropollutants to further evaluate the applicability of ha fe ii paa process experiments for degrading other micropollutants including indole naproxen npx acetaminophen ace ibuprofen ibp and carbamazepine cbz were conducted as shown in fig 9 b ha fe ii paa process had an outstanding oxidation performance on dcf indole and npx with degradation efficiencies of 95 90 and 68 respectively however only approximately 22 of ace 15 of ibp and 10 of cbz were oxidized within 10 min the selective oxidation of micropollutants with ha fe ii paa process could be ascribed to the high selectivity of feivo2 and r o cai et al 2017 dong et al 2020 zong et al 2021 thus unlike oh and so4 mediated ha fe ii pms process and oh mediated ha fenton process chen et al 2011 li et al 2021b zou et al 2013 ha fe ii paa process possessed high selectivity to micropollutants which is similar to our previously reported abts enhanced fe ii paa process lin et al 2021 unfortunately due to the lack of detailed rate constants of feivo2 and r o with these selected micropollutants more efforts should be made in the future to better understand the selective oxidation ability of ha fe ii paa process it could also be noted that cbz and ibp which could both easily react with oh k ohcbz 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 k oh ibp 3 43 109 m 1 s 1 cai et al 2021 yang et al 2017 were slightly degraded in ha fe ii paa process these results also supported our previous conclusion section 3 2 that oh played a negligible role in this study 4 conclusions this study proposed a novel strategy i e adding ha to enhance the oxidation capacity of fe ii paa process by accelerating the redox cycle of fe iii fe ii the proposed ha fe ii paa process was highly efficient for dcf elimination over the ph range of 3 0 6 0 feivo2 and r o were identified as primary reactive species responsible for dcf elimination via experiments of epr pmso oxidation and alcohols quenching seven different intermediate products of dcf were identified by uplc q tof ms and four corresponding degradation pathways were proposed reaction mechanism of ha fe ii paa process was proposed feivo2 r o and fe iii were firstly produced via the rapid reaction of fe ii and paa and then dcf was degraded by feivo2 and r o fe ii was regenerated via the reactions of fe iii and feivo2 with ha elevated dosages of fe ii and paa were beneficial for dcf removal the coexistent h2o2 and acetic acid in paa solution and the common inorganic anions e g cl hco3 and so4 2 showed negligible impacts on dcf removal though dcf degradation was inhibited in the presence of humic acid the inhibition effect could be greatly alleviated by increasing the dosage of fe ii ha fe ii paa process possessed high selectivity towards micropollutants and was highly efficient to degrade dcf in natural water matrices in addition ha was gradually decomposed to n2 n2o no2 and no3 and the eco friendly gas of n2 was its major decomposition product overall ha fe ii paa process is a promising approach and has potential
