9800,drought has been a major limiting factor affecting agricultural production in the world accurately quantitative analysis of the dynamic changes of evapotranspiration and soil water balance is very important for effectively managing water resources and improving water use efficiency under water scarcity soil water balance for perennial forage is more complex than the annuals due to stronger roots and periodic evapotranspiration the objective was to explore the evapotranspiration characteristics and soil water balance of alfalfa medicago sativa l grasslands under border irrigation at different stand ages and irrigation treatments a 3 yr field experiment with a full irrigation and 6 regulated deficit irrigation treatments was conducted and growth related indicators soil evaporation and soil water dynamics were observed regularly daily evapotranspiration and soil water balance were computed using a modified dual kc model which is able to simulate evaporation and transpiration separately the results showed that soil water simulated by the model and the measured value were in good agreement and regression coefficients were higher than 0 6 and close to 1 0 in most cuts the change trend of root zone water under deficit irrigation at single growth stages was similar to that under full irrigation under irrigation the transpiration was the main water loss of alfalfa grasslands the daily actual evapotranspiration of alfalfa in the 1st cut was higher than 8 0 mm d 1 and even over 15 0 mm d 1 at the middle and later growth stages in contrast in the 2nd and 3rd cut it was always less than 10 0 mm d 1 the daily actual evapotranspiration decreased significantly and immediately after cutting and daily actual transpiration was reduced to less than 1 0 mmd 1 the change trend of daily actual evapotranspiration under deficit irrigation at single growth stages was also similar to that under full irrigation the seasonal evapotranspiration could reach 800 mm and was reduced by deficit irrigation the average proportion of soil evaporation to total evapotranspiration was 18 with the decrease of irrigation amount the evapotranspiration transpiration and irrigation water compensation decreased while evaporation remained relatively stable and the ratio of evaporation to evapotranspiration increased a lower relative evapotranspiration deficit 0 041 was obtained under moderate deficit irrigation at the budding stage than those in other deficit cases 0 086 or over in conclusion in the arid and semi arid areas deficit irrigation could be applied to alfalfa grassland at the budding stage in alfalfa production keywords alfalfa regulated deficit irrigation soil water balance transpiration soil evaporation 1 introduction more than half of the global agricultural area is facing drought challenges geng et al 2016 and drought has been a major limiting factor affecting agricultural production in the world which is increasingly intensified by population increase and global climate change coyagocruz et al 2019 giuliani et al 2011 drought cannot always be addressed through water reclamation strategies such as the desalination and improving water use efficiency is still an extremely urgent problem panagopoulos and haralambous 2020 panagopoulos et al 2021 in recent years cultivated grassland has been extensively used in drought areas due to great potential in providing forages for animal feeding and strong adaptability in adverse environments some of the forages i e alfalfa medicago sativa l show broad spectrums in adapting to soil water availability and can survive and produce even under very dry conditions alemayehu et al 2017 capstaff and miller 2018 steduto et al 2012 however drought is still an important limiting factor for forage yield and quality in arid areas in practice irrigation is an option to sustain the growth and production of forages under drought stress considering that forage crop is quite different from grain crop in life cycle water requirement and use since it has stronger roots and periodic evapotranspiration due to cutting and regrowth further exploring how water loss and balance are affected by irrigation is very important for deep understanding of water cycle in forage production systems and for extension of forage cultivation in drought areas soil water balance in the root zone is fundamental for plant survival and production which is controlled by water input and output when root zone soil water declines to a certain extent like half of total available water for many plants steduto et al 2012 root water uptake will be significantly reduced and plant growth will be obviously restricted rahman and hasegawa 2012 soil water in the root zone can be recharged and balanced through a number of water processes allen et al 1998 irrigation and precipitation input water into root zone and increase soil water content swc however when the amount of irrigation and rainfall exceeds the holding capacity of topsoil surface runoff and deep percolation will occur which limits the increase of soil water in root zone water might also be lifted by capillary rise from a shallow watertable most importantly transpiration and evaporation cause water loss and reduce swc therefore accurate estimation of soil water balance in the root zone is of great significance to determine the availability of water resources and to guide optimal managements in irrigated arid agriculture ghiberto et al 2011 shelia et al 2018 in practice it is difficult to accurately estimate water balance mainly due to the complexity of water processes in the soil plant atmosphere continuum and the accuracy of measurements of the above indexes ghiberto et al 2011 the precipitation and irrigation are easy to obtain and surface runoff is usually ignored when the land is flat in contrast evaporation transpiration capillary rise and deep percolation are difficult to be obtained directly silva et al 2006 although there are many instruments and methods to measure these parameters problems such as high cost and time consuming still restrict the measurements cermak et al 2004 deol et al 2012 iritz et al 1997 kool et al 2014 payero and irmak 2008 wang et al 2015 soil water balance can also be analyzed by model simulation with low cost and high speed which is an efficient alternative option in deeply understanding water balance a number of models have been proposed to assess evapotranspiration or to dissect the composition of evapotranspiration at different scales malik et al 2020 maroufpoor et al 2020 qasem et al 2019 the single crop coefficient and dual kc model recommended by food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations allen et al 1998 and shuttleworth wallace model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 have been widely used and helped some in analyzing soil water dynamics however there are still some defects in these model analyses single crop coefficient model only simulates evapotranspiration failing to separate evaporation and transpiration from evapotranspiration the shuttleworth wallace model needs more parameters including some resistance parameters i e bulk resistances of canopy stomatal and boundary layer additionally these models ignore the calculation of capillary rise in recent decades rosa et al 2016 developed a simdualkc model by combining the dual kc model and the capillary rise calculation model proposed by liu et al 2006 this model is performed well in analyzing the process of soil water balance rosa et al 2016 wei et al 2015 with few parameters but separation of evaporation and transpiration however the model has been less applied to simulate water balance in perennial forages which generally appear greatly different from annual species alfalfa is one of the oldest and most important forages in the world with a planting area of more than 30 million ha steduto et al 2012 and has been planted in china for over 2000 yr it has high nutritional quality and biomass production rogers et al 2014 and can widely adapt to the environments avcÄ± et al 2013 in recent years a renewed interest has been attracted to further explore the ability of alfalfa to reduce vulnerability of agricultural areas steduto et al 2012 for instance compared with annual crops alfalfa cultivation is more efficient in reducing surface runoff and soil erosion jun et al 2014 alfalfa can survive and produce in the areas with annual precipitation of 300 800 mm but irrigation has played a key role in commercial alfalfa production in the arid areas like the inland arid area of midwestern china previous report has shown that regulated deficit irrigation rdi could regulate the yield and quality of alfalfa and higher production performance could be obtained under rdi at single growth stages especially at the budding stage liu et al 2021 however there is a lack of elaboration on alfalfa water loss in these situations as a perennial forage alfalfa has many obvious differences with traditional grain crops in water loss 1 alfalfa has the potential to produce dry matter in the whole year so it has high annual water loss between 800 and 1600 mm kuslu 2010 2 alfalfa is usually mowed at the early flowering stage to harvest forage testa et al 2011 avoiding at least part of the period of maximum water loss allen et al 1998 when the daily actual evapotranspiration can exceed 8 mm d 1 3 water cycle and use of alfalfa grassland differ among various growth stages and stand ages 4 alfalfa has a strong and deep taproot in soil profile xiao et al 2015 endowed it strong ability of water extraction in deeper soil layers therefore soil water balance process of alfalfa might be different from that of traditional grain crops further revealing soil water balance and its regulation would help a lot in the extensive use of irrigated alfalfa grassland in addition model simulation has potentials in analyzing soil water balance which has not been demonstrated in the previous report liu et al 2021 this study aims to uncover the evapotranspiration characteristics and soil water balance of alfalfa grassland with modified dual kc model the purpose of this study is 1 to verify the applicability of modified dual kc model in simulating soil water balance of alfalfa root zone with a 3 yr border irrigation trail 2 to demonstrate the changes in evapotranspiration characteristics and soil water balance of alfalfa grassland with rdi 3 to find out which rdi treatment can achieve weaker water stress without enhancing water irrigation input 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment 1 site description the experiment was conducted in suzhou district 98 80 e 39 67 n 1368 m above sea level jiuquan city gansu province china from 2017 to 2019 the study area is a typical inland arid area with an annual average precipitation of 90 mm 1954 2019 and an annual average reference evapotranspiration of 1730 mm 1954 2019 calculated by the penman monteith equation soil texture of 0 40 40 60 and 60 200 cm are sandy loam with 69 3 sand 26 4 silt and 4 3 clay sandy loam with 51 1 sand 42 9 silt and 6 clay and silt loam with 13 2 sand 75 5 silt and 11 3 clay respectively and the corresponding field capacity are 0 25 0 34 and 0 40 m3 m 3 the electrical conductivity and ph of irrigation water are 0 7 ms cm 1 and 7 4 this site belongs to a highly irrigation dependent oasis with one cropping mode representing the local agricultural practice the pre crop before this experiment was lycium ruthenicum an economic crop sown in this area 2 experimental design and field management alfalfa was sown on may 24 2017 with seeding rate of 22 5 kg ha 1 seeding depth of 2 cm and row space of 20 cm there were 20 rows in each plot under a border irrigation and 300 kg ha 1 diammonium phosphate was used as base fertilizer before seeding irrigation treatment was then started when three true leaves of alfalfa emerged the experiment was arranged in a completely random design with seven irrigation treatments and three replicates 6 m 4 m per replicate plot alfalfa generally has three main phenological stages which are fundamental for growth and production therefore seven irrigation treatments were set to consider different water stress scenarios at various phenological stages the seven irrigation treatments included a full irrigation treatment for the whole growth period ifu and six rdi treatments a slight water deficit for whole growth period isl b moderate water deficit for the whole growth period imo c moderate water deficit at the branching and budding stage ibb d moderate water deficit at the regrowth stage ire e moderate water deficit at the branching stage ibr and f moderate water deficit at the budding stage ibu using the irrigation amount under ifu as the standard 50 60 mm for each irrigation which makes the surface 60 cm soil layer reach field capacity the irrigation amount of slight water deficit was 70 and moderate water deficit 50 more details for irrigation schedule shown in fig s1 the irrigation date for ifu treatment depended on the change in available water of reference soil layer 0 60 cm in 2017 and 0 100 cm in 2018 and 2019 kuslu et al 2010 the available water of reference soil layer was calculated using the difference in water storage between the field capacity and the wilting point in the reference layer in order to accurately demonstrate the change in swc a manual time domain reflectometry tdr instrument trime pico iph tdr imko was used to measure the swc in each plot the installation calibration and validation of tdr can be referred in the instruction manual of tdr provided with the devices this instrument can quickly and accurately measure the swc of different depths showing good performance in monitoring soil water dynamics when the available water of reference soil layer under ifu treatment reduced to half of the maximum available water irrigation was applied kuslu et al 2010 water meters were used to measure the irrigation amount in different cuts of the three years table 1 before winter the grasslands were fully irrigated once helping to survive the cold winter no fertilizer was applied in the following growing seasons the controls on pests and insects diseases and other grasses were referred to local practices 3 measurement and calculation leaf area index was measured regularly in each plot fig s2 with a sunscan device delta t devices ltd uk plant height was measured regularly in each plot fig s3 with a constant method root drill was used to monitor root depth of alfalfa at the end of each year and root distribution in each soil layer was obtained only at the end of 2019 fig s4 note that the roots were mainly distributed in 0 80 cm soil layer in 2017 0 120 cm in 2018 and 0 180 cm in 2019 the swc in the growing season was measured at 0 2 m depth interval in each plot every 3 d using the tdr which gradually enters the 2 0 m probe tube down to deep soil layer the location in the plot shown in fig s5 in 2018 soil drill gravimetric method was used as a standard method to measure swc at different depths in four of the measurement times with tdr and the relationship was analyzed using a linear regression with the data obtained from two methods the measurement with tdr could obtain greater accuracy fig s6 the swc were measured to a depth of 1 2 m at the 1st and 2nd cut in 2017 and 2018 1 8 m at the 3rd cut in 2018 and all cuts in 2019 watertable level fig s7 was measured on the same day that the swc was measured in addition there was a fully automatic micro weather station near the site therefore meteorological data were automatically recorded including air temperature air humidity atmospheric pressure solar radiation wind speed and rainfall fig s8 also shown in liu et al 2021 soil evaporation e m in each plot was measured using a micro lysimeter the location in the plot shown in fig s5 which is an easily operated and widely used method zhang et al 2011 wei et al 2015 the micro lysimeter consists of two parts one was pvc pipe with diameter of 0 10 m and height of 0 17 m soil depth is 0 15 m as inner cylinder which will be pull out to weigh every day and another was iron pipe with diameter of 0 11 m and height of 0 17 m as outer cylinder which is closely attached to soil wall and prevents the wall from collapse the micro lysimeter would be reinstalled in other places of the plot with soil replaced after irrigation or heavy precipitation and a new weighing of micro lysimeter is started soil e m was finally calculated using the following formula 1 e m 10 Î´ w Ï Ï d 2 2 where e m is the measured soil evaporation Î´w is the difference of the two weights g in the micro lysimeter for 24 h Ï is water density g cm 3 and d is the micro lysimeter diameter cm 2 2 model simulation 1 model description and parameter computation the daily soil water balance at the field scales was computed following the methods of fao56 allen et al 1998 2 d r i d r i 1 p r o i i i c r i e t a i d p i where dr i and dr i 1 are the daily depletion water shortage relative to field capacity of root zone at the end of day i and i 1 mm in this study the depth of root zone was 0 80 cm soil layer in 2017 0 120 cm in 2018 and 0 180 cm in 2019 field capacity and actual water content of different soil layers were measured using soil drill method and summed according to the reference depth to truly reflect dr in formula 2 p is the precipitation mm ro is surface runoff mm there were 0 5 m high ridges around the experimental plots so ro was ignored here and i is irrigation mm cr is capillary rise mm from watertable eta is actual evapotranspiration mm and dpi is deep percolation mm the cr was calculated with the method of liu et al 2006 the dual kc model allen et al 1998 was used to compute actual crop transpiration ta and soil evaporation ea and then actual evapotranspiration eta was calculated 3 e t a k s k c b k e e t 0 4 e a k e e t 0 5 t a k s k c b e t 0 where ks is water stress coefficient kcb is basal crop coefficient ke is soil evaporation coefficient et0 is reference crop evapotranspiration mm calculated by penman monteith equation here ea is actual soil evaporation mm and ta is actual crop transpiration in the study area alfalfa can be harvested 2 or 3 cuts in a year so each cut has a set of kcb values which should be adjusted by wind speed air humidity and plant height allen et al 1998 the ke was computed using the method of fao56 allen et al 1998 and the fraction of ground cover fc to assess ke was computed from leaf area index lai and crop height h using the following formula allen and pereira 2009 6 f c 1 e 0 7 l a i 1 h the ks was computed using the following formula 7 k s t a w d r i t a w r a w 8 r a w p t a w where taw and raw are the total and readily available soil water mm of root zone p is the depletion fraction for the crop under no water stress and for alfalfa it is 0 55 as previously recommended allen et al 1998 the dp was calculated using fao56 method allen et al 1998 following irrigation or heavy rain swc in the root zone might exceed field capacity and thus some of them may go down into deeper soil layers it was assumed that the soil water content is at field capacity on the same day of the wetting event so the d r i will be zero 9 d p i p i r o i i i e t a i d r i 1 as long as the soil water content in the root zone is below field capacity i e dr i 0 the soil will not drain and dpi 0 allen et al 1998 the above calculation process was encapsulated with r code and the calibrated values of these parameters were summarized in table 2 in addition relative evapotranspiration deficit etpot eta etpot is often used to evaluate the degree of water stress on crops and etpot is potential evapotranspiration shrestha et al 2010 irrigation water compensation iwc was calculated using the following formula 10 i w c i e t 100 where et is seasonal evapotranspiration mm 2 model calibration and validation in this study each treatment included three replicate plots and thus all input data for the model were the average of the data from three plots the soil water data under imo treatment was used to calibrate the model to obtain appropriate model parameters and the data from other treatments were used to verify the calibrated model parameters in each year three statistical parameters mean error me mean absolute errors mae and root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate model errors phogat et al 2017 a simple linear regression was used to fit the relationship between measured and simulated values and r2 was obtained and plotted the following equations were employed to obtain me mae and rmse by comparing measured m and corresponding simulated s values of water content as follows 11 m e 1 n i 1 n m i s i 12 m a e 1 n i 1 n m i s i 13 r m s e 1 n i 1 n m i s i 2 where n is the number of comparisons 3 simulation of soil water balance in alfalfa grassland after the applicability of the model in simulation soil water dynamics in alfalfa grassland the dynamic changes of soil water storage evaporation and transpiration were analyzed through model simulation the differences in water balance components among different irrigation treatments in various growing seasons were compared the detailed analysis process was summarized in a flow chart fig s9 which also included the field measured parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification of the model and simulation of water storage in root zone alfalfa shoot growth and root distribution in soils varied among stand ages steduto et al 2012 which leads to the changes in water use and soil water availability therefore calibration and validation of model parameter should be carried out separately for different years therefore we used the imo treatment data set of three years to calibrate the model parameters in this study table 2 soil water dynamics was well simulated with the model and the rmse for swc ranged from 0 0061 to 0 0246 m3 m 3 the me ranged from 0 0018 0 0114 m3 m 3 and the mae ranged from 0 0049 to 0 0169 m3 m 3 table 3 figs 1 and 2 showed the comparison between the measured and simulated values of swc and water storage in root zone and both values were in good agreement the regression coefficients for linear regressions were higher than 0 6 and close to 1 0 in most cuts and the slopes were close to 1 0 in all cuts fig 1 it suggested that the model can well predict the variation of soil water during alfalfa growth and thus can be used to analyze soil water dynamics in the irrigation management during alfalfa production alfalfa roots grow continuously as the life cycle prolongs huang et al 2018 shen et al 2009 zhao et al 2004 and thus soil depth to which alfalfa can extract water changes with stand age in this study alfalfa root in 2017 distributed mainly in the 80 cm soil depth 120 cm in 2018 and 180 cm in 2019 these differences led to change in water storage of root zone with stand age showing a tendency of increase with years fig 2 which is obviously different from annual crops such as corn and sweet sorghum rosa et al 2016 soybean wei et al 2015 deficit irrigation treatments isl and imo during the whole growth period decreased water storage in root zone dramatically the change trend of water storage under deficit irrigation at single growth stage was similar to that under full irrigation ifu it implies that deficit irrigation only in a single growth stage would reduce the amplitude of the fluctuation of soil water in the root zone but barely change the fluctuation curve 3 2 soil evaporation estimation in comparison with soil water soil evaporation was not well simulated with the model fig 3 the rmse for soil evaporation ranged from 0 7984 to 1 3465 mm d 1 the me ranged from 0 5011 to 1 0693 mm d 1 and the mae ranged from 0 6957 to 1 0775 mm d 1 table 4 fig 3 showed the comparison between the measured and simulated soil evaporations and there were consistent change trends for both values however the measured values were somehow higher than the simulated ones especially during the mid season in all cuts it suggested that the measurement by the micro lysimeter would have led to overestimation of soil evaporation this overestimation has also been reported in other studies hu et al 2020 klocke et al 1990 martin et al 1987 wei et al 2015 zhao et al 2013 2015 water extraction by roots was excluded from the micro lysimeter which results in higher swc in the micro lysimeter than in the surrounding area at the end of a drying cycle and thus leads to a higher potential to evaporate daamen 1993 klocke et al 1990 note that the overestimation occurred easily when alfalfa grew to form a closed canopy structure with relatively small soil evaporation thus in agreement with the finding of klocke et al 1990 the simulated soil evaporation of alfalfa at the early stage well reflected the measured value but it didn t when alfalfa grew to the middle and later stages this growth stage specific inconsistency gives us another viewpoint to consider the overestimation the inevitable daily field measurement pulling out the inner cylinder to weigh and put it back may lead to canopy damage and less cover over the micro lysimeter which leads to more radiation and air flow on the soil in the micro lysimeter finn 1997 sun et al 2014 at the early growth stage of alfalfa the canopy is sparse and short the frequent measurement caused canopy damage barely affects soil evaporation in contrast soil surface is completely covered till alfalfa grows to form a closed canopy structure at the middle and later stages fig s2 thus less cover caused by micro lysimeter weighing makes the soil surface very different on the micro lysimeter from the surrounding area this would result in higher evaporation nevertheless the applicability of this model in simulating soil evaporation for irrigated alfalfa grassland cannot be denied 3 3 crop coefficients soil evaporation coefficient ke describes the evaporation potential from soil surface allen et al 1998 for all cuts alfalfa had a higher ke value during the initial stage than later stages fig 4 suggesting that the evaporation in soil water loss at the initial stage tends to be greater than those at other stages at this stage there is more energy for soil evaporation due to less cover to soil surface and relatively high soil water content due to one time irrigation at the beginning in contrast at the later growth stages of alfalfa the available energy to the soil decreases with increasing canopy cover which leads to lower ke values till the end of the growth cycle this is consistent with the findings on winter wheat wang et al 2016 soybean wei et al 2015 summer maize zhao et al 2013 in this study there were two growth cycles in 2017 establishing year three in 2018 and 2019 the duration of the first growth cycle was the longest leading to various growth performances the kcb curve reflects the change in potential basal crop coefficient in different cuts and different growth stages of the year there are four stages which can be divided from the curve according to leaf area index and growth stage including kcb ini kcb dev kcb mid and kcb end allen et al 1998 in the dual kc model standard kcb mid and kcb end the kcb at the middle and end of growth stage values are generally adjusted under specific climatic conditions and growth status allen et al 1998 therefore in this study kcb mid and kcb end were also adjusted in different cuts since precipitation radiation and temperature were very different in various cuts and alfalfa growth status as well in 2018 and 2019 kcb mid and kcb end in the 1st cut were higher than those in the other two cuts it means water consumption in this cut might be higher the dry matter yield of alfalfa in the 1st cut was higher than those in the 2nd and 3rd cut liu et al 2021 and thus the water consumption in the 1st cut was greater it is also confirmed indirectly by the higher leaf area index and height in this cut figs s2 and s3 additionally in the same duration climatic condition barely differed among various plots of the experimental site and soil water might be the main influencing factor in this case therefore there were significant differences in kcb adj among different deficit irrigation treatments fig 4 suggesting that deficit irrigation would significantly affect evapotranspiration 3 4 evapotranspiration characteristics fig 5 showed the results on changes in ea ta and eta computed by this model at the beginning of each cut ea was the main source of evapotranspiration but with the increase of leaf area index fig s2 it decreased while ta increased to become the main source of evapotranspiration this shift of role in forming evapotranspiration has also been demonstrated with other crops wei et al 2015 zhao et al 2013 as alfalfa grows to reach closed canopy eta can rise to over 8 0 mm d 1 and even 15 0 mm d 1 in some cases benli et al 2006 steduto et al 2012 in this study the daily eta in the 1st cut of 2017 and 2018 was higher than 8 0 mm d 1 and even over 15 0 mm d 1 at the middle and later growth stages in contrast in the 2nd and 3rd cuts it was always less than 10 0 mm d 1 there was higher dry matter accumulation in the 1st cut than in the rest cuts liu et al 2021 which leads to greater daily water consumption in the 1st cut and higher daily eta feng et al 2020 this higher eta was also in accordance with higher kc mid and kc end in the 1st cut of 2018 and 2019 fig 4 at the early flowering stage when alfalfa was harvested the daily eta decreased significantly due to cutting and especially ta was reduced to less than 1 0 mm d 1 which is consistent with other studies steduto et al 2012 this periodic variation of evapotranspiration is beneficial to the recovery of soil water after cutting and to retaining more water for the regrowth wagle et al 2019 we also found that the daily eta under different irrigation treatments showed a similar change trend but deficit irrigation led to reduction in intensity of daily eta 3 5 soil water balance in this study seasonal evapotranspiration could reach 800 mm in alfalfa grassland table 5 which has also been reported in other studies kuslu et al 2010 sahin and hamay 1996 but the precipitation in this area ca 90 mm was much lower than the evapotranspiration therefore irrigation was the main source of water supply to replenish water shortage and capillary rise was also a source that cannot be ignored in this area in this study water replenishment through capillary rise was 73 mm in 2017 79 mm in 2018 and 64 mm in 2019 the amount of water from capillary rise is close to the annual rainfall in this area accounting for 10 or more of alfalfa water demand alfalfa transpiration and soil evaporation were the main water loss in the grasslands in this study soil evaporation loss was 102 107 mm in 2017 130 155 mm in 2018 and 126 145 mm in 2019 the average proportions of soil evaporation in total evapotranspiration of alfalfa grasslands were 18 18 and 19 in 2017 2019 table 5 much less than those of soybean 32 wei et al 2015 maize 24 rosa et al 2016 and sorghum 28 rosa et al 2016 the closed canopy structure of alfalfa would inhibit soil evaporation a lot due to less radiation and weaker wind than in other crop systems the leaf area index of alfalfa in each cut could exceed 3 0 in a short time fig s2 which indicates there is a complete coverage to the soil allen et al 1998 in contrast the transpiration took up the most part of total evapotranspiration more than 90 in most time of the life cycle fig 6 in addition the proportion of transpiration tended to increase with the growth in a life cylce while the evaporation was greater at the earlier growth stages with the decrease of irrigation amount the evapotranspiration transpiration and iwc decreased table 5 the decrease of irrigation amount results in lower swc and alfalfa may encounter water stress which leads to reduced transpiration abduljabbar et al 1985 kuslu et al 2010 in contrast evaporation was relatively stable the surface soil under different treatments might have been completely covered by the canopy of alfalfa in a short time fig s2 which leads to equivalent energy obtained under various treatments and consequently close soil evaporation in this study water loss was always higher than water supply leading to the depletion of soil water storage during alfalfa growth therefore the less irrigation was performed the more soil water content decreased in this study the iwc under ifu treatment was 72 5 much lower than those of other plants in similar semi arid areas for instance under full irrigation iwc was 82 for pumpkin yavuz et al 2015 88 for sugar beet topak et al 2016 89 for sunflower yavuz et al 2019 and 74 81 for melon yavuz et al 2021 this may be attributed mainly to differences in root characteristics between alfalfa and those plants alfalfa can excavate water from deeper soil layers since it has a very deep taproot which makes it less dependent on irrigation water compared with shallower root crops cavero et al 2016 in addition the iwc decreased with the decrease of irrigation amount for instance under the imo treatment it was reduced to about 50 3 6 relative evapotranspiration deficit the relative evapotranspiration deficit can reflect the degree of water stress gonzalez dugo et al 2020 king et al 2021 the relative evapotranspiration deficit under ifu treatment was always the lowest which was 0 07 in 2017 0 009 in 2018 and 0 005 in 2019 while increased significantly with the decrease of irrigation amount under whole growth deficit irrigation fig 7 under deficit irrigation treatments at single growth stages the values were higher than that under ifu treatment but lower than those under other treatments this was in accordance with changes in irrigation amount under different treatments table 1 particularly relative evapotranspiration deficit under ibu treatment was about 0 041 in 2018 and 2019 lower than those under other deficit irrigation treatments this means that moderate deficit irrigation at the budding stage may not cause severe water stress and may result in less harm to the growth than other deficit irrigation treatments thus the deficit irrigation at the budding stage would less affect the yield than those deficit irrigated at the regrowth or branching stage cheng 2005 liu et al 2021 sun 2008 therefore this irrigation practice can save irrigation water about 100 mm without significantly increasing water stress additionally soil drying due to less water supply at this stage can be beneficial for alfalfa harvest at the flowering stage 4 conclusions the modified dual kc model can well simulate the change of soil water content in root zone of alfalfa the change trend of root zone water under deficit irrigation at single growth stages was similar to that under full irrigation micro lysimeter method would overestimate soil evaporation of alfalfa when soil surface was completely covered by alfalfa the evapotranspiration and transpiration of alfalfa grasslands were significantly reduced by lowering irrigation amount while evaporation barely changed the change trend of daily actual evapotranspiration under deficit irrigation at single growth stages was also similar to that under full irrigation the seasonal evapotranspiration could reach 800 mm under alfalfa grassland and was reduced by deficit irrigation the daily actual evapotranspiration of alfalfa in the 1st cut was higher than 8 0 mm d 1 and even over 15 0 mm d 1 at the middle and later growth stages in contrast in the 2nd and 3rd cut it was always less than 10 0 mm d 1 the average proportion of soil evaporation to total evapotranspiration of alfalfa grasslands was 18 moderate deficit irrigation at the budding stage did not cause obvious water stress and thus was recommended to be applied in the management of alfalfa cultivation in these areas however we have to admit that this study didn t show in details how water moves within soil profile some mechanistic models such as hydrus model series would be used to explore water movement from horizonal and or vertical levels in the root zone with further research declaration of

9800,drought has been a major limiting factor affecting agricultural production in the world accurately quantitative analysis of the dynamic changes of evapotranspiration and soil water balance is very important for effectively managing water resources and improving water use efficiency under water scarcity soil water balance for perennial forage is more complex than the annuals due to stronger roots and periodic evapotranspiration the objective was to explore the evapotranspiration characteristics and soil water balance of alfalfa medicago sativa l grasslands under border irrigation at different stand ages and irrigation treatments a 3 yr field experiment with a full irrigation and 6 regulated deficit irrigation treatments was conducted and growth related indicators soil evaporation and soil water dynamics were observed regularly daily evapotranspiration and soil water balance were computed using a modified dual kc model which is able to simulate evaporation and transpiration separately the results showed that soil water simulated by the model and the measured value were in good agreement and regression coefficients were higher than 0 6 and close to 1 0 in most cuts the change trend of root zone water under deficit irrigation at single growth stages was similar to that under full irrigation under irrigation the transpiration was the main water loss of alfalfa grasslands the daily actual evapotranspiration of alfalfa in the 1st cut was higher than 8 0 mm d 1 and even over 15 0 mm d 1 at the middle and later growth stages in contrast in the 2nd and 3rd cut it was always less than 10 0 mm d 1 the daily actual evapotranspiration decreased significantly and immediately after cutting and daily actual transpiration was reduced to less than 1 0 mmd 1 the change trend of daily actual evapotranspiration under deficit irrigation at single growth stages was also similar to that under full irrigation the seasonal evapotranspiration could reach 800 mm and was reduced by deficit irrigation the average proportion of soil evaporation to total evapotranspiration was 18 with the decrease of irrigation amount the evapotranspiration transpiration and irrigation water compensation decreased while evaporation remained relatively stable and the ratio of evaporation to evapotranspiration increased a lower relative evapotranspiration deficit 0 041 was obtained under moderate deficit irrigation at the budding stage than those in other deficit cases 0 086 or over in conclusion in the arid and semi arid areas deficit irrigation could be applied to alfalfa grassland at the budding stage in alfalfa production keywords alfalfa regulated deficit irrigation soil water balance transpiration soil evaporation 1 introduction more than half of the global agricultural area is facing drought challenges geng et al 2016 and drought has been a major limiting factor affecting agricultural production in the world which is increasingly intensified by population increase and global climate change coyagocruz et al 2019 giuliani et al 2011 drought cannot always be addressed through water reclamation strategies such as the desalination and improving water use efficiency is still an extremely urgent problem panagopoulos and haralambous 2020 panagopoulos et al 2021 in recent years cultivated grassland has been extensively used in drought areas due to great potential in providing forages for animal feeding and strong adaptability in adverse environments some of the forages i e alfalfa medicago sativa l show broad spectrums in adapting to soil water availability and can survive and produce even under very dry conditions alemayehu et al 2017 capstaff and miller 2018 steduto et al 2012 however drought is still an important limiting factor for forage yield and quality in arid areas in practice irrigation is an option to sustain the growth and production of forages under drought stress considering that forage crop is quite different from grain crop in life cycle water requirement and use since it has stronger roots and periodic evapotranspiration due to cutting and regrowth further exploring how water loss and balance are affected by irrigation is very important for deep understanding of water cycle in forage production systems and for extension of forage cultivation in drought areas soil water balance in the root zone is fundamental for plant survival and production which is controlled by water input and output when root zone soil water declines to a certain extent like half of total available water for many plants steduto et al 2012 root water uptake will be significantly reduced and plant growth will be obviously restricted rahman and hasegawa 2012 soil water in the root zone can be recharged and balanced through a number of water processes allen et al 1998 irrigation and precipitation input water into root zone and increase soil water content swc however when the amount of irrigation and rainfall exceeds the holding capacity of topsoil surface runoff and deep percolation will occur which limits the increase of soil water in root zone water might also be lifted by capillary rise from a shallow watertable most importantly transpiration and evaporation cause water loss and reduce swc therefore accurate estimation of soil water balance in the root zone is of great significance to determine the availability of water resources and to guide optimal managements in irrigated arid agriculture ghiberto et al 2011 shelia et al 2018 in practice it is difficult to accurately estimate water balance mainly due to the complexity of water processes in the soil plant atmosphere continuum and the accuracy of measurements of the above indexes ghiberto et al 2011 the precipitation and irrigation are easy to obtain and surface runoff is usually ignored when the land is flat in contrast evaporation transpiration capillary rise and deep percolation are difficult to be obtained directly silva et al 2006 although there are many instruments and methods to measure these parameters problems such as high cost and time consuming still restrict the measurements cermak et al 2004 deol et al 2012 iritz et al 1997 kool et al 2014 payero and irmak 2008 wang et al 2015 soil water balance can also be analyzed by model simulation with low cost and high speed which is an efficient alternative option in deeply understanding water balance a number of models have been proposed to assess evapotranspiration or to dissect the composition of evapotranspiration at different scales malik et al 2020 maroufpoor et al 2020 qasem et al 2019 the single crop coefficient and dual kc model recommended by food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations allen et al 1998 and shuttleworth wallace model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 have been widely used and helped some in analyzing soil water dynamics however there are still some defects in these model analyses single crop coefficient model only simulates evapotranspiration failing to separate evaporation and transpiration from evapotranspiration the shuttleworth wallace model needs more parameters including some resistance parameters i e bulk resistances of canopy stomatal and boundary layer additionally these models ignore the calculation of capillary rise in recent decades rosa et al 2016 developed a simdualkc model by combining the dual kc model and the capillary rise calculation model proposed by liu et al 2006 this model is performed well in analyzing the process of soil water balance rosa et al 2016 wei et al 2015 with few parameters but separation of evaporation and transpiration however the model has been less applied to simulate water balance in perennial forages which generally appear greatly different from annual species alfalfa is one of the oldest and most important forages in the world with a planting area of more than 30 million ha steduto et al 2012 and has been planted in china for over 2000 yr it has high nutritional quality and biomass production rogers et al 2014 and can widely adapt to the environments avcÄ± et al 2013 in recent years a renewed interest has been attracted to further explore the ability of alfalfa to reduce vulnerability of agricultural areas steduto et al 2012 for instance compared with annual crops alfalfa cultivation is more efficient in reducing surface runoff and soil erosion jun et al 2014 alfalfa can survive and produce in the areas with annual precipitation of 300 800 mm but irrigation has played a key role in commercial alfalfa production in the arid areas like the inland arid area of midwestern china previous report has shown that regulated deficit irrigation rdi could regulate the yield and quality of alfalfa and higher production performance could be obtained under rdi at single growth stages especially at the budding stage liu et al 2021 however there is a lack of elaboration on alfalfa water loss in these situations as a perennial forage alfalfa has many obvious differences with traditional grain crops in water loss 1 alfalfa has the potential to produce dry matter in the whole year so it has high annual water loss between 800 and 1600 mm kuslu 2010 2 alfalfa is usually mowed at the early flowering stage to harvest forage testa et al 2011 avoiding at least part of the period of maximum water loss allen et al 1998 when the daily actual evapotranspiration can exceed 8 mm d 1 3 water cycle and use of alfalfa grassland differ among various growth stages and stand ages 4 alfalfa has a strong and deep taproot in soil profile xiao et al 2015 endowed it strong ability of water extraction in deeper soil layers therefore soil water balance process of alfalfa might be different from that of traditional grain crops further revealing soil water balance and its regulation would help a lot in the extensive use of irrigated alfalfa grassland in addition model simulation has potentials in analyzing soil water balance which has not been demonstrated in the previous report liu et al 2021 this study aims to uncover the evapotranspiration characteristics and soil water balance of alfalfa grassland with modified dual kc model the purpose of this study is 1 to verify the applicability of modified dual kc model in simulating soil water balance of alfalfa root zone with a 3 yr border irrigation trail 2 to demonstrate the changes in evapotranspiration characteristics and soil water balance of alfalfa grassland with rdi 3 to find out which rdi treatment can achieve weaker water stress without enhancing water irrigation input 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment 1 site description the experiment was conducted in suzhou district 98 80 e 39 67 n 1368 m above sea level jiuquan city gansu province china from 2017 to 2019 the study area is a typical inland arid area with an annual average precipitation of 90 mm 1954 2019 and an annual average reference evapotranspiration of 1730 mm 1954 2019 calculated by the penman monteith equation soil texture of 0 40 40 60 and 60 200 cm are sandy loam with 69 3 sand 26 4 silt and 4 3 clay sandy loam with 51 1 sand 42 9 silt and 6 clay and silt loam with 13 2 sand 75 5 silt and 11 3 clay respectively and the corresponding field capacity are 0 25 0 34 and 0 40 m3 m 3 the electrical conductivity and ph of irrigation water are 0 7 ms cm 1 and 7 4 this site belongs to a highly irrigation dependent oasis with one cropping mode representing the local agricultural practice the pre crop before this experiment was lycium ruthenicum an economic crop sown in this area 2 experimental design and field management alfalfa was sown on may 24 2017 with seeding rate of 22 5 kg ha 1 seeding depth of 2 cm and row space of 20 cm there were 20 rows in each plot under a border irrigation and 300 kg ha 1 diammonium phosphate was used as base fertilizer before seeding irrigation treatment was then started when three true leaves of alfalfa emerged the experiment was arranged in a completely random design with seven irrigation treatments and three replicates 6 m 4 m per replicate plot alfalfa generally has three main phenological stages which are fundamental for growth and production therefore seven irrigation treatments were set to consider different water stress scenarios at various phenological stages the seven irrigation treatments included a full irrigation treatment for the whole growth period ifu and six rdi treatments a slight water deficit for whole growth period isl b moderate water deficit for the whole growth period imo c moderate water deficit at the branching and budding stage ibb d moderate water deficit at the regrowth stage ire e moderate water deficit at the branching stage ibr and f moderate water deficit at the budding stage ibu using the irrigation amount under ifu as the standard 50 60 mm for each irrigation which makes the surface 60 cm soil layer reach field capacity the irrigation amount of slight water deficit was 70 and moderate water deficit 50 more details for irrigation schedule shown in fig s1 the irrigation date for ifu treatment depended on the change in available water of reference soil layer 0 60 cm in 2017 and 0 100 cm in 2018 and 2019 kuslu et al 2010 the available water of reference soil layer was calculated using the difference in water storage between the field capacity and the wilting point in the reference layer in order to accurately demonstrate the change in swc a manual time domain reflectometry tdr instrument trime pico iph tdr imko was used to measure the swc in each plot the installation calibration and validation of tdr can be referred in the instruction manual of tdr provided with the devices this instrument can quickly and accurately measure the swc of different depths showing good performance in monitoring soil water dynamics when the available water of reference soil layer under ifu treatment reduced to half of the maximum available water irrigation was applied kuslu et al 2010 water meters were used to measure the irrigation amount in different cuts of the three years table 1 before winter the grasslands were fully irrigated once helping to survive the cold winter no fertilizer was applied in the following growing seasons the controls on pests and insects diseases and other grasses were referred to local practices 3 measurement and calculation leaf area index was measured regularly in each plot fig s2 with a sunscan device delta t devices ltd uk plant height was measured regularly in each plot fig s3 with a constant method root drill was used to monitor root depth of alfalfa at the end of each year and root distribution in each soil layer was obtained only at the end of 2019 fig s4 note that the roots were mainly distributed in 0 80 cm soil layer in 2017 0 120 cm in 2018 and 0 180 cm in 2019 the swc in the growing season was measured at 0 2 m depth interval in each plot every 3 d using the tdr which gradually enters the 2 0 m probe tube down to deep soil layer the location in the plot shown in fig s5 in 2018 soil drill gravimetric method was used as a standard method to measure swc at different depths in four of the measurement times with tdr and the relationship was analyzed using a linear regression with the data obtained from two methods the measurement with tdr could obtain greater accuracy fig s6 the swc were measured to a depth of 1 2 m at the 1st and 2nd cut in 2017 and 2018 1 8 m at the 3rd cut in 2018 and all cuts in 2019 watertable level fig s7 was measured on the same day that the swc was measured in addition there was a fully automatic micro weather station near the site therefore meteorological data were automatically recorded including air temperature air humidity atmospheric pressure solar radiation wind speed and rainfall fig s8 also shown in liu et al 2021 soil evaporation e m in each plot was measured using a micro lysimeter the location in the plot shown in fig s5 which is an easily operated and widely used method zhang et al 2011 wei et al 2015 the micro lysimeter consists of two parts one was pvc pipe with diameter of 0 10 m and height of 0 17 m soil depth is 0 15 m as inner cylinder which will be pull out to weigh every day and another was iron pipe with diameter of 0 11 m and height of 0 17 m as outer cylinder which is closely attached to soil wall and prevents the wall from collapse the micro lysimeter would be reinstalled in other places of the plot with soil replaced after irrigation or heavy precipitation and a new weighing of micro lysimeter is started soil e m was finally calculated using the following formula 1 e m 10 Î´ w Ï Ï d 2 2 where e m is the measured soil evaporation Î´w is the difference of the two weights g in the micro lysimeter for 24 h Ï is water density g cm 3 and d is the micro lysimeter diameter cm 2 2 model simulation 1 model description and parameter computation the daily soil water balance at the field scales was computed following the methods of fao56 allen et al 1998 2 d r i d r i 1 p r o i i i c r i e t a i d p i where dr i and dr i 1 are the daily depletion water shortage relative to field capacity of root zone at the end of day i and i 1 mm in this study the depth of root zone was 0 80 cm soil layer in 2017 0 120 cm in 2018 and 0 180 cm in 2019 field capacity and actual water content of different soil layers were measured using soil drill method and summed according to the reference depth to truly reflect dr in formula 2 p is the precipitation mm ro is surface runoff mm there were 0 5 m high ridges around the experimental plots so ro was ignored here and i is irrigation mm cr is capillary rise mm from watertable eta is actual evapotranspiration mm and dpi is deep percolation mm the cr was calculated with the method of liu et al 2006 the dual kc model allen et al 1998 was used to compute actual crop transpiration ta and soil evaporation ea and then actual evapotranspiration eta was calculated 3 e t a k s k c b k e e t 0 4 e a k e e t 0 5 t a k s k c b e t 0 where ks is water stress coefficient kcb is basal crop coefficient ke is soil evaporation coefficient et0 is reference crop evapotranspiration mm calculated by penman monteith equation here ea is actual soil evaporation mm and ta is actual crop transpiration in the study area alfalfa can be harvested 2 or 3 cuts in a year so each cut has a set of kcb values which should be adjusted by wind speed air humidity and plant height allen et al 1998 the ke was computed using the method of fao56 allen et al 1998 and the fraction of ground cover fc to assess ke was computed from leaf area index lai and crop height h using the following formula allen and pereira 2009 6 f c 1 e 0 7 l a i 1 h the ks was computed using the following formula 7 k s t a w d r i t a w r a w 8 r a w p t a w where taw and raw are the total and readily available soil water mm of root zone p is the depletion fraction for the crop under no water stress and for alfalfa it is 0 55 as previously recommended allen et al 1998 the dp was calculated using fao56 method allen et al 1998 following irrigation or heavy rain swc in the root zone might exceed field capacity and thus some of them may go down into deeper soil layers it was assumed that the soil water content is at field capacity on the same day of the wetting event so the d r i will be zero 9 d p i p i r o i i i e t a i d r i 1 as long as the soil water content in the root zone is below field capacity i e dr i 0 the soil will not drain and dpi 0 allen et al 1998 the above calculation process was encapsulated with r code and the calibrated values of these parameters were summarized in table 2 in addition relative evapotranspiration deficit etpot eta etpot is often used to evaluate the degree of water stress on crops and etpot is potential evapotranspiration shrestha et al 2010 irrigation water compensation iwc was calculated using the following formula 10 i w c i e t 100 where et is seasonal evapotranspiration mm 2 model calibration and validation in this study each treatment included three replicate plots and thus all input data for the model were the average of the data from three plots the soil water data under imo treatment was used to calibrate the model to obtain appropriate model parameters and the data from other treatments were used to verify the calibrated model parameters in each year three statistical parameters mean error me mean absolute errors mae and root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate model errors phogat et al 2017 a simple linear regression was used to fit the relationship between measured and simulated values and r2 was obtained and plotted the following equations were employed to obtain me mae and rmse by comparing measured m and corresponding simulated s values of water content as follows 11 m e 1 n i 1 n m i s i 12 m a e 1 n i 1 n m i s i 13 r m s e 1 n i 1 n m i s i 2 where n is the number of comparisons 3 simulation of soil water balance in alfalfa grassland after the applicability of the model in simulation soil water dynamics in alfalfa grassland the dynamic changes of soil water storage evaporation and transpiration were analyzed through model simulation the differences in water balance components among different irrigation treatments in various growing seasons were compared the detailed analysis process was summarized in a flow chart fig s9 which also included the field measured parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification of the model and simulation of water storage in root zone alfalfa shoot growth and root distribution in soils varied among stand ages steduto et al 2012 which leads to the changes in water use and soil water availability therefore calibration and validation of model parameter should be carried out separately for different years therefore we used the imo treatment data set of three years to calibrate the model parameters in this study table 2 soil water dynamics was well simulated with the model and the rmse for swc ranged from 0 0061 to 0 0246 m3 m 3 the me ranged from 0 0018 0 0114 m3 m 3 and the mae ranged from 0 0049 to 0 0169 m3 m 3 table 3 figs 1 and 2 showed the comparison between the measured and simulated values of swc and water storage in root zone and both values were in good agreement the regression coefficients for linear regressions were higher than 0 6 and close to 1 0 in most cuts and the slopes were close to 1 0 in all cuts fig 1 it suggested that the model can well predict the variation of soil water during alfalfa growth and thus can be used to analyze soil water dynamics in the irrigation management during alfalfa production alfalfa roots grow continuously as the life cycle prolongs huang et al 2018 shen et al 2009 zhao et al 2004 and thus soil depth to which alfalfa can extract water changes with stand age in this study alfalfa root in 2017 distributed mainly in the 80 cm soil depth 120 cm in 2018 and 180 cm in 2019 these differences led to change in water storage of root zone with stand age showing a tendency of increase with years fig 2 which is obviously different from annual crops such as corn and sweet sorghum rosa et al 2016 soybean wei et al 2015 deficit irrigation treatments isl and imo during the whole growth period decreased water storage in root zone dramatically the change trend of water storage under deficit irrigation at single growth stage was similar to that under full irrigation ifu it implies that deficit irrigation only in a single growth stage would reduce the amplitude of the fluctuation of soil water in the root zone but barely change the fluctuation curve 3 2 soil evaporation estimation in comparison with soil water soil evaporation was not well simulated with the model fig 3 the rmse for soil evaporation ranged from 0 7984 to 1 3465 mm d 1 the me ranged from 0 5011 to 1 0693 mm d 1 and the mae ranged from 0 6957 to 1 0775 mm d 1 table 4 fig 3 showed the comparison between the measured and simulated soil evaporations and there were consistent change trends for both values however the measured values were somehow higher than the simulated ones especially during the mid season in all cuts it suggested that the measurement by the micro lysimeter would have led to overestimation of soil evaporation this overestimation has also been reported in other studies hu et al 2020 klocke et al 1990 martin et al 1987 wei et al 2015 zhao et al 2013 2015 water extraction by roots was excluded from the micro lysimeter which results in higher swc in the micro lysimeter than in the surrounding area at the end of a drying cycle and thus leads to a higher potential to evaporate daamen 1993 klocke et al 1990 note that the overestimation occurred easily when alfalfa grew to form a closed canopy structure with relatively small soil evaporation thus in agreement with the finding of klocke et al 1990 the simulated soil evaporation of alfalfa at the early stage well reflected the measured value but it didn t when alfalfa grew to the middle and later stages this growth stage specific inconsistency gives us another viewpoint to consider the overestimation the inevitable daily field measurement pulling out the inner cylinder to weigh and put it back may lead to canopy damage and less cover over the micro lysimeter which leads to more radiation and air flow on the soil in the micro lysimeter finn 1997 sun et al 2014 at the early growth stage of alfalfa the canopy is sparse and short the frequent measurement caused canopy damage barely affects soil evaporation in contrast soil surface is completely covered till alfalfa grows to form a closed canopy structure at the middle and later stages fig s2 thus less cover caused by micro lysimeter weighing makes the soil surface very different on the micro lysimeter from the surrounding area this would result in higher evaporation nevertheless the applicability of this model in simulating soil evaporation for irrigated alfalfa grassland cannot be denied 3 3 crop coefficients soil evaporation coefficient ke describes the evaporation potential from soil surface allen et al 1998 for all cuts alfalfa had a higher ke value during the initial stage than later stages fig 4 suggesting that the evaporation in soil water loss at the initial stage tends to be greater than those at other stages at this stage there is more energy for soil evaporation due to less cover to soil surface and relatively high soil water content due to one time irrigation at the beginning in contrast at the later growth stages of alfalfa the available energy to the soil decreases with increasing canopy cover which leads to lower ke values till the end of the growth cycle this is consistent with the findings on winter wheat wang et al 2016 soybean wei et al 2015 summer maize zhao et al 2013 in this study there were two growth cycles in 2017 establishing year three in 2018 and 2019 the duration of the first growth cycle was the longest leading to various growth performances the kcb curve reflects the change in potential basal crop coefficient in different cuts and different growth stages of the year there are four stages which can be divided from the curve according to leaf area index and growth stage including kcb ini kcb dev kcb mid and kcb end allen et al 1998 in the dual kc model standard kcb mid and kcb end the kcb at the middle and end of growth stage values are generally adjusted under specific climatic conditions and growth status allen et al 1998 therefore in this study kcb mid and kcb end were also adjusted in different cuts since precipitation radiation and temperature were very different in various cuts and alfalfa growth status as well in 2018 and 2019 kcb mid and kcb end in the 1st cut were higher than those in the other two cuts it means water consumption in this cut might be higher the dry matter yield of alfalfa in the 1st cut was higher than those in the 2nd and 3rd cut liu et al 2021 and thus the water consumption in the 1st cut was greater it is also confirmed indirectly by the higher leaf area index and height in this cut figs s2 and s3 additionally in the same duration climatic condition barely differed among various plots of the experimental site and soil water might be the main influencing factor in this case therefore there were significant differences in kcb adj among different deficit irrigation treatments fig 4 suggesting that deficit irrigation would significantly affect evapotranspiration 3 4 evapotranspiration characteristics fig 5 showed the results on changes in ea ta and eta computed by this model at the beginning of each cut ea was the main source of evapotranspiration but with the increase of leaf area index fig s2 it decreased while ta increased to become the main source of evapotranspiration this shift of role in forming evapotranspiration has also been demonstrated with other crops wei et al 2015 zhao et al 2013 as alfalfa grows to reach closed canopy eta can rise to over 8 0 mm d 1 and even 15 0 mm d 1 in some cases benli et al 2006 steduto et al 2012 in this study the daily eta in the 1st cut of 2017 and 2018 was higher than 8 0 mm d 1 and even over 15 0 mm d 1 at the middle and later growth stages in contrast in the 2nd and 3rd cuts it was always less than 10 0 mm d 1 there was higher dry matter accumulation in the 1st cut than in the rest cuts liu et al 2021 which leads to greater daily water consumption in the 1st cut and higher daily eta feng et al 2020 this higher eta was also in accordance with higher kc mid and kc end in the 1st cut of 2018 and 2019 fig 4 at the early flowering stage when alfalfa was harvested the daily eta decreased significantly due to cutting and especially ta was reduced to less than 1 0 mm d 1 which is consistent with other studies steduto et al 2012 this periodic variation of evapotranspiration is beneficial to the recovery of soil water after cutting and to retaining more water for the regrowth wagle et al 2019 we also found that the daily eta under different irrigation treatments showed a similar change trend but deficit irrigation led to reduction in intensity of daily eta 3 5 soil water balance in this study seasonal evapotranspiration could reach 800 mm in alfalfa grassland table 5 which has also been reported in other studies kuslu et al 2010 sahin and hamay 1996 but the precipitation in this area ca 90 mm was much lower than the evapotranspiration therefore irrigation was the main source of water supply to replenish water shortage and capillary rise was also a source that cannot be ignored in this area in this study water replenishment through capillary rise was 73 mm in 2017 79 mm in 2018 and 64 mm in 2019 the amount of water from capillary rise is close to the annual rainfall in this area accounting for 10 or more of alfalfa water demand alfalfa transpiration and soil evaporation were the main water loss in the grasslands in this study soil evaporation loss was 102 107 mm in 2017 130 155 mm in 2018 and 126 145 mm in 2019 the average proportions of soil evaporation in total evapotranspiration of alfalfa grasslands were 18 18 and 19 in 2017 2019 table 5 much less than those of soybean 32 wei et al 2015 maize 24 rosa et al 2016 and sorghum 28 rosa et al 2016 the closed canopy structure of alfalfa would inhibit soil evaporation a lot due to less radiation and weaker wind than in other crop systems the leaf area index of alfalfa in each cut could exceed 3 0 in a short time fig s2 which indicates there is a complete coverage to the soil allen et al 1998 in contrast the transpiration took up the most part of total evapotranspiration more than 90 in most time of the life cycle fig 6 in addition the proportion of transpiration tended to increase with the growth in a life cylce while the evaporation was greater at the earlier growth stages with the decrease of irrigation amount the evapotranspiration transpiration and iwc decreased table 5 the decrease of irrigation amount results in lower swc and alfalfa may encounter water stress which leads to reduced transpiration abduljabbar et al 1985 kuslu et al 2010 in contrast evaporation was relatively stable the surface soil under different treatments might have been completely covered by the canopy of alfalfa in a short time fig s2 which leads to equivalent energy obtained under various treatments and consequently close soil evaporation in this study water loss was always higher than water supply leading to the depletion of soil water storage during alfalfa growth therefore the less irrigation was performed the more soil water content decreased in this study the iwc under ifu treatment was 72 5 much lower than those of other plants in similar semi arid areas for instance under full irrigation iwc was 82 for pumpkin yavuz et al 2015 88 for sugar beet topak et al 2016 89 for sunflower yavuz et al 2019 and 74 81 for melon yavuz et al 2021 this may be attributed mainly to differences in root characteristics between alfalfa and those plants alfalfa can excavate water from deeper soil layers since it has a very deep taproot which makes it less dependent on irrigation water compared with shallower root crops cavero et al 2016 in addition the iwc decreased with the decrease of irrigation amount for instance under the imo treatment it was reduced to about 50 3 6 relative evapotranspiration deficit the relative evapotranspiration deficit can reflect the degree of water stress gonzalez dugo et al 2020 king et al 2021 the relative evapotranspiration deficit under ifu treatment was always the lowest which was 0 07 in 2017 0 009 in 2018 and 0 005 in 2019 while increased significantly with the decrease of irrigation amount under whole growth deficit irrigation fig 7 under deficit irrigation treatments at single growth stages the values were higher than that under ifu treatment but lower than those under other treatments this was in accordance with changes in irrigation amount under different treatments table 1 particularly relative evapotranspiration deficit under ibu treatment was about 0 041 in 2018 and 2019 lower than those under other deficit irrigation treatments this means that moderate deficit irrigation at the budding stage may not cause severe water stress and may result in less harm to the growth than other deficit irrigation treatments thus the deficit irrigation at the budding stage would less affect the yield than those deficit irrigated at the regrowth or branching stage cheng 2005 liu et al 2021 sun 2008 therefore this irrigation practice can save irrigation water about 100 mm without significantly increasing water stress additionally soil drying due to less water supply at this stage can be beneficial for alfalfa harvest at the flowering stage 4 conclusions the modified dual kc model can well simulate the change of soil water content in root zone of alfalfa the change trend of root zone water under deficit irrigation at single growth stages was similar to that under full irrigation micro lysimeter method would overestimate soil evaporation of alfalfa when soil surface was completely covered by alfalfa the evapotranspiration and transpiration of alfalfa grasslands were significantly reduced by lowering irrigation amount while evaporation barely changed the change trend of daily actual evapotranspiration under deficit irrigation at single growth stages was also similar to that under full irrigation the seasonal evapotranspiration could reach 800 mm under alfalfa grassland and was reduced by deficit irrigation the daily actual evapotranspiration of alfalfa in the 1st cut was higher than 8 0 mm d 1 and even over 15 0 mm d 1 at the middle and later growth stages in contrast in the 2nd and 3rd cut it was always less than 10 0 mm d 1 the average proportion of soil evaporation to total evapotranspiration of alfalfa grasslands was 18 moderate deficit irrigation at the budding stage did not cause obvious water stress and thus was recommended to be applied in the management of alfalfa cultivation in these areas however we have to admit that this study didn t show in details how water moves within soil profile some mechanistic models such as hydrus model series would be used to explore water movement from horizonal and or vertical levels in the root zone with further research declaration of

9801,plastic mulching pm is regarded as a promising way to increase crop production however its reported that plastic mulching may decrease soil organic carbon content and been unfavorable for sustainable agricultural production confirmation of the effects of plastic mulching on soil water and organic carbon balances in a long term including finding efficient ways to improve these balances is crucial for the sustainability of agricultural production in semiarid rain fed areas we conducted field experiment 2010 2019 with spring maize and wheat as tested crops using four treatments of plastic mulching pm plastic mulching with supplementary irrigation pmi plastic mulching with organic fertilizer application pmo and without mulching ck the results of this 10 year field experiment showed that pm with supplementary irrigation and organic fertilizer application not only significantly increased yield and water productivity wp of wheat and maize but also had a positive effect on soil water budget the soil water budget of pmi pmo and pm significantly increased by 120 4 96 1 and 105 8 in wheat and by 149 7 28 2 and 53 6 in maize compared with ck respectively the improved soil water condition resulted in a significant increment of yield pmi pmo and pm increased yield by 122 8 89 7 and 67 0 for wheat by 237 8 183 0 and 148 4 for maize respectively compared with ck the 10 years of continuous pm significantly decreased soil organic carbon content soc in 0 10 10 20 30 50 and 50 70 cm profiles by 22 5 19 1 15 6 and 15 3 for wheat but had no significant effect for maize the pmo significantly increased soil organic carbon content in 0 30 cm profiles for both wheat and maize but the soil organic carbon budgets were negative for all four treatments the pmo accelerated soil organic carbon loss for maize but had little effect for wheat compared with pm and ck however pmi pmo and pm significantly increases crop bio carbon production resulted in the positive total carbon budget and significantly increased by 25 0 15 0 11 5 mg ha 1 in wheat and 105 1 74 1 74 0 mg ha 1 in maize respectively as compared with ck these results suggested that the soil organic carbon budget differed for the two crops also affected by water or organic carbon supplementation a more appropriate crop rotation system with organic fertilizer application should be developed to increase

plastic mulching significantly increases crop yield worldwide li et al 2007 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 mo et al 2017 especially in semiarid areas hou et al 2014 qin et al 2015 wang et al 2015 wang and shangguan 2015 where cover 40 of the global land surface huang et al 2016 and are the main regions suffering starvation and poverty fao 2019 the soil thermal hydraulic effect of plastic mulching is clear liu et al 2009 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 hou et al 2014 mo et al 2017 wu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 and is regarded as a promising way to increase crop production and resolve poverty in semiarid areas however there has been increasing attention on soil quality and sustainable agricultural production li et al 2004 2007 zhou et al 2012 luo et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 dong et al 2018 jin et al 2018 especially on soil organic carbon soc and annual water balances which are the key factors affecting the sustainable production of plastic mulching technology the effect of plastic mulching on soc concentration is not only a key issue for technological development but also a scientific issue of great contention there are contradictory statements on the effect of plastic mulching on soc concentration some researchers reported that plastic mulching can decrease soil organic matter concentration li et al 2004 2007 zhou et al 2012 huo et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 fu et al 2017 dong et al 2018 jin et al 2018 mainly because plastic mulching increases soil water content swc and temperature resulting in decreased dissolved organic carbon and increased microbial biomass carbon and soil respiration huo et al 2015 dong et al 2018 thus being a disadvantage to soil carbon accumulation however other studies demonstrated that plastic mulching can significantly increase soc sustainably enhance crop productivity and maintain soil quality liu et al 2009 luo et al 2015 li et al 2015 especially for an aridity index of 0 15 0 4 thus soc more likely benefits from plastic mulching zhu et al 2017 reported that integrated arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and a plastic film mulching farming system promoted both soc and economic profitability and was an environment friendly and promising management to ensure food security and ecosystem sustainability additionally fu et al 2017 reported that plastic mulching did not change soc concentration in a wheat field in a sub humid rain fed area after 7 years consequently the effects of plastic mulching on soc was sharply different this mainly because change in soc is a long term accumulative effect and differs according to the crop and the area the short term i e less than 10 years and single crop field investigations is not sufficient to estimate this key issue the soil water balance swb is another key factor in determining the plastic mulching in sustainable agricultural production which is also doubted widely some work verified that plastic mulching increased swc accompanied by significantly increased evapotranspiration et zhang et al 2011 2019 ren et al 2017 wu et al 2018 conversely ding et al 2018 reported that soil water was depleted by 125 6 193 0 mm down to 180 cm depths in winter wheat on the northwest loess plateau wu et al 2018 also found that soil water storage sws in the 100 200 cm profile of a plastic mulched maize field decreased by 28 mm at harvest stage compared with a no mulching field our previous study also showed that after 6 years of maize continuous cropping on a semiarid rain fed field sws with plastic mulching decreased by 163 59 mm comprising 5 21 mm in the 0 140 and 158 37 mm in the 140 300 cm layers compared with that at sowing stage in the first experimental year wang et al 2018 however wheat continuous cropping increased sws in the deep soil profile hou et al 2014 otherwise the effect of plastic mulching on swb differs according to local rainfall crops and even the measured soil depth of 0 200 or 0 300 cm soil profiles for example plastic mulched maize depleted deep soil water in a semiarid area wang et al 2018 but increased it in a sub humid area ren et al 2017 with annual rainfall of 410 and 550 mm respectively in sum studies on the plastic mulching in sustainable agricultural production are well documented and both the soc and swb have conflicting results for three main reasons 1 previous studies concerned one kind of crop on the same site conducted over the short term or the measured depths of swc 0 200 cm were insufficient to obtain accurate information on the effect of plastic mulching on crop production sustainability 2 the experimental treatment designs usually only showed the difference between with and without plastic mulching treatments and did not address the two key factors water supplementation and organic carbon addition although these are very important to determine a helpful method to sustain this balance 3 the experimental analysis investigated the soc and not crop carbon sequestration and thus could not accurately estimate the effect of plastic mulching on carbon accumulation of the soil crop system for the above reasons and based on our previous work we hypothesized that plastic mulching causes soil water depletion and decreases soil soc and designed a field experiment spring maize zea mays l xianyu 335 and wheat triticum aestivum l longchun 27 were selected as tested crops the field experiment was conducted in a typical semiarid area the aridity index is 0 28 from 2010 and the swc down to 300 cm and soc down to 100 cm in the soil profile were measured the objectives were 1 to determine the soc and water balance over the long term for a deep soil profile in a typical semiarid area annual rainfall around 400 mm in a critical region for agriculture 2 if pm was disadvantage to the balance of soil water and organic carbon could the water supplementation and organic carbon addition sustain this balance and 3 assess the production and ecological effect of plastic mulching by analyzing the total carbon and water budgets of the soil crop system 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and experimental treatments the study site was located at the national agricultural experimental

field experiment and the quantity was controlled by a water meter organic fertilizer dry rotten sheep manure was spread annually before tillage at rates of 13 500 and 9000 kg per ha for maize and wheat respectively all treatments were rotary tilled once after crop harvest i e maize and wheat at the end of october and july respectively with plastic mulching applied immediately after tillage to inhibit evaporation the weed removed manually and there was no other practice in crop growth period all treatments were arranged in a randomized complete design with three replications the area of

advanced almost 5 7 days 2 2 measurement of soil water storage the soil water concentration swc was measured at 20 cm intervals in the 0 300 cm soil profile for maize and wheat with soil cores randomly collected in each plot at the sowing and harvesting stages every year for the determination of supplementary irrigation amount the swc in 0 100 cm profile was measured every 10 days from seedling to harvesting for both maize and wheat the soil samples were collected by drilling equipment and loaded into aluminum boxes the fresh weight was determined the sample was oven dried at 105 c for 12 h and then the dry weight was measured and swc w w calculated according to formula 2 2 swc fw dw dw aw where fw is fresh weight of the soil sample with the aluminum box dw is dry weight of the

crop growing period the water productivity wp was calculated as yield divided by et annual rainfall is around 400 mm and annual evaporation reaches 1500 mm in the experimental area thus percolation could be generally ignored the soil water budget swb is measured to assess the soil water balance it is equal to the sws at harvesting stage of 2019 minus sws at sowing stage of 2010 2 4 biomass and grain yield at maturity in each year crop biomass was measured for 50 plants selected from each plot for maize and wheat the total biomass mg ha 1 equal to the product of plant density million plant

inhibiting evaporation and increasing soil temperature zhang et al 2011 hou et al 2014 farmer et al 2016 ren et al 2017 resulting in a relatively suitable micro environment for crop development the well developed crop population improves soil water utilization which may cause soil water depletion and destroy the soil water annual balance some research has shown that continuous cropping of maize and wheat under plastic mulch resulted in soil water depletion for semiarid rain fed areas wang et al 2015 ding wu et al 2018 2018 our previous experimental results also verified that continuous maize cropping for 6 years depleted the soil water by 158 37 mm in the 140 300 cm layer wang et al 2018 the results of this 10 year field experiment showed that plastic mulching not only significantly increased yield and wp of wheat and maize but also had a positive effect on soil water budget swb as compared with 2010 the sws in the 0 300 cm profile at sowing stage in 2019 increased by 172 8 and 14 5 mm for wheat and maize respectively the supplementary irrigation is an efficient way to increase crop production and sustain swb in rain fed areas li et al 2010 mavimbela and van rensburg 2012 wei et al 2018 our research further showed that the swb of pmi being 16 7 and 188 7 mm for wheat and 8 3 and 106 8 mm for maize at harvesting and sowing stages in 2019 respectively the correspondingly value of pmo were 119 6 171 2 mm and 15 9 9 2 mm these results indicated that long term plastic mulching could sustain the swb for both wheat and maize the supplementary irrigation could strengthen this effect by ameliorating the deep soil water condition and organic fertilizer were also benefit to soil water balance the plastic mulching ameliorated soil water and temperature condition these are benefit to increase dissolved organic carbon microbial biomass carbon content and soil respiration huo et al 2015 dong et al 2018 resulted in the decreased soil organic carbon content contrarily the other studies reported that soc more likely benefits from plastic mulching liu et al 2009 luo et al 2015 li et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 especially in the region with aridity index of 0 15 0 4 the results of this 10 year field experiment showed that pm decreased soc in the wheat field by 22 5 19 1 15 6 and 16 3 in 0 10 10 20 30 50 and 50 70 cm profiles respectively this may because the plastic mulching increased sensitivity of soil organic carbon luo et al 2015 improved the decomposition of soil organic carbon however pm did not significantly affect soc in the maize field compared with soc at sowing stage in 2010 this indicated that the decomposition amount of soil organic carbon was approximate to the carbon fixation amount which caused by the increased root biomass of maize under plastic mulching condition pmo significantly increased soc in 0 30 cm soil profile 36 4 89 6 and without significantly in 30 100 cm soil profile the pmi and pm significantly decreased soc in 0 20 cm profile in wheat field as compared with soc at sowing stage in 2010 this suggested that the carbon fixation amount caused by the increased root biomass of wheat was lower than the soil organic carbon decomposition under plastic mulching condition for pmo the soc in 0 10 and 10 20 cm soil profile was significantly increased by 58 1 and 25 9 and without significant difference in 30 100 cm soil profile consequently the effect of plastic mulching on soc was specific in different crops decreased soc in wheat but had no significant effect in maize field this may indicate that the rotation of different crops may be a promising way to increase soc adiku et al 2008 adviento borbe et al 2007 the organic fertilizer application could increase soc in both wheat and maize field in a long term the soc budget reflects the soil organic carbon balance the positive soc budget means carbon sink and the negative means carbon source adviento borbe et al 2007 after 10 years wheat and maize monocropping the soc budget was negative for the four experimental treatments pm increased soc loss by 2 4 and 2 2 mg ha 1 in wheat and maize respectively as compared with ck though pmo significantly increased soc in 0 10 10 20 and 20 30 cm profiles in both wheat and maize field when compared with pm the soc budget of pmo were 11 9 and 9 7 mg ha 1 in wheat and maize respectively lower than pm in maize 3 0 mg ha 1 as compared with pm pmi increased soil organic carbon loss in maize but decreased in wheat the soc budget of pmi were 9 7 and 4 1 mg ha 1 in wheat and maize respectively additionally the budget of soc in all four treatments were lower in wheat field than that in maize field these results suggested that long term plastic mulching was not advantage to soc balance the organic fertilizer application accelerated soc loss in the maize field this effect was more remarkable in wheat field pm increases crop bio carbon production but decrease soc budget significantly resulted in the positive total carbon budget and significantly increased by 11 5 and 74 0 mg ha 1 in wheat and maize respectively as compared with ck the total carbon budget of pmi was significantly higher than pmo pm and ck and the pmo was higher than pm the significant difference was observed in wheat field these results showed that plastic mulching could improve carbon accumulation in crop soil system and the supplemented irrigation and carbon addition could strengthen this effect in the semiarid area consequently by analyzing the effect of plastic mulching supplemented irrigation and organic carbon on swb soc budget and total carbon budget of crop soil system comprehensively we regarded that plastic mulching organic carbon addition and supplemented irrigation caused the soil organic carbon loss but ameliorated soil water condition especially in deep profile and improved bio carbon production resulted in the significantly increased total carbon budget it could be explored in semiarid area to increase crop production and soil quality while the optimized cropping system widely adapted 5 conclusions after 10 years monocropping pm decreased soil organic carbon content but well sustained the soil water budget in wheat field as compared with ck pmi and pmo increased grain yield and water use efficiency both for wheat and maize and well sustain soil water budget however pmo accelerated soil organic carbon loss for both maize and wheat resulting in decrements in the soil organic carbon budget pm significantly increased the carbon accumulation in the soil crop system and the supplementary irrigation and organic carbon addition strengthened this effect by significantly increasing crop biomass these results indicated that the effect of plastic mulching supplemented irrigation and organic carbon addition of soil water budget soil organic carbon budget and total carbon budget were differed in different crops we recommend that a more appropriate crop rotation system should be developed

9801,plastic mulching pm is regarded as a promising way to increase crop production however its reported that plastic mulching may decrease soil organic carbon content and been unfavorable for sustainable agricultural production confirmation of the effects of plastic mulching on soil water and organic carbon balances in a long term including finding efficient ways to improve these balances is crucial for the sustainability of agricultural production in semiarid rain fed areas we conducted field experiment 2010 2019 with spring maize and wheat as tested crops using four treatments of plastic mulching pm plastic mulching with supplementary irrigation pmi plastic mulching with organic fertilizer application pmo and without mulching ck the results of this 10 year field experiment showed that pm with supplementary irrigation and organic fertilizer application not only significantly increased yield and water productivity wp of wheat and maize but also had a positive effect on soil water budget the soil water budget of pmi pmo and pm significantly increased by 120 4 96 1 and 105 8 in wheat and by 149 7 28 2 and 53 6 in maize compared with ck respectively the improved soil water condition resulted in a significant increment of yield pmi pmo and pm increased yield by 122 8 89 7 and 67 0 for wheat by 237 8 183 0 and 148 4 for maize respectively compared with ck the 10 years of continuous pm significantly decreased soil organic carbon content soc in 0 10 10 20 30 50 and 50 70 cm profiles by 22 5 19 1 15 6 and 15 3 for wheat but had no significant effect for maize the pmo significantly increased soil organic carbon content in 0 30 cm profiles for both wheat and maize but the soil organic carbon budgets were negative for all four treatments the pmo accelerated soil organic carbon loss for maize but had little effect for wheat compared with pm and ck however pmi pmo and pm significantly increases crop bio carbon production resulted in the positive total carbon budget and significantly increased by 25 0 15 0 11 5 mg ha 1 in wheat and 105 1 74 1 74 0 mg ha 1 in maize respectively as compared with ck these results suggested that the soil organic carbon budget differed for the two crops also affected by water or organic carbon supplementation a more appropriate crop rotation system with organic fertilizer application should be developed to increase

plastic mulching significantly increases crop yield worldwide li et al 2007 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 mo et al 2017 especially in semiarid areas hou et al 2014 qin et al 2015 wang et al 2015 wang and shangguan 2015 where cover 40 of the global land surface huang et al 2016 and are the main regions suffering starvation and poverty fao 2019 the soil thermal hydraulic effect of plastic mulching is clear liu et al 2009 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 hou et al 2014 mo et al 2017 wu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 and is regarded as a promising way to increase crop production and resolve poverty in semiarid areas however there has been increasing attention on soil quality and sustainable agricultural production li et al 2004 2007 zhou et al 2012 luo et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 dong et al 2018 jin et al 2018 especially on soil organic carbon soc and annual water balances which are the key factors affecting the sustainable production of plastic mulching technology the effect of plastic mulching on soc concentration is not only a key issue for technological development but also a scientific issue of great contention there are contradictory statements on the effect of plastic mulching on soc concentration some researchers reported that plastic mulching can decrease soil organic matter concentration li et al 2004 2007 zhou et al 2012 huo et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 fu et al 2017 dong et al 2018 jin et al 2018 mainly because plastic mulching increases soil water content swc and temperature resulting in decreased dissolved organic carbon and increased microbial biomass carbon and soil respiration huo et al 2015 dong et al 2018 thus being a disadvantage to soil carbon accumulation however other studies demonstrated that plastic mulching can significantly increase soc sustainably enhance crop productivity and maintain soil quality liu et al 2009 luo et al 2015 li et al 2015 especially for an aridity index of 0 15 0 4 thus soc more likely benefits from plastic mulching zhu et al 2017 reported that integrated arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and a plastic film mulching farming system promoted both soc and economic profitability and was an environment friendly and promising management to ensure food security and ecosystem sustainability additionally fu et al 2017 reported that plastic mulching did not change soc concentration in a wheat field in a sub humid rain fed area after 7 years consequently the effects of plastic mulching on soc was sharply different this mainly because change in soc is a long term accumulative effect and differs according to the crop and the area the short term i e less than 10 years and single crop field investigations is not sufficient to estimate this key issue the soil water balance swb is another key factor in determining the plastic mulching in sustainable agricultural production which is also doubted widely some work verified that plastic mulching increased swc accompanied by significantly increased evapotranspiration et zhang et al 2011 2019 ren et al 2017 wu et al 2018 conversely ding et al 2018 reported that soil water was depleted by 125 6 193 0 mm down to 180 cm depths in winter wheat on the northwest loess plateau wu et al 2018 also found that soil water storage sws in the 100 200 cm profile of a plastic mulched maize field decreased by 28 mm at harvest stage compared with a no mulching field our previous study also showed that after 6 years of maize continuous cropping on a semiarid rain fed field sws with plastic mulching decreased by 163 59 mm comprising 5 21 mm in the 0 140 and 158 37 mm in the 140 300 cm layers compared with that at sowing stage in the first experimental year wang et al 2018 however wheat continuous cropping increased sws in the deep soil profile hou et al 2014 otherwise the effect of plastic mulching on swb differs according to local rainfall crops and even the measured soil depth of 0 200 or 0 300 cm soil profiles for example plastic mulched maize depleted deep soil water in a semiarid area wang et al 2018 but increased it in a sub humid area ren et al 2017 with annual rainfall of 410 and 550 mm respectively in sum studies on the plastic mulching in sustainable agricultural production are well documented and both the soc and swb have conflicting results for three main reasons 1 previous studies concerned one kind of crop on the same site conducted over the short term or the measured depths of swc 0 200 cm were insufficient to obtain accurate information on the effect of plastic mulching on crop production sustainability 2 the experimental treatment designs usually only showed the difference between with and without plastic mulching treatments and did not address the two key factors water supplementation and organic carbon addition although these are very important to determine a helpful method to sustain this balance 3 the experimental analysis investigated the soc and not crop carbon sequestration and thus could not accurately estimate the effect of plastic mulching on carbon accumulation of the soil crop system for the above reasons and based on our previous work we hypothesized that plastic mulching causes soil water depletion and decreases soil soc and designed a field experiment spring maize zea mays l xianyu 335 and wheat triticum aestivum l longchun 27 were selected as tested crops the field experiment was conducted in a typical semiarid area the aridity index is 0 28 from 2010 and the swc down to 300 cm and soc down to 100 cm in the soil profile were measured the objectives were 1 to determine the soc and water balance over the long term for a deep soil profile in a typical semiarid area annual rainfall around 400 mm in a critical region for agriculture 2 if pm was disadvantage to the balance of soil water and organic carbon could the water supplementation and organic carbon addition sustain this balance and 3 assess the production and ecological effect of plastic mulching by analyzing the total carbon and water budgets of the soil crop system 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and experimental treatments the study site was located at the national agricultural experimental

field experiment and the quantity was controlled by a water meter organic fertilizer dry rotten sheep manure was spread annually before tillage at rates of 13 500 and 9000 kg per ha for maize and wheat respectively all treatments were rotary tilled once after crop harvest i e maize and wheat at the end of october and july respectively with plastic mulching applied immediately after tillage to inhibit evaporation the weed removed manually and there was no other practice in crop growth period all treatments were arranged in a randomized complete design with three replications the area of

advanced almost 5 7 days 2 2 measurement of soil water storage the soil water concentration swc was measured at 20 cm intervals in the 0 300 cm soil profile for maize and wheat with soil cores randomly collected in each plot at the sowing and harvesting stages every year for the determination of supplementary irrigation amount the swc in 0 100 cm profile was measured every 10 days from seedling to harvesting for both maize and wheat the soil samples were collected by drilling equipment and loaded into aluminum boxes the fresh weight was determined the sample was oven dried at 105 c for 12 h and then the dry weight was measured and swc w w calculated according to formula 2 2 swc fw dw dw aw where fw is fresh weight of the soil sample with the aluminum box dw is dry weight of the

crop growing period the water productivity wp was calculated as yield divided by et annual rainfall is around 400 mm and annual evaporation reaches 1500 mm in the experimental area thus percolation could be generally ignored the soil water budget swb is measured to assess the soil water balance it is equal to the sws at harvesting stage of 2019 minus sws at sowing stage of 2010 2 4 biomass and grain yield at maturity in each year crop biomass was measured for 50 plants selected from each plot for maize and wheat the total biomass mg ha 1 equal to the product of plant density million plant

differences for maize 3 7 balance of sws compared with the sws at harvesting stage in 2019 after 10 years of continuous cropping the soil water budget swb was positive for pmi and pm but it was 3 2 and 81 6 mm in pmo and ck for wheat respectively for maize harvest swb was only positive for pmi and it was 66 8 43 2 and 93 1 mm in pmo pm and ck respectively fig 3 the swb of pmi pmo and pm significantly increased by 120 4 96 1 and 105 8 in wheat and by 149 7 28 2 and 53 6 in maize compared with ck respectively however compared with sws at sowing stage in 2019 swb was positive in all treatments for wheat and there were no significant differences among the pm pmi and pmo they were all significantly higher than for ck for maize the swb of the pm pmi and pmo were positive but swb of ck was negative 4 discussion plastic mulching has increased crop production significantly worldwide kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 wang and shangguan 2015 mo et al 2017 this benefit basically depends on inhibiting evaporation and increasing soil temperature zhang et al 2011 hou et al 2014 farmer et al 2016 ren et al 2017 resulting in a relatively suitable micro environment for crop development the well developed crop population improves soil water utilization which may cause soil water depletion and destroy the soil water annual balance some research has shown that continuous cropping of maize and wheat under plastic mulch resulted in soil water depletion for semiarid rain fed areas wang et al 2015 ding wu et al 2018 2018 our previous experimental results also verified that continuous maize cropping for 6 years depleted the soil water by 158 37 mm in the 140 300 cm layer wang et al 2018 the results of this 10 year field experiment showed that plastic mulching not only significantly increased yield and wp of wheat and maize but also had a positive effect on soil water budget swb as compared with 2010 the sws in the 0 300 cm profile at sowing stage in 2019 increased by 172 8 and 14 5 mm for wheat and maize respectively the supplementary irrigation is an efficient way to increase crop production and sustain swb in rain fed areas li et al 2010 mavimbela and van rensburg 2012 wei et al 2018 our research further showed that the swb of pmi being 16 7 and 188 7 mm for wheat and 8 3 and 106 8 mm for maize at harvesting and sowing stages in 2019 respectively the correspondingly value of pmo were 119 6 171 2 mm and 15 9 9 2 mm these results indicated that long term plastic mulching could sustain the swb for both wheat and maize the supplementary irrigation could strengthen this effect by ameliorating the deep soil water condition and organic fertilizer were also benefit to soil water balance the plastic mulching ameliorated soil water and temperature condition these are benefit to increase dissolved organic carbon microbial biomass carbon content and soil respiration huo et al 2015 dong et al 2018 resulted in the decreased soil organic carbon content contrarily the other studies reported that soc more likely benefits from plastic mulching liu et al 2009 luo et al 2015 li et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 especially in the region with aridity index of 0 15 0 4 the results of this 10 year field experiment showed that pm decreased soc in the wheat field by 22 5 19 1 15 6 and 16 3 in 0 10 10 20 30 50 and 50 70 cm profiles respectively this may because the plastic mulching increased sensitivity of soil organic carbon luo et al 2015 improved the decomposition of soil organic carbon however pm did not significantly affect soc in the maize field compared with soc at sowing stage in 2010 this indicated that the decomposition amount of soil organic carbon was approximate to the carbon fixation amount which caused by the increased root biomass of maize under plastic mulching condition pmo significantly increased soc in 0 30 cm soil profile 36 4 89 6 and without significantly in 30 100 cm soil profile the pmi and pm significantly decreased soc in 0 20 cm profile in wheat field as compared with soc at sowing stage in 2010 this suggested that the carbon fixation amount caused by the increased root biomass of wheat was lower than the soil organic carbon decomposition under plastic mulching condition for pmo the soc in 0 10 and 10 20 cm soil profile was significantly increased by 58 1 and 25 9 and without significant difference in 30 100 cm soil profile consequently the effect of plastic mulching on soc was specific in different crops decreased soc in wheat but had no significant effect in maize field this may indicate that the rotation of different crops may be a promising way to increase soc adiku et al 2008 adviento borbe et al 2007 the organic fertilizer application could increase soc in both wheat and maize field in a long term the soc budget reflects the soil organic carbon balance the positive soc budget means carbon sink and the negative means carbon source adviento borbe et al 2007 after 10 years wheat and maize monocropping the soc budget was negative for the four experimental treatments pm increased soc loss by 2 4 and 2 2 mg ha 1 in wheat and maize respectively as compared with ck though pmo significantly increased soc in 0 10 10 20 and 20 30 cm profiles in both wheat and maize field when compared with pm the soc budget of pmo were 11 9 and 9 7 mg ha 1 in wheat and maize respectively lower than pm in maize 3 0 mg ha 1 as compared with pm pmi increased soil organic carbon loss in maize but decreased in wheat the soc budget of pmi were 9 7 and 4 1 mg ha 1 in wheat and maize respectively additionally the budget of soc in all four treatments were lower in wheat field than that in maize field these results suggested that long term plastic mulching was not advantage to soc balance the organic fertilizer application accelerated soc loss in the maize field this effect was more remarkable in wheat field pm increases crop bio carbon production but decrease soc budget significantly resulted in the positive total carbon budget and significantly increased by 11 5 and 74 0 mg ha 1 in wheat and maize respectively as compared with ck the total carbon budget of pmi was significantly higher than pmo pm and ck and the pmo was higher than pm the significant difference was observed in wheat field these results showed that plastic mulching could improve carbon accumulation in crop soil system and the supplemented irrigation and carbon addition could strengthen this effect in the semiarid area consequently by analyzing the effect of plastic mulching supplemented irrigation and organic carbon on swb soc budget and total carbon budget of crop soil system comprehensively we regarded that plastic mulching organic carbon addition and supplemented irrigation caused the soil organic carbon loss but ameliorated soil water condition especially in deep profile and improved bio carbon production resulted in the significantly increased total carbon budget it could be explored in semiarid area to increase crop production and soil quality while the optimized cropping system widely adapted 5 conclusions after 10 years monocropping pm decreased soil organic carbon content but well sustained the soil water budget in wheat field as compared with ck pmi and pmo increased grain yield and water use efficiency both for wheat and maize and well sustain soil water budget however pmo accelerated soil organic carbon loss for both maize and wheat resulting in decrements in the soil organic carbon budget pm significantly increased the carbon accumulation in the soil crop system and the supplementary irrigation and organic carbon addition strengthened this effect by significantly increasing crop biomass these results indicated that the effect of plastic mulching supplemented irrigation and organic carbon addition of soil water budget soil organic carbon budget and total carbon budget were differed in different crops we recommend that a more appropriate crop rotation system should be developed to increase crop production and soil quality by ameliorating soil organic carbon and its budget in semiarid rain fed areas declaration of competing interest zhang xucheng and hou huizhi have received

9802,the demand for freshwater resources has increased in recent times and has been exacerbated by escalating global population and increasing drought indices in the world s agricultural zones irrigated agriculture is inevitably a wasteful water user that has deprived other sectors of the scarce resource improving water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture is therefore crucial for sustainable agricultural production to thrive there is potential to improve water use efficiency through smart irrigation systems especially with the advent of wireless communication technologies monitoring systems and advanced control strategies for optimal irrigation scheduling this paper reviews state of the art smart monitoring and irrigation control strategies that have been used in recent years for irrigation scheduling from the literature review closed loop irrigation control strategies are efficient than open loop systems which do not cater for uncertainties it is argued that combining soil based plant and weather based monitoring methods in a modelling environment with model predictive control can significantly improve water use efficiency this review shall help researchers and farmers to choose the best irrigation monitoring and control strategy to improve irrigation scheduling in open field agricultural systems keywords smart irrigation water use efficiency irrigation scheduling model predictive control precision agriculture 1 introduction agriculture is the backbone of most economies in the world as it contributes significantly to the gross domestic product gdp and provides food security world bank 2020d conversely agriculture has been regarded as a significant water user sector as it abstracts 70 of the world s freshwater resources to irrigate 25 of the world s croplands fao 2020a 2017a khokhar 2017 climate change and increasing population do impose additional pressure to resources such as water availability that are vital for agricultural production ungureanu et al 2020 according to the anon 2019 the world population will hit 9 7 billion by 2050 translating into increased demand for nutritious food and water resources the food and agricultural organization fao forecasts a more than 50 increase in irrigated food production by 2050 which will require a 10 increase in water abstracted for agriculture provided water productivity improves fao 2020b the land on which food is cultivated does not expand which means agricultural cropping systems need to utilize the available water and land resources efficiently to feed the future population understanding the mechanisms that can improve water use efficiency and result in significant water savings and higher yield is therefore paramount water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture is the ratio of estimated irrigation water requirements to the actual water withdrawal fao 2020a water use efficiency is dimensionless and can be applied to plant field scheme as well on basin and country scale agronomists however define water use efficiency in terms of crop yield per amount of water used to produce the yield hatfield and dold 2019 sharma et al 2015 ullah et al 2019 and unver et al 2017 water use efficiency has gained significant attention from researchers as water scarcity continues to vary in both space and time across the world due to the effects of climate change hess and knox 2013 competition from other sectors of the economy for the scarce water resource has made agriculturalists irrigation engineers and policy makers revisit the way water is used in agriculture apparently state of the art approaches to water management and systems will need to be adopted to address declining land base and water allocations to meet agricultural production needs precision agricultural technologies are key in ensuring a higher water use efficiency evans and sadler 2008 precision agriculture is at the centre to shape itself to provide solutions to the overarching problems in agriculture yin et al 2021 described precision agriculture as the use of technologies that integrate sensors information systems enhanced machinery and informed management to improve production by accounting for dynamics within sustainable agricultural systems precision agriculture and smart irrigation in particular enables farmers to save precious resources without subjecting plants to moisture deficiency pierce 2010 smart irrigation involves the application of water at the right time in the right amounts and at the right spot in the field singh et al 2019 therefore it requires the use of monitoring and control strategies for optimum irrigation scheduling taking into consideration the variation in soil moisture conditions changing weather patterns and plant physiological conditions conventional irrigation systems apply irrigation water without considering the spatiotemporal variation of soil characteristics and changes in weather variables that affect crop evapotranspiration vories et al 2021 this subsequently leads to spatial variation in the actual depth of irrigation water received by plants applying more than required irrigation water results in fertilizer leaching deep percolation and surface ponding and runoff while inadequate irrigation may lead to plant stress that may result in a reduction in crop yield and quality implementing an optimised irrigation schedule through a smart irrigation system requires sensors to monitor soil plant weather conditions on the other hand irrigation control deals with the allocation of inputs and making necessary adjustments according to the crop response to save irrigation water while mitigating the effects of disturbances and uncertainties abioye et al 2020a zazueta et al 2008 over the past few years several survey articles have been published on improving water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture chai et al 2014 hatfield and dold 2019 howell 2001 taheripour et al 2016 ullah et al 2019 other past reviews have focused on the use of smart technologies like smart sensors internet of things iot wireless sensor networks wsn in agriculture adeyemi et al 2017 hamami and nassereddine 2020 koech and langat 2018 li et al 2020 velmurugan et al 2020 and zinkernagel et al 2020 one of the most recent survey papers in the realm of smart irrigation was performed by abioye et al 2020b the authors highlight the application of monitoring and control strategies in precision irrigation in our opinion the authors give a valuable start to fellow researchers interested in smart irrigation however concerning the application of monitoring and control strategies for water use efficiency improvement to the best of our knowledge there appear to be very limited systematic literature reviews the authors fail to show how monitoring and control strategies water use efficiency in precision agriculture this review further builds upon existing literature by combining both smart strategies used in monitoring crop water use and irrigation control techniques to improve water use efficiency 2 real time irrigation scheduling irrigation scheduling is the decision of when and how much water to apply to the field and thus has a direct effect on water use efficiency broner 2005 and koech and langat 2018 the quantity of water to be applied is estimated using a criterion to determine the irrigation requirement and strategy to prescribe how much to apply efficient application of irrigation water requires an understanding of the dynamics of plant water use which has a relationship with the weather soil characteristics and plant physiology efficient irrigation scheduling applies irrigation water at the right time and in the right quantity to optimize production and offset adverse environmental impacts on the other hand poor irrigation scheduling results in under watering or waterlogging which affects water use efficiency hassan et al 2021 real time irrigation scheduling is pertinent in saving water by applying the quantity required to meet plant needs several irrigation scheduling tools have been developed to help irrigators apply water precisely to crops andales et al 2019 growers who do not use any irrigation scheduling tool often rely on their experience to schedule irrigation anon 2010 recent research has proved that growers who rely on heuristic methods of scheduling like manual time based and volume based irrigation scheduling register significant water losses garcÃ­a et al 2020 an effective real time irrigation scheduling event requires monitoring of the factors that affect plant growth and a control strategy for the delivery of the right amounts of irrigation water 3 monitoring in smart irrigation systems to improve water use efficiency it is pertinent to monitor specific factors that influence crop growth and development monitoring in the perspective of smart irrigation also entails real time data collection on the status of soil plant and weather parameters cropped area through the use of state of the art communication technologies abioye et al 2020b the development of a real time monitoring system involves the integration of sensors with a wireless sensor communication network or iot framework wireless networks are very significant in real time monitoring for smart irrigation since they have sensing processing and transmission capabilities hamami and nassereddine 2020 the wireless sensor network comprises various sensor nodes connected through a wireless connection module hamami and nassereddine 2020 monitoring in smart irrigation can either be soil based weather based or plant based monitoring as depicted in fig 1 3 1 soil moisture monitoring soil moisture monitoring involves measuring either the soil water potential or the soil water content it has been used widely for irrigation scheduling delgoda et al 2016 monitoring the soil moisture in the plant root zone is important as it helps in understanding the moisture dynamics and its relationship with the volume of irrigation water and plant water uptake several options exist for determining soil moisture levels the direct soil moisture measurement gravimetric sampling and indirect methods like eletromagetic property heat conductivity neutron count water potential and electrical resistance with advances in microcomputer and communication technology varieties of soil sensors for example ground aerial and satellite moisture sensors are gaining momentum in the suite of irrigation tools earth observation system 2020a soil moisture sensors have a small footprint on the field with sensors at multiple depths soil moisture dynamics can be captured installing the sensors at different depths increases the accuracy and also helps in understanding the changes in soil water content in response to irrigation and crop water use soulis et al 2015 soil sensors give a wide range of data on the soil s physical chemical and mechanical properties taken as optical radiometric mechanical acoustic electrical electromagnetic pneumatic or electrochemical measurements zinkernagel et al 2020 the measured variables helps in the determination of parameters such as the maximum allowable depletion mad li et al 2020 detailed descriptions of the functionality of soil moisture sensors and their characteristics can be found in pardossi et al 2009 and pardossi and incrocci 2011 and thompson et al 2017 fig 2 presents the most commonly used soil moisture sensors in research and vegetable production determination of spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture content is vital for various applications this has prompted the development of different measurement techniques over the last years soil moisture content is measured as volumetric moisture content vmc soil moisture content sensors infer volumetric moisture content based on changes in the thermal properties or electrical properties of the soil peddinti et al 2020 the electrical based sensors used to measure volumetric moisture content rely on the propagation of electromagnetic waves in the soil these sensors fall into various types i e frequency domain reflectometry fdr time domain reflectometry tdr capacitance and resistance sensors frequency domain reflectometry sensors are capable of determining the bulk dielectric constant by measuring the frequency variations of an electro magnetic pulse propagated into the soil fertinnowa 2020b lozoya et al 2016 used fdr sensors to measure field volumetric soil moisture content the sensor node was implemented with a low cost arduino mega board based on an atmega 328 microcontroller the sensors were placed on crop root level and had a volumetric moisture content range of 0 50 with 0 1 resolution to optimize water use efficiency in vegetables yadav et al 2020 used six 6 capacitance soil moisture based sensors with a data logger at three 3 locations the authors programmed irrigation scheduling using upper field capacity and lower thresholds of soil available water the results revealed an improvement in water use efficiency compared to conventional methods of irrigation scheduling domÃ­nguez niÃ±o et al 2020 reported that using capacitance type soil moisture sensors combined with fao s soil water balance model provided a sound basis for automated irrigation scheduling in orchards the disadvantage associated with soil moisture based irrigation scheduling is that plant water uptake and stress does not only respond to the soil water content but also to atmospheric conditions nutrient availability root zone salinity and pest and disease infestation with variation in soil characteristics accurate irrigation schedules are established if many representative monitoring sites are established rather than using a single point recently researchers are combining remote sensing with ground sensors to solve the problem of heterogeneity ahmad et al 2021 babaeian et al 2019 klemas et al 2014 liao et al 2021 in experimenting with a smart irrigation system in a greenhouse using soil moisture sensors used a logic diagram to describe the irrigation scheduling process as shown in fig 3 3 2 weather based monitoring weather based monitoring involves real time estimation of reference evapotranspiration et using measured weather parameters and thus indicates the water lost by the plants and the soil environment abioye et al 2020b adeyemi et al 2017 the quantity of water lost through evapotranspiration depends on humidity wind speed solar radiation and air temperature the temporal dynamics of evapotranspiration on hourly or daily timescales is appropriate for determining crop water use in smart irrigation systems where soil or plant measurements are not possible weather parameters are used to give an approximate irrigation schedule white and raine 2008 the fao penman monteith equation discussed in allen et al 1998 presents a procedure for calculating hourly or daily evapotranspiration values using standard climatological measurements of air temperature solar radiation humidity and wind speed the daily crop water use can then be estimated using eq 1 1 et c k c et 0 where et c crop evapotranspiration mm day 1 k c crop coefficient et 0 reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 most real time weather based monitoring systems have an automatic weather station with sensors for humidity temperature wind speed rainfall solar radiation and atmospheric pressure adeyemi et al 2017 dataloggers are configured to automatically acquire data at a set interval and the data is then transmitted via a communication system to an online data access portal the data logger manages communication protocols with the remote server using a wsn or iot framework the data is sent to smart irrigation controllers that combine with site specific variables such as soil type to adjust irrigation schedules hydropoint 2017b the factors that affect the performance and choice of a weather monitoring system range from robustness accuracy installation and maintenance requirements measurement suite remote data acquisition season capabilities and power requirements khoa et al 2019 implemented smart water management in farming using an iot platform the authors proposed a novel topology of sensor nodes using affordable and efficient components with a lora lpwan long range low power wide area network technology transmission module the authors reported good performance of the system similarly wasson et al 2017 used a weather based monitoring system and transmitted the real time air temperature solar radiation wind speed and humidity data via a wireless communication standard coelho et al 2020 developed a system for monitoring soil moisture and environmental parameters using the iot data acquisition was carried out employing sensors connected to a micro controller system and the signals were transmitted through a radio frequency module using the lorawantm protocol irrigation schedules developed using weather measurements are widely used however the soil characteristics often used for estimating soil water volume are based on the soil texture and yet soil structure and organic matter content affect available soil moisture 3 3 plant based monitoring irrigation scheduling can be achieved by monitoring the plant water status indices the relationship between crop water stress and soil water deficit makes it possible to estimate irrigation scheduling the sensitivity of the measurement made to determine water deficit in a plant at a particular crop stage influences the efficiency of plant based irrigation scheduling gu et al 2020 jones 2004 classified plant based monitoring into plant water status monitoring which involves direct measurement of leaf xylem or stems water potential and plant physiologic monitoring that involves stomatal conductance thermal sensing sap flow and xylem cavitation measurements 3 3 1 leaf turgor pressure sensors leaf turgor pressure sensors detect leaf water stress by measuring relative changes in leaf turgor pressure zimmermann et al 2013 the magnitude of turgor pressure is dictated by rootwater uptake transpirational water loss and by the celluar osmotic pressure an example of the leaf turgor pressure sensor is the non invasive leaf patch clamp pressure probe also know as the zim probe the zim probe provides real time measurements of even minute changes in turgor pressure within leaves zimmermann 2011 2013 it consists of two stamps that are each equipped with a magnet one stamp also contains a sensitive pressure sensoring element which sends detected pressure changes to the zimtransmitter and telemetric unit the counter stamp contains a screw thread which enables adjustment of the distance between the two magnets as depicted in fig 4 the zim probe has been successfully tested under laboratory greenhouse and field conditions on a variety of herbaceous and woody plant species e g grapevine barley arabidopsis tomato tobacco banana paprika wheat maize beech oak populus olive avocado plum orange grapefruit and eucalyptus 3 3 2 leaf thickness sensors advances in electronic technologies have enabled researchers to develop small leaf thickness sensors afzal et al 2017 seelig et al 2012 developed tiny leaf sensors and evaluated them on a tomato plant solanum lycopersicum and cowpea vigna unguiculata respectively seelig et al 2012 observed that irrigation timing based on leaf thickness measurements improved water use efficiency by 25 45 compared to the preset irrigation scheduling treatments afzal et al 2017 reported that the daily cap variations decreased when soil moisture was below the wilting point and completely ceased below the soil volumetric water content of 11 suggesting that the effect of water stress on cap was observed through its impact on photosynthesis the results suggest that leaf thickness and cap can be used for estimating plant water status these studies suggested leaf thickness variations as a feasible plant based method for monitoring water status 3 3 3 sap flow sensors the development of reliable heat pulse and energy balance thermal sensors for sap flow measurement in the stems of plants has opened up an alternative approach to irrigation scheduling based on measurements of sap flow rates jones 2004 because sap flow rates are expected to be sensitive to water deficits and especially to stomatal closure many workers have tested the use of sap flow measurement for irrigation scheduling and control in a diverse range of crops including grapevine jones 2004 the dynagage sap flow sensors are the latest technology for measuring the sap flow and thus the water consumption of plants ecotechtonic 2016 these energy balance sensors measure the amount of heat carried by the sap which is converted into real time sap flow in grams or kilograms per hour the sensors are non intrusive and not harmful since the plants are heated up 1 c to 5 c typically the principles of heat balance sensors are scientifically proven and references exist for most major crops and many tree species unlike other methods dynagages require no calibration since sap flux is directly determined by the energy balance and rates of heat convection by the sap flow dynamax inc 2007 the need for this new technology is great because it is an affordable and practical way to measure the water use by plants of agricultural economic and ecological importance plants in greenhouses nurseries or in natural environments can be measured with the same ease 3 3 4 xylem cavitation sensors in transpiring plants water in the xylem vessels is under tension this tension is directly proportional to the water deficit to such an extent that the water columns can fracture or cavitate jones 2004 the cavitation events lead to the explosive formation of a bubble initially containing water vapour these cavitation events can be detected acoustically in the audio or ultrasonic frequencies and the resulting embolisms may restrict water flow through the stem substantial evidence though largely circumstantial now indicates that the ultrasonic acoustic emissions aes detected as plants become stressed do indeed indicate cavitation events and that ae rates can be used as an indicator of plant stress 3 3 5 stem diameter variation stem and fruit diameters fluctuate diurnally in response to changes in water content and so suffer from many of the same disadvantages as other water status measures nevertheless the diurnal dynamics of changes in diameter especially of fruits have been used to derive rather more sensitive indicators of irrigation need where the magnitude of daily shrinkage has been used to indicate water status and comparisons of diameters at the same time on succeeding days give a measure of growth rate although changes in growth rate provide a particularly sensitive measure of plant water stress such daily measurements are not particularly useful for the control of high frequency irrigation systems nevertheless several workers have achieved promising results for low frequency irrigation scheduling by the use of maximum daily shrinkage mds new trends in plant based monitoring involve the use of optical sensors to assess the status of plant water stress drought nutrient level and pest and disease infestation optical sensors are broadly classified into contact or non contact sensors whereas contact sensors are physically mounted so that they are in contact with the plant non contact sensors are either proximal handheld fixed or vehicle mounted or remote aerial and satellite based data acquisition adeyemi et al 2017 several researchers including aleotti et al 2018 jia et al 2019 and uddin et al 2017 have generated irrigation maps through monitoring vegetation using unmanned aerial vehicles with high resolution cameras similarly lozoya et al 2019 employed spectral reflectance sensors to estimate the health status of the plant in a controlled environment agriculture experiment the authors found out that the two methods achieved similar spectral results on the health status of the plant which could be integrated with soil moisture sensing for optimal irrigation control the major constraint in the application of plant based sensors for commercial irrigation scheduling is that they do not provide a direct measurement of the quantity of irrigation water to be applied white and raine 2008 it requires using plant based irrigation scheduling conjunctively with soil moisture measurement and the soil water balance model table 1 summarizes the monitoring strategies that have been employed in recent years to schedule irrigation 4 irrigation control strategies for smart irrigation systems for irrigation to be sustainable control strategies that apply irrigation water precisely have to be adopted an irrigation controller is an essential part of the irrigation system and helps to achieve labour savings in addition to applying the required volume of irrigation water for a specified period leading to high efficiency in water energy and fertilizer use boman et al 2018 irrigation control strategies are divided into open loop systems and closed loop systems while open loop systems apply a preset action like in simple irrigation timers closed loop systems receive feedback from sensors make decisions and apply the resulting decisions to the irrigation system fig 4 presents a detailed classification of irrigation control strategies derived from literature studies 4 1 open loop irrigation control in an open loop system the operator decides on the amount of water that will be applied and when the irrigation will take place boman et al 2018 this information is then programmed into the controller and the water is applied according to the desired schedule open loop systems are either time based or volume based as shown in fig 5 abioye et al 2020b open loop systems have a clock that is used to start and stop irrigation events zazueta et al 2008 sudarmaji et al 2019 developed and used time based automatic irrigation systems for both drip and sprinkler irrigation the system was found to apply water according to the set time times similarly montesano et al 2016 compared time based irrigation control with soil moisture based control and reported low water use efficiency with 18 leaching compared to soil moisture based control in a soil less lettuce experiment since there is no soil moisture and weather monitoring in an open loop system sensors are not required this makes the system inexpensive however with constraints of failing to respond to varying soil and environmental conditions 4 2 closed loop irrigation control in closed loop systems a control strategy for irrigation decisions is developed having defined the strategy the control system takes over and makes irrigation scheduling decisions boman et al 2018 sensors help to provide feedback to the controller on which the irrigation decisions are based feedback and control in a closed loop system are done continuously and therefore require data acquired by monitoring devices like soil moisture air temperature solar radiation wind speed humidity and rainfall as well as system parameters like pressure and flow in closed loop control a decision of whether or not to initiate an action is based on a comparison between the current state of the system and the specified desired state boman et al 2018 fig 6 is a schematic presentation of a closed loop control system closed loop control strategies are further subdivided into linear control intelligent control optimal control and other control strategies as depicted in fig 5 4 2 1 linear control linear control in closed loop irrigation is further classified as linear quadratic control and proportional integral derivative pid control proportional integral derivative based irrigation controllers have been widely used in irrigation research and other industrial applications because of their simplicity low cost and extensive control algorithm aguilar et al 2015 the principle of pid controller is to read a sensor then compute the desired actuator output by calculating proportional integral and derivative responses and summing those three components to compute the output national instruments corperation 2020c although pid controllers suffer setbacks when faced with external disturbances and non linear systems it is more efficient because of its control ability on the actual output of a process lacasta et al 2014 implemented a decentralized feedback discrete pid controller integrated with the hydraulic model to achieve a reliable complete simulation tool for predictive purposes the results showed that the pid controllers effectively captured the stochastic phenomena and provided the correct gate movements to obtain the desired water levels likewise arauz et al 2020 designed a pi controller for irrigation canals based on linear matrix inequalities the authors solved an linear matrix inequalities based optimal control problem to obtain sparse feedback that provided the pi tuning the results indicated a 30 improvement in pid tuning and were able to satisfactorily control canal water levels azar et al 2020 designed and manufactured a smart irrigation mobile robot with a soil moisture sensor the authors introduced a simulation analysis of the designed smart irrigation mobile robot by using one degree of freedom 1 dof pid controller the results indicated that the smart irrigation mobile robot produced the desired output parameters nonetheless classical closed loop controllers such as pid find it hard to control multi variable and moving processes with time delays abioye et al 2020a 2020b improving the controller performance requires linking feedback paths or cascading several pid controllers given the non linearity of pids there are inadequate gain selections of the control systems hybrid fuzzy pid is required for optimal control of irrigation systems tuning a pid requires the integration of intelligent algorithms such as hybrid fuzzy pid for optimal control of irrigation systems chao et al 2019 maghfiroh et al 2020 4 2 2 artificial intelligence in closed loop irrigation mccarthy 2004 defined artificial intelligence ai as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines especially intelligent computer programs ai is an evolving technology in the agricultural domain ai based machines and systems have taken today s agricultural production systems to a different level this technology has enhanced crop production and improved real time monitoring harvesting processing and irrigation and marketing talaviya et al 2020 ai has the capability of solving multivariate non linear and time variant complex problems affecting the irrigation system ai algorithms can mimic the human decision making process when applied to a certain problem domain ai has been implemented in irrigation systems for adaptive decision making processes in a form of ann fuzzy logic and expert systems adeyemi et al 2017 artificial neural network ann is a variation of the machine learning model that resembles the neural network of the human brain campos et al 2020 while synapses connect the neurons in a human brain in ann synapses are replaced by weights and biased connections this helps to map the relationship between inputs and outputs campos et al 2020 ann based controllers have learning and adaptation capabilities to the variable dynamics which makes them suitable for irrigation control systems abioye et al 2020b in recent years various studies have explored the applicability of artificial neural networks in irrigation scheduling king et al 2020 used ann modelling to develop and evaluate data driven models for predicting the reference canopy temperatures needed to compute crop water stress index for sugarbeet and wine grape the data driven models developed by the authors were able to estimate reference temperatures enabled automated calculation of the crop water stress index for effective assessment of crop water stress adeyemi et al 2018 modelled soil moisture content using dynamic neural networks and reported significant water savings in an aquacrop simulation of a potato growing season similarly karasekreter et al 2013 registered 20 5 and 23 9 in water and energy savings when an ann for scheduling with soil moisture and physical parameter inputs was implemented in a strawberry orchard the major drawback with ann systems is that large datasets for ann model training are required the accuracy of the ann based irrigation scheduling depends on how representative the data is of the physical system and thus data collection using precision instruments needs to be carefully undertaken fuzzy logic based methodology focuses on decision making by allowing the expression of logical values between true and false and describes the uncertainty and non linearity of real world problems krishnan et al 2020 a fuzzy logic system is made up of a set used to classify input data into membership classes a decision rule is applied to each set which culminates in a human like decision output from the system adeyemi et al 2017 fuzzy logic has been applied in irrigation control and has been recommended by researchers for example mendes et al 2019 developed a fuzzy inference system that decided when to increase or decrease the speed of the central pivot by considering the spatial variability of the field the system was reported to work efficiently fuzzy irrigation controllers can accurately calculate the required amount of irrigation water and address the non linearity associated with the process abioye et al 2020b although fuzzy logic based irrigation controllers have been reported by researchers as efficient the accuracy and performance of the prediction entirely depend on the expertise of the designer about plant dynamics and fuzzy rule formulation another aspect of artificial intelligence in irrigation control is expert systems an expert system is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence ai technologies to simulate the judgment and behavior of a human or an organization that has expert knowledge and experience in a particular field janjanam et al 2021 typically an expert system incorporates a knowledge base containing accumulated experience and an inference or rules engine a set of rules for applying the knowledge base to each particular situation that is described to the program the system s capabilities can be enhanced with additions to the knowledge base or to the set of rules current systems may include machine learning capabilities that allow them to improve their performance based on experience just as humans do an expert controlled irrigation system aims to provide farmers with the expertise on how to determine the exact quantity of crop water needed at the right time weather and growing medium such as humidity temperature and soil types nada et al 2014 several researchers including eid and abdrabbo 2018 hazman 2015 ragab et al 2018 shahzadi et al 2016 have used expert systems for various applications in agriculture the performance of an expert system is largely dependent on the effectiveness of the knowledge acquisition process process errors pose a great threat to expert systems reliability and performance 4 2 3 model predictive control model predictive control mpc has its roots in optimal control the principle of mpc is to use a dynamic model to forecast system behaviour and optimize the forecast to produce the best decision the control move at the current time rawlings et al 2018 model predictive control is a very flexible optimal control framework based on solving constrained optimal control problems online repeatedly mao et al 2018 mpc has been widely used in modern manufacturing industries due to its ability to handle multivariate processes and to address state and input constraints ding et al 2018 lozoya et al 2014 2016 puig et al 2012 in a control problem the goal of the controller is to calculate the input to the plant such that the output follows the desired reference anon 2018 mpc uses a model of the plant to make predictions about future plant output behaviour and an optimizer that ensures that the predicted future plant output tracks the desired reference anon 2018 fig 7 is a schematic presentation of a model predictive control process several researchers such as abioye et al 2021 ding et al 2018 lozoya et al 2014 mccarthy et al 2014 puig et al 2012 saleem et al 2013 and zhang et al 2015 have used model predictive control strategies in irrigation scheduling in controlled environment agriculture mpc has shown better performance in controlling air temperature in greenhouses compared to proportional integral derivative control however the applications in irrigation are still minimal with many studies stopping at the simulation phase and thus the impact on water use efficiency and water productivity is not known more so the mpc methods often used are classical and improved mpc there is a need to evaluate stochastic and hybrid mpc strategies for efficient irrigation scheduling in open field agriculture there are many uncertainties and unpredictable disturbances from the environment exist unlike in a greenhouse environment a summary of irrigation control strategies as used in irrigation are presented in table 2 5 opportunities for improving water use efficiency in open field smart irrigation systems the need to improve water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture has gained serious attention from researchers in recent years this is because agriculture has been reported to be a significant water user sector and yet spatiotemporal water scarcity indices are on the rise leaving little or no water for agricultural production producing more crop per drop requires that soil and weather parameters are precisely monitored and irrigation scheduled to meet the crop water demand commercial automated irrigation systems offered by major irrigation companies are programmed to irrigate at time intervals for predefined periods and it is usually based on the user s empirical knowledge of crop needs soil characteristics and weather factors some farmers use either soil moisture based scheduling or weather based scheduling these methods have been reported to save water consequently closed loop based feedback control strategies have been proposed for smart irrigation as opposed to open loop systems which are characterized by over and under irrigation several studies have developed process dynamics models on which closed loop irrigation schedules are based delgoda et al 2016 ding et al 2018 goodchild et al 2015 lozoya et al 2016 lozoya et al 2019 saleem et al 2013 karasekreter et al 2013 ragab et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 the system dynamics estimated and formulated in these studies are based on the soil water balance model without capturing the dynamic nature of weather soil characteristics and plant water use capturing weather and plant water use dynamics ensures that all disturbances to the system are well incorporated in the algorithm which improves the accuracy therefore there is a need to address this gap by developing a mathematical model that incorporates the dynamics of soil moisture content weather and crop growth parameters obtained from a combination of weather soil and plant sensors in open field experiments a novel irrigation control strategy based on a hybrid model predictive control needs to be evaluated in an open field irrigation environment and the resulting water use efficiency and water productivity determined 6 conclusions in this manuscript a review of smart irrigation monitoring and control strategies for improving water use efficiency in precision agriculture has been presented the review has been developed around monitoring strategies for irrigation scheduling and irrigation control techniques in addition a discussion on opportunities for future research based on research gaps has been established in this regard it is concluded that a combination of weather based soil based and plant based monitoring strategies coupled with a discrete model predictive control strategy needs to be studied in an open field environment unlike controlled environment agriculture research open field agricultural irrigation systems are faced with uncertainties that need to be studied future research will thus focus on developing process dynamics models for irrigation scheduling and establishing the effects of smart monitoring and control strategies on water use efficiency and water productivity

9802,the demand for freshwater resources has increased in recent times and has been exacerbated by escalating global population and increasing drought indices in the world s agricultural zones irrigated agriculture is inevitably a wasteful water user that has deprived other sectors of the scarce resource improving water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture is therefore crucial for sustainable agricultural production to thrive there is potential to improve water use efficiency through smart irrigation systems especially with the advent of wireless communication technologies monitoring systems and advanced control strategies for optimal irrigation scheduling this paper reviews state of the art smart monitoring and irrigation control strategies that have been used in recent years for irrigation scheduling from the literature review closed loop irrigation control strategies are efficient than open loop systems which do not cater for uncertainties it is argued that combining soil based plant and weather based monitoring methods in a modelling environment with model predictive control can significantly improve water use efficiency this review shall help researchers and farmers to choose the best irrigation monitoring and control strategy to improve irrigation scheduling in open field agricultural systems keywords smart irrigation water use efficiency irrigation scheduling model predictive control precision agriculture 1 introduction agriculture is the backbone of most economies in the world as it contributes significantly to the gross domestic product gdp and provides food security world bank 2020d conversely agriculture has been regarded as a significant water user sector as it abstracts 70 of the world s freshwater resources to irrigate 25 of the world s croplands fao 2020a 2017a khokhar 2017 climate change and increasing population do impose additional pressure to resources such as water availability that are vital for agricultural production ungureanu et al 2020 according to the anon 2019 the world population will hit 9 7 billion by 2050 translating into increased demand for nutritious food and water resources the food and agricultural organization fao forecasts a more than 50 increase in irrigated food production by 2050 which will require a 10 increase in water abstracted for agriculture provided water productivity improves fao 2020b the land on which food is cultivated does not expand which means agricultural cropping systems need to utilize the available water and land resources efficiently to feed the future population understanding the mechanisms that can improve water use efficiency and result in significant water savings and higher yield is therefore paramount water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture is the ratio of estimated irrigation water requirements to the actual water withdrawal fao 2020a water use efficiency is dimensionless and can be applied to plant field scheme as well on basin and country scale agronomists however define water use efficiency in terms of crop yield per amount of water used to produce the yield hatfield and dold 2019 sharma et al 2015 ullah et al 2019 and unver et al 2017 water use efficiency has gained significant attention from researchers as water scarcity continues to vary in both space and time across the world due to the effects of climate change hess and knox 2013 competition from other sectors of the economy for the scarce water resource has made agriculturalists irrigation engineers and policy makers revisit the way water is used in agriculture apparently state of the art approaches to water management and systems will need to be adopted to address declining land base and water allocations to meet agricultural production needs precision agricultural technologies are key in ensuring a higher water use efficiency evans and sadler 2008 precision agriculture is at the centre to shape itself to provide solutions to the overarching problems in agriculture yin et al 2021 described precision agriculture as the use of technologies that integrate sensors information systems enhanced machinery and informed management to improve production by accounting for dynamics within sustainable agricultural systems precision agriculture and smart irrigation in particular enables farmers to save precious resources without subjecting plants to moisture deficiency pierce 2010 smart irrigation involves the application of water at the right time in the right amounts and at the right spot in the field singh et al 2019 therefore it requires the use of monitoring and control strategies for optimum irrigation scheduling taking into consideration the variation in soil moisture conditions changing weather patterns and plant physiological conditions conventional irrigation systems apply irrigation water without considering the spatiotemporal variation of soil characteristics and changes in weather variables that affect crop evapotranspiration vories et al 2021 this subsequently leads to spatial variation in the actual depth of irrigation water received by plants applying more than required irrigation water results in fertilizer leaching deep percolation and surface ponding and runoff while inadequate irrigation may lead to plant stress that may result in a reduction in crop yield and quality implementing an optimised irrigation schedule through a smart irrigation system requires sensors to monitor soil plant weather conditions on the other hand irrigation control deals with the allocation of inputs and making necessary adjustments according to the crop response to save irrigation water while mitigating the effects of disturbances and uncertainties abioye et al 2020a zazueta et al 2008 over the past few years several survey articles have been published on improving water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture chai et al 2014 hatfield and dold 2019 howell 2001 taheripour et al 2016 ullah et al 2019 other past reviews have focused on the use of smart technologies like smart sensors internet of things iot wireless sensor networks wsn in agriculture adeyemi et al 2017 hamami and nassereddine 2020 koech and langat 2018 li et al 2020 velmurugan et al 2020 and zinkernagel et al 2020 one of the most recent survey papers in the realm of smart irrigation was performed by abioye et al 2020b the authors highlight the application of monitoring and control strategies in precision irrigation in our opinion the authors give a valuable start to fellow researchers interested in smart irrigation however concerning the application of monitoring and control strategies for water use efficiency improvement to the best of our knowledge there appear to be very limited systematic literature reviews the authors fail to show how monitoring and control strategies water use efficiency in precision agriculture this review further builds upon existing literature by combining both smart strategies used in monitoring crop water use and irrigation control techniques to improve water use efficiency 2 real time irrigation scheduling irrigation scheduling is the decision of when and how much water to apply to the field and thus has a direct effect on water use efficiency broner 2005 and koech and langat 2018 the quantity of water to be applied is estimated using a criterion to determine the irrigation requirement and strategy to prescribe how much to apply efficient application of irrigation water requires an understanding of the dynamics of plant water use which has a relationship with the weather soil characteristics and plant physiology efficient irrigation scheduling applies irrigation water at the right time and in the right quantity to optimize production and offset adverse environmental impacts on the other hand poor irrigation scheduling results in under watering or waterlogging which affects water use efficiency hassan et al 2021 real time irrigation scheduling is pertinent in saving water by applying the quantity required to meet plant needs several irrigation scheduling tools have been developed to help irrigators apply water precisely to crops andales et al 2019 growers who do not use any irrigation scheduling tool often rely on their experience to schedule irrigation anon 2010 recent research has proved that growers who rely on heuristic methods of scheduling like manual time based and volume based irrigation scheduling register significant water losses garcÃ­a et al 2020 an effective real time irrigation scheduling event requires monitoring of the factors that affect plant growth and a control strategy for the delivery of the right amounts of irrigation water 3 monitoring in smart irrigation systems to improve water use efficiency it is pertinent to monitor specific factors that influence crop growth and development monitoring in the perspective of smart irrigation also entails real time data collection on the status of soil plant and weather parameters cropped area through the use of state of the art communication technologies abioye et al 2020b the development of a real time monitoring system involves the integration of sensors with a wireless sensor communication network or iot framework wireless networks are very significant in real time monitoring for smart irrigation since they have sensing processing and transmission capabilities hamami and nassereddine 2020 the wireless sensor network comprises various sensor nodes connected through a wireless connection module hamami and nassereddine 2020 monitoring in smart irrigation can either be soil based weather based or plant based monitoring as depicted in fig 1 3 1 soil moisture monitoring soil moisture monitoring involves measuring either the soil water potential or the soil water content it has been used widely for irrigation scheduling delgoda et al 2016 monitoring the soil moisture in the plant root zone is important as it helps in understanding the moisture dynamics and its relationship with the volume of irrigation water and plant water uptake several options exist for determining soil moisture levels the direct soil moisture measurement gravimetric sampling and indirect methods like eletromagetic property heat conductivity neutron count water potential and electrical resistance with advances in microcomputer and communication technology varieties of soil sensors for example ground aerial and satellite moisture sensors are gaining momentum in the suite of irrigation tools earth observation system 2020a soil moisture sensors have a small footprint on the field with sensors at multiple depths soil moisture dynamics can be captured installing the sensors at different depths increases the accuracy and also helps in understanding the changes in soil water content in response to irrigation and crop water use soulis et al 2015 soil sensors give a wide range of data on the soil s physical chemical and mechanical properties taken as optical radiometric mechanical acoustic electrical electromagnetic pneumatic or electrochemical measurements zinkernagel et al 2020 the measured variables helps in the determination of parameters such as the maximum allowable depletion mad li et al 2020 detailed descriptions of the functionality of soil moisture sensors and their characteristics can be found in pardossi et al 2009 and pardossi and incrocci 2011 and thompson et al 2017 fig 2 presents the most commonly used soil moisture sensors in research and vegetable production determination of spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture content is vital for various applications this has prompted the development of different measurement techniques over the last years soil moisture content is measured as volumetric moisture content vmc soil moisture content sensors infer volumetric moisture content based on changes in the thermal properties or electrical properties of the soil peddinti et al 2020 the electrical based sensors used to measure volumetric moisture content rely on the propagation of electromagnetic waves in the soil these sensors fall into various types i e frequency domain reflectometry fdr time domain reflectometry tdr capacitance and resistance sensors frequency domain reflectometry sensors are capable of determining the bulk dielectric constant by measuring the frequency variations of an electro magnetic pulse propagated into the soil fertinnowa 2020b lozoya et al 2016 used fdr sensors to measure field volumetric soil moisture content the sensor node was implemented with a low cost arduino mega board based on an atmega 328 microcontroller the sensors were placed on crop root level and had a volumetric moisture content range of 0 50 with 0 1 resolution to optimize water use efficiency in vegetables yadav et al 2020 used six 6 capacitance soil moisture based sensors with a data logger at three 3 locations the authors programmed irrigation scheduling using upper field capacity and lower thresholds of soil available water the results revealed an improvement in water use efficiency compared to conventional methods of irrigation scheduling domÃ­nguez niÃ±o et al 2020 reported that using capacitance type soil moisture sensors combined with fao s soil water balance model provided a sound basis for automated irrigation scheduling in orchards the disadvantage associated with soil moisture based irrigation scheduling is that plant water uptake and stress does not only respond to the soil water content but also to atmospheric conditions nutrient availability root zone salinity and pest and disease infestation with variation in soil characteristics accurate irrigation schedules are established if many representative monitoring sites are established rather than using a single point recently researchers are combining remote sensing with ground sensors to solve the problem of heterogeneity ahmad et al 2021 babaeian et al 2019 klemas et al 2014 liao et al 2021 in experimenting with a smart irrigation system in a greenhouse using soil moisture sensors used a logic diagram to describe the irrigation scheduling process as shown in fig 3 3 2 weather based monitoring weather based monitoring involves real time estimation of reference evapotranspiration et using measured weather parameters and thus indicates the water lost by the plants and the soil environment abioye et al 2020b adeyemi et al 2017 the quantity of water lost through evapotranspiration depends on humidity wind speed solar radiation and air temperature the temporal dynamics of evapotranspiration on hourly or daily timescales is appropriate for determining crop water use in smart irrigation systems where soil or plant measurements are not possible weather parameters are used to give an approximate irrigation schedule white and raine 2008 the fao penman monteith equation discussed in allen et al 1998 presents a procedure for calculating hourly or daily evapotranspiration values using standard climatological measurements of air temperature solar radiation humidity and wind speed the daily crop water use can then be estimated using eq 1 1 et c k c et 0 where et c crop evapotranspiration mm day 1 k c crop coefficient et 0 reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 most real time weather based monitoring systems have an automatic weather station with sensors for humidity temperature wind speed rainfall solar radiation and atmospheric pressure adeyemi et al 2017 dataloggers are configured to automatically acquire data at a set interval and the data is then transmitted via a communication system to an online data access portal the data logger manages communication protocols with the remote server using a wsn or iot framework the data is sent to smart irrigation controllers that combine with site specific variables such as soil type to adjust irrigation schedules hydropoint 2017b the factors that affect the performance and choice of a weather monitoring system range from robustness accuracy installation and maintenance requirements measurement suite remote data acquisition season capabilities and power requirements khoa et al 2019 implemented smart water management in farming using an iot platform the authors proposed a novel topology of sensor nodes using affordable and efficient components with a lora lpwan long range low power wide area network technology transmission module the authors reported good performance of the system similarly wasson et al 2017 used a weather based monitoring system and transmitted the real time air temperature solar radiation wind speed and humidity data via a wireless communication standard coelho et al 2020 developed a system for monitoring soil moisture and environmental parameters using the iot data acquisition was carried out employing sensors connected to a micro controller system and the signals were transmitted through a radio frequency module using the lorawantm protocol irrigation schedules developed using weather measurements are widely used however the soil characteristics often used for estimating soil water volume are based on the soil texture and yet soil structure and organic matter content affect available soil moisture 3 3 plant based monitoring irrigation scheduling can be achieved by monitoring the plant water status indices the relationship between crop water stress and soil water deficit makes it possible to estimate irrigation scheduling the sensitivity of the measurement made to determine water deficit in a plant at a particular crop stage influences the efficiency of plant based irrigation scheduling gu et al 2020 jones 2004 classified plant based monitoring into plant water status monitoring which involves direct measurement of leaf xylem or stems water potential and plant physiologic monitoring that involves stomatal conductance thermal sensing sap flow and xylem cavitation measurements 3 3 1 leaf turgor pressure sensors leaf turgor pressure sensors detect leaf water stress by measuring relative changes in leaf turgor pressure zimmermann et al 2013 the magnitude of turgor pressure is dictated by rootwater uptake transpirational water loss and by the celluar osmotic pressure an example of the leaf turgor pressure sensor is the non invasive leaf patch clamp pressure probe also know as the zim probe the zim probe provides real time measurements of even minute changes in turgor pressure within leaves zimmermann 2011 2013 it consists of two stamps that are each equipped with a magnet one stamp also contains a sensitive pressure sensoring element which sends detected pressure changes to the zimtransmitter and telemetric unit the counter stamp contains a screw thread which enables adjustment of the distance between the two magnets as depicted in fig 4 the zim probe has been successfully tested under laboratory greenhouse and field conditions on a variety of herbaceous and woody plant species e g grapevine barley arabidopsis tomato tobacco banana paprika wheat maize beech oak populus olive avocado plum orange grapefruit and eucalyptus 3 3 2 leaf thickness sensors advances in electronic technologies have enabled researchers to develop small leaf thickness sensors afzal et al 2017 seelig et al 2012 developed tiny leaf sensors and evaluated them on a tomato plant solanum lycopersicum and cowpea vigna unguiculata respectively seelig et al 2012 observed that irrigation timing based on leaf thickness measurements improved water use efficiency by 25 45 compared to the preset irrigation scheduling treatments afzal et al 2017 reported that the daily cap variations decreased when soil moisture was below the wilting point and completely ceased below the soil volumetric water content of 11 suggesting that the effect of water stress on cap was observed through its impact on photosynthesis the results suggest that leaf thickness and cap can be used for estimating plant water status these studies suggested leaf thickness variations as a feasible plant based method for monitoring water status 3 3 3 sap flow sensors the development of reliable heat pulse and energy balance thermal sensors for sap flow measurement in the stems of plants has opened up an alternative approach to irrigation scheduling based on measurements of sap flow rates jones 2004 because sap flow rates are expected to be sensitive to water deficits and especially to stomatal closure many workers have tested the use of sap flow measurement for irrigation scheduling and control in a diverse range of crops including grapevine jones 2004 the dynagage sap flow sensors are the latest technology for measuring the sap flow and thus the water consumption of plants ecotechtonic 2016 these energy balance sensors measure the amount of heat carried by the sap which is converted into real time sap flow in grams or kilograms per hour the sensors are non intrusive and not harmful since the plants are heated up 1 c to 5 c typically the principles of heat balance sensors are scientifically proven and references exist for most major crops and many tree species unlike other methods dynagages require no calibration since sap flux is directly determined by the energy balance and rates of heat convection by the sap flow dynamax inc 2007 the need for this new technology is great because it is an affordable and practical way to measure the water use by plants of agricultural economic and ecological importance plants in greenhouses nurseries or in natural environments can be measured with the same ease 3 3 4 xylem cavitation sensors in transpiring plants water in the xylem vessels is under tension this tension is directly proportional to the water deficit to such an extent that the water columns can fracture or cavitate jones 2004 the cavitation events lead to the explosive formation of a bubble initially containing water vapour these cavitation events can be detected acoustically in the audio or ultrasonic frequencies and the resulting embolisms may restrict water flow through the stem substantial evidence though largely circumstantial now indicates that the ultrasonic acoustic emissions aes detected as plants become stressed do indeed indicate cavitation events and that ae rates can be used as an indicator of plant stress 3 3 5 stem diameter variation stem and fruit diameters fluctuate diurnally in response to changes in water content and so suffer from many of the same disadvantages as other water status measures nevertheless the diurnal dynamics of changes in diameter especially of fruits have been used to derive rather more sensitive indicators of irrigation need where the magnitude of daily shrinkage has been used to indicate water status and comparisons of diameters at the same time on succeeding days give a measure of growth rate although changes in growth rate provide a particularly sensitive measure of plant water stress such daily measurements are not particularly useful for the control of high frequency irrigation systems nevertheless several workers have achieved promising results for low frequency irrigation scheduling by the use of maximum daily shrinkage mds new trends in plant based monitoring involve the use of optical sensors to assess the status of plant water stress drought nutrient level and pest and disease infestation optical sensors are broadly classified into contact or non contact sensors whereas contact sensors are physically mounted so that they are in contact with the plant non contact sensors are either proximal handheld fixed or vehicle mounted or remote aerial and satellite based data acquisition adeyemi et al 2017 several researchers including aleotti et al 2018 jia et al 2019 and uddin et al 2017 have generated irrigation maps through monitoring vegetation using unmanned aerial vehicles with high resolution cameras similarly lozoya et al 2019 employed spectral reflectance sensors to estimate the health status of the plant in a controlled environment agriculture experiment the authors found out that the two methods achieved similar spectral results on the health status of the plant which could be integrated with soil moisture sensing for optimal irrigation control the major constraint in the application of plant based sensors for commercial irrigation scheduling is that they do not provide a direct measurement of the quantity of irrigation water to be applied white and raine 2008 it requires using plant based irrigation scheduling conjunctively with soil moisture measurement and the soil water balance model table 1 summarizes the monitoring strategies that have been employed in recent years to schedule irrigation 4 irrigation control strategies for smart irrigation systems for irrigation to be sustainable control strategies that apply irrigation water precisely have to be adopted an irrigation controller is an essential part of the irrigation system and helps to achieve labour savings in addition to applying the required volume of irrigation water for a specified period leading to high efficiency in water energy and fertilizer use boman et al 2018 irrigation control strategies are divided into open loop systems and closed loop systems while open loop systems apply a preset action like in simple irrigation timers closed loop systems receive feedback from sensors make decisions and apply the resulting decisions to the irrigation system fig 4 presents a detailed classification of irrigation control strategies derived from literature studies 4 1 open loop irrigation control in an open loop system the operator decides on the amount of water that will be applied and when the irrigation will take place boman et al 2018 this information is then programmed into the controller and the water is applied according to the desired schedule open loop systems are either time based or volume based as shown in fig 5 abioye et al 2020b open loop systems have a clock that is used to start and stop irrigation events zazueta et al 2008 sudarmaji et al 2019 developed and used time based automatic irrigation systems for both drip and sprinkler irrigation the system was found to apply water according to the set time times similarly montesano et al 2016 compared time based irrigation control with soil moisture based control and reported low water use efficiency with 18 leaching compared to soil moisture based control in a soil less lettuce experiment since there is no soil moisture and weather monitoring in an open loop system sensors are not required this makes the system inexpensive however with constraints of failing to respond to varying soil and environmental conditions 4 2 closed loop irrigation control in closed loop systems a control strategy for irrigation decisions is developed having defined the strategy the control system takes over and makes irrigation scheduling decisions boman et al 2018 sensors help to provide feedback to the controller on which the irrigation decisions are based feedback and control in a closed loop system are done continuously and therefore require data acquired by monitoring devices like soil moisture air temperature solar radiation wind speed humidity and rainfall as well as system parameters like pressure and flow in closed loop control a decision of whether or not to initiate an action is based on a comparison between the current state of the system and the specified desired state boman et al 2018 fig 6 is a schematic presentation of a closed loop control system closed loop control strategies are further subdivided into linear control intelligent control optimal control and other control strategies as depicted in fig 5 4 2 1 linear control linear control in closed loop irrigation is further classified as linear quadratic control and proportional integral derivative pid control proportional integral derivative based irrigation controllers have been widely used in irrigation research and other industrial applications because of their simplicity low cost and extensive control algorithm aguilar et al 2015 the principle of pid controller is to read a sensor then compute the desired actuator output by calculating proportional integral and derivative responses and summing those three components to compute the output national instruments corperation 2020c although pid controllers suffer setbacks when faced with external disturbances and non linear systems it is more efficient because of its control ability on the actual output of a process lacasta et al 2014 implemented a decentralized feedback discrete pid controller integrated with the hydraulic model to achieve a reliable complete simulation tool for predictive purposes the results showed that the pid controllers effectively captured the stochastic phenomena and provided the correct gate movements to obtain the desired water levels likewise arauz et al 2020 designed a pi controller for irrigation canals based on linear matrix inequalities the authors solved an linear matrix inequalities based optimal control problem to obtain sparse feedback that provided the pi tuning the results indicated a 30 improvement in pid tuning and were able to satisfactorily control canal water levels azar et al 2020 designed and manufactured a smart irrigation mobile robot with a soil moisture sensor the authors introduced a simulation analysis of the designed smart irrigation mobile robot by using one degree of freedom 1 dof pid controller the results indicated that the smart irrigation mobile robot produced the desired output parameters nonetheless classical closed loop controllers such as pid find it hard to control multi variable and moving processes with time delays abioye et al 2020a 2020b improving the controller performance requires linking feedback paths or cascading several pid controllers given the non linearity of pids there are inadequate gain selections of the control systems hybrid fuzzy pid is required for optimal control of irrigation systems tuning a pid requires the integration of intelligent algorithms such as hybrid fuzzy pid for optimal control of irrigation systems chao et al 2019 maghfiroh et al 2020 4 2 2 artificial intelligence in closed loop irrigation mccarthy 2004 defined artificial intelligence ai as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines especially intelligent computer programs ai is an evolving technology in the agricultural domain ai based machines and systems have taken today s agricultural production systems to a different level this technology has enhanced crop production and improved real time monitoring harvesting processing and irrigation and marketing talaviya et al 2020 ai has the capability of solving multivariate non linear and time variant complex problems affecting the irrigation system ai algorithms can mimic the human decision making process when applied to a certain problem domain ai has been implemented in irrigation systems for adaptive decision making processes in a form of ann fuzzy logic and expert systems adeyemi et al 2017 artificial neural network ann is a variation of the machine learning model that resembles the neural network of the human brain campos et al 2020 while synapses connect the neurons in a human brain in ann synapses are replaced by weights and biased connections this helps to map the relationship between inputs and outputs campos et al 2020 ann based controllers have learning and adaptation capabilities to the variable dynamics which makes them suitable for irrigation control systems abioye et al 2020b in recent years various studies have explored the applicability of artificial neural networks in irrigation scheduling king et al 2020 used ann modelling to develop and evaluate data driven models for predicting the reference canopy temperatures needed to compute crop water stress index for sugarbeet and wine grape the data driven models developed by the authors were able to estimate reference temperatures enabled automated calculation of the crop water stress index for effective assessment of crop water stress adeyemi et al 2018 modelled soil moisture content using dynamic neural networks and reported significant water savings in an aquacrop simulation of a potato growing season similarly karasekreter et al 2013 registered 20 5 and 23 9 in water and energy savings when an ann for scheduling with soil moisture and physical parameter inputs was implemented in a strawberry orchard the major drawback with ann systems is that large datasets for ann model training are required the accuracy of the ann based irrigation scheduling depends on how representative the data is of the physical system and thus data collection using precision instruments needs to be carefully undertaken fuzzy logic based methodology focuses on decision making by allowing the expression of logical values between true and false and describes the uncertainty and non linearity of real world problems krishnan et al 2020 a fuzzy logic system is made up of a set used to classify input data into membership classes a decision rule is applied to each set which culminates in a human like decision output from the system adeyemi et al 2017 fuzzy logic has been applied in irrigation control and has been recommended by researchers for example mendes et al 2019 developed a fuzzy inference system that decided when to increase or decrease the speed of the central pivot by considering the spatial variability of the field the system was reported to work efficiently fuzzy irrigation controllers can accurately calculate the required amount of irrigation water and address the non linearity associated with the process abioye et al 2020b although fuzzy logic based irrigation controllers have been reported by researchers as efficient the accuracy and performance of the prediction entirely depend on the expertise of the designer about plant dynamics and fuzzy rule formulation another aspect of artificial intelligence in irrigation control is expert systems an expert system is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence ai technologies to simulate the judgment and behavior of a human or an organization that has expert knowledge and experience in a particular field janjanam et al 2021 typically an expert system incorporates a knowledge base containing accumulated experience and an inference or rules engine a set of rules for applying the knowledge base to each particular situation that is described to the program the system s capabilities can be enhanced with additions to the knowledge base or to the set of rules current systems may include machine learning capabilities that allow them to improve their performance based on experience just as humans do an expert controlled irrigation system aims to provide farmers with the expertise on how to determine the exact quantity of crop water needed at the right time weather and growing medium such as humidity temperature and soil types nada et al 2014 several researchers including eid and abdrabbo 2018 hazman 2015 ragab et al 2018 shahzadi et al 2016 have used expert systems for various applications in agriculture the performance of an expert system is largely dependent on the effectiveness of the knowledge acquisition process process errors pose a great threat to expert systems reliability and performance 4 2 3 model predictive control model predictive control mpc has its roots in optimal control the principle of mpc is to use a dynamic model to forecast system behaviour and optimize the forecast to produce the best decision the control move at the current time rawlings et al 2018 model predictive control is a very flexible optimal control framework based on solving constrained optimal control problems online repeatedly mao et al 2018 mpc has been widely used in modern manufacturing industries due to its ability to handle multivariate processes and to address state and input constraints ding et al 2018 lozoya et al 2014 2016 puig et al 2012 in a control problem the goal of the controller is to calculate the input to the plant such that the output follows the desired reference anon 2018 mpc uses a model of the plant to make predictions about future plant output behaviour and an optimizer that ensures that the predicted future plant output tracks the desired reference anon 2018 fig 7 is a schematic presentation of a model predictive control process several researchers such as abioye et al 2021 ding et al 2018 lozoya et al 2014 mccarthy et al 2014 puig et al 2012 saleem et al 2013 and zhang et al 2015 have used model predictive control strategies in irrigation scheduling in controlled environment agriculture mpc has shown better performance in controlling air temperature in greenhouses compared to proportional integral derivative control however the applications in irrigation are still minimal with many studies stopping at the simulation phase and thus the impact on water use efficiency and water productivity is not known more so the mpc methods often used are classical and improved mpc there is a need to evaluate stochastic and hybrid mpc strategies for efficient irrigation scheduling in open field agriculture there are many uncertainties and unpredictable disturbances from the environment exist unlike in a greenhouse environment a summary of irrigation control strategies as used in irrigation are presented in table 2 5 opportunities for improving water use efficiency in open field smart irrigation systems the need to improve water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture has gained serious attention from researchers in recent years this is because agriculture has been reported to be a significant water user sector and yet spatiotemporal water scarcity indices are on the rise leaving little or no water for agricultural production producing more crop per drop requires that soil and weather parameters are precisely monitored and irrigation scheduled to meet the crop water demand commercial automated irrigation systems offered by major irrigation companies are programmed to irrigate at time intervals for predefined periods and it is usually based on the user s empirical knowledge of crop needs soil characteristics and weather factors some farmers use either soil moisture based scheduling or weather based scheduling these methods have been reported to save water consequently closed loop based feedback control strategies have been proposed for smart irrigation as opposed to open loop systems which are characterized by over and under irrigation several studies have developed process dynamics models on which closed loop irrigation schedules are based delgoda et al 2016 ding et al 2018 goodchild et al 2015 lozoya et al 2016 lozoya et al 2019 saleem et al 2013 karasekreter et al 2013 ragab et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 the system dynamics estimated and formulated in these studies are based on the soil water balance model without capturing the dynamic nature of weather soil characteristics and plant water use capturing weather and plant water use dynamics ensures that all disturbances to the system are well incorporated in the algorithm which improves the accuracy therefore there is a need to address this gap by developing a mathematical model that incorporates the dynamics of soil moisture content weather and crop growth parameters obtained from a combination of weather soil and plant sensors in open field experiments a novel irrigation control strategy based on a hybrid model predictive control needs to be evaluated in an open field irrigation environment and the resulting water use efficiency and water productivity determined 6 conclusions in this manuscript a review of smart irrigation monitoring and control strategies for improving water use efficiency in precision agriculture has been presented the review has been developed around monitoring strategies for irrigation scheduling and irrigation control techniques in addition a discussion on opportunities for future research based on research gaps has been established in this regard it is concluded that a combination of weather based soil based and plant based monitoring strategies coupled with a discrete model predictive control strategy needs to be studied in an open field environment unlike controlled environment agriculture research open field agricultural irrigation systems are faced with uncertainties that need to be studied future research will thus focus on developing process dynamics models for irrigation scheduling and establishing the effects of smart monitoring and control strategies on water use efficiency and water productivity

9803,production and consumption of greenhouse gases ghgs from agricultural soil largely depend on soil temperature and moisture previous studies regarding the relationships between soil temperature and moisture and ghg emissions mainly considered the upper soil depth and lacked information on the deeper soil depth here we for the first time explored the relationships between hydrothermal conditions at the soil surface to a depth of 100 cm and ghg emissions in a typical winter wheat summer maize cropping system and then evaluated yield crop water productivity wp global warming potential gwp and ghg intensity ghgi under four irrigation schedules w1 pre sowing irrigation w2 pre sowing jointing irrigation w3 pre sowing anthesis irrigation w4 pre sowing jointing anthesis irrigation regardless of the irrigation schedule the soil acted as a source of ghgs for the wheat maize system small differences in irrigation related soil temperature were detected while volumetric soil water content vswc in the different soil depths varied greatly soil temperature and vswc in the 0 100 cm and 0 50 cm soil depths of the wheat maize system were positively correlated with co2 and n2o fluxes soil temperature in the 0 70 cm soil depth positively affected ch4 flux whereas positive and negative correlations were observed between vswc in the 0 40 cm and 50 90 cm soil depths and ch4 flux respectively an improper irrigation period under the w3 treatment lowered crop yield and excessive irrigation under the w4 treatment caused increased water consumption and ghg emissions the w2 treatment improved yield by 5 6 6 2 and 2 2 3 1 increased wp by 5 0 8 1 and 12 8 13 1 decreased gwp by 2 8 3 1 and 6 0 6 6 and reduced ghgi by 8 6 9 4 and 9 0 9 2 compared to the w3 and w4 treatments respectively this study highlights the importance of the effect of the hydrothermal conditions in different soil depths on ghg emissions and an adequate irrigation schedule for improving yield saving water and mitigating ghgs keywords greenhouse gas irrigation strategy moisture temperature yield 1 introduction global warming caused by excessive greenhouse gas ghg emissions is a serious problem that has aroused unprecedented attention stocker et al 2013 agricultural soil is considered to be the main contributor to ghg emissions such as carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o tellez rio et al 2017 it is estimated that about 25 of total ghg emissions originate from agricultural soil burney et al 2010 as the food demand associated with global population growth continues to increase reducing ghg emissions from agricultural soils is a huge challenge skinner et al 2019 although agriculture has released large amounts of ghgs into the atmosphere the global agricultural technology mitigation potential will be 5 5 6 0 pg c yr 1 by 2030 smith et al 2008 increased ghg emissions associated with irrigation have accelerated the global warming effect of agriculture mcgill et al 2018 tian et al 2021 of which global co2 emissions from agricultural irrigation are 36 7 54 2 mt zou et al 2015 in this case finding reasonable irrigation management may be a matter of interest to mitigate ghg emissions and ensure food security as one of the three main food producing regions in china the north china plain ncp accounts for more than half of winter wheat production and one third of summer maize production in china liang et al 2011 however in the ncp winter wheat is usually irrigated three to five times to meet water demand and summer maize is irrigated once after planting sun et al 2011 frequent irrigation particularly of winter wheat has resulted in the over exploitation of groundwater feng et al 2018 substantial agricultural irrigation leads to serious soil secondary salinization which is the main problem with irrigation water quality javadi et al 2019 shi et al 2020 saline sodic soils usually present a poor soil structure related to a reduced soil infiltration rate hydraulic conductivity and fertility shaygan et al 2017 the movement of salts proceeds with the flow of water in the soil resulting in a soil water deficit or inefficiency yang et al 2019 the winter wheat season is both drier and cooler than the summer maize season under the saline sodic land as well as dry and cool weather conditions soil water resources potentially threaten the growth and productivity of winter wheat which requires proper irrigation to avoid a water shortage and aggravate soil salinization however applying irrigation during the crop growing season promotes methanogen and denitrification processes and reduces soil organic carbon contents resulting in higher risks of co2 ch4 and n2o emissions d acunha and johnsona 2019 wiesmeier et al 2019 blind irrigation not only causes the waste of water resource but also leads to environmental pollution nevertheless irrigation during the critical period helps to absorb more water from the soil and increase crop yield while alleviating ghg emissions cheng et al 2020 reported that intermittent irrigation after midseason drainage reduced ghg emissions without affecting rice yield xu et al 2018 discovered that irrigation at the jointing stage increased water utilization and dry matter accumulation of winter wheat based on seven different irrigation regimes therefore determining reasonable irrigation schedules may be a promising option to maintain agricultural production save water resource and reduce ghg emissions ghg emissions are the result of complicated production consumption and transportation in agricultural soil livesley et al 2011 and are influenced by soil conditions and management measures linquist et al 2015 mcgill et al 2018 irrigation related variations in soil temperature and water content determine whether soil acts as a ghg source or sink saurich et al 2019 low soil temperature limits the soil nitrogen cycle and the activities of methanogenic archaea and methanotrophs thus reducing n2o and ch4 emissions bai et al 2013 luan et al 2019 irrigation induced high soil water content promotes respiration and organic matter decomposition in the rhizosphere and drives soil nitrification and denitrification processes which emit more co2 and n2o raich and schlesinger 1992 ye et al 2020 however increased soil water content inhibits methanotroph activity and oxygen diffusion thereby suppressing ch4 uptake ran et al 2017 a positive relationship has been observed between soil temperature and moisture and ghg emissions previous studies have mainly considered the effect of temperature and moisture in the upper soil depths e g 0 5 0 10 and 0 20 cm on ghg emissions for example kumar et al 2016 investigated the relationship between soil temperature in the 0 10 cm soil depth and ghg emissions under different soil water potentials wei et al 2018 reported that co2 and n2o fluxes were positively and exponentially correlated to soil water content in the top 0 24 cm soil depth under two watering treatments zhong and xiong 2021b analyzed the impacts of soil temperature in the 0 5 cm soil depth and soil water filled pore space in the 0 20 cm soil depth on co2 emissions based on different irrigation amounts in particular the relationship between the hydrothermal conditions in deeper soil depths and ghg emissions is unclear given that the source sink function of ghgs may be affected by soil temperature and moisture in different soil depths this study explored the associations between hydrothermal conditions from the soil surface to a depth of 100 cm and ghg emissions in a winter wheat summer maize cropping system and then analyzed crop productivity and the environmental risks under different irrigation schedules the main objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the temporal variation and vertical distribution of soil hydrothermal conditions related to irrigation 2 determine the annual variations in co2 ch4 and n2o fluxes 3 evaluate the relationships between soil hydrothermal conditions in the 0 100 cm soil depth and ghg fluxes and 4 compare the discrepancies in crop yield water productivity and ghg emissions between different irrigation schedules the results will provide a theoretical basis for understanding the effects of soil hydrothermal conditions in different soil depths on the production and consumption of ghgs the findings will also be of great significance to optimize the irrigation strategy to save water improve yield and mitigate ghg emissions 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment the field trial was conducted at the wuqiao experimental station 116 44 e 37 63 n china agricultural university ncp from 2018 to 2020 fig 1 the typical winter wheat summer maize cropping system is usually practiced in this region winter wheat usually grows from mid october to early june and summer maize is planted after harvesting winter wheat and grows from mid june to early october the average daily air temperature during the winter wheat season was 8 1 c in 2018 2019 and 8 9 c in 2019 2020 the total rainfall was 79 2 mm during 23 rainy days and 153 6 mm during 33 rainy days in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively and the rainfall was mostly concentrated in may fig 2 the average daily air temperature during the summer maize season was 25 7 c in 2019 and 25 1 c in 2020 the total rainfall was 439 2 mm during 24 rainy days and 240 5 mm during 28 rainy days in 2019 and 2020 respectively and the rainfall was mostly concentrated in july and august fig 2 the soil at a depth of 0 20 cm at the experimental site is a silty loam texture 11 clay 70 silt and 19 sand which has an organic matter content of 14 7 g kg 1 alkaline hydrolyzable n content of 64 2 mg kg 1 available p content of 14 8 mg kg 1 available k content of 123 5 mg kg 1 and ph of 7 4 the initial available water content hydraulic conductivity and soil infiltration rate in the 0 20 cm soil depth were 14 9 2 3 cm h 1 and 12 6 cm h 1 respectively a split block design was used with three replicates each plot had an area of 55 m2 5 11 m pre sowing irrigation is widely used to promote seed emergence and ensure the normal growth of seedlings li et al 2005 the main irrigation regimes in this area to increase water productivity and maintain the winter wheat yield involved irrigating at the jointing and anthesis stages li and zhou 2000 to explore the optimal irrigation schedule to balance agricultural production and environmental protection the treatments consisted of four irrigation schedules w1 pre sowing irrigation w2 pre sowing jointing irrigation w3 pre sowing anthesis irrigation and w4 pre sowing jointing anthesis irrigation the four different irrigation treatments were adapted for winter wheat all plots were irrigated once after planting summer maize and there was no additional irrigation before harvesting the summer maize the irrigation amount was 75 mm each time which was recorded by water meters with an accuracy of 0 1 l for each irrigation event therefore this study investigated the direct residual and annual impacts of different irrigation schedules from the winter wheat season on winter wheat summer maize and the wheat maize system respectively the sowing harvest and irrigation dates of the winter wheat and summer maize are listed in table s1 all summer maize straw was crushed with a rotary tiller after harvesting and returned to the field then the jimai 22 winter wheat variety was seeded at a seeding rate of 300 kg ha 1 after rotary tillage the winter wheat straw was left on the soil surface with about 20 cm of stubble after harvesting the winter wheat and the zhengdan 958 summer maize variety was planted at a density of 75 000 plants ha 1 under no tillage the amounts of fertilizer applied to the winter wheat were the same as those applied to summer maize namely all treatments received 225 kg ha 1 138 kg ha 1 and 112 kg ha 1 n p and k fertilizers respectively which were applied using urea 46 n diammonium phosphate 18 n and 46 p and potassium sulfate 50 k given that farmers tend to obtain high benefits at low inputs all fertilizers are applied as basal fertilizer which is the fertilization method commonly used by local farmers however topdressing is both time consuming and laborious therefore all fertilizers were applied at pre sowing to winter wheat and at the time of planting of the summer maize respectively 2 2 field measurements 2 2 1 daily soil temperature and volumetric water content soil temperature c and volumetric soil water content vswc were monitored continuously in real time using the crop soil monitor beijing dongfang runze ecological technology co ltd beijing china fig 1 soil temperature and vswc were measured in the 0 100 cm soil depth with a 10 cm interval by inserting a probe into the ground vertically insentek s high definition frequency domain reflectometry fdr accuracy of 4 sensor is used to track changes in soil temperature and vswc with high sensitivity temperature measurement range is from 20 60 c with an accuracy of 0 5 c and vswc measurement range is from dry to saturated soil with an accuracy of 4 the machine learning and kalman filter are used to better understand the data and thereby there is no primary calibration the data capture interval can be configured from 5 min to 4 h with a 32 bit arm cpu insentek 2020 the monitor was placed in each plot after sowing the winter wheat and the monitor was not removed until the summer maize was harvested the monitor was fully charged before it was placed in the field and a solar panel lithium iron phosphate battery was applied to provide electricity during monitoring the average field water capacity and wilting point in the 0 100 cm soil profile were 40 7 and 11 3 respectively in this study capture interval was set to 1 h so soil temperature and vswc were recorded at a 1 h interval between 1 00 and 24 00 every day because gas samples were collected between 9 00 and 11 00 am soil temperature and vswc recorded by the monitor at 10 00 am were extracted from the ecodata module to match the time of gas collection then we used extracted the soil temperature and vswc to analyze dynamic changes in the hydrothermal conditions of the 0 100 cm soil depth and examined the relationships between hydrothermal variations in different soil depths and ghg emissions 2 2 2 crop water productivity in this study we only assessed crop water productivity wp throughout the crop growing season and did not consider wp at different growth stages thus soil water content was measured at the pre sowing and maturity stages respectively summer maize and winter wheat roots can reach up to depth of 120 and 200 cm respectively zhao et al 2014 zhou et al 2008 to fully analyze the ability of the root systems to absorb soil water content soil samples were obtained from the 0 200 cm soil depth with a 20 cm interval using a soil corer sun et al 2019 wang et al 2018 soil gravimetric water content under each soil depth was measured to a constant weight at 105 c for 48 h using an oven drying method soil volumetric water content was determined by the bulk density and gravimetric water content the difference in stored soil water under the soil depths between the pre sowing and maturity stages was used to determine the change in soil profile water the wp kg m 3 was calculated using the following equation fernÃ¡ndez et al 2020 wp gy p i Î´w r d where gy kg ha 1 is crop yield p mm is precipitation throughout the growing season i mm is the irrigation amount Î´w mm is the change in soil water storage 0 200 cm between pre sowing and maturity r mm is surface runoff and d mm is drainage from the root zone below the 200 cm soil profile no surface runoff occurred because of the presence of beds around each plot because irrigation i e at the pre sowing jointing and anthesis stages at the site was only used to replace soil water content in the root zone drainage was assumed to be negligible ali et al 2007 likewise surface runoff and drainage can also be ignored in the ncp including at this experimental site gao et al 2017 wang et al 2021a 2 2 3 greenhouse gas sampling ghg fluxes were measured using the closed chamber technique and gas chromatography the chambers 0 2 0 2 0 3 m were placed at a depth of about 3 cm in the soil in each plot during the growing season the pedestal had a 3 cm deep groove that was filled with water to ensure that the internal changes during sampling were not affected by the external environment gas samples from surface air were taken with a 50 ml gas tight plastic syringe attached to a three way stopcock at 10 min intervals i e 0 10 20 and 30 min between 9 00 and 11 00 am the temperature at a soil depth of 0 5 cm was recorded with a geothermometer while gas samples were being collected gas samples were generally collected once every ten days however gas samples were collected once more the day after heavy rainfall and once every other day three times after irrigation the concentrations of co2 ch4 and n2o in the samples were measured by gas chromatography agilent 7890 a agilent technologies santa clara ca usa equipped with a flame ionization detector for measuring co2 and ch4 at 200 c and an electron capture detector for measuring n2o at 330 c the column temperature was set to 55 c the equation for calculating ghg fluxes f was zhong et al 2021a f Î´c Î´t h Ï 273 273 t where Î´c Î´t mg m 3 is the change rate of gas concentration per unit time h m is the height of chamber Ï mg cm 3 is the gas density in standard state and t c is the temperature of chamber cumulative ghg emissions were calculated by linear interpolation of the daily fluxes between successive sampling dates singh et al 1999 the sum of cumulative co2 ch4 and n2o emissions were used to estimate global warming potential gwp where the conversion coefficients of ch4 and n2o to co2 equivalents are 28 and 265 for a 100 year horizon respectively ipcc et al 2014 the ghgi was calculated by dividing the gwp by the corresponding crop yield shang et al 2011 2 3 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were conducted using spss 25 0 software ibm corp armonk ny usa before the statistical tests assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity of the residuals were tested using the shapiro wilk and levene tests respectively one way analysis of variance was applied to test the effects of the irrigation schedule on cumulative ghg emissions crop yield wp gwp and ghgi the relationships between soil temperature and vswc in the 0 100 cm soil depth and ghg fluxes were analyzed by pearson s correlation analysis significant differences between various treatments were identified using the least significant difference test at the p 0 05 level the map figure was produced using arcgis 10 2 software esri redlands ca usa and the other figures were created with origin 2018 software originlab software inc northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 soil temperature and volumetric soil water content dynamics soil temperature varied with air temperature in the wheat maize system across the two years fig s1 soil temperature during the winter wheat and summer maize seasons showed a slightly increasing and decreasing trend with soil depth respectively whereas there was almost no change in soil temperature in the wheat maize system fig s2 the average soil temperature range in the 0 100 cm soil depth under the w1 w2 w3 and w4 treatments was 7 5 12 4 mean 9 9 7 4 11 0 9 3 8 3 11 2 9 8 and 7 4 11 3 9 6 for the winter wheat season 22 1 25 5 24 1 21 3 24 8 23 3 21 1 26 2 23 8 and 21 2 25 1 23 5 for the summer maize season and 13 1 15 8 15 5 13 0 14 5 13 8 13 2 15 5 14 2 and 13 0 15 1 14 1 for the wheat maize system from 2018 to 2020 respectively fig s2 soil temperature in the 0 100 cm soil depth had similar vertical distribution patterns under each treatment fig s3 although the irrigation schedules were different between the treatments irrigation events at the jointing and anthesis stages did not cause significant soil temperature differences in the same soil depth vswc fluctuations among all treatments tended to be steady with soil depth fig 3 for example vswc in the 0 30 cm soil depth fluctuated widely whereas the range of vswc variation in the 30 100 cm soil depth was obviously small vswc showed a downward trend with soil depth in the 10 50 cm soil depth and then an upward trend in the 50 100 cm soil depth of which vswc in the 0 10 cm soil depth was the lowest fig 4 the average vswc ranges in the 0 100 cm soil depth under the w1 w2 w3 and w4 treatments were 14 5 32 5 mean 23 7 18 4 34 3 26 0 16 6 31 9 23 4 and 16 9 34 5 24 0 for the winter wheat season 15 7 35 4 27 7 19 4 34 9 28 4 19 0 35 5 27 4 and 17 3 35 2 27 3 for the summer maize season and 14 9 31 8 24 9 19 5 33 8 26 8 17 4 31 1 24 6 and 17 1 34 7 25 1 for the wheat maize system from 2018 to 2020 respectively fig 4 vswc under each treatment presented different vertical distributions during the winter wheat season while similar distribution features were found for the summer maize season fig 5 lower vswc under the w1 treatment during the winter wheat season increased to a depth of about 70 cm from the jointing to the harvest stage due to the lack of additional irrigation after sowing following the jointing and anthesis irrigation events vswc in all soil depths under the w2 and w4 treatments increased whereas vswc in the 0 40 cm soil depth increased only under the w3 treatment vswc in the 10 100 cm soil depth during the summer maize season was always higher under each treatment due to frequent rainfall events however lower vswc occasionally occurred in the 0 10 cm soil depth 3 2 greenhouse gas emissions co2 flux trended downward and then upward during the winter wheat season but showed a downward tendency with the fluctuation during the summer maize season fig 6 a b co2 flux reached a peak after sowing winter wheat and summer maize and the irrigation events at the jointing and anthesis stages cumulative co2 emissions were affected by the year and irrigation table 1 tables s2 s3 the w4 treatment generally had the highest cumulative co2 emissions followed by the w3 w2 and w1 treatments for the winter wheat and wheat maize system cumulative co2 emissions under the w3 treatment increased by 5 4 5 8 and 3 0 3 1 compared with the w2 treatment in 2018 2020 respectively cumulative co2 emissions in the w4 treatment were 8 4 11 1 and 6 1 6 5 higher than those in the w2 treatment respectively however no significant difference in cumulative co2 emissions of summer maize was observed between various treatments across the two years ch4 flux presented the characteristics of absorption and exclusion but the soil acted as a ch4 sink figs 6 c 6 d ch4 flux gradually decreased from the highest value within one week after sowing winter wheat and summer maize ch4 flux peaks appeared and showed an exclusion characteristic after irrigation at the jointing and anthesis stages no clear pattern of ch4 flux was observed during the rest of the time cumulative ch4 emissions were mainly affected by the year irrigation and their interaction table 1 tables s2 s3 cumulative ch4 uptake generally followed the order w1 w2 w3 w4 for winter wheat and the wheat maize system whereas an obvious pattern was not found for summer maize over two growing seasons the w3 treatment resulted in 9 4 12 7 and 9 2 10 5 higher cumulative ch4 emissions than the w2 treatment for winter wheat and the wheat maize system respectively cumulative ch4 emissions were 22 6 24 4 and 18 6 24 8 higher under the w4 treatment than under the w2 treatment respectively in general n2o flux was low and steady in the wheat maize system with occasional peak events figs 6 e 6 f n2o flux peaks occurred after sowing the winter wheat and summer maize n2o flux also reached emission peaks due to irrigation at the jointing and anthesis stages and after heavy rainfall the n2o flux during the summer maize season was greater than that during the winter wheat season there were significant effects of year irrigation and their interaction on cumulative n2o emissions table 1 tables s2 s3 cumulative n2o emissions increased as the total irrigation amount was increased in 2018 2020 cumulative n2o emissions of winter wheat and the wheat maize system under the w4 treatment increased by 0 8 1 3 and 3 0 11 2 compared to the w2 treatment respectively cumulative n2o emissions of the w2 treatment were 3 5 4 3 higher than those of the w3 treatment during the winter wheat season whereas no significant difference was observed between the w2 and w3 treatments in the wheat maize system although a significant difference in cumulative summer maize n2o emissions was observed among all treatments no clear pattern was detected 3 3 relationships between greenhouse gas emissions and soil hydrothermal conditions based on pearson s correlation analysis the association between soil temperature in the 0 100 cm soil depth and ghg emissions was investigated fig 7 a soil temperature in the 0 100 cm soil depth was positively correlated with co2 flux except for the summer maize 80 100 cm soil depth soil temperature in the 70 100 cm soil depth was negatively correlated with ch4 flux of winter wheat and soil temperature in the 0 70 cm soil depth and ch4 flux of summer maize and the wheat maize system were positively correlated soil temperature in the 0 100 cm soil depth was positively correlated with n2o flux of winter wheat and the wheat maize system except in the winter wheat 0 30 cm soil depth similarly the effect of vswc in the 0 100 cm soil depth on ghg emissions was analyzed fig 7 b vswc in the 0 50 cm soil depth was positively correlated with co2 and n2o fluxes in contrast a negative correlation was detected between vswc in the 30 90 cm soil depth and the ch4 flux of winter wheat vswc in the 0 40 cm soil depth was positively correlated with the ch4 flux of summer maize vswc in the 0 40 cm soil depth of the wheat maize system was positively correlated with ch4 flux whereas vswc in the 50 90 cm soil depth was negatively correlated with ch4 flux 3 4 yield crop water productivity global warming potential and greenhouse gas intensity the order of yield under the different irrigation schedules was w2 w4 w3 w1 for winter wheat and the wheat maize system while the yield of summer maize was not affected by the irrigation treatments table 1 tables s2 s3 in 2018 2020 the w2 treatment resulted in 13 2 16 5 and 3 3 7 2 greater yield for winter wheat compared to the w3 and w4 treatments respectively similarly the yield of the wheat maize system increased by 5 6 6 2 and 2 2 3 1 under the w2 treatment compared to the w3 and w4 treatments respectively wp was affected by the year and the irrigation schedule table 1 tables s2 s3 wp in winter wheat and the wheat maize system generally presented a decreasing trend with the increase in the total amount of irrigation however the difference in wp of summer maize between all treatments was relatively small the w2 treatment increased wp by 8 7 9 6 for winter wheat and 5 0 8 1 for the wheat maize system compared with the w3 treatment during the two growing seasons wp in winter wheat and the wheat maize system was 14 9 23 4 and 12 8 13 1 higher under the w2 treatment than under the w4 treatment respectively lower gwp and ghgi were observed for winter wheat under the w2 treatment from 2018 to 2020 table s2 as an illustration the gwp and ghgi of the w2 treatment were 5 2 5 6 and 19 5 22 6 lower than those of the w3 treatment respectively the w2 treatment decreased gwp and ghgi by 8 3 10 9 and 11 9 18 9 compared to the w4 treatment respectively the w2 treatment of summer maize obtained the lowest gwp and ghgi across both years whereas relatively small differences were observed between all treatments table s3 in the wheat maize system the w2 treatment also resulted in lower gwp and ghgi table 1 in 2018 2020 the gwp and ghgi under the w2 treatment were 2 8 3 1 and 8 6 9 4 lower than those under the w3 treatment respectively the gwp and ghgi were 6 0 6 6 and 9 0 9 2 lower under the w2 treatment than under the w4 treatment respectively 4 discussion 4 1 variations in greenhouse gas emissions co2 flux varied seasonally in the wheat maize system co2 flux peaks were observed after sowing winter wheat and summer maize figs 6 a 6 b which was in line with the findings of trost et al 2016 this flux occurred because high soil organic carbon availability caused by returning the straw to the field and applying fertilizers during the early sowing stage increased co2 emissions bhattacharyya et al 2018 musafiri et al 2020 tilling the soil during the winter wheat season could break down soil aggregates and further released more protected soil carbon thus inducing more co2 sainju et al 2010 the lower temperature in the winter led to a low and steady co2 flux from december to march and then the co2 flux presented an upward trend from march to june due to increased temperature and rainfall after reviving stage liu et al 2016 the frequent rainfall and elevated temperatures from july to august increased co2 emissions during the summer maize season and then co2 emissions decreased gradually owing to the decrease of temperature from august to october figs 6 a 6 b consistent with the findings of forte et al 2017 the co2 emission peaks occurred following jointing and anthesis irrigation events figs 6 a 6 b because irrigation increased soil respiration which led to more co2 emissions ali et al 2021 increasing the amount of irrigation promotes co2 emissions hou et al 2019 thereby resulting in high cumulative co2 emissions table 1 tables s2 s3 the w4 treatment had the highest cumulative co2 emissions during the jointing and anthesis irrigation events although the same irrigation amount was used in the w2 and w3 treatments the w3 treatment realized higher cumulative co2 emissions the combination of irrigation at the anthesis stage and rainfall in may could have resulted in higher soil water content during the late growth stage in the w3 treatment thus releasing more co2 regardless of the irrigation schedule the soil acted as a ch4 sink in the wheat maize system figs 6 c 6 d similar to the findings of mateo marin et al 2020 the lack of a groundwater table in the root zone and the aerobic conditions promote the soil to act as a ch4 sink huÃ©rfano et al 2015 however ch4 emission peaks were detected after irrigation during the jointing and anthesis stages figs 6 c 6 d comparable to the results of meng et al 2020 ch4 oxidation was restricted by reduced oxygen availability and soil air permeability under high soil moisture conditions chen et al 2017 cumulative ch4 uptake exhibited a decreasing tendency with an increase in the total irrigation amount table 1 tables s2 s3 applying irrigation resulted in a shortage of oxygen and further formed an anaerobic environment which was helpful for methanogen activity li et al 2020a wang et al 2016 however lower cumulative ch4 uptake was observed under the w3 treatment than the w2 treatment the w3 treatment was not irrigated before the anthesis stage thereby resulting in long term soil drought the dry soil was suddenly wet after the anthesis irrigation event and soil water content increased rapidly which may have greatly limited absorption of ch4 xu et al 2020 n2o is a byproduct of nitrification and denitrification luo et al 2013 in this study n2o flux peaks appeared following fertilization irrigation and heavy rainfall fig 6 e f consistent with previous results barton et al 2013 jahangir et al 2021 yao et al 2021 use of the fertilizer enriched soil inorganic nitrogen pool and induced nitrification oxidation and nitrifier denitrification thereby causing more nitrogen to be transformed into n2o bhuiyan et al 2021 laville et al 2011 the increase in soil moisture caused by heavy rainfall and irrigation regulated the supply of oxygen to soil microorganisms which promoted nitrogen conversion via denitrification and further produced more n2o dobbie and smith 2010 silva et al 2008 higher cumulative n2o emissions were detected as a result of the increase in total irrigation amount table 1 tables s2 s3 as the n2o flux peak after irrigation at the anthesis stage was lower than that after irrigation at the jointing stage lower cumulative n2o emissions were observed under the w3 treatment than under the w2 treatment anthesis irrigation under the w3 treatment coincided with the high amounts of rainfall in may which may have partially compensated for the soil water deficit also the soil inorganic nitrogen pool was exhausted during the late growth stage therefore the probable reason for the lower cumulative n2o emissions was a limitation of available nitrogen rather than a water shortage jabro et al 2008 rochette et al 2008 4 2 effect of soil hydrothermal conditions on greenhouse gas emissions in this study the average soil temperature of the different soil depths in all treatments was 9 3 9 9 and 23 3 24 1 for winter wheat and summer maize respectively figs s1 s2 indicating relatively small differences in soil temperature between irrigation treatments zhong and xiong 2021b however the average vswc under the w2 treatment was slightly higher than the other treatments fig 4 xu et al 2016 confirmed that irrigation at the jointing stage was an important irrigation period to avoid a soil water shortage the w3 treatment was not irrigated from the post sowing to the pre anthesis stage which resulted in soil drought for a long time irrigation water was quickly absorbed after the anthesis irrigation was carried out i e only vswc in the 0 40 cm soil depth increased a short time after anthesis irrigation thus leading to low vswc although the w2 treatment was not irrigated during the anthesis stage compared with the w4 treatment the frequent rainfall in may could have partially offset the water deficit ghg emissions are regulated by soil temperature and water content and many studies have investigated the effects of soil hydrothermal variation on ghg emissions kallenbach et al 2010 mancinelli et al 2015 zhang et al 2013a in this study soil temperature in the 0 100 cm soil depth was positively correlated with co2 flux due to the relatively small difference in soil temperature between the soil depths fig 7 a a positive correlation was detected between soil temperature and co2 flux by zhao et al 2020 higher temperature promoted the rapid mineralization of soil organic matter and accelerated soil respiration thereby releasing more co2 a positive correlation was observed between vswc in the 0 50 cm soil depth and co2 flux fig 7 b similar to the results of nguyen and kravchenko 2021 this correlation could be related to the finding that water content in the 0 50 cm soil depth was lower than that in the 50 100 cm soil depth fig 5 low vswc could limit microbial activity and respiration in the rhizosphere which decreased microbial mobility and soluble matrix diffusivity thereby decreasing contact between the soil matrix and microbes and ultimately resulting in a positive correlation between vswc and co2 flux hou et al 2019 additionally root length density decreases with soil depth rubino and franchi 1990 illustrating that the upper soil depth is a hotspot for rhizosphere activity relative to the deeper soil depth kan et al 2020 namely the zone of root activity was more concentrated in the 0 50 cm soil depth than the 50 100 cm soil depth intense heterotrophic respiration stimulated by organic carbon substrates from roots in the upper soil horizon baudoin et al 2001 and increased vswc in the 0 50 cm soil depth could together promote the rate of co2 production and decrease co2 efflux from the soil wang et al 2013b the microbial processes of methanogens and methanotrophs related to the soil conditions affect ch4 flux dunfield et al 1993 galbally et al 2008 our results showed that soil temperature was positively associated with ch4 flux in the wheat maize system fig 7 a which was similar to the findings of chen et al 2018 and was caused by increased enzyme and methanogen activities however there was a complex relationship between vswc in the different soil depths and ch4 flux positive and negative correlations were found between vswc in the 0 40 cm and 50 90 cm soil depths and ch4 flux respectively fig 7 b vswc in the 0 40 cm soil depth was lower than that in the 50 90 cm soil depth fig 5 in relatively dry soil environments increased vswc reduces ch4 diffusivity into the soil resulting in a high risk of ch4 emissions liu et al 2016 however increased vswc in relatively wet soil environments can increase the abundance of methanotrophs near the oxygen interface which promotes microbial oxidation of ch4 and ch4 uptake zhang et al 2019 the relationships between soil temperature and vswc and n2o flux were similar to the co2 flux findings fig 7 similarly other researchers have reported that increased soil temperature and water content are conducive to n2o emissions horv ath et al 2010 li et al 2020b zhu et al 2015 the positive relationships between soil microbial activity and denitrification rate and temperature lead to increased n2o emissions zhang et al 2020 an increase in soil water content may have reduced the diffusion of n2o into the soil thereby stimulating n2o emissions lyu et al 2019 however a significant correlation was not detected between soil temperature and n2o flux for summer maize fig 7 a higher soil water content from irrigation and heavy rainfall resulted in obvious n2o flux peaks during the summer maize season whereas higher water content was usually accompanied by lower soil temperature the disproportionate relationship between higher n2o flux peaks and lower soil temperature might make it difficult to explain the correlation between soil temperature and n2o flux fan et al 2021 4 3 integrative productivity under the different irrigation schedules the changes in the winter wheat season irrigation schedule exhibited strong impacts on winter wheat and the wheat maize system variations in indicators i e cumulative co2 ch4 and n2o emissions yield wp gwp and ghgi of the wheat maize system generally followed those of winter wheat however there was little residual impact on summer maize the possible reason for the small difference was that frequent rainfall and the same irrigation amount during the summer maize season could have compensated for the soil water storage differences between different irrigation treatments in the previous season similarly zhang et al 2021 reported that rainfall could weaken the difference between optimized practice and traditional practice treatments although a difference in irrigation amount was observed between the two treatments the yield and wp under the w2 treatment with jointing irrigation were higher than those under the w3 treatment with anthesis irrigation table 1 table s2 irrigation at the jointing stage compared with that at the anthesis stage was key to increasing yield and wp because sufficient water and nitrogen supply at the jointing stage promoted cytokinin synthesis in the roots li et al 2018 xu et al 2018 no irrigation at the jointing stage in the w3 treatment resulted in a soil water deficit during a critical period which limited the absorption of soil water by the root system deng et al 2006 jointing irrigation effectively increases leaf nutrient contents thereby improving dry matter accumulation li et al 2010 although the crop in the w4 treatment was irrigated at the jointing and anthesis stages the w2 treatment had a higher yield and wp table 1 table s2 our results agreed with the findings of zhao et al 2021 indicating that water stress during the non critical period i e anthesis stage had a little effect on crop growth the w2 treatment under limited irrigation experienced a true water shortage during the non critical period which could have helped the root system penetrate the subsoil depth xu et al 2016 thereby increasing water consumption in deeper soil depths zhang et al 2013b in addition excessive soil water content caused by multiple irrigations can lead to premature leaf senescence and further decrease grain weight li et al 2019b wang et al 2013a gwp and ghgi are determined by the crop yield and ghg emissions maneepitak et al 2019 in this study positive gwp values were obtained in which the contribution of co2 to gwp was the greatest followed by n2o while a negative contribution of ch4 to gwp was detected table 1 tables s2 s3 this result was in line with that of gao et al 2018 indicating that the soil acted as a source of ghgs for the wheat maize system in the ncp the w2 treatment realized a lower gwp compared with the w3 and w4 treatments which was mostly attributable to lower cumulative co2 emissions higher yield under the w2 treatment further resulted in a lower ghgi consequently pre sowing jointing irrigation could be a promising strategy to mitigate ghg emissions increase crop yield and save water 5 conclusions this study investigated the relationships between soil hydrothermal conditions in the 0 100 cm soil depth and ghg fluxes and further compared differences in crop yield wp gwp and ghgi under four irrigation schedules in a typical winter wheat summer maize cropping system the soil temperature and vswc dynamics related to irrigation were assessed which indicated that the effect of irrigation management on vswc was greater than that of soil temperature in the wheat maize system soil temperature hardly changed with the soil depth which led to a positive correlation between soil temperature in the 0 100 cm soil depth and ghg fluxes vswc in the 0 50 cm soil depth decreased with soil depth therefore increased vswc under a low water content condition promoted ghg emissions in contrast vswc in the 50 100 cm soil depth increased with soil depth suppressing ch4 emissions changes in the ghg emissions from agricultural soil were closely related to hydrothermal conditions in the different soil depths which could regulate ghg emissions through irrigation management considering the comprehensive effects of different irrigation schedules on agricultural production and environmental risks the w2 treatment with appropriate irrigation during the critical period increased yield by 2 2 6 2 and wp by 5 0 13 1 but reduced gwp by 2 8 6 6 and ghgi by 8 6 9 4 compared with the w3 and w4 treatments irrigation at the pre sowing jointing stages is recommended to improve crop yield and water productivity while lowering ghg emissions in the ncp credit authorship contribution statement chong wang conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation writing original draft zhenzhen gao investigation

9803,production and consumption of greenhouse gases ghgs from agricultural soil largely depend on soil temperature and moisture previous studies regarding the relationships between soil temperature and moisture and ghg emissions mainly considered the upper soil depth and lacked information on the deeper soil depth here we for the first time explored the relationships between hydrothermal conditions at the soil surface to a depth of 100 cm and ghg emissions in a typical winter wheat summer maize cropping system and then evaluated yield crop water productivity wp global warming potential gwp and ghg intensity ghgi under four irrigation schedules w1 pre sowing irrigation w2 pre sowing jointing irrigation w3 pre sowing anthesis irrigation w4 pre sowing jointing anthesis irrigation regardless of the irrigation schedule the soil acted as a source of ghgs for the wheat maize system small differences in irrigation related soil temperature were detected while volumetric soil water content vswc in the different soil depths varied greatly soil temperature and vswc in the 0 100 cm and 0 50 cm soil depths of the wheat maize system were positively correlated with co2 and n2o fluxes soil temperature in the 0 70 cm soil depth positively affected ch4 flux whereas positive and negative correlations were observed between vswc in the 0 40 cm and 50 90 cm soil depths and ch4 flux respectively an improper irrigation period under the w3 treatment lowered crop yield and excessive irrigation under the w4 treatment caused increased water consumption and ghg emissions the w2 treatment improved yield by 5 6 6 2 and 2 2 3 1 increased wp by 5 0 8 1 and 12 8 13 1 decreased gwp by 2 8 3 1 and 6 0 6 6 and reduced ghgi by 8 6 9 4 and 9 0 9 2 compared to the w3 and w4 treatments respectively this study highlights the importance of the effect of the hydrothermal conditions in different soil depths on ghg emissions and an adequate irrigation schedule for improving yield saving water and mitigating ghgs keywords greenhouse gas irrigation strategy moisture temperature yield 1 introduction global warming caused by excessive greenhouse gas ghg emissions is a serious problem that has aroused unprecedented attention stocker et al 2013 agricultural soil is considered to be the main contributor to ghg emissions such as carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o tellez rio et al 2017 it is estimated that about 25 of total ghg emissions originate from agricultural soil burney et al 2010 as the food demand associated with global population growth continues to increase reducing ghg emissions from agricultural soils is a huge challenge skinner et al 2019 although agriculture has released large amounts of ghgs into the atmosphere the global agricultural technology mitigation potential will be 5 5 6 0 pg c yr 1 by 2030 smith et al 2008 increased ghg emissions associated with irrigation have accelerated the global warming effect of agriculture mcgill et al 2018 tian et al 2021 of which global co2 emissions from agricultural irrigation are 36 7 54 2 mt zou et al 2015 in this case finding reasonable irrigation management may be a matter of interest to mitigate ghg emissions and ensure food security as one of the three main food producing regions in china the north china plain ncp accounts for more than half of winter wheat production and one third of summer maize production in china liang et al 2011 however in the ncp winter wheat is usually irrigated three to five times to meet water demand and summer maize is irrigated once after planting sun et al 2011 frequent irrigation particularly of winter wheat has resulted in the over exploitation of groundwater feng et al 2018 substantial agricultural irrigation leads to serious soil secondary salinization which is the main problem with irrigation water quality javadi et al 2019 shi et al 2020 saline sodic soils usually present a poor soil structure related to a reduced soil infiltration rate hydraulic conductivity and fertility shaygan et al 2017 the movement of salts proceeds with the flow of water in the soil resulting in a soil water deficit or inefficiency yang et al 2019 the winter wheat season is both drier and cooler than the summer maize season under the saline sodic land as well as dry and cool weather conditions soil water resources potentially threaten the growth and productivity of winter wheat which requires proper irrigation to avoid a water shortage and aggravate soil salinization however applying irrigation during the crop growing season promotes methanogen and denitrification processes and reduces soil organic carbon contents resulting in higher risks of co2 ch4 and n2o emissions d acunha and johnsona 2019 wiesmeier et al 2019 blind irrigation not only causes the waste of water resource but also leads to environmental pollution nevertheless irrigation during the critical period helps to absorb more water from the soil and increase crop yield while alleviating ghg emissions cheng et al 2020 reported that intermittent irrigation after midseason drainage reduced ghg emissions without affecting rice yield xu et al 2018 discovered that irrigation at the jointing stage increased water utilization and dry matter accumulation of winter wheat based on seven different irrigation regimes therefore determining reasonable irrigation schedules may be a promising option to maintain agricultural production save water resource and reduce ghg emissions ghg emissions are the result of complicated production consumption and transportation in agricultural soil livesley et al 2011 and are influenced by soil conditions and management measures linquist et al 2015 mcgill et al 2018 irrigation related variations in soil temperature and water content determine whether soil acts as a ghg source or sink saurich et al 2019 low soil temperature limits the soil nitrogen cycle and the activities of methanogenic archaea and methanotrophs thus reducing n2o and ch4 emissions bai et al 2013 luan et al 2019 irrigation induced high soil water content promotes respiration and organic matter decomposition in the rhizosphere and drives soil nitrification and denitrification processes which emit more co2 and n2o raich and schlesinger 1992 ye et al 2020 however increased soil water content inhibits methanotroph activity and oxygen diffusion thereby suppressing ch4 uptake ran et al 2017 a positive relationship has been observed between soil temperature and moisture and ghg emissions previous studies have mainly considered the effect of temperature and moisture in the upper soil depths e g 0 5 0 10 and 0 20 cm on ghg emissions for example kumar et al 2016 investigated the relationship between soil temperature in the 0 10 cm soil depth and ghg emissions under different soil water potentials wei et al 2018 reported that co2 and n2o fluxes were positively and exponentially correlated to soil water content in the top 0 24 cm soil depth under two watering treatments zhong and xiong 2021b analyzed the impacts of soil temperature in the 0 5 cm soil depth and soil water filled pore space in the 0 20 cm soil depth on co2 emissions based on different irrigation amounts in particular the relationship between the hydrothermal conditions in deeper soil depths and ghg emissions is unclear given that the source sink function of ghgs may be affected by soil temperature and moisture in different soil depths this study explored the associations between hydrothermal conditions from the soil surface to a depth of 100 cm and ghg emissions in a winter wheat summer maize cropping system and then analyzed crop productivity and the environmental risks under different irrigation schedules the main objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the temporal variation and vertical distribution of soil hydrothermal conditions related to irrigation 2 determine the annual variations in co2 ch4 and n2o fluxes 3 evaluate the relationships between soil hydrothermal conditions in the 0 100 cm soil depth and ghg fluxes and 4 compare the discrepancies in crop yield water productivity and ghg emissions between different irrigation schedules the results will provide a theoretical basis for understanding the effects of soil hydrothermal conditions in different soil depths on the production and consumption of ghgs the findings will also be of great significance to optimize the irrigation strategy to save water improve yield and mitigate ghg emissions 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment the field trial was conducted at the wuqiao experimental station 116 44 e 37 63 n china agricultural university ncp from 2018 to 2020 fig 1 the typical winter wheat summer maize cropping system is usually practiced in this region winter wheat usually grows from mid october to early june and summer maize is planted after harvesting winter wheat and grows from mid june to early october the average daily air temperature during the winter wheat season was 8 1 c in 2018 2019 and 8 9 c in 2019 2020 the total rainfall was 79 2 mm during 23 rainy days and 153 6 mm during 33 rainy days in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively and the rainfall was mostly concentrated in may fig 2 the average daily air temperature during the summer maize season was 25 7 c in 2019 and 25 1 c in 2020 the total rainfall was 439 2 mm during 24 rainy days and 240 5 mm during 28 rainy days in 2019 and 2020 respectively and the rainfall was mostly concentrated in july and august fig 2 the soil at a depth of 0 20 cm at the experimental site is a silty loam texture 11 clay 70 silt and 19 sand which has an organic matter content of 14 7 g kg 1 alkaline hydrolyzable n content of 64 2 mg kg 1 available p content of 14 8 mg kg 1 available k content of 123 5 mg kg 1 and ph of 7 4 the initial available water content hydraulic conductivity and soil infiltration rate in the 0 20 cm soil depth were 14 9 2 3 cm h 1 and 12 6 cm h 1 respectively a split block design was used with three replicates each plot had an area of 55 m2 5 11 m pre sowing irrigation is widely used to promote seed emergence and ensure the normal growth of seedlings li et al 2005 the main irrigation regimes in this area to increase water productivity and maintain the winter wheat yield involved irrigating at the jointing and anthesis stages li and zhou 2000 to explore the optimal irrigation schedule to balance agricultural production and environmental protection the treatments consisted of four irrigation schedules w1 pre sowing irrigation w2 pre sowing jointing irrigation w3 pre sowing anthesis irrigation and w4 pre sowing jointing anthesis irrigation the four different irrigation treatments were adapted for winter wheat all plots were irrigated once after planting summer maize and there was no additional irrigation before harvesting the summer maize the irrigation amount was 75 mm each time which was recorded by water meters with an accuracy of 0 1 l for each irrigation event therefore this study investigated the direct residual and annual impacts of different irrigation schedules from the winter wheat season on winter wheat summer maize and the wheat maize system respectively the sowing harvest and irrigation dates of the winter wheat and summer maize are listed in table s1 all summer maize straw was crushed with a rotary tiller after harvesting and returned to the field then the jimai 22 winter wheat variety was seeded at a seeding rate of 300 kg ha 1 after rotary tillage the winter wheat straw was left on the soil surface with about 20 cm of stubble after harvesting the winter wheat and the zhengdan 958 summer maize variety was planted at a density of 75 000 plants ha 1 under no tillage the amounts of fertilizer applied to the winter wheat were the same as those applied to summer maize namely all treatments received 225 kg ha 1 138 kg ha 1 and 112 kg ha 1 n p and k fertilizers respectively which were applied using urea 46 n diammonium phosphate 18 n and 46 p and potassium sulfate 50 k given that farmers tend to obtain high benefits at low inputs all fertilizers are applied as basal fertilizer which is the fertilization method commonly used by local farmers however topdressing is both time consuming and laborious therefore all fertilizers were applied at pre sowing to winter wheat and at the time of planting of the summer maize respectively 2 2 field measurements 2 2 1 daily soil temperature and volumetric water content soil temperature c and volumetric soil water content vswc were monitored continuously in real time using the crop soil monitor beijing dongfang runze ecological technology co ltd beijing china fig 1 soil temperature and vswc were measured in the 0 100 cm soil depth with a 10 cm interval by inserting a probe into the ground vertically insentek s high definition frequency domain reflectometry fdr accuracy of 4 sensor is used to track changes in soil temperature and vswc with high sensitivity temperature measurement range is from 20 60 c with an accuracy of 0 5 c and vswc measurement range is from dry to saturated soil with an accuracy of 4 the machine learning and kalman filter are used to better understand the data and thereby there is no primary calibration the data capture interval can be configured from 5 min to 4 h with a 32 bit arm cpu insentek 2020 the monitor was placed in each plot after sowing the winter wheat and the monitor was not removed until the summer maize was harvested the monitor was fully charged before it was placed in the field and a solar panel lithium iron phosphate battery was applied to provide electricity during monitoring the average field water capacity and wilting point in the 0 100 cm soil profile were 40 7 and 11 3 respectively in this study capture interval was set to 1 h so soil temperature and vswc were recorded at a 1 h interval between 1 00 and 24 00 every day because gas samples were collected between 9 00 and 11 00 am soil temperature and vswc recorded by the monitor at 10 00 am were extracted from the ecodata module to match the time of gas collection then we used extracted the soil temperature and vswc to analyze dynamic changes in the hydrothermal conditions of the 0 100 cm soil depth and examined the relationships between hydrothermal variations in different soil depths and ghg emissions 2 2 2 crop water productivity in this study we only assessed crop water productivity wp throughout the crop growing season and did not consider wp at different growth stages thus soil water content was measured at the pre sowing and maturity stages respectively summer maize and winter wheat roots can reach up to depth of 120 and 200 cm respectively zhao et al 2014 zhou et al 2008 to fully analyze the ability of the root systems to absorb soil water content soil samples were obtained from the 0 200 cm soil depth with a 20 cm interval using a soil corer sun et al 2019 wang et al 2018 soil gravimetric water content under each soil depth was measured to a constant weight at 105 c for 48 h using an oven drying method soil volumetric water content was determined by the bulk density and gravimetric water content the difference in stored soil water under the soil depths between the pre sowing and maturity stages was used to determine the change in soil profile water the wp kg m 3 was calculated using the following equation fernÃ¡ndez et al 2020 wp gy p i Î´w r d where gy kg ha 1 is crop yield p mm is precipitation throughout the growing season i mm is the irrigation amount Î´w mm is the change in soil water storage 0 200 cm between pre sowing and maturity r mm is surface runoff and d mm is drainage from the root zone below the 200 cm soil profile no surface runoff occurred because of the presence of beds around each plot because irrigation i e at the pre sowing jointing and anthesis stages at the site was only used to replace soil water content in the root zone drainage was assumed to be negligible ali et al 2007 likewise surface runoff and drainage can also be ignored in the ncp including at this experimental site gao et al 2017 wang et al 2021a 2 2 3 greenhouse gas sampling ghg fluxes were measured using the closed chamber technique and gas chromatography the chambers 0 2 0 2 0 3 m were placed at a depth of about 3 cm in the soil in each plot during the growing season the pedestal had a 3 cm deep groove that was filled with water to ensure that the internal changes during sampling were not affected by the external environment gas samples from surface air were taken with a 50 ml gas tight plastic syringe attached to a three way stopcock at 10 min intervals i e 0 10 20 and 30 min between 9 00 and 11 00 am the temperature at a soil depth of 0 5 cm was recorded with a geothermometer while gas samples were being collected gas samples were generally collected once every ten days however gas samples were collected once more the day after heavy rainfall and once every other day three times after irrigation the concentrations of co2 ch4 and n2o in the samples were measured by gas chromatography agilent 7890 a agilent technologies santa clara ca usa equipped with a flame ionization detector for measuring co2 and ch4 at 200 c and an electron capture detector for measuring n2o at 330 c the column temperature was set to 55 c the equation for calculating ghg fluxes f was zhong et al 2021a f Î´c Î´t h Ï 273 273 t where Î´c Î´t mg m 3 is the change rate of gas concentration per unit time h m is the height of chamber

fig s1 soil temperature during the winter wheat and summer maize seasons showed a slightly increasing and decreasing trend with soil depth respectively whereas there was almost no change in soil temperature in the wheat maize system fig s2 the average soil temperature range in the 0 100 cm soil depth under the w1 w2 w3 and w4 treatments was 7 5 12 4 mean 9 9 7 4 11 0 9 3 8 3 11 2 9 8 and 7 4 11 3 9 6 for the winter wheat season 22 1 25 5 24 1 21 3 24 8 23 3 21 1 26 2 23 8 and 21 2 25 1 23 5 for the summer maize season and 13 1 15 8 15 5 13 0 14 5 13 8 13 2 15 5 14 2 and 13 0 15 1 14 1 for the wheat maize system from 2018 to 2020 respectively fig s2 soil temperature in the 0 100 cm soil depth had similar vertical distribution patterns under each treatment fig s3 although the irrigation schedules were different between the treatments irrigation events at the jointing and anthesis stages did not cause significant soil temperature differences in the same soil depth vswc fluctuations among all treatments tended to be steady with soil depth fig 3 for example vswc in the 0 30 cm soil depth fluctuated widely whereas the range of vswc variation in the 30 100 cm soil depth was obviously small vswc showed a downward trend with soil depth in the 10 50 cm soil depth and then an upward trend in the 50 100 cm soil depth of which vswc in the 0 10 cm soil depth was the lowest fig 4 the average vswc ranges in the 0 100 cm soil depth under the w1 w2 w3 and w4 treatments were 14 5 32 5 mean 23 7 18 4 34 3 26 0 16 6 31 9 23 4 and 16 9 34 5 24 0 for the winter wheat season 15 7 35 4 27 7 19 4 34 9 28 4 19 0 35 5 27 4 and 17 3 35 2 27 3 for the summer maize season and 14 9 31 8 24 9 19 5 33 8 26 8 17 4 31 1 24 6 and 17 1 34 7 25 1 for the wheat maize system from 2018 to 2020 respectively fig 4 vswc under each treatment presented different vertical distributions during the winter wheat season while similar distribution features were found for the summer maize season fig 5 lower vswc under the w1 treatment during the winter wheat season increased to a depth of about 70 cm from the jointing to the harvest stage due to the lack of additional irrigation after sowing following the jointing and anthesis irrigation events vswc in all soil depths under the w2 and w4 treatments increased whereas vswc in the 0 40 cm soil depth increased only under the w3 treatment vswc in the 10 100 cm soil depth during the summer maize season was always higher under each treatment due to frequent rainfall events however lower vswc occasionally occurred in the 0 10 cm soil depth 3 2 greenhouse gas emissions co2 flux trended downward and then upward during the winter wheat season but showed a downward tendency with the fluctuation during the summer maize season fig 6 a b co2 flux reached a peak after sowing winter wheat and summer maize and the irrigation events at the jointing and anthesis stages cumulative co2 emissions were affected by the year and irrigation table 1 tables s2 s3 the w4 treatment generally had the highest cumulative co2 emissions followed by the w3 w2 and w1 treatments for the winter wheat and wheat maize system cumulative co2 emissions under the w3 treatment increased by 5 4 5 8 and 3 0 3 1 compared with the w2 treatment in 2018 2020 respectively cumulative co2 emissions in the w4 treatment were 8 4 11 1 and 6 1 6 5 higher than those in the w2 treatment respectively however no significant difference in cumulative co2 emissions of summer maize was observed between various treatments across the two years ch4 flux presented the characteristics of absorption and exclusion but the soil acted as a ch4 sink figs 6 c 6 d ch4 flux gradually decreased from the highest value within one week after sowing winter wheat and summer maize ch4 flux peaks appeared and showed an exclusion characteristic after irrigation at the jointing and anthesis stages no clear pattern of ch4 flux was observed during the rest of the time cumulative ch4 emissions were mainly affected by the year irrigation and their interaction table 1 tables s2 s3 cumulative ch4 uptake generally followed the order w1 w2 w3 w4 for winter wheat and the wheat maize system whereas an obvious pattern was not found for summer maize over two growing seasons the w3 treatment resulted in 9 4 12 7 and 9 2 10 5 higher cumulative ch4 emissions than the w2 treatment for winter wheat and the wheat maize system respectively cumulative ch4 emissions were 22 6 24 4 and 18 6 24 8 higher under the w4 treatment than under the w2 treatment respectively in general n2o flux was low and steady in the wheat maize system with occasional peak events figs 6 e 6 f n2o flux peaks occurred after sowing the winter wheat and summer maize n2o flux also reached emission peaks due to irrigation at the jointing and anthesis stages and after heavy rainfall the n2o flux during the summer maize season was greater than that during the winter wheat season there were significant effects of year irrigation and their interaction on cumulative n2o emissions table 1 tables s2 s3 cumulative n2o emissions increased as the total irrigation amount was increased in 2018 2020 cumulative n2o emissions of winter wheat and the wheat maize system under the w4 treatment increased by 0 8 1 3 and 3 0 11 2 compared to the w2 treatment respectively cumulative n2o emissions of the w2 treatment were 3 5 4 3 higher than those of the w3 treatment during the winter wheat season whereas no significant difference was observed between the w2 and w3 treatments in the wheat maize system although a significant difference in cumulative summer maize n2o emissions was observed among all treatments no clear pattern was detected 3 3 relationships between greenhouse gas emissions and soil hydrothermal conditions based on pearson s correlation analysis the association between soil temperature in the 0 100 cm soil depth and ghg emissions was investigated fig 7 a soil temperature in the 0 100 cm soil depth was positively correlated with co2 flux except for the summer maize 80 100 cm soil depth soil temperature in the 70 100 cm soil depth was negatively correlated with ch4 flux of winter wheat and soil temperature in the 0 70 cm soil depth and ch4 flux of summer maize and the wheat maize system were positively correlated soil temperature in the 0 100 cm soil depth was positively correlated with n2o flux of winter wheat and the wheat maize system except in the winter wheat 0 30 cm soil depth similarly the effect of vswc in the 0 100 cm soil depth on ghg emissions was analyzed fig 7 b vswc in the 0 50 cm soil depth was positively correlated with co2 and n2o fluxes in contrast a negative correlation was detected between vswc in the 30 90 cm soil depth and the ch4 flux of winter wheat vswc in the 0 40 cm soil depth was positively correlated with the ch4 flux of summer maize vswc in the 0 40 cm soil depth of the wheat maize system was positively correlated with ch4 flux whereas vswc in the 50 90 cm soil depth was negatively correlated with ch4 flux 3 4 yield crop water productivity global warming potential and greenhouse gas intensity the order of yield under the different irrigation schedules was w2 w4 w3 w1 for winter wheat and the wheat maize system while the yield of summer maize was not affected by the irrigation treatments table 1 tables s2 s3 in 2018 2020 the w2 treatment resulted in 13 2 16 5 and 3 3 7 2 greater yield for winter wheat compared to the w3 and w4 treatments respectively similarly the yield of the wheat maize system increased by 5 6 6 2 and 2 2 3 1 under the w2 treatment compared to the w3 and w4 treatments respectively wp was affected by the year and the irrigation schedule table 1 tables s2 s3 wp in winter wheat and the wheat maize system generally presented a decreasing trend with the increase in the total amount of irrigation however the difference in wp of summer maize between all treatments was relatively small the w2 treatment increased wp by 8 7 9 6 for winter wheat and 5 0 8 1 for the wheat maize system compared with the w3 treatment during the two growing seasons wp in winter wheat and the wheat maize system was 14 9 23 4 and 12 8 13 1 higher under the w2 treatment than under the w4 treatment respectively lower gwp and ghgi were observed for winter wheat under the w2 treatment from 2018 to 2020 table s2 as an illustration the gwp and ghgi of the w2 treatment were 5 2 5 6 and 19 5 22 6 lower than those of the w3 treatment respectively the w2 treatment decreased gwp and ghgi by 8 3 10 9 and 11 9 18 9 compared to the w4 treatment respectively the w2 treatment of summer maize obtained the lowest gwp and ghgi across both years whereas relatively small differences were observed between all treatments table s3 in the wheat maize system the w2 treatment also resulted in lower gwp and ghgi table 1 in 2018 2020 the gwp and ghgi under the w2 treatment were 2 8 3 1 and 8 6 9 4 lower than those under the w3 treatment respectively the gwp and ghgi were 6 0 6 6 and 9 0 9 2 lower under the w2 treatment than under the w4 treatment respectively 4 discussion 4 1 variations in greenhouse gas emissions co2 flux varied seasonally in the wheat maize system co2 flux peaks were observed after sowing winter wheat and summer maize figs 6 a 6 b which was in line with the findings of trost et al 2016 this flux occurred because high soil organic carbon availability caused by returning the straw to the field and applying fertilizers during the early sowing stage increased co2 emissions bhattacharyya et al 2018 musafiri et al 2020 tilling the soil during the winter wheat season could break down soil aggregates and further released more protected soil carbon thus inducing more co2 sainju et al 2010 the lower temperature in the winter led to a low and steady co2 flux from december to march and then the co2 flux presented an upward trend from march to june due to increased temperature and rainfall after reviving stage liu et al 2016 the frequent rainfall and elevated temperatures from july to august increased co2 emissions during the summer maize season and then co2 emissions decreased gradually owing to the decrease of temperature from august to october figs 6 a 6 b consistent with the findings of forte et al 2017 the co2 emission peaks occurred following jointing and anthesis irrigation events figs 6 a 6 b because irrigation increased soil respiration which led to more co2 emissions ali et al 2021 increasing the amount of irrigation promotes co2 emissions hou et al 2019 thereby resulting in high cumulative co2 emissions table 1 tables s2 s3 the w4 treatment had the highest cumulative co2 emissions during the jointing and anthesis irrigation events although the same irrigation amount was used in the w2 and w3 treatments the w3 treatment realized higher cumulative co2 emissions the combination of irrigation at the anthesis stage and rainfall in may could have resulted in higher soil water content during the late growth stage in the w3 treatment thus releasing more co2 regardless of the irrigation schedule the soil acted as a ch4 sink in the wheat maize system figs 6 c 6 d similar to the findings of mateo marin et al 2020 the lack of a groundwater table in the root zone and the aerobic conditions promote the soil to act as a ch4 sink huÃ©rfano et al 2015 however ch4 emission peaks were detected after irrigation during the jointing and anthesis stages figs 6 c 6 d comparable to the results of meng et al 2020 ch4 oxidation was restricted by reduced oxygen availability and soil air permeability under high soil moisture conditions chen et al 2017 cumulative ch4 uptake exhibited a decreasing tendency with an increase in the total irrigation amount table 1 tables s2 s3 applying irrigation resulted in a shortage of oxygen and further formed an anaerobic environment which was helpful for methanogen activity li et al 2020a wang et al 2016 however lower cumulative ch4 uptake was observed under the w3 treatment than the w2 treatment the w3 treatment was not irrigated before the anthesis stage thereby resulting in long term soil drought the dry soil was suddenly wet after the anthesis irrigation event and soil water content increased rapidly which may have greatly limited absorption of ch4 xu et al 2020 n2o is a byproduct of nitrification and denitrification luo et al 2013 in this study n2o flux peaks appeared following fertilization irrigation and heavy rainfall fig 6 e f consistent with previous results barton et al 2013 jahangir et al 2021 yao et al 2021 use of the fertilizer enriched soil inorganic nitrogen pool and induced nitrification oxidation and nitrifier denitrification thereby causing more nitrogen to be transformed into n2o bhuiyan et al 2021 laville et al 2011 the increase in soil moisture caused by heavy rainfall and irrigation regulated the supply of oxygen to soil microorganisms which promoted nitrogen conversion via denitrification and further produced more n2o dobbie and smith 2010 silva et al 2008 higher cumulative n2o emissions were detected as a result of the increase in total irrigation amount table 1 tables s2 s3 as the n2o flux peak after irrigation at the anthesis stage was lower than that after irrigation at the jointing stage lower cumulative n2o emissions were observed under the w3 treatment than under the w2 treatment anthesis irrigation under the w3 treatment coincided with the high amounts of rainfall in may which may have partially compensated for the soil water deficit also the soil inorganic nitrogen pool was exhausted during the late growth stage therefore the probable reason for the lower cumulative n2o emissions was a limitation of available nitrogen rather than a water shortage jabro et al 2008 rochette et al 2008 4 2 effect of soil hydrothermal conditions on greenhouse gas emissions in this study the average soil temperature of the different soil depths in all treatments was 9 3 9 9 and 23 3 24 1 for winter wheat and summer maize respectively figs s1 s2 indicating relatively small differences in soil temperature between irrigation treatments zhong and xiong 2021b however the average vswc under the w2 treatment was slightly higher than the other treatments fig 4 xu et al 2016 confirmed that irrigation at the jointing stage was an important irrigation period to avoid a soil water shortage the w3 treatment was not irrigated from the post sowing to the pre anthesis stage which resulted in soil drought for a long time irrigation water was quickly absorbed after the anthesis irrigation was carried out i e only vswc in the 0 40 cm soil depth increased a short time after anthesis irrigation thus leading to low vswc although the w2 treatment was not irrigated during the anthesis stage compared with the w4 treatment the frequent rainfall in may could have partially offset the water deficit ghg emissions are regulated by soil temperature and water content and many studies have investigated the effects of soil hydrothermal variation on ghg emissions kallenbach et al 2010 mancinelli et al 2015 zhang et al 2013a in this study soil temperature in the 0 100 cm soil depth was positively correlated with co2 flux due to the relatively small difference in soil temperature between the soil depths fig 7 a a positive correlation was detected between soil temperature and co2 flux by zhao et al 2020 higher temperature promoted the rapid mineralization of soil organic matter and accelerated soil respiration thereby releasing more co2 a positive correlation was observed between vswc in the 0 50 cm soil depth and co2 flux fig 7 b similar to the results of nguyen and kravchenko 2021 this correlation could be related to the finding that water content in the 0 50 cm soil depth was lower than that in the 50 100 cm soil depth fig 5 low vswc could limit microbial activity and respiration in the rhizosphere which decreased microbial mobility and soluble matrix diffusivity thereby decreasing contact between the soil matrix and microbes and ultimately resulting in a positive correlation between vswc and co2 flux hou et al 2019 additionally root length density decreases with soil depth rubino and franchi 1990 illustrating that the upper soil depth is a hotspot for rhizosphere activity relative to the deeper soil depth kan et al 2020 namely the zone of root activity was more concentrated in the 0 50 cm soil depth than the 50 100 cm soil depth intense heterotrophic respiration stimulated by organic carbon substrates from roots in the upper soil horizon baudoin et al 2001 and increased vswc in the 0 50 cm soil depth could together promote the rate of co2 production and decrease co2 efflux from the soil wang et al 2013b the microbial processes of methanogens and methanotrophs related to the soil conditions affect ch4 flux dunfield et al 1993 galbally et al 2008 our results showed that soil temperature was positively associated with ch4 flux in the wheat maize system fig 7 a which was similar to the findings of chen et al 2018 and was caused by increased enzyme and methanogen activities however there was a complex relationship between vswc in the different soil depths and ch4 flux positive and negative correlations were found between vswc in the 0 40 cm and 50 90 cm soil depths and ch4 flux respectively fig 7 b vswc in the 0 40 cm soil depth was lower than that in the 50 90 cm soil depth fig 5 in relatively dry soil environments increased vswc reduces ch4 diffusivity into the soil resulting in a high risk of ch4 emissions liu et al 2016 however increased vswc in relatively wet soil environments can increase the abundance of methanotrophs near the oxygen interface which promotes microbial oxidation of ch4 and ch4 uptake zhang et al 2019 the relationships between soil temperature and vswc and n2o flux were similar to the co2 flux findings fig 7 similarly other researchers have reported that increased soil temperature and water content are conducive to n2o emissions horv ath et al 2010 li et al 2020b zhu et al 2015 the positive relationships between soil microbial activity and denitrification rate and temperature lead to increased n2o emissions zhang et al 2020 an increase in soil water content may have reduced the diffusion of n2o into the soil thereby stimulating n2o emissions lyu et al 2019 however a significant correlation was not detected between soil temperature and n2o flux for summer maize fig 7 a higher soil water content from irrigation and heavy rainfall resulted in obvious n2o flux peaks during the summer maize season whereas higher water content was usually accompanied by lower soil temperature the disproportionate relationship between higher n2o flux peaks and lower soil temperature might make it difficult to explain the correlation between soil temperature and n2o flux fan et al 2021 4 3 integrative productivity under the different irrigation schedules the changes in the winter wheat season irrigation schedule exhibited strong impacts on winter wheat and the wheat maize system variations in indicators i e cumulative co2 ch4 and n2o emissions yield wp gwp and ghgi of the wheat maize system generally followed those of winter wheat however there was little residual impact on summer maize the possible reason for the small difference was that frequent rainfall and the same irrigation amount during the summer maize season could have compensated for the soil water storage differences between different irrigation treatments in the previous season similarly zhang et al 2021 reported that rainfall could weaken the difference between optimized practice and traditional practice treatments although a difference in irrigation amount was observed between the two treatments the yield and wp under the w2 treatment with jointing irrigation were higher than those under the w3 treatment with anthesis irrigation table 1 table s2 irrigation at the jointing stage compared with that at the anthesis stage was key to increasing yield and wp because sufficient water and nitrogen supply at the jointing stage promoted cytokinin synthesis in the roots li et al 2018 xu et al 2018 no irrigation at the jointing stage in the w3 treatment resulted in a soil water deficit during a critical period which limited the absorption of soil water by the root system deng et al 2006 jointing irrigation effectively increases leaf nutrient contents thereby improving dry matter accumulation li et al 2010 although the crop in the w4 treatment was irrigated at the jointing and anthesis stages the w2 treatment had a higher yield and wp table 1 table s2 our results agreed with the findings of zhao et al 2021 indicating that water stress during the non critical period i e anthesis stage had a little effect on crop growth the w2 treatment under limited irrigation experienced a true water shortage during the non critical period which could have helped the root system penetrate the subsoil depth xu et al 2016 thereby increasing water consumption in deeper soil depths zhang et al 2013b in addition excessive soil water content caused by multiple irrigations can lead to premature leaf senescence and further decrease grain weight li et al 2019b wang et al 2013a gwp and ghgi are determined by the crop yield and ghg emissions maneepitak et al 2019 in this study positive gwp values were obtained in which the contribution of co2 to gwp was the greatest followed by n2o while a negative contribution of ch4 to gwp was detected table 1 tables s2 s3 this result was in line with that of gao et al 2018 indicating that the soil acted as a source of ghgs for the wheat maize system in the ncp the w2 treatment realized a lower gwp compared with the w3 and w4 treatments which was mostly attributable to lower cumulative co2 emissions higher yield under the w2 treatment further resulted in a lower ghgi consequently pre sowing jointing irrigation could be a promising strategy to mitigate ghg emissions increase crop yield and save water 5 conclusions this study investigated the relationships between soil hydrothermal conditions in the 0 100 cm soil depth and ghg fluxes and further compared differences in crop yield wp gwp and ghgi under four irrigation schedules in a typical winter wheat summer maize cropping system the soil temperature and vswc dynamics related to irrigation were assessed which indicated that the effect of irrigation management on vswc was greater than that of soil temperature in the wheat maize system soil temperature hardly changed with the soil depth which led to a positive correlation between soil temperature in the 0 100 cm soil depth and ghg fluxes vswc in the 0 50 cm soil depth decreased with soil depth therefore increased vswc under a low water content condition promoted ghg emissions in contrast vswc in the 50 100 cm soil depth increased with soil depth suppressing ch4 emissions changes in the ghg emissions from agricultural soil were closely related to hydrothermal conditions in the different soil depths which could regulate ghg emissions through irrigation management considering the comprehensive effects of different irrigation schedules on agricultural production and environmental risks the w2 treatment with appropriate irrigation during the critical period increased yield by 2 2 6 2 and wp by 5 0 13 1 but reduced gwp by 2 8 6 6 and ghgi by 8 6 9 4 compared with the w3 and w4 treatments irrigation at the pre sowing jointing stages is recommended to improve crop yield and water productivity while lowering ghg emissions in the ncp credit authorship contribution statement chong wang conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation writing original draft zhenzhen gao investigation

9804,although the frequency and intensity of seasonal drought and wetness are increasing under climate change background their effects on soil nitrate nitrogen no3 n leaching have remained unclear in this study validated by the field data on a typical tea garden hillslope in taihu basin china the decomposition denitrification dndc model was used to investigate these effects the decennial drought decennial wetness and normal conditions of different seasons were combined to construct 31 scenarios results showed that seasonal drought decreased annual no3 n leaching with a reduction of 6 52 18 70 one season drought 18 62 29 68 two season drought 36 64 43 99 three season drought and 51 44 all season drought relative to the normal scenario except the spring drought drought in other seasons had legacy effects that increased no3 n leaching in their succession seasons the legacy effect of summer drought even continued till the summer of next year seasonal wetness increased annual no3 n leaching with an increase of 2 58 11 39 one season wetness 10 04 22 31 two season wetness 19 50 29 39 three season wetness and 29 66 all season wetness relative to the normal scenario autumn and winter wetness decreased the no3 n leaching in their succession seasons while spring and summer wetness had no such effect soil no3 n leaching had positive correlations with precipitation drought scenarios r 0 74 wetness scenarios r 0 54 and soil water seepage drought scenarios r 0 62 wetness scenarios r 0 56 weak correlation coefficients between soil no3 n content and no3 n leaching were also observed especially under spring drought r 0 17 and summer drought r 0 14 however no3 n leaching was not limited by soil no3 n content after the application of basal fertilizer fertilization plus drought or wetness increased the risk of soil no3 n leaching these findings will be benefit for controlling the non point n loss of tea plantation under the background of climate change keywords dndc

series of ecological and environmental problems such as water contamination soil degradation and greenhouse gas emissions compton et al 2011 sinha et al 2017 sun et al 2012 nitrate nitrogen no3 n is a preferential n form for plant uptake however it is highly water soluble and thus can be easily leached from the soil profile with water movement zhu et al 2018 large amount of no3 n leaching to the groundwater due to excessive n fertilization can severely threaten human s health in china more than 60 of monitored drinking water are seriously contaminated due to no3 n leaching han et al 2016 bai et al 2018 therefore it is essential to improve the understanding of no3 n leaching mechanisms to maintain the sustainable agricultural management and development soil no3 n leaching is determined by different factors including climate soil hydrology land use and agricultural management greaver et al 2016 ouyang et al 2017 klaus et al 2018 trolove et al 2019 liang et al 2020 among them climate has been recognized as a critical factor under the background of global warming sinha et al 2017 global warming interferes with the global water cycle due to feedbacks between rising temperatures and hydrologic processes bowles et al 2018 along with the global warming extreme weather events like severe droughts and heavy rainstorms have been frequently occurring over the world trenberth et al 2014 meehl et al 2013 drought may decrease the no3 n leaching due to two reasons firstly suppressed microbial activity in drought conditions slows down the production of no3 n manzoni et al 2012 secondly indiscernible soil water flow under drought condition limits the no3 n transport larsen et al 2011 in contrast rainstorm increases the no3 n leaching due to large soil water leakage huang et al 2018 the influences of drought and wetness on no3 n leaching have attracted worldwide attention for instance the sequence of extreme weather years wet dry and dry wet had an influence of 93 to 290 on two year cumulative no3 n leaching compared to the normal normal scenario in the u s corn belt iqbal et al 2018 the groundwater no3 n concentration under a natural vegetation field increased from 38 mg l to 69 mg l due to extreme precipitations zheng et al 2020 however previous studies revealing the influences of drought and wetness on no3 n leaching mostly focused on annual scale or rainfall events while little attention has been paid on seasonal scale more attentions should be paid on the effects of seasonal drought and wetness this is because the crop growth and agricultural management practices exhibit distinct seasonality seasonal drought and wetness induce changes on n transformations by disturbing the dynamics of microbial activities soil moisture plant nutrient uptake and carbon c and n availabilities reichmann and ala 2013 previous studies found that dry season suppressed the nitrification and n mineralization rates by 13 20 while wet season increased both those rates by 50 chen et al 2017 rainstorm in the growing seasons may have limited effect on no3 n leaching this was because although rainstorm may cause soil water leakage plenty of soil available water also facilitated plant n uptake wang et al 2015 patil et al 2010 therefore it is important to reveal the complicated effects of seasonal drought and wetness on no3 n leaching especially for the agricultural land with distinct seasonality of crop growth and agricultural management apart from the immediate effects the drought and wetness also have legacy and stimulating effects on no3 n leaching for example no3 n leaching increased from a temperate karst spruce beech forest in the following spring summer and autumn after a drought year leitner et al 2020 the accumulated no3 n leaching decreased by 84 and 43 at natural vegetation and cultivated farmland in the following year after a wet year respectively zheng et al 2020 however little information can be found on the legacy and stimulating effects of seasonal drought and wetness in the published studies in addition increasing frequency of seasonal extreme droughts and storms have been predicted in subtropical china in the coming decades ding et al 2020 sun et al 2020 therefore revealing the legacy and stimulating effects of no3 n leaching under seasonal drought and wetness is an important issue for comprehensive understanding the risk of n loss field experiments were conducted on monitoring no3 n leaching and its response to other factors zhang et al 2015 however they were often time and labor consuming and results were difficult to spatially and temporally scale up therefore the process based biogeochemical models have been used to investigate no3 n leaching different nutrient loading prediction models have been developed to meet these application requirements the decomposition denitrification dndc model has a relative advantage on c and n transformations firstly it had comprehensive physical mechanisms in simulating c and n biogeochemical processes as considering the microbial activity by the michaelis menten kinetics secondly on the basis of cascade approach water retention features were added to better simulate the soil hydrological processes butterbach bahl et al 2013 li et al 2004 therefore it has been calibrated and used to estimate no3 n leaching under different agricultural

expanding at the expense of natural forest yan et al 2018 this land use cover change has influenced the soil properties and hydrology and thus induced great n loss yao et al 2015 plenty of researches on climate change and soil no3 n leaching have been conducted in land uses like farmland lu et al 2019 forest geng et al 2020 grassland he et al 2020 etc however little has been known about how drought and wetness affect no3 n leaching in tea garden therefore based on the field monitoring on a typical tea garden hillslope in taihu basin china we investigated the influence of seasonal drought and wetness on soil no3 n leaching by scenario model simulations the primary aims of this study were to i quantify the no3 n leaching under different seasonal drought and wetness scenarios ii reveal the reducing and increasing characteristics of no3 n leaching in seasons after seasonal drought and wetness and iii explore the controlling factors of soil no3 n leaching under the background of seasonal drought and wetness 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description a tea garden hillslope 31 21 n 119 03 e in the western hilly region of the taihu basin china was selected as the study site

this hillslope fig 1b at each site after removing the litter layer three surface soil cores 100 cm3 were collected and oven dried 105 for 24 h to measure the bulk density bd three soil sub samples within 1 m distance fig 1c were collected at 0 20 cm these soil sampling sites were chosen between two rows of plants and with distance of 20 40 cm to the nearest plant after fully mixed soil samples were used to determine the rfc and contents of clay silt sand soil organic matter no3 n and ammonium nitrogen details about the measurements of these soil properties can be found in the study of zhou et al 2020 the elevation and slope were determined from a digital elevation model dem with 1 m spatial resolution by arcgis 10 0 esri redlands ca at each site soil water content swc and soil temperature st at 10 cm depth mean value at the depth of 0 20 cm were measured using ec 5 and mps 6 sensors meter group inc pullman wa usa three closed static chambers and three zero tension lysimeters fig 1c were installed to collect the soil gas and leachate samples below 30 cm depth one to two times per month from april 2016 to march 2018 the lysimeters were installed at this depth since the soil thickness of these four sites varied from about 30 50 cm and 90 of the roots were found in the top 30 cm depth zhu et al 2017 in general one sampling per month was the basic requirement additional sampling was also conducted after major rainfall events and fertilizer application the leachate no3 n concentrations were analyzed using the continuous flow analyzer san skalar breda the netherlands the gas nitrous oxide n2o concentrations were measured using the gas chromatograph 7890b agilent technologies santa clara california usa detailed informations about the measurements were

kg 1 2 3 dndc model set up and validation the dndc model li et al 1992 is comprised of two components the first component contains sub models of soil climate crop growth and organic matter decomposition the second component contains sub models of nitrification denitrification and fermentation this model predicts no3 n leaching by simulating both hydrological processes and n transformation if water drainage occurs in a soil layer the model distributes a fraction of the soil no3 n in the layer into the leachate and therefore no3 n leaching is controlled by both leaching water and soil no3 n content deng et al 2011 li et al 2006 since only surface soil parameters were required in the dndc model the measured or predicted soil parameters of the upper 20 cm depth were applied to run the model required parameters include meteorology soil properties terrain attributes plant physiology and land managements the meteorological data was obtained from the weather station 60 km away from the study site from the china meteorological data service centre https data cma cn the soil parameters and terrain attributes including slope bd clay content soc no3 n and ammonium nitrogen contents were obtained as described in section 2 2 soil hydraulic parameters including residual water content Î¸ r saturated water content Î¸ s and saturated water conductivity k s were predicted by rosetta model with sand silt and clay contents and then corrected by rfc according to lai et al 2018 the mean values of these parameters of these four sites table 1 were used to run the model plant physiological parameters of green tea were acquired from liao et al 2019 the calibration of dndc model for this study hillslope has been conducted in the study of liao et al 2019 in the current study we validated it with the measured st swc leachate no3 n concentration and the n2o emission flux from april 2016 to march 2018 due to high soil rfc the simulated no3 n leaching and n2o fluxes were corrected by the rfc liao et al 2019 a model output correction equation s c s 1 rfc was applied where s and s c are the simulated values before and after correction respectively the model accuracies were evaluated by the coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the model was considered to be perfect with nse 1 good with 0 5 nse 1 margin with 0 nse 0 5 and poor with nse 0 moriasi et al 2007 2 4 seasonal drought and wetness scenarios set up and simulation seasonal precipitation amounts in spring march to may summer june to august autumn september to november and winter december to february from 1960 to 2019 were analyzed for each season the precipitation amounts of different years were ranked from low to high the one ranked 6th and the one ranked 55th were the decennial drought and wetness seasons respectively while the one ranked 30th was the normal condition table 2 based on these 31 scenarios in the simulation year were determined these included four scenarios of one season drought four scenarios of one season wetness six scenarios of two season drought six scenarios of two season wetness four scenarios of three season drought four scenarios of three season wetness one scenario of all season drought one scenario of all season wetness and one scenario of all season normal condition each scenario was denoted with four letters from left to right to represent spring summer autumn and winter the letters d n and w stand for decennial drought normal and decennial wetness respectively for example dnnn meant that the spring was drought but the other three seasons were normal a three year simulation was conducted in the dndc model the first year was used for model spin up and the third year was used to investigate the legacy and stimulating effects the meteorological data of the all season normal scenario nnnn was used for simulation in these two years the second year was scenario simulation year and thus the meteorological data in different scenarios were used for different scenarios parameters other than the meteorology were set as the same the simulated no3 n leaching soil no3 n content n2o flux and soil water seepage were explored to reveal the effects of seasonal drought and wetness on no3 n leaching 3 results 3 1 model performance acceptable performances were achieved in simulating the soil temperature and soil water content at 10 cm depth and in simulating leachate no3 n concentrations and soil n2o emission fluxes fig 2 the r2 and nse values of the simulated mean soil temperature at 10 cm depth were 0 95 and 0 83 respectively those of the simulated soil water content at 10 cm depth were 0 72 and 0 65 the r2 values of the simulated leachate no3 n concentrations and n2o fluxes were 0 51 and 0 62 and the nse were 0 47 and 0 55 respectively the r2 values were 0 51 and nse values were 0 47 for the simulation indicating the overall performances were not perfect but acceptable 3 2 soil no3 n leaching under different scenarios seasonal variations of no3 n leaching were observed under the nnnn scenario fig 3 under the nnnn scenario with the total annual precipitation of 1077 mm the annual no3 n leaching load was 87 57 kg n ha 1 the greatest no3 n leaching load 27 68 kg n ha 1 was found in winter with the highest soil no3 n content 8 70 mg n kg 1 and the smallest precipitation 116 3 mm although largest precipitation 517 7 mm was observed in summer the soil no3 n content and no3 n leaching load were lowest 0 64 mg n kg 1 and 16 60 kg n ha 1 respectively intermediate no3 n leaching loads were found in spring 25 20 kg n ha 1 and autumn 18 08 kg n ha 1 and the precipitation amounts and soil no3 n contents in these two seasons were 249 0 mm and 194 0 mm 4 60 mg n kg 1 and 3 40 mg n kg 1 respectively compared to the nnnn scenario scenarios with more drought seasons had lower no3 n leaching loads in the simulation year yet greater leaching loads in the following year fig 4a under one season drought scenarios the no3 n leaching loads were 71 20 81 86 kg n ha 1 in the simulation year and 89 96 96 40 kg n ha 1 in the following year such loads were 61 58 71 26 kg n ha 1 in the simulation year and 86 41 101 82 kg n ha 1 in the following year under two season drought scenarios under three season drought scenarios such loads were 49 05 58 40 kg n ha 1 in the simulation year and 97 27 104 58 kg n ha 1 in the following year under all season drought scenario the no3 n leaching load was 42 52 kg n ha 1 in the simulation year and 106 01 kg n ha 1 in the following year drought in different seasons had different seasonal no3 n leaching loads relative to those under the nnnn scenario fig 5a taking one season drought scenarios as examples compared to the nnnn scenario the greatest seasonal reduction was found in autumn drought 70 69 then followed by spring drought 55 43 winter drought 45 59 and summer drought 45 28 soil no3 n leaching loads increased by 7 35 11 27 and 28 69 in their corresponding succession seasons when drought occurred in summer autumn or winter respectively however under spring drought a reduction of 14 17 was observed in the succession summer the legacy effect caused by summer drought lasted for a long time and reached the maximum increase of 18 94 in the next summer scenarios with more wetness seasons had greater no3 n leaching loads in the simulation year but lower loads in the following year fig 4a under one season wetness scenarios no3 n leaching loads were 89 83 97 54 kg n ha 1 in the simulation year and 80 69 86 41 kg n ha 1 in the following year under two season wetness scenarios such loads were 96 36 107 10 kg n ha 1in the simulation year and 79 27 84 57 kg n ha 1 in the following year under three season wetness scenarios such loads were 104 64 113 31 kg n ha 1 in the simulation year and 78 58 82 92 kg n ha 1 in the following year under all season wetness scenario it was 113 54 kg n ha 1 in the simulation year and 79 26 kg n ha 1 in the following year wetness in different seasons resulted in different seasonal no3 n leaching loads relative to those under the nnnn scenario fig 5b under one season wetness scenarios autumn wetness caused an increased no3 n leaching loads in autumn by 94 47 followed by wetness in spring 39 72 winter 25 58 and summer 22 82 autumn wetness decreased no3 n leaching loads by 23 94 22 27 and 10 30 in the winter next spring and next summer respectively winter wetness decreased no3 n leaching load by 11 27 in the next spring spring and summer wetness had limited effect 3 00 and 5 67 respectively on no3 n leaching in the succession summer and autumn when wetness existed in autumn e g nwwn wwwn nwww and wwww no3 n leaching loads in autumn increased by 76 02 94 47 however when both autumn and winter were wet e g nnww wnww nwww and wwww winter no3 n leaching load slightly decreased by 1 27 3 26 compared to the nnnn scenario 3 3 soil n2o emission fluxes under different scenarios the n2o fluxes were 0 88 1 33 kg n ha 1 in the simulation year and 1 70 1 83 kg n ha 1 in the following year under seasonal drought scenarios such values were 0 93 1 34 kg n ha 1 in the simulation year and 1 50 1 70 kg n ha 1 in the following year under seasonal wetness scenarios fig 4b compared to the nnnn scenario scenarios with more drought seasons had lower n2o fluxes in the simulation year but greater fluxes in the following year while scenarios with more wetness seasons had lower n2o fluxes both in the simulation year and following year drought or wetness in different seasons resulted in different seasonal n2o fluxes relative to those under the nnnn scenario under one season drought scenarios except that winter drought increased n2o fluxes by 17 30 drought in other three seasons deceased n2o fluxes 53 70 in autumn 37 90 in spring and 2 91 in summer except summer wetness under one season wetness scenarios which increased the n2o fluxes by 6 11 wetness in other three seasons decreased n2o fluxes 36 05 in autumn 31 52 in spring 16 48 in winter under multi season scenarios spring drought increased n2o fluxes in the succession summer 7 81 21 62 while spring and autumn wetness decreased n2o fluxes in the succession summer 2 04 11 74 and winter 27 83 39 83 4 discussion 4 1 dynamics of soil no3 n leaching under seasonal drought different dynamics of no3 n leaching were found when the drought occurred in different seasons spring drought not only decreased no3 n leaching load in the spring but also decreased it in the succession summer drought in spring increased soil no3 n content by 4 05 compared to the nnnn scenario but the increased plant n uptake in spring 22 09 compensated for the spring n accumulation in addition heavy precipitation in summer also increased n2o fluxes by 19 97 relative to the nnnn scenario due to denitrification however greater no3 n leaching was observed in the next summer rather than the succession autumn after the summer drought this was attributed to that autumn winter and spring had low precipitation thus limited no3 n leaching due to the low plant n uptake and evapotranspiration both autumn and winter droughts increased no3 n leaching in the succession winter and spring great no3 n leaching was observed in the following spring after winter drought this could be attributed to that increased litter inputs due to drought stress elevated soil no3 n content by 7 30 and 17 49 in the winter and next spring relative to the nnnn scenario respectively therefore when temperature rose and precipitation increased in the next spring the mineralization and decomposition of organic n accelerated resulting in a large no3 n leaching soil no3 n leaching had a lag performance under the drought conditions figs 5a and 6a the more drought seasons the longer legacy effect lasted fig 6a the legacy effect of seasonal drought on no3 n leaching has been widely reported and was attributed to the soil n accumulation under the drought conditions manzoni et al 2014 this was consistent with our study that the soil no3 n content increased from 4 30 to 5 14 mg n kg 1 from the one season drought to all season drought prolonged drought also inhibited the denitrification and decreased n2o emission from 1 33 to 0 88 kg n ha 1 fig 4b in addition the simulated plant n uptakes under the nnnn and drought scenarios were close 100 06 102 19 kg n ha 1 yr 1 this indicated that such droughts were not severe enough to limit tea n uptake therefore the legacy effect was mainly attributed to the n accumulation and limited water percolation when the soil was rewetted after drought the n decomposition and nitrification rates increased and the accumulated no3 n leached with water movement leitner et al 2017 similar results have also been observed in previous studies hartl meier et al 2014 found that after severe drought the water limitation stress reduced tree growth up to four years which led to decrease in tree n uptake and increase in no3 n leaching van metre et al 2016 and loecke et al 2017 found that after the 2012 drought in the midwest u s a wet 2013 spring led to exceptionally high no3 n loads in the mississippi river 4 2 dynamics of soil no3 n leaching under seasonal wetness seasonal wetness also had different effects on no3 n leaching in the succession seasons wetness in autumn and winter reduced the no3 n leaching in their succession seasons fig 5b under autumn and winter wetness scenarios soil water improved the dissolution and mineralization of fertilizers applied in late october while excessive soil water would facilitate the no3 n leaching therefore this great leaching loads reduced the soil available n in their succession seasons under autumn and winter wetness scenarios soil no3 n contents were lower in the autumn 13 50 and winter 8 50 compared to those under the nnnn scenario in addition autumn wetness also decreased n2o fluxes in autumn 36 05 and winter 35 50 in comparison increased precipitation in spring and summer had limited effects on no3 n leaching in their corresponding succession seasons fig 5b this could be partially attributed to the great plant water uptake and evapotranspiration in these seasons seasonal wetness stimulated no3 n leaching since that precipitation increased deep percolation and accelerated microbial n dynamics such as mineralization lohse et al 2009 hess et al 2018 liu et al 2020 this stimulating effects might reduce the no3 n leaching in the succession seasons in our study the more wetness seasons the longer reducing effect lasted fig 6b this was in line with the study that of iqbal et al 2018 found two year no3 n leaching increased ranging from 55 in the dry wet scenario to 290 in the wet wet scenario relative to the normal normal scenario previous study also found that wet season would reduce the no3 n availability chen et al 2016 this was consistent with our study that soil no3 n contents decreased from 4 30 to 3 44 mg n kg 1 as the amounts of wet seasons increasing fig 4b in addition the relationship between the annual n2o fluxes and no3 n leaching loads was positive under the drought scenarios but negative under the wetness scenarios fig 7d the wet conditions elevated the denitrification and increased soil n2o fluxes however when swc was higher than the field capacity gas diffusion o2 and n2o was limited and thus soil n2o flux decreased but no3 n leaching increased castellano et al 2010 zhou et al 2020 4 3 controls of soil no3 n leaching soil no3 n leaching had positive relationships with precipitation and soil water seepage and such relationships under the drought scenarios were stronger than that under the wetness scenarios at the annual scale fig 7a b at the daily scale precipitation and soil water seepage also influenced the no3 n leaching under the drought scenarios and wetness scenarios table 3 the weaker relationship under wetness scenarios indicated that soil no3 n content could be a restricted factor due to great leaching with plentiful precipitation in the early stage tian et al 2012 ni 2013 also found that no3 n leaching increased and reached the maximum when the annual precipitation was 600 800 mm lu et al 2019 had also indicated that no3 n leaching initially increased and then decreased with the continuous precipitation because of the excessive soil water stimulated the denitrification this can be further verified by the fact that relationship between the no3 n leaching and n2o fluxes under the wetness scenarios was stronger than that under the drought scenarios fig 7d soil no3 n content had negative influences on no3 n leaching in the simulation year at the annual scale fig 7c however it had mixed effects on no3 n leaching at the daily scale under the different scenarios table 3 under the nnnn scenario high no3 n leaching was observed after the application of n fertilizer fig 8 under seasonal wetness scenarios no matter in which season the wetness occurred soil no3 n content had positive influence on no3 n leaching table 3 this indicated that soil no3 n content increased no3 n leaching when the soil water was excessive under seasonal drought scenarios no3 n leaching had stronger relationships with soil no3 n content under the dnnn and ndnn scenarios than nnnn scenario table 3 this indicated that drought in spring and summer intensified the effect of soil no3 n content on no3 n leaching however no relationships were observed between the no3 n leaching and soil no3 n content under the nndn and nnnd scenarios this was because that after the application of basal fertilizer no3 n leaching was not limited by soil no3 n content but precipitation lai et al 2019 in addition the timing of precipitation events and fertilization also had important influences on total seasonal no3 n leaching loads in our study increasing no3 n leaching rates were observed after the application of n fertilizer especially after basal fertilization fig 8 in addition drought or wetness in autumn had greatest influence on no3 n leaching then followed by spring fig 5 this may be due to the drought or wetness after fertilization increased the risk of no3 n leaching similarly previous study also found that fertilization plus drought or wetness resulted in a drastic increase on no3 n leaching klaus et al 2020 5 conclusion understanding the effects of seasonal drought and wetness on no3 n leaching is essential for developing strategies to regulate non point n loss in this study on a tea garden slope in taihu basin we set up 31 scenarios and investigated the effects of seasonal drought and wetness on soil no3 n leaching using the dndc model the seasonal drought decreased no3 n leaching in the corresponding seasons but may increase no3 n leaching in their succession seasons however the opposite trend was observed under the seasonal wetness drought or wetness in autumn and winter had greater influence on no3 n leaching in their corresponding seasons and succession seasons compared to those in other seasons the legacy n effect caused by summer drought lasted for a long time until the next summer however drought in spring decreased no3 n leaching load in the summer and wetness in spring and summer did not reduce the no3 n leaching in the succession seasons precipitation soil water seepage were vital factors affecting no3 n leaching in addition soil no3 n content also influenced no3 n leaching especially under the spring and summer drought scenarios fertilization plus drought or wetness increased the no3 n leaching risk results of this study will be contributed to the risk assessment of non point n leaching loss and the precise agricultural management under climate

9804,although the frequency and intensity of seasonal drought and wetness are increasing under climate change background their effects on soil nitrate nitrogen no3 n leaching have remained unclear in this study validated by the field data on a typical tea garden hillslope in taihu basin china the decomposition denitrification dndc model was used to investigate these effects the decennial drought decennial wetness and normal conditions of different seasons were combined to construct 31 scenarios results showed that seasonal drought decreased annual no3 n leaching with a reduction of 6 52 18 70 one season drought 18 62 29 68 two season drought 36 64 43 99 three season drought and 51 44 all season drought relative to the normal scenario except the spring drought drought in other seasons had legacy effects that increased no3 n leaching in their succession seasons the legacy effect of summer drought even continued till the summer of next year seasonal wetness increased annual no3 n leaching with an increase of 2 58 11 39 one season wetness 10 04 22 31 two season wetness 19 50 29 39 three season wetness and 29 66 all season wetness relative to the normal scenario autumn and winter wetness decreased the no3 n leaching in their succession seasons while spring and summer wetness had no such effect soil no3 n leaching had positive correlations with precipitation drought scenarios r 0 74 wetness scenarios r 0 54 and soil water seepage drought scenarios r 0 62 wetness scenarios r 0 56 weak correlation coefficients between soil no3 n content and no3 n leaching were also observed especially under spring drought r 0 17 and summer drought r 0 14 however no3 n leaching was not limited by soil no3 n content after the application of basal fertilizer fertilization plus drought or wetness increased the risk of soil no3 n leaching these findings will be benefit for controlling the non point n loss of tea plantation under the background of climate change keywords dndc

series of ecological and environmental problems such as water contamination soil degradation and greenhouse gas emissions compton et al 2011 sinha et al 2017 sun et al 2012 nitrate nitrogen no3 n is a preferential n form for plant uptake however it is highly water soluble and thus can be easily leached from the soil profile with water movement zhu et al 2018 large amount of no3 n leaching to the groundwater due to excessive n fertilization can severely threaten human s health in china more than 60 of monitored drinking water are seriously contaminated due to no3 n leaching han et al 2016 bai et al 2018 therefore it is essential to improve the understanding of no3 n leaching mechanisms to maintain the sustainable agricultural management and development soil no3 n leaching is determined by different factors including climate soil hydrology land use and agricultural management greaver et al 2016 ouyang et al 2017 klaus et al 2018 trolove et al 2019 liang et al 2020 among them climate has been recognized as a critical factor under the background of global warming sinha et al 2017 global warming interferes with the global water cycle due to feedbacks between rising temperatures and hydrologic processes bowles et al 2018 along with the global warming extreme weather events like severe droughts and heavy rainstorms have been frequently occurring over the world trenberth et al 2014 meehl et al 2013 drought may decrease the no3 n leaching due to two reasons firstly suppressed microbial activity in drought conditions slows down the production of no3 n manzoni et al 2012 secondly indiscernible soil water flow under drought condition limits the no3 n transport larsen et al 2011 in contrast rainstorm increases the no3 n leaching due to large soil water leakage huang et al 2018 the influences of drought and wetness on no3 n leaching have attracted worldwide attention for instance the sequence of extreme weather years wet dry and dry wet had an influence of 93 to 290 on two year cumulative no3 n leaching compared to the normal normal scenario in the u s corn belt iqbal et al 2018 the groundwater no3 n concentration under a natural vegetation field increased from 38 mg l to 69 mg l due to extreme precipitations zheng et al 2020 however previous studies revealing the influences of drought and wetness on no3 n leaching mostly focused on annual scale or rainfall events while little attention has been paid on seasonal scale more attentions should be paid on the effects of seasonal drought and wetness this is because the crop growth and agricultural management practices exhibit distinct seasonality seasonal drought and wetness induce changes on n transformations by disturbing the dynamics of microbial activities soil moisture plant nutrient uptake and carbon c and n availabilities reichmann and ala 2013 previous studies found that dry season suppressed the nitrification and n mineralization rates by 13 20 while wet season increased both those rates by 50 chen et al 2017 rainstorm in the growing seasons may have limited effect on no3 n leaching this was because although rainstorm may cause soil water leakage plenty of soil available water also facilitated plant n uptake wang et al 2015 patil et al 2010 therefore it is important to reveal the complicated effects of seasonal drought and wetness on no3 n leaching especially for the agricultural land with distinct seasonality of crop growth and agricultural management apart from the immediate effects the drought and wetness also have legacy and stimulating effects on no3 n leaching for example no3 n leaching increased from a temperate karst spruce beech forest in the following spring summer and autumn after a drought year leitner et al 2020 the accumulated no3 n leaching decreased by 84 and 43 at natural vegetation and cultivated farmland in the following year after a wet year respectively zheng et al 2020 however little information can be found on the legacy and stimulating effects of seasonal drought and wetness in the published studies in addition increasing frequency of seasonal extreme droughts and storms have been predicted in subtropical china in the coming decades ding et al 2020 sun et al 2020 therefore revealing the legacy and stimulating effects of no3 n leaching under seasonal drought and wetness is an important issue for comprehensive understanding the risk of n loss field experiments were conducted on monitoring no3 n leaching and its response to other factors zhang et al 2015 however they were often time and labor consuming and results were difficult to spatially and temporally scale up therefore the process based biogeochemical models have been used to investigate no3 n leaching different nutrient loading prediction models have been developed to meet these application requirements the decomposition denitrification dndc model has a relative advantage on c and n transformations firstly it had comprehensive physical mechanisms in simulating c and n biogeochemical processes as considering the microbial activity by the michaelis menten kinetics secondly on the basis of cascade approach water retention features were added to better simulate the soil hydrological processes butterbach bahl et al 2013 li et al 2004 therefore it has been calibrated and used to estimate no3 n leaching under different agricultural management and climatic conditions he et al 2019 taft et al 2019 tea as one of the most important agricultural cash crops plays an important role in local cultural and economic developments in china in 2018 tea plantation area reached 2 99 million ha in china accounting for 47 of the world fao 2019 national bureau of statistics of the people s republic of china 2019 tea plantation has been expanding at the expense of natural forest yan et al 2018 this land use cover change has influenced the soil properties and hydrology and thus induced great n loss yao et al 2015 plenty of researches on climate change and soil no3 n leaching have been conducted in land uses like farmland lu et al 2019 forest geng et al 2020 grassland he et al 2020 etc however little has been known about how drought and wetness affect no3 n leaching in tea garden therefore based on the field monitoring on a typical tea garden hillslope in taihu basin china we investigated the influence of seasonal drought and wetness on soil no3 n leaching by scenario model simulations the primary aims of this study were to i quantify the no3 n leaching under different seasonal drought and wetness scenarios ii reveal the reducing and increasing characteristics of no3 n leaching in seasons after seasonal drought and wetness and iii explore the controlling factors of soil no3 n leaching under the background of seasonal drought and wetness 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description a tea garden hillslope 31 21 n 119 03 e in the western hilly region of the taihu basin china was selected as the study site

temperature st at 10 cm depth mean value at the depth of 0 20 cm were measured using ec 5 and mps 6 sensors meter group inc pullman wa usa three closed static chambers and three zero tension lysimeters fig 1c were installed to collect the soil gas and leachate samples below 30 cm depth one to two times per month from april 2016 to march 2018 the lysimeters were installed at this depth since the soil thickness of these four sites varied from about 30 50 cm and 90 of the roots were found in the top 30 cm depth zhu et al 2017 in general one sampling per month was the basic requirement additional sampling was also conducted after major rainfall events and fertilizer application the leachate no3 n concentrations were analyzed using the continuous flow analyzer san skalar breda the

kg 1 2 3 dndc model set up and validation the dndc model li et al 1992 is comprised of two components the first component contains sub models of soil climate crop growth and organic matter decomposition the second component contains sub models of nitrification denitrification and fermentation this model predicts no3 n leaching by simulating both hydrological processes and n transformation if water drainage occurs in a soil layer the model distributes a fraction of the soil no3 n in the layer into the leachate and therefore no3 n leaching is controlled by both leaching water and soil no3 n content deng et al 2011 li et al 2006 since only surface soil parameters were required in the dndc model the measured or predicted soil parameters of the upper 20 cm depth were applied to run the model required parameters include meteorology soil properties terrain attributes plant physiology and land managements the meteorological data was obtained from the weather station 60 km away from the study site from the china meteorological data service centre https data cma cn the soil parameters and terrain attributes including slope bd clay content soc no3 n and ammonium nitrogen contents were obtained as described in section 2 2 soil hydraulic parameters including residual water content Î¸ r saturated water content Î¸ s and saturated water conductivity k s were predicted by rosetta model with sand silt and clay contents and then corrected by rfc according to lai et al 2018 the mean values of these parameters of these four sites table 1 were used to run the model plant physiological parameters of green tea were acquired from liao et al 2019 the calibration of dndc model for this study hillslope has been conducted in the study of liao et al 2019 in the current study we validated it with the measured st swc leachate no3 n concentration and the n2o emission flux from april 2016 to march 2018 due to high soil rfc the simulated no3 n leaching and n2o fluxes were corrected by the rfc liao et al 2019 a model output correction equation s c s 1 rfc was applied where s and s c are the simulated values before and after correction respectively the model accuracies were evaluated by the coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the model was considered to be perfect with nse 1 good with 0 5 nse 1 margin with 0 nse 0 5 and poor with nse 0 moriasi et al 2007 2 4 seasonal drought and wetness scenarios set up and simulation seasonal precipitation amounts in spring march to may summer june to august autumn september to november and winter december to february from 1960 to 2019 were analyzed for each season the precipitation amounts of different years were ranked from low to high the one ranked 6th and the one ranked 55th were the decennial drought and wetness seasons respectively while the one ranked 30th was the normal condition table 2 based on these 31 scenarios in the simulation year were determined these included four scenarios of one season drought four scenarios of one season wetness six scenarios of two season drought six scenarios of two season wetness four scenarios of three season drought four scenarios of three season wetness one scenario of all season drought one scenario of all season wetness and one scenario of all season normal condition each scenario was denoted with four letters from left to right to represent spring summer autumn and winter the letters d n and w stand for decennial drought normal and decennial wetness respectively for example dnnn meant that the spring was drought but the other three seasons were normal a three year simulation was conducted in the dndc model the first year was used for model spin up and the third year was used to investigate the legacy and stimulating effects the meteorological data of the all season normal scenario nnnn was used for simulation in these two years the second year was scenario simulation year and thus the meteorological data in different scenarios were used for different scenarios parameters other than the meteorology were set as the same the simulated no3 n leaching soil no3 n content n2o flux and soil water seepage were explored to reveal the effects of seasonal drought and wetness on no3 n leaching 3 results 3 1 model performance acceptable performances were achieved in simulating the soil temperature and soil water content at 10 cm depth and in simulating leachate no3 n concentrations and soil n2o emission fluxes fig 2 the r2 and nse values of the simulated mean soil temperature at 10 cm depth were 0 95 and 0 83 respectively those of the simulated soil water content at 10 cm depth were 0 72 and 0 65 the r2 values of the simulated leachate no3 n concentrations and n2o fluxes were 0 51 and 0 62 and the nse were 0 47 and 0 55 respectively the r2 values were 0 51 and nse values were 0 47 for the simulation indicating the overall performances were not perfect but acceptable 3 2 soil no3 n leaching under different scenarios seasonal variations of no3 n leaching were observed under the nnnn scenario fig 3 under the nnnn scenario with the total annual precipitation of 1077 mm the annual no3 n leaching load was 87 57 kg n ha 1 the greatest no3 n leaching load 27 68 kg n ha 1 was found in winter with the highest soil no3 n content 8 70 mg n kg 1 and the smallest precipitation 116 3 mm although largest precipitation 517 7 mm was observed in summer the soil no3 n content and no3 n leaching load were lowest 0 64 mg n kg 1 and 16 60 kg n ha 1 respectively intermediate no3 n leaching loads were found in spring 25 20 kg n ha 1 and autumn 18 08 kg n ha 1 and the precipitation amounts and soil no3 n contents in these two seasons were 249 0 mm and 194 0 mm 4 60 mg n kg 1 and 3 40 mg n kg 1 respectively compared to the nnnn scenario scenarios with more drought seasons had lower no3 n leaching loads in the simulation year yet greater leaching loads in the following year fig 4a under one season drought scenarios the no3 n leaching loads were 71 20 81 86 kg n ha 1 in the simulation year and 89 96 96 40 kg n ha 1 in the following year such loads were 61 58 71 26 kg n ha 1 in the simulation year and 86 41 101 82 kg n ha 1 in the following year under two season drought scenarios under three season drought scenarios such loads were 49 05 58 40 kg n ha 1 in the simulation year and 97 27 104 58 kg n ha 1 in the following year under all season drought scenario the no3 n leaching load was 42 52 kg n ha 1 in the simulation year and 106 01 kg n ha 1 in the following year drought in different seasons had different seasonal no3 n leaching loads relative to those under the nnnn scenario fig 5a taking one season drought scenarios as examples compared to the nnnn scenario the greatest seasonal reduction was found in autumn drought 70 69 then followed by spring drought 55 43 winter drought 45 59 and summer drought 45 28 soil no3 n leaching loads increased by 7 35 11 27 and 28 69 in their corresponding succession seasons when drought occurred in summer autumn or winter respectively however under spring drought a reduction of 14 17 was observed in the succession summer the legacy effect caused by summer drought lasted for a long time and reached the maximum increase of 18 94 in the next summer scenarios with more wetness seasons had greater no3 n leaching loads in the simulation year but lower loads in the following year fig 4a under one season wetness scenarios no3 n leaching loads were 89 83 97 54 kg n ha 1 in the simulation year and 80 69 86 41 kg n ha 1 in the following year under two season wetness scenarios such loads were 96 36 107 10 kg n ha 1in the simulation year and 79 27 84 57 kg n ha 1 in the following year under three season wetness scenarios such loads were 104 64 113 31 kg n ha 1 in the simulation year and 78 58 82 92 kg n ha 1 in the following year under all season wetness scenario it was 113 54 kg n ha 1 in the simulation year and 79 26 kg n ha 1 in the following year wetness in different seasons resulted in different seasonal no3 n leaching loads relative to those under the nnnn scenario fig 5b under one season wetness scenarios autumn wetness caused an increased no3 n leaching loads in autumn by 94 47 followed by wetness in spring 39 72 winter 25 58 and summer 22 82 autumn wetness decreased no3 n leaching loads by 23 94 22 27 and 10 30 in the winter next spring and next summer respectively winter wetness decreased no3 n leaching load by 11 27 in the next spring spring and summer wetness had limited effect 3 00 and 5 67 respectively on no3 n leaching in the succession summer and autumn when wetness existed in autumn e g nwwn wwwn nwww and wwww no3 n leaching loads in autumn increased by 76 02 94 47 however when both autumn and winter were wet e g nnww wnww nwww and wwww winter no3 n leaching load slightly decreased by 1 27 3 26 compared to the nnnn scenario 3 3 soil n2o emission fluxes under different scenarios the n2o fluxes were 0 88 1 33 kg n ha 1 in the simulation year and 1 70 1 83 kg n ha 1 in the following year under seasonal drought scenarios such values were 0 93 1 34 kg n ha 1 in the simulation year and 1 50 1 70 kg n ha 1 in the following year under seasonal wetness scenarios fig 4b compared to the nnnn scenario scenarios with more drought seasons had lower n2o fluxes in the simulation year but greater fluxes in the following year while scenarios with more wetness seasons had lower n2o fluxes both in the simulation year and following year drought or wetness in different seasons resulted in different seasonal n2o fluxes relative to those under the nnnn scenario under one season drought scenarios except that winter drought increased n2o fluxes by 17 30 drought in other three seasons deceased n2o fluxes 53 70 in autumn 37 90 in spring and 2 91 in summer except summer wetness under one season wetness scenarios which increased the n2o fluxes by 6 11 wetness in other three seasons decreased n2o fluxes 36 05 in autumn 31 52 in spring 16 48 in winter under multi season scenarios spring drought increased n2o fluxes in the succession summer 7 81 21 62 while spring and autumn wetness decreased n2o fluxes in the succession summer 2 04 11 74 and winter 27 83 39 83 4 discussion 4 1 dynamics of soil no3 n leaching under seasonal drought different dynamics of no3 n leaching were found when the drought occurred in different seasons spring drought not only decreased no3 n leaching load in the spring but also decreased it in the succession summer drought in spring increased soil no3 n content by 4 05 compared to the nnnn scenario but the increased plant n uptake in spring 22 09 compensated for the spring n accumulation in addition heavy precipitation in summer also increased n2o fluxes by 19 97 relative to the nnnn scenario due to denitrification however greater no3 n leaching was observed in the next summer rather than the succession autumn after the summer drought this was attributed to that autumn winter and spring had low precipitation thus limited no3 n leaching due to the low plant n uptake and evapotranspiration both autumn and winter droughts increased no3 n leaching in the succession winter and spring great no3 n leaching was observed in the following spring after winter drought this could be attributed to that increased litter inputs due to drought stress elevated soil no3 n content by 7 30 and 17 49 in the winter and next spring relative to the nnnn scenario respectively therefore when temperature rose and precipitation increased in the next spring the mineralization and decomposition of organic n accelerated resulting in a large no3 n leaching soil no3 n leaching had a lag performance under the drought conditions figs 5a and 6a the more drought seasons the longer legacy effect lasted fig 6a the legacy effect of seasonal drought on no3 n leaching has been widely reported and was attributed to the soil n accumulation under the drought conditions manzoni et al 2014 this was consistent with our study that the soil no3 n content increased from 4 30 to 5 14 mg n kg 1 from the one season drought to all season drought prolonged drought also inhibited the denitrification and decreased n2o emission from 1 33 to 0 88 kg n ha 1 fig 4b in addition the simulated plant n uptakes under the nnnn and drought scenarios were close 100 06 102 19 kg n ha 1 yr 1 this indicated that such droughts were not severe enough to limit tea n uptake therefore the legacy effect was mainly attributed to the n accumulation and limited water percolation when the soil was rewetted after drought the n decomposition and nitrification rates increased and the accumulated no3 n leached with water movement leitner et al 2017 similar results have also been observed in previous studies hartl meier et al 2014 found that after severe drought the water limitation stress reduced tree growth up to four years which led to decrease in tree n uptake and increase in no3 n leaching van metre et al 2016 and loecke et al 2017 found that after the 2012 drought in the midwest u s a wet 2013 spring led to exceptionally high no3 n loads in the mississippi river 4 2 dynamics of soil no3 n leaching under seasonal wetness seasonal wetness also had different effects on no3 n leaching in the succession seasons wetness in autumn and winter reduced the no3 n leaching in their succession seasons fig 5b under autumn and winter wetness scenarios soil water improved the dissolution and mineralization of fertilizers applied in late october while excessive soil water would facilitate the no3 n leaching therefore this great leaching loads reduced the soil available n in their succession seasons under autumn and winter wetness scenarios soil no3 n contents were lower in the autumn 13 50 and winter 8 50 compared to those under the nnnn scenario in addition autumn wetness also decreased n2o fluxes in autumn 36 05 and winter 35 50 in comparison increased precipitation in spring and summer had limited effects on no3 n leaching in their corresponding succession seasons fig 5b this could be partially attributed to the great plant water uptake and evapotranspiration in these seasons seasonal wetness stimulated no3 n leaching since that precipitation increased deep percolation and accelerated microbial n dynamics such as mineralization lohse et al 2009 hess et al 2018 liu et al 2020 this stimulating effects might reduce the no3 n leaching in the succession seasons in our study the more wetness seasons the longer reducing effect lasted fig 6b this was in line with the study that of iqbal et al 2018 found two year no3 n leaching increased ranging from 55 in the dry wet scenario to 290 in the wet wet scenario relative to the normal normal scenario previous study also found that wet season would reduce the no3 n availability chen et al 2016 this was consistent with our study that soil no3 n contents decreased from 4 30 to 3 44 mg n kg 1 as the amounts of wet seasons increasing fig 4b in addition the relationship between the annual n2o fluxes and no3 n leaching loads was positive under the drought scenarios but negative under the wetness scenarios fig 7d the wet conditions elevated the denitrification and increased soil n2o fluxes however when swc was higher than the field capacity gas diffusion o2 and n2o was limited and thus soil n2o flux decreased but no3 n leaching increased castellano et al 2010 zhou et al 2020 4 3 controls of soil no3 n leaching soil no3 n leaching had positive relationships with precipitation and soil water seepage and such relationships under the drought scenarios were stronger than that under the wetness scenarios at the annual scale fig 7a b at the daily scale precipitation and soil water seepage also influenced the no3 n leaching under the drought scenarios and wetness scenarios table 3 the weaker relationship under wetness scenarios indicated that soil no3 n content could be a restricted factor due to great leaching with plentiful precipitation in the early stage tian et al 2012 ni 2013 also found that no3 n leaching increased and reached the maximum when the annual precipitation was 600 800 mm lu et al 2019 had also indicated that no3 n leaching initially increased and then decreased with the continuous precipitation because of the excessive soil water stimulated the denitrification this can be further verified by the fact that relationship between the no3 n leaching and n2o fluxes under the wetness scenarios was stronger than that under the drought scenarios fig 7d soil no3 n content had negative influences on no3 n leaching in the simulation year at the annual scale fig 7c however it had mixed effects on no3 n leaching at the daily scale under the different scenarios table 3 under the nnnn scenario high no3 n leaching was observed after the application of n fertilizer fig 8 under seasonal wetness scenarios no matter in which season the wetness occurred soil no3 n content had positive influence on no3 n leaching table 3 this indicated that soil no3 n content increased no3 n leaching when the soil water was excessive under seasonal drought scenarios no3 n leaching had stronger relationships with soil no3 n content under the dnnn and ndnn scenarios than nnnn scenario table 3 this indicated that drought in spring and summer intensified the effect of soil no3 n content on no3 n leaching however no relationships were observed between the no3 n leaching and soil no3 n content under the nndn and nnnd scenarios this was because that after the application of basal fertilizer no3 n leaching was not limited by soil no3 n content but precipitation lai et al 2019 in addition the timing of precipitation events and fertilization also had important influences on total seasonal no3 n leaching loads in our study increasing no3 n leaching rates were observed after the application of n fertilizer especially after basal fertilization fig 8 in addition drought or wetness in autumn had greatest influence on no3 n leaching then followed by spring fig 5 this may be due to the drought or wetness after fertilization increased the risk of no3 n leaching similarly previous study also found that fertilization plus drought or wetness resulted in a drastic increase on no3 n leaching klaus et al 2020 5 conclusion understanding the effects of seasonal drought and wetness on no3 n leaching is essential for developing strategies to regulate non point n loss in this study on a tea garden slope in taihu basin we set up 31 scenarios and investigated the effects of seasonal drought and wetness on soil no3 n leaching using the dndc model the seasonal drought decreased no3 n leaching in the corresponding seasons but may increase no3 n leaching in their succession seasons however the opposite trend was observed under the seasonal wetness drought or wetness in autumn and winter had greater influence on no3 n leaching in their corresponding seasons and succession seasons compared to those in other seasons the legacy n effect caused by summer drought lasted for a long time until the next summer however drought in spring decreased no3 n leaching load in the summer and wetness in spring and summer did not reduce the no3 n leaching in the succession seasons precipitation soil water seepage were vital factors affecting no3 n leaching in addition soil no3 n content also influenced no3 n leaching especially under the spring and summer drought scenarios fertilization plus drought or wetness increased the no3 n leaching risk results of this study will be contributed to the risk assessment of non point n leaching loss and the precise agricultural management under climate
