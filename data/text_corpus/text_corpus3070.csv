15350,selective production of carboxylic acids cas from mixed culture fermentation remains a difficult task in organic waste valorization herein we developed a facile and sustainable carbon loop strategy to regulate the fermentation micro environment and steer acidogenesis towards selective butyric acid production this new ion substitution electrodialysis anaerobic membrane bioreactor ised anmbr integrated system demonstrated a high butyric acid production at 11 19 g l with a mass fraction of 76 05 in comparison only 1 04 g l with a mass fraction of 30 56 was observed in the uncoupled control reactor the carbon recovery reached a maximum of 96 09 with the assistance of ised inorganic carbon assimilation was believed to be an important contributor which was verified by 13c isotopic tracing microbial community structure shows the dominance of clostridia 80 16 in the unique micro environment e g ph 4 80 5 50 controlled by ised which is believed beneficial to the growth of such fermentative bacteria with main products of butyric acid and acetic acid in addition the emergence of chain elongators such as clostridium sensu stricto 12 was observed to have a great influence on butyric acid production this work provides a new approach to generate tailored longer chain carboxylic acids from organic waste with high titer thus contributing to a circular economy graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords acidogenic fermentation inorganic carbon anaerobic membrane bioreactor electrodialysis closed carbon loop 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad has been widely used in resource and energy recovery from organic waste james et al 2021 yan et al 2020 in recent decades efforts have been devoted to energy recovery in the form of biogas kainthola et al 2020 however concerns on low value and climate change due to fugitive emissions of potent greenhouse gas methane and carbon dioxide make such conversion less attractive jones et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 alternatively short chain carboxylic acids sccas such as acetic acid propionic acid and butyric acid are valuable platform chemicals generated in the acidogenic stage bhatt et al 2020 among sccas butyric acid is considered an important commodity chemical with a relatively high market price of 2000 2500 usd t which is much higher than that of acetic acid 400 900 usd t bastidas oyanedel et al 2019 additionally butyric acid has much bigger market potential and broader applications as the feedstock or intermediate in the chemical food and pharmaceutical industries to date industrial butyric acid is mainly produced through chemical synthesis from petroleum based feedstocks e g propylene and butyraldehyde jiang et al 2018 undoubtedly targeted production of bio butyric acid is a promising alternative strategy that carries multiple benefits to reduce fossil fuel use upgrade ad products and reduce fugitive carbon emissions it can greatly alleviate the demand for petroleum derived butyric acid production while achieving waste reduction resource recovery and reduced carbon emission mixed culture fermentation plays an important role in facilitating the production of biofuels and commodity chemicals especially from mixed organic feedstocks because it doesn t require sterilization and pre treatment and it often has economic and operational advantages over pure culture fermentation hoelzle et al 2014 however the process generates a mixture of organic acids which challenges subsequent product separation and purification pervez et al 2022b thus there is an urgent need to promote the selectivity of target chemicals with higher economic viability and butyric acid is an ideal product in this context during acidogenic fermentation the product spectrum is directly dependent on the microbes in the bioreactors which are affected by the inoculum and especially the fermentation micro environment e g temperature ph orp headspace pressure trace elements substrate type arslan et al 2013 dahiya et al 2020 jankowska et al 2017 ramos suarez et al 2021 above all ph is observed as a critical factor that determines the product spectrum in the bioreactor it can change the structure of the microbial community in the anaerobic process thereby shifting the fermentation pathway feng et al 2020a for example when the ph was extremely low i e ph 3 5 lactic acid bacteria like lactobacillus 97 55 dominated the system due to their higher tolerance ability to ph over other acid producing bacteria contributing to the selective production of lactic acid itoh et al 2012 at ph 4 5 the proportion of lactobacillus decreased to 65 54 and bifidobacterium increased significantly which contributed to increased acetic acid production when ph increased to 6 0 the co occurrence of prevotella acidaminococcus and megasphaera was observed which were responsible for mixed acid fermentation feng et al 2018 it was well acknowledged that most of the existing studies on butyric acid fermentation from organic waste were usually observed in mildly acidic conditions around ph 5 0 feng et al 2018 horiuchi et al 2002 jiang et al 2013 exogenous alkaline and bio system buffer solution addition were two prevalent methods to regulate ph and ensure system stability dahiya and mohan 2019 feng et al 2020b however alkaline usage would cause the accumulation of salt and subsequently inhibit functional microbes in the anaerobic process including acidogenesis and methanogenesis feng et al 2020b liu et al 2017 therefore a salt concentration below 6 g l in food waste was recommended for volatile fatty acids vfas generation during the fermentation of food waste liu et al 2017 moreover there are still some controversies in terms of the influences of high salt concentration on acidogenic fermentation for example it was reported that acidogens were still productive when the salt concentration exceeded 10 g l he et al 2019 nevertheless as the salt concentration increased the production of butyric acid decreased and even ceased while the propionic acid production enhanced this was because the salt tolerant microorganisms i e propionibacteria became dominant in the bioreactor once biomass was exposed to high salt concentration alternatively when the biosystem buffer strategy was applied the excessive accumulation of carboxylic acids would lead to a drastic decrement of the in situ buffering ability which directly hampered the fermentation process therefore a more appropriate method should be developed to maintain the proton balance in the bioreactor coupling ion substitution electrodialysis ised is an effective method to control the proton balance as the proper arrangement of ion exchange membranes in the electrodialysis stack results in the substitution between ions of the type without posing significant inhibitions therefore a novel closed carbon loop strategy was designed in this study in which sodium hydroxide solution saturated with acidogenic off gasses co2 was used as the ion substituting solution to exchange carboxylate in the anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr through ised thus leading to the optimization of the micro environment e g ph such an approach would greatly avoid the excessive accumulation of salt in the broth compared with the traditional acid base neutralization method furthermore the capture of acidogenic off gas co2 and further introduction to the anaerobic system in the form of carbonate bicarbonate would improve the buffer ability through carbonate equilibrium and facilitate acid production during the anaerobic process in this study we investigated the feasibility of this approach ised anmbr coupled system to steer acidogenesis toward selective butyric acid production and explored the corresponding intensification mechanisms in addition the succession of the microbial community under the scheme of in situ micro environment regulation was revealed we also proposed the possible metabolic pathways through comprehensive analyses of the product spectrum micro environment carbon balance microbial community analysis and key enzyme activities this process allows the first report on the in situ reuse of acidogenic off gasses for the selective production of butyric acid in the anaerobic fermentation system 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and operation two replicates of the fermentation system reactor 1 and 2 denoted as r1 and r2 were operated at the same time based on whether the bioreactors coupled with the ion substitution electrodialysis part the whole operation process was divided into two different stages the uncoupled anmbr only stage 0 85 h and the coupled ised anmbr operation stage 85 396 h as shown in fig 1 the ion substitution electrodialysis anaerobic membrane bioreactor ised anmbr integrated system consisted of two functional zones the tailored anaerobic membrane bioreactor zone for acid production and biomass retention and the ion substitution electrodialysis zone for substitution of the carboxylic anion with inorganic carbon anion the anaerobic membrane bioreactor was a cylinder shape with a diameter of 10 cm and a height of 12 cm the customized filtration modules assembled with commercial hydrophobic flat sheet membrane polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe anow co ltd china were submerged in the broth with a pore size of 0 45 µm and a total filtration area of 0 031 m2 the electrodialysis stack and the ion exchange membranes were bought from hefei chemjoy polymer material co ltd hefei china during the ised anmbr operation stage a certain volume half or two thirds of fermentation broth was taken out from anmbrs for ised operation with a peristaltic pump yz1515x a baoding longer precision pump co ltd china when the broth ph was below 4 80 brown arrow the biomass was retained by the ptfe membrane module while permeate was collected in the glass reservoir b and subsequently pumped to the ised feed loop when the ph rose to the desired value the ised operation was stopped immediately and the fermentation broth was returned to the anaerobic bioreactor functioned as the back washing procedure black arrow afterwards the flow channels of the electrodialysis stacks were cleaned with deionized water the arrangement of ion exchange membranes in the ion substitution electrodialysis stack was described in fig 1 once applying an electrical potential between two electrodes the anions i e dissociated carboxylic acids in the left broth compartment were transported through the anion exchange membrane and migrated towards the product chamber at the same time the anions i e oh co3 2 and hco3 in the product chamber migrated towards the right broth compartment to maintain the electroneutrality of the product chamber and were then introduced into the bioreactor dashed blue arrow thus the simultaneous substitution of the carboxylic acid with basic anion and inorganic carbon was achieved in addition the cations in the left broth compartment were transported through the cation exchange membrane to the cathode chamber since the cathode and anode chamber shared the same electrolyze solution 0 2 m na2so4 the cations were then back to the broth compartments through the cation exchange membrane on the right in this study two cell pairs were applied in addition to those shown in the upper left corner of fig 1 with two more pieces of anion exchange membranes aem and one more piece of cation exchange membranes cem arranged between the anode and cathode a current of 1 a was selected during all ised experiments the initial product solution p simulates acidogenic off gas co2 sequestration with sodium hydroxide solution the volume and circulation flow rate of the product solution and electrode rinsing solution was kept the same as that of the feed solution b all operations in the two bioreactors remained the same in the first 306 5 h at 308 h the broth ph in r1 was promoted to 6 87 by ised while the broth ph in r2 was still maintained at ph 4 80 5 50 to investigate the effect of promoted ph on the product spectrum 2 2 inoculum and artificial wastewater an acclimated anaerobic sludge 4 v v od600 1 80 was inoculated in both bioreactors artificial organic wastewater was used as the substrate which contained g l glucose 5 00 kh2po4 0 23 yeast extract 1 00 nh4cl 0 45 and trace element solution 10 mm of sodium 2 bromoethanesulfonate bes was supplemented into bioreactors as a methanogenesis inhibitor in addition a 0 05 m phosphate buffer solution was initially added to two bioreactors then the reactors were flushed with n2 to ensure the anaerobic condition and then cultured in a 37 c incubator at the shaking speed of 100 rpm the experiment was carried out in a fed batch mode in the uncoupled stage the substrate was supplied every two days by injecting 20 ml of concentrated stock solutions to meet a final glucose concentration of 5 00 g l during the ised anmbr operation stage the concentrated stock solution was supplemented every day due to an obvious increment in substrate consumption 2 3 analytical methods samples 2 5 ml were taken at a given frequency from two bioreactors throughout the whole process fig 1 carboxylic acids ethanol and glucose in the samples were quantified using agilent 1260 high performance liquid chromatography hplc system agilent santa clara ca usa as described previously zhou et al 2019 also extra 2 ml samples were collected and stored at 20 c for further enzyme activity analysis and high throughput pyrosequencing the ph and conductivity in anmbrs were recorded by real time process monitoring with a ph meter mettler toledo five go columbus oh usa and a digital electrical conductivity meter mettler toledo five go switzerland the oxidation reduction potential orp was also measured with an electrode mettler toledo le 510 furthermore the activities of four key enzymes in the butyric acid type fermentation pathway acetate kinase ak butyrate kinase bk phosphotransacetylase pta and phosphotransbutyrylase ptb were assayed using the corresponding linked immunosorbent assay kit elisa kit fankel industrial co ltd shanghai china the biomass samples were firstly washed three times with sterile ultra pure water the pellet was harvested by centrifuging at 12 000 g for 10 min then it was suspended in 5 ml of 25 mm tris hcl ph 7 4 the cell suspension was sonicated and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12 000 g for 10 min the supernatant served as a cell free extract and was used for enzyme activity analysis according to the manufacturer s instruction 2 4 13c stable isotopic tracing test serum bottles 250 ml capped with butyl rubber septa and aluminum crimp were used as reactors the reactors were fed with 192 ml artificial organic wastewater and 8 ml acclimated anaerobically digested sludge the composition of artificial wastewater and fermentation conditions were the same as mentioned above besides 13c labeled inorganic carbon na2 13co3 and nah13co3 sigma aldrich were used to distinguish whether the product was derived from the fermentation of glucose or the reutilization of inorganic carbon 0 1784 g na2 13co3 and 0 1417 g nah13co3 were added to the bioreactor ⅰ the molar ratio of 13c labeled inorganic carbon to non labeled organic carbon substrate was 10 100 while 0 0892 g na2 13co3 and 0 0709 g nah13co3 were added to the bioreactor ⅱ the molar ratio of 13c labeled inorganic carbon to non labeled organic carbon substrate was 5 100 the 13c labeled inorganic carbon was not added to the control bioreactor 2 ml samples were collected from three bioreactors at 0 72 and 120 h the isotopic analysis was performed with the gas chromatography isotope ratio mass spectrometer gc irms system agilent 7890b isoprime 2 5 high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing the samples for subsequent high throughput sequencing analysis were collected from two fermentation systems at 0 85 113 5 203 237 5 260 306 5 and 347 h the total genome dna of the samples was extracted by using the cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide sodium dodecyl sulfate ctab sds method the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing service was provided by novogene co ltd beijing china the 16s rrna gene amplicons 16s v3 v4 were generated with barcoded primers 341f 5 cct ayg ggr bgc asc ag 3 and 806r 5 gga cta cnn ggg tat cta at 3 the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequences were deposited in the national center for biotechnology information ncbi sequence read archive database with an accession number of sub9376870 3 results and discussion 3 1 butyric acid production the butyric acid production and mass fraction of main products in two anaerobic membrane bioreactors during the uncoupled anmbr stage 0 85 h and ised anmbr operation stage 85 396 h are presented in fig 2 at the end of the uncoupled stage the concentration of total carboxylic acids including formic acetic propionic butyric acid etc in the broth was observed in the range of 3 40 3 49 g l in two bioreactors in this phase the main products were lactic acid and ethanol indicating the prevalence of lactic acid type fermentation afterward during the ised anmbr operation stage the highest carboxylic acid concentration reached 17 60 g l and 11 62 g l in the r1 and r2 respectively the maximum concentration of butyric acid reached 11 19 g l in the integrated bioreactor increased by 11 times from 1 04 g l during the uncoupled period the mass fraction of the butyric acid reached 76 05 of the products in the broth directly reflecting the dominance of the butyric acid type fermentation pathway this result was much higher than those achieved in previous studies for the selective production of butyric acid liu et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 for example zhang et al constructed a cathodic mixed culture electro fermentation system and introduced neutral red as an electron mediator to facilitate the extracellular electron transfer eet for enhancing butyric acid production but the highest concentration was only 5 54 g l zhang et al 2021 additionally the ba aa ratio mol mol obtained in this study reached 5 05 which was higher than the typical values i e 2 mol mol in the butyric acid type fermentation jiang et al 2018 these results demonstrated that integrated ised anmbrs can significantly boost butyric acid production during acidogenic fermentation afterward the emergence of competitive metabolic pathways like chain elongation may have great influence on the selective butyric acid production from acidogenic fermentation of organic waste as shown in fig 2 a b the accumulative production of butyric acid seems to have reached a plateau at around 200 h in two bioreactors meanwhile the fraction of butyric acid gradually decreased whereas the production of hexanoic caproic acid was observed concurrently it can be inferred that this phenomenon was greatly related to the occurrence of the secondary fermentation chain elongation ce the ce reaction occurs when there is an abundant supply of ethanol and lactic acid as precursors and there is a high enough h2 partial pressure spirito et al 2014 as shown in fig 2 c d the concentration of lactic acid gradually increased since around 200 h in both bioreactors which facilitated lactic acid as the electron donor for chain elongation the acidogenic products such as acetic and butyric acid can be used as electron acceptors coma et al 2016 besides h2 production always occurs concurrently in butyric acid type fermentation zhou et al 2018 therefore it is understandable that such a condition triggered the chain elongation reaction moreover butyric acid is theoretically considered to be a more efficient electron acceptor than acetic acid for chain elongation due to an omitted step of elongating acetic acid into butyric acid as a result the data showed that acidogenic fermentation of organic waste not only led to the production of short chain carboxylic acids but also resulted in further production of medium chain carboxylic acids which was in agreement with the previous report arslan et al 2013 contreras dávila et al 2020 zhou et al 2018 when oriented towards butyric acid production in anaerobic systems the appropriate solution should be developed accordingly to alleviate the consecutive consumption of butyric acid in chain elongation raising the broth ph proved to be an effective approach to enhancing butyric acid production as shown in fig 2 the production of butyric acid increased again at around 308 h in r1 the concentration of butyric acid in r1 reached 9 98 g l 64 31 at 361 h while the concentration of butyric acid in r2 was only 2 40 g l 24 07 through preliminary analysis of the fermentation microenvironment it was found that this phenomenon was highly attributed to the elevated ph in r1 ph 5 89 6 87 during 308 324 h fig 4 in r2 the broth ph value was always controlled below 5 5 meanwhile the elevated ph promoted the production of propionic acid in r1 this could be explained by the natural ph selecting the acrylate pathway to convert lactic acid to propionic acid rather than chain elongation to produce butyric acid caproic acid candry et al 2020 theoretically butyric acid production can be enhanced in two aspects primary fermentation and secondary fermentation fig 3 on one hand it should be due to the neutral ph condition that favored butyric acid production from glucose as a result of the accumulation of the desired microbial community structure in r1 the thermodynamic analysis showed that butyric acid production from glucose becomes more exergonic with increasing ph eq 1 kleerebezem and van loosdrecht 2010 this suggested that an elevated ph was more conducive to butyric acid production it was consistent with the opinion proposed by gonzález cabaleiro that successful microbial catabolic activities are selected by an overall maximum energy harvest rate gonzalez cabaleiro et al 2015 moreover some researchers found that butyric acid type fermentation was prevalent at ph 6 0 fu et al 2020 liu et al 2013 but almost all of them were performed in pure culture mode and inoculated with the butyric acid producer clostridium tyrobutyricum there was a contradiction about optimal ph for butyric acid production for example masset et al studied the precise effect of ph 4 7 7 3 on the product spectrum with other butyric acid producers clostridium butyricum masset et al 2010 they found that the carbon recovery in the form of butyric acid peaked at ph 4 85 and 5 2 with a percentage of 40 34 and 40 62 masset et al 2010 feng et al also reported that butyric acid fermentation was observed in mildly acidic conditions around ph 5 0 feng et al 2018 moreover it was reported that butyric acid was dominant in the distribution of vfas at ph 5 and 6 pervez et al 2022a therefore it was referred that the optimal ph for butyric acid production was also correlated to the dominated microbes within the bioreactor this hypothesis was supported by dwidar dwidar et al 2013 they pointed out that the optimum ph for individual growth and butyric acid production of bacillus strain and clostridium tyrobutyricum was 7 0 and 6 0 respectively however when the two strain was co cultured the optimal ph for butyric acid production was 5 5 microbial community dynamic succession analysis has important implications for revealing the optimal ph for butyric acid production which would be discussed further below c 6 h 12 o 6 c h 3 c h 2 c h 2 co o h 2 h 2 2 c o 2 1 δ g 0 37 c 228 19 kj mol on the other hand the increased butyric acid was possibly derived from the chain elongation in this experiment the lactic acid 1 79 g l present in the broth could act as an electron donor involved in the chain elongation reaction which provided energy and acetyl coa there are two routes for lactic acid elongating to butyric acid 1 chain elongation based on one cycle of reverse β oxidation and 2 linear chain elongation candry et al 2020 when without sufficient electron donors in the bioreactors the acetyl coa derived from lactic acid oxidation would flow to reverse β oxidation and convert to butyric acid as the end product rather than hexanoic acid through one cycle eq 3 4 in the second route the acetyl coa from the lactic acid oxidation process was not flowed to reverse β oxidation cycle instead it converted to butyl coa and butyric acid sequentially without the production of hexanoic acid in this study the substrate like lactic and acetic acid and product butyric acid related to the chain elongation reaction did not show a trend of one falling with the rising of another but the concentrations of both were increasing in addition butyric acid production from lactic acid becomes more exergonic with the decreasing ph this suggested that an elevated ph was not beneficial for the conversion of lactic acid to butyric acid therefore the resurgence of butyric acid production was presumably mainly associated with the contribution of glucose fermentation fig 3 in addition to ph parameters related to the fermentation microenvironment such as orp and conductivity also have important effects on the distribution of metabolites c h 3 chohco o h 2 o c h 3 co o 2 h 2 c o 2 2 δ g 0 37 c 13 67 kj mol c h 3 chohco o c h 3 co o h c h 3 c h 2 2 co o c o 2 h 2 o 3 δ g 0 37 c 99 94

important for the production of carboxylic acids from acidogenic fermentation lin et al 2021 profiles of ph and mass fraction of the butyric and acetic acid in two bioreactors throughout the operation periods are demonstrated in fig 4 in the uncoupled stage the ph in both reactors decreased from 6 76 to below 4 80 butyric acid became detectable at ph 5 55 and 5 29 in r1 and r2 respectively afterwards the broth ph of two reactors was in situ controlled at the range of ph 4 80 5 50 by ised the stability of ph in bioreactors shown in fig 4 a b during the ised anmbr operation stage suggested that our strategy was effective to regulate the proton balance in the broth this was due to the inorganic carbon ions in the initial product solution successfully exchanged with carboxylic anion and thereby introduced to the broth as a buffer reagent to regulate the proton balance in the bioreactors fig 1 since butyric and acetic acid were the typical product of the butyric acid type fermentation pathway the sum of these two metabolites could directly reflect the prevalence of butyric acid fermentation as a response to the coupling strategy the sum of the butyric and acetic acid fractions increased which can account for 94 92 of the product in the broth at 184 h this suggested that the micro environment regulated in this study was beneficial to butyric acid type fermentation however the butyric acid type fermentation was weakened to some extent at around 200 300 h due to the occurrence of chain elongation as discussed above to alleviate the consumption of butyric acid in chain elongation the appropriate solution should be developed accordingly to prevent the occurrence of chain elongation such as adjusting the partial pressure of h2 removing products in time and optimizing the micro environment to further investigate the effect of promoted ph on butyric acid production the broth ph in bioreactor r1 was promoted to 6 87 by ised as a result the percentage of typical metabolites from butyric acid type fermentation in r1 has increased again fig 4a indicating the advantage of promoted ph conditions on the butyric acid fermentation at this time moreover the value of conductivity reflects the content of free ions in the broth as shown in figure s1 the conductivity in both reactors was almost stable below 10 000 us cm at the first 200 h while it was a little higher than 10 000 us cm at the last 200 h both the improvement of carboxylic acid production and the product spectrum broadening in the broth contributed to increased conductivity this might lead to the mass production of lactic acid in the last 200 h fig 2 which was validated in the correlation heat map analysis that the abundance of lactic acid producing bacteria lactobacillus was positively related to the increased conductivity fig 8 oxidation reduction potential orp is an essential parameter related to fermentation conditions as it can reflect the existence of oxidative or reductive substances i e oxygen level within the fermentation bioreactor it can be obtained from figure s2 that orp rapidly dropped to 375 mv at 24 h indicating under fully anaerobic conditions the decreased orp with operation time was due to the consumption of a small amount of remaining oxygen by facultative anaerobes such as lactic acid bacteria it can explain the dominance of lactic acid type fermentation in the uncoupled period during the ised anmbr operation stage the ised operation made a slight periodic variation on the orp profile for example the orp before and after the first ised operation was 358 mv and 173 mv respectively the orp was then rapidly decreased to 438 mv after 5 h s fermentation due to the assumption of remaining oxygen by facultative anaerobic microbes nevertheless an early work pointed out that the fully anaerobic conditions when orp ranged from 200 to 300 mv played a negative effect on vfas production during acidogenesis yin et al 2016 instead maximal vfas yield was accomplished when orp was between 100 and 200 mv this was because the situation enabled the higher vfas yield from facultative acidogens similarly in this study the periodic ised operation leads to limited aeration conditions in bioreactors which benefit the production of carboxylic acids theoretically lower orp favors more reduced products such as butyric acid while higher orp promotes the production of more oxidized products such as lactic acid by facultative anaerobic microbes lactic acid could be elongated to butyric acid through chain elongation based on reverse β oxidation and linear conversion it is worth noting that except for the initial no gas flushing was performed to maintain the anaerobic circumstance which greatly reduced the operational cost during this process to conclude the ised anmbr integrated strategy provided the unique fermentation micro environment which was thought to be favorable for the production of butyric acid 3 3 carbon balance the ised anmbr integrated strategy not only facilitated the butyric acid type fermentation and also had a great benefit for overall carbon recovery as shown in fig 5 a the carbon conversion rate in both bioreactors was over 96 09 which was greatly higher than the reported values below 70 among them about 68 36 of carbon flowed to butyric acid throughout the whole process followed by acetic acid 13 46 in r1 due to the relatively higher lactic acid production in r2 the percentage of butyric acid recovery in r2 was slightly low 51 06 during the ised anmbr operation stage the existed carboxylate in broth was replaced by the same molar of inorganic carbon the electrode reaction in this process has nothing to do with carbon balance herein the improved carbon recovery rate may be due to the application of the closed carbon loop strategy that allows the inorganic carbon source to be used for acid production by homoacetogens fig 5b this was also proposed in a recent study that a higher acetic acid production 5 85 g l was observed with a na2co3 buffered anaerobic system dahiya and mohan 2019 to further confirm the contribution of inorganic carbon to the promoted carbon recovery the stable isotopic tracing experiment was performed na2 13co3 and nah13co3 were supplemented as the inorganic carbon isotopic tracer to the anaerobic fermentation bioreactor with glucose as the sole organic substrate it was known that the natural abundance of 12c and 13c was 98 892 and 1 108 respectively as shown in fig 5c when without 13c labeled inorganic carbon added the abundance of 13c in the metabolic products was 1 213 1 373 which was close to the natural abundance indicating the accuracy of the analytical method when small amounts of inorganic carbon isotopic tracers the molar ratio of 13c labeled inorganic carbon to non labeled organic carbon substrate was 5 100 were added in bioreactor ⅱ the abundance of 13c in product acetic acid ethanol and butyric acid was 3 185 3 361 and 2 182 respectively this was higher than the natural abundance of 13c 1 108 it indicated the inorganic carbon was reutilized for acetic acid production and also participated in the formation of other products such as ethanol and butyric acid when the molar ratio of 13c labeled inorganic carbon to non labeled organic carbon substrate improved to 10 100 the abundance of 13c in acetic acid correspondingly reach 4 657 this once again verifies that inorganic carbon was indeed involved in acidogenic fermentation and the assimilation of inorganic carbon increased with the dosage of isotopic tracers in addition samples collected from the bioreactor ⅰ at 0 72 and 120 h were analyzed as shown in fig 5d only a trace amount of acetic acid was detected at 0 h which was derived from the inoculum and the abundance of 13c was 1 116 the relative abundance of 13c in acetic acid was the highest at 72 h which was 5 026 the abundance of 13c in major metabolites hardly changed from 72 h to 120 h this indicated that the utilization of inorganic carbon was mainly carried out in the first 72 h interestingly the glucose was exhausted within the first 72 h during the glucose fermentation a large amount of hydrogen was usually accompanied which was also verified by gas composition analysis in this experiment this process could provide the substrates for the homoacetogenesis pathway which was conducive to the assimilation of inorganic carbon as mentioned above it can be concluded that the assimilation of inorganic carbon played an important role in enhanced carbon recovery during the fermentation process in this study 3 4 microbial community inoculum and microbial samples were analyzed to investigate the response of the microbial community to the regulated micro environment there were 505 otus detected in the inoculum while 288 otus and 390 otus were observed in the reactor r1 and r2 at 347 h r1 7 and r2 7 respectively this suggested that microbial diversity decreased with fermentation progress the shannon and chao1 index also showed a continuously decreasing trend table s1 indicating that the richness and biodiversity in both bioreactors decreased along with time these results demonstrated that the fermentation micro environment shaped in this study was beneficial for decreasing the biocomplexity of the microbial consortia which was advantageous to fermenting more simplex fermentation products in broth the top ten major dominant microbes in the two reactors were listed at the class and genus level fig 6 at the class level clostridia 67 56 bacilli 7 72 and gammaproteobacteria 7 27 were detected in the inoculum most species belonging to the classes bacilli and gammaproteobacteria were characterized by their facultative aerobic growth for example lactobacillales belongs to the bacilli class which was responsible for lactic acid production enterobacteriaceae belongs to the gammaproteobacteria class which can ferment sugars to lactic acid and various other products zhou et al 2017 during the uncoupled period the abundance of gammaproteobacteria reached 19 17 and 30 73 in r1 and r2 which could explain the consumption of remaining oxygen and decreased orp therefore a large amount of lactic acid was produced in this period during the ised anmbr operation stage as a response to the regulated micro environment the class clostridia the biggest contributor to butyric acid production became more prevalent in both reactors the highest abundance of clostridia reached 80 16 in r1 which was highly related to the increased butyric acid production in both bioreactors in the first 200 h most species belonging to clostridia are obligate anaerobes which became active when the oxygen was completely depleted the increased obligated anaerobes also verified the anaerobic environment in two bioreactors which coincides with the orp profile figure s2 at the genus level genus clostridium sensu stricto 1 was predominant in the inoculum with an abundance of 35 37 during the ised anmbr operation stage the abundance of clostridium sensu stricto 1 decreased with time in both reactors the percentage was 10 41 10 81 in two bioreactors at the end alternatively clostridium sensu stricto 11 was greatly enriched and showed a tendency of rapid improvement from 0 01 inoculum to 40 18 and 24 41 in r1 and r2 at 237 5 h thus it s reasonable to assume that the contribution of clostridium sensu stricto 11 to butyric acid production was much higher than clostridium sensu stricto 1 in this research in general clostridium was chemoorganotrophic and nearly all species of the genus clostridium can produce butyric acid as a major fermentation product such as clostridium acetobutyricum clostridium sensu stricto 11 clostridium perfringens clostridium sensu stricto 1 besides some species belonging to clostridium are chemoautotrophic as well such as clostridium ljungdahlii and clostridium drakei were involved in the homoacetogensis process to produce acetic acid from h2 co2 in the wood ljungdahl pathway pan et al 2021 these homoacetogens mostly belong to the genus clostridium sensu stricto 12 surprisingly this genus was emerged and greatly enriched with the operation in two bioreactors with the highest proportion of 8 00 besides the occurrence of blautia 4 93 also provides the possibility for the homoacetogensis process in this study pan et al 2021 therefore the production of carboxylic acids was contributed by both glucose fermentation and homoacetogenesis at the species level clostridium butyricum 20 29 was highly dominated in the inoculum which then decreased to 4 82 along with the operation of the integrated system alternatively other butyric acid producers such as clostridium perfringens clostridium tyrobutyricum were enriched as a response to the ised anmbr coupling strategy the dynamic microbial community within the bioreactor could lead to the deviation of the optimal ph for butyric acid production dwidar et al 2013 in addition to homoacetogens the genus clostridium sensu stricto 12 also included the typical chain elongator clostridium kluyveri which was responsible for hexanoic acid production from acetic butyric acid due to the distinctive demand of this strain for inorganic carbon it was considered that the periodic introduction of inorganic carbon in this study was advantageous for the emerging and growth of chain elongation related functional microbe cavalcante et al 2017 besides the relative abundance of caproiciproducens increased in both reactors with the highest percentage of 34 69 caproiciproducens belong to the ruminococcaceae family and were capable of using lactate and sugars for chain elongation in which the short chain carboxylic acids such as acetic acid were elongated by the sequential addition of two carbon units derived from acetyl coa such as acetic acid to butyric acid and butyric acid to hexanoic acid contreras dávila et al 2020 zagrodnik et al 2020 the increased abundance of these two genera was responsible for the occurrence of hexanoic acid from the chain elongation process this was similar to the early report in which hydrolysis acidification and chain elongation occurred sequentially during food waste fermentation contreras dávila et al 2020 they found that hexanoic acid was formed while lactic acid was consumed at ph 4 7 5 3 which was closed to the condition in this study therefore it can be inferred that the chain elongation reaction occurred and further affected the product spectrum furthermore the relationship between environmental factors with different microbial consortia at the genus level was investigated according to the correlation heat map analysis presented in fig 7 the two genera faecalibacterium and lachnoclostridium belonging to the class clostridia were significantly positively associated with butyric acid production in addition clostridium sensu stricto 11 also had a positive impact on both acetic and butyric acid production in addition lactobacillus was positively related to the increased conductivity the variance partitioning canonical correspondence analysis could specify the contribution of each environmental factor to the variation of the microbial community the result showed that a percentage of 47 13 of dynamic variation of the microbial community can be explained by the broth ph while about 52 87 was associated with the concentration of carboxylic acids including acetic butyric and lactic acid this result illustrated that the concentration of carboxylic acid and broth ph were both crucial for the succession of the microbiome in bioreactors 3 5 proposed metabolic pathway a possible related fermentation metabolic pathway in this study was proposed fig 8 three types of metabolisms were involved in the whole process 1 the metabolic pathway ⅰ mainly refers to the production of short chain carboxylic acids from glucose fermentation 2 the metabolic pathway ⅱ the production of acetic acid from the homoacetogensis process 3 the metabolic pathway ⅲ the production of medium chain carboxylic acids from microbial chain elongation process in this experiment butyric acid was the target product in addition to the typical butyric acid metabolic pathway from glucose fermentation butyric acid could also be produced through chain elongation process the unique chain elongation process occurs when there is an abundant supply of electron donors e g lactic acid and electron acceptors e g acetic acid as well as a high enough h2 partial pressure spirito et al 2014 when acetic acid was the electron acceptor the acetyl coa derived from lactic acid oxidation would flow to reverse β oxidation and convert to butyric acid furthermore the experimental results showed that the homoacetogensis also promoted the production of carboxylic acids meanwhile homoacetogensis can also be regarded as a c1 to c2 chain elongation pathway with h2 as an electron donor lactic acid type fermentation was dominant due to the presence of a small amount of oxygen in the broth and the existence of lactic acid producing bacteria derived from the inoculum in the uncoupled period afterward the ised anmbr integrating strategy alleviated the product inhibition and buffered the broth ph which offered the desired micro environment for the butyric acid producers i e clostridium as shown in fig 8 during butyric acid type fermentation the diversions of acetyl coa were the key process which includes 1 acetic acid production acetyl coa was converted to acetyl phosphate assisted by pta and the acetyl phosphate was subsequently utilized to produce acetic acid by ak 2 butyric acid production acetyl coa was converted to butyryl coa then turned to butyryl phosphate and butyric acid sequentially catalyzed by ptb and bk respectively jiang et al 2018 therefore acetic acid was always produced as a byproduct in butyric acid type fermentation the activities of bk were much low than those of ptb in investigated samples which suggested that the reaction of butyryl phosphate to butyric acid was the rate limiting step overall the activities of pta and ak showed a slightly decreasing trend while the activities of ptb and bk increased along the operation which was consistent with the product spectrum the highest enzyme activities of ptb and bk were detected in sample t1 2 which were 1048 16 and 417 46 u l fig 8 respectively in addition the inorganic carbon was introduced into the broth by ised and subsequently participated in acid production through the wood ljungdahl pathway by homoacetogens in this pathway the metabolic pathway ⅱ the methyl group was combined with the carbonyl branch to produce acetyl coa which acts as a key node for the production of carboxylic acids due to its intersection with many metabolic pathways and transformations shi and tu 2015 therefore the metabolic pathway ⅱ was also favorable for strengthening the metabolic pathways related to acetyl coa like butyric acid type fermentation this was supported by the result of the stable isotope experiment as shown in fig 8 the relative abundance of 13c in the main metabolites e g butyric acid was greatly higher than that in the natural samples 1 11 at the later stage of the experiment due to the enrichment of chain elongation related microbes the short chain carboxylic acids such as acetic acid or butyric acid were elongated into hexanoic acid when lactic acid ethanol glucose acted as the electron donors as shown in the metabolic pathway iii in conclusion the closed carbon loop strategy enabled the simultaneous removal of carboxylic acid and the introduction of inorganic carbon which resulted in the significant strengthening of the butyric acid metabolic pathway during acidogenic fermentation conclusions we developed the ised anmbr coupling system for the selective production of butyric acid and reutilization of acidogenic off gasses during acidogenic fermentation it shaped the unique micro environment and drove the mixed culture fermentation towards a certain product or combination of carboxylic acids the results indicated that the mass fraction of butyric acid was significantly enhanced to 76 05 while the concentration of butyric acid was 11 17 times that of the uncoupled period clostridia with the capability of butyric acid producing and homoacetogenesis dominated 80 16 the reactors advanced isotope and metabolic analyses supported the hypothesis of a combination of three pathways that led to high butyric acid production in the coupled system this study provides a new approach for organic waste valorization into more tailored and higher value products through further exploration of parameters and optimization of systematic design it is expected more tunable fermentation products and higher titer and yield could be achieved in such processes further study is

15350,selective production of carboxylic acids cas from mixed culture fermentation remains a difficult task in organic waste valorization herein we developed a facile and sustainable carbon loop strategy to regulate the fermentation micro environment and steer acidogenesis towards selective butyric acid production this new ion substitution electrodialysis anaerobic membrane bioreactor ised anmbr integrated system demonstrated a high butyric acid production at 11 19 g l with a mass fraction of 76 05 in comparison only 1 04 g l with a mass fraction of 30 56 was observed in the uncoupled control reactor the carbon recovery reached a maximum of 96 09 with the assistance of ised inorganic carbon assimilation was believed to be an important contributor which was verified by 13c isotopic tracing microbial community structure shows the dominance of clostridia 80 16 in the unique micro environment e g ph 4 80 5 50 controlled by ised which is believed beneficial to the growth of such fermentative bacteria with main products of butyric acid and acetic acid in addition the emergence of chain elongators such as clostridium sensu stricto 12 was observed to have a great influence on butyric acid production this work provides a new approach to generate tailored longer chain carboxylic acids from organic waste with high titer thus contributing to a circular economy graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords acidogenic fermentation inorganic carbon anaerobic membrane bioreactor electrodialysis closed carbon loop 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad has been widely used in resource and energy recovery from organic waste james et al 2021 yan et al 2020 in recent decades efforts have been devoted to energy recovery in the form of biogas kainthola et al 2020 however concerns on low value and climate change due to fugitive emissions of potent greenhouse gas methane and carbon dioxide make such conversion less attractive jones et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 alternatively short chain carboxylic acids sccas such as acetic acid propionic acid and butyric acid are valuable platform chemicals generated in the acidogenic stage bhatt et al 2020 among sccas butyric acid is considered an important commodity chemical with a relatively high market price of 2000 2500 usd t which is much higher than that of acetic acid 400 900 usd t bastidas oyanedel et al 2019 additionally butyric acid has much bigger market potential and broader applications as the feedstock or intermediate in the chemical food and pharmaceutical industries to date industrial butyric acid is mainly produced through chemical synthesis from petroleum based feedstocks e g propylene and butyraldehyde jiang et al 2018 undoubtedly targeted production of bio butyric acid is a promising alternative strategy that carries multiple benefits to reduce fossil fuel use upgrade ad products and reduce fugitive carbon emissions it can greatly alleviate the demand for petroleum derived butyric acid production while achieving waste reduction resource recovery and reduced carbon emission mixed culture fermentation plays an important role in facilitating the production of biofuels and commodity chemicals especially from mixed organic feedstocks because it doesn t require sterilization and pre treatment and it often has economic and operational advantages over pure culture fermentation hoelzle et al 2014 however the process generates a mixture of organic acids which challenges subsequent product separation and purification pervez et al 2022b thus there is an urgent need to promote the selectivity of target chemicals with higher economic viability and butyric acid is an ideal product in this context during acidogenic fermentation the product spectrum is directly dependent on the microbes in the bioreactors which are affected by the inoculum and especially the fermentation micro environment e g temperature ph orp headspace pressure trace elements substrate type arslan et al 2013 dahiya et al 2020 jankowska et al 2017 ramos suarez et al 2021 above all ph is observed as a critical factor that determines the product spectrum in the bioreactor it can change the structure of the microbial community in the anaerobic process thereby shifting the fermentation pathway feng et al 2020a for example when the ph was extremely low i e ph 3 5 lactic acid bacteria like lactobacillus 97 55 dominated the system due to their higher tolerance ability to ph over other acid producing bacteria contributing to the selective production of lactic acid itoh et al 2012 at ph 4 5 the proportion of lactobacillus decreased to 65 54 and bifidobacterium increased significantly which contributed to increased acetic acid production when ph increased to 6 0 the co occurrence of prevotella acidaminococcus and megasphaera was observed which were responsible for mixed acid fermentation feng et al 2018 it was well acknowledged that most of the existing studies on butyric acid fermentation from organic waste were usually observed in mildly acidic conditions around ph 5 0 feng et al 2018 horiuchi et al 2002 jiang et al 2013 exogenous alkaline and bio system buffer solution addition were two prevalent methods to regulate ph and ensure system stability dahiya and mohan 2019 feng et al 2020b however alkaline usage would cause the accumulation of salt and subsequently inhibit functional microbes in the anaerobic process including acidogenesis and methanogenesis feng et al 2020b liu et al 2017 therefore a salt concentration below 6 g l in food waste was recommended for volatile fatty acids vfas generation during the fermentation of food waste liu et al 2017 moreover there are still some controversies in terms of the influences of high salt concentration on acidogenic fermentation for example it was reported that acidogens were still productive when the salt concentration exceeded 10 g l he et al 2019 nevertheless as the salt concentration increased the production of butyric acid decreased and even ceased while the propionic acid production enhanced this was because the salt tolerant microorganisms i e propionibacteria became dominant in the bioreactor once biomass was exposed to high salt concentration alternatively when the biosystem buffer strategy was applied the excessive accumulation of carboxylic acids would lead to a drastic decrement of the in situ buffering ability which directly hampered the fermentation process therefore a more appropriate method should be developed to maintain the proton balance in the bioreactor coupling ion substitution electrodialysis ised is an effective method to control the proton balance as the proper arrangement of ion exchange membranes in the electrodialysis stack results in the substitution between ions of the type without posing significant inhibitions therefore a novel closed carbon loop strategy was designed in this study in which sodium hydroxide solution saturated with acidogenic off gasses co2 was used as the ion substituting solution to exchange carboxylate in the anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr through ised thus leading to the optimization of the micro environment e g ph such an approach would greatly avoid the excessive accumulation of salt in the broth compared with the traditional acid base neutralization method furthermore the capture of acidogenic off gas co2 and further introduction to the anaerobic system in the form of carbonate bicarbonate would improve the buffer ability through carbonate equilibrium and facilitate acid production during the anaerobic process in this study we investigated the feasibility of this approach ised anmbr coupled system to steer acidogenesis toward selective butyric acid production and explored the corresponding intensification mechanisms in addition the succession of the microbial community under the scheme of in situ micro environment regulation was revealed we also proposed the possible metabolic pathways through comprehensive analyses of the product spectrum micro environment carbon balance microbial community analysis and key enzyme activities this process allows the first report on the in situ reuse of acidogenic off gasses for the selective production of butyric acid in the anaerobic fermentation system 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and operation two replicates of the fermentation system reactor 1 and 2 denoted as r1 and r2 were operated at the same time based on whether the bioreactors coupled with the ion substitution electrodialysis part the whole operation process was divided into two different stages the uncoupled anmbr only stage 0 85 h and the coupled ised anmbr operation stage 85 396 h as shown in fig 1 the ion substitution electrodialysis anaerobic membrane bioreactor ised anmbr integrated system consisted of two functional zones the tailored anaerobic membrane bioreactor zone for acid production and biomass retention and the ion substitution electrodialysis zone for substitution of the carboxylic anion with inorganic carbon anion the anaerobic membrane bioreactor was a cylinder shape with a diameter of 10 cm and a height of 12 cm the customized filtration modules assembled with commercial hydrophobic flat sheet membrane polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe anow co ltd china were submerged in the broth with a pore size of 0 45 µm and a total filtration area of 0 031 m2 the electrodialysis stack and the ion exchange membranes were bought from hefei chemjoy polymer material co ltd hefei china during the ised anmbr operation stage a certain volume half or two thirds of fermentation broth was taken out from anmbrs for ised operation with a peristaltic pump yz1515x a baoding longer precision pump co ltd china when the broth ph was below 4 80 brown arrow the biomass was retained by the ptfe membrane module while permeate was collected in the glass reservoir b and subsequently pumped to the ised feed loop when the ph rose to the desired value the ised operation was stopped immediately and the fermentation broth was returned to the anaerobic bioreactor functioned as the back washing procedure black arrow afterwards the flow channels of the electrodialysis stacks were cleaned with deionized water the arrangement of ion exchange membranes in the ion substitution electrodialysis stack was described in fig 1 once applying an electrical potential between two electrodes the anions i e dissociated carboxylic acids in the left broth compartment were transported through the anion exchange membrane and migrated towards the product chamber at the same time the anions i e oh co3 2 and hco3 in the product chamber migrated towards the right broth compartment to maintain the electroneutrality of the product chamber and were then introduced into the bioreactor dashed blue arrow thus the simultaneous substitution of the carboxylic acid with basic anion and inorganic carbon was achieved in addition the cations in the left broth compartment were transported through the cation exchange membrane to the cathode chamber since the cathode and anode chamber shared the same electrolyze solution 0 2 m na2so4 the cations were then back to the broth compartments through the cation exchange membrane on the right in this study two cell pairs were applied in addition to those shown in the upper left corner of fig 1 with two more pieces of anion exchange membranes aem and one more piece of cation exchange membranes cem arranged between the anode and cathode a current of 1 a was selected during all ised experiments the initial product solution p simulates acidogenic off gas co2 sequestration with sodium hydroxide solution the volume and circulation flow rate of the product solution and electrode rinsing solution was kept the same as that of the feed solution b all operations in the two bioreactors remained the same in the first 306 5 h at 308 h the broth ph in r1 was promoted to 6 87 by ised while the broth ph in r2 was still maintained at ph 4 80 5 50 to investigate the effect of promoted ph on the product spectrum 2 2 inoculum and artificial wastewater an acclimated anaerobic sludge 4 v v od600 1 80 was inoculated in both bioreactors artificial organic wastewater was used as the substrate which contained g l glucose 5 00 kh2po4 0 23 yeast extract 1 00 nh4cl 0 45 and trace element solution 10 mm of sodium 2 bromoethanesulfonate bes was supplemented into bioreactors as a methanogenesis inhibitor in addition a 0 05 m phosphate buffer solution was initially added to two bioreactors then the reactors were flushed with n2 to ensure the anaerobic condition and then cultured in a 37 c incubator at the shaking speed of 100 rpm the experiment was carried out in a fed batch mode in the uncoupled stage the substrate was supplied every two days by injecting 20 ml of concentrated stock solutions to meet a final glucose concentration of 5 00 g l during the ised anmbr operation stage the concentrated stock solution was supplemented every day due to an obvious increment in substrate consumption 2 3 analytical methods samples 2 5 ml were taken at a given frequency from two bioreactors throughout the whole process fig 1 carboxylic acids ethanol and glucose in the samples were quantified using agilent 1260 high performance liquid chromatography hplc system agilent santa clara ca usa as described previously zhou et al 2019 also extra 2 ml samples were collected and stored at 20 c for further enzyme activity analysis and high throughput pyrosequencing the ph and conductivity in anmbrs were recorded by real time process monitoring with a ph meter mettler toledo five go columbus oh usa and a digital electrical conductivity meter mettler toledo five go switzerland the oxidation reduction potential orp was also measured with an electrode mettler toledo le 510 furthermore the activities of four key enzymes in the butyric acid type fermentation pathway acetate kinase ak butyrate kinase bk phosphotransacetylase pta and phosphotransbutyrylase ptb were assayed using the corresponding linked immunosorbent assay kit elisa kit fankel industrial co ltd shanghai china the biomass samples were firstly washed three times with sterile ultra pure water the pellet was harvested by centrifuging at 12 000 g for 10 min then it was suspended in 5 ml of 25 mm tris hcl ph 7 4 the cell suspension was sonicated and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12 000 g for 10 min the supernatant served as a cell free extract and was used for enzyme activity analysis according to the manufacturer s instruction 2 4 13c stable isotopic tracing test serum bottles 250 ml capped with butyl rubber septa and aluminum crimp were used as reactors the reactors were fed with 192 ml artificial organic wastewater and 8 ml acclimated anaerobically digested sludge the composition of artificial wastewater and fermentation conditions were the same as mentioned above besides 13c labeled inorganic carbon na2 13co3 and nah13co3 sigma aldrich were used to distinguish whether the product was derived from the fermentation of glucose or the reutilization of inorganic carbon 0 1784 g na2 13co3 and 0 1417 g nah13co3 were added to the bioreactor ⅰ the molar ratio of 13c labeled inorganic carbon to non labeled organic carbon substrate was 10 100 while 0 0892 g na2 13co3 and 0 0709 g nah13co3 were added to the bioreactor ⅱ the molar ratio of 13c labeled inorganic carbon to non labeled organic carbon substrate was 5 100 the 13c labeled inorganic carbon was not added to the control bioreactor 2 ml samples were collected from three bioreactors at 0 72 and 120 h the isotopic analysis was performed with the gas chromatography isotope ratio mass spectrometer gc irms system agilent 7890b isoprime 2 5 high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing the samples for subsequent high throughput sequencing analysis were collected from two fermentation systems at 0 85 113

tat cta at 3 the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequences were deposited in the national center for biotechnology information ncbi sequence read archive database with an accession number of sub9376870 3 results and discussion 3 1 butyric acid production the butyric acid production and mass fraction of main products in two anaerobic membrane bioreactors during the uncoupled anmbr stage 0 85 h and ised anmbr operation stage 85 396 h are presented in fig 2 at the end of the uncoupled stage the concentration of total carboxylic acids including formic acetic propionic butyric acid etc in the broth was observed in the range of 3 40 3 49 g l in two bioreactors in this phase the main products were lactic acid and ethanol indicating the prevalence of lactic acid type fermentation afterward during the ised anmbr operation stage the highest carboxylic acid concentration reached 17 60 g l and 11 62 g l in the r1 and r2 respectively the maximum concentration of butyric acid reached 11 19 g l in the integrated bioreactor increased by 11 times from 1 04 g l during the uncoupled period the mass fraction of the butyric acid reached 76 05 of the products in the broth directly reflecting the dominance of the butyric acid type fermentation pathway this result was much higher than those achieved in previous studies for the selective production of butyric acid liu et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 for example zhang et al constructed a cathodic mixed culture electro fermentation system and introduced neutral red as an electron mediator to facilitate the extracellular electron transfer eet for enhancing butyric acid production but the highest concentration was only 5 54 g l zhang et al 2021 additionally the ba aa ratio mol mol obtained in this study reached 5 05 which was higher than the typical values i e 2 mol mol in the butyric acid type fermentation jiang et al 2018 these results demonstrated that integrated ised anmbrs can significantly boost butyric acid production during acidogenic fermentation afterward the emergence of competitive metabolic pathways like chain elongation may have great influence on the selective butyric acid production from acidogenic fermentation of organic waste as shown in fig 2 a b the accumulative production of butyric acid seems to have reached a plateau at around 200 h in two bioreactors meanwhile the fraction of butyric acid gradually decreased whereas the production of hexanoic caproic acid was observed concurrently it can be inferred that this phenomenon was greatly related to the occurrence of the secondary fermentation chain elongation ce the ce reaction occurs when there is an abundant supply of ethanol and lactic acid as precursors and there is a high enough h2 partial pressure spirito et al 2014 as shown in fig 2 c d the concentration of lactic acid gradually increased since around 200 h in both bioreactors which facilitated lactic acid as the electron donor for chain elongation the acidogenic products such as acetic and butyric acid can be used as electron acceptors coma et al 2016 besides h2 production always occurs concurrently in butyric acid type fermentation zhou et al 2018 therefore it is understandable that such a condition triggered the chain elongation reaction moreover butyric acid is theoretically considered to be a more efficient electron acceptor than acetic acid for chain elongation due to an omitted step of elongating acetic acid into butyric acid as a result the data showed that acidogenic fermentation of organic waste not only led to the production of short chain carboxylic acids but also resulted in further production of medium chain carboxylic acids which was in agreement with the previous report arslan et al 2013 contreras dávila et al 2020 zhou et al 2018 when oriented towards butyric acid production in anaerobic systems the appropriate solution should be developed accordingly to alleviate the consecutive consumption of butyric acid in chain elongation raising the broth ph proved to be an effective approach to enhancing butyric acid production as shown in fig 2 the production of butyric acid increased again at around 308 h in r1 the concentration of butyric acid in r1 reached 9 98 g l 64 31 at 361 h while the concentration of butyric acid in r2 was only 2 40 g l 24 07 through preliminary analysis of the fermentation microenvironment it was found that this phenomenon was highly attributed to the elevated ph in r1 ph 5 89 6 87 during 308 324 h fig 4 in r2 the broth ph value was always controlled below 5 5 meanwhile the elevated ph promoted the production of propionic acid in r1 this could be explained by the natural ph selecting the acrylate pathway to convert lactic acid to propionic acid rather than chain elongation to produce butyric acid caproic acid candry et al 2020 theoretically butyric acid production can be enhanced in two aspects primary fermentation and secondary fermentation fig 3 on one hand it should be due to the neutral ph condition that favored butyric acid production from glucose as a result of the accumulation of the desired microbial community structure in r1 the thermodynamic analysis showed that butyric acid production from glucose becomes more exergonic with increasing ph eq 1 kleerebezem and van loosdrecht 2010 this suggested that an elevated ph was more conducive to butyric acid production it was consistent with the opinion proposed by gonzález cabaleiro that successful microbial catabolic activities are selected by an overall maximum energy harvest rate gonzalez cabaleiro et al 2015 moreover some researchers found that butyric acid type fermentation was prevalent at ph 6 0 fu et al 2020 liu et al 2013 but almost all of them were performed in pure culture mode and inoculated with the butyric acid producer clostridium tyrobutyricum there was a contradiction about optimal ph for butyric acid production for example masset et al studied the precise effect of ph 4 7 7 3 on the product spectrum with other butyric acid producers clostridium butyricum masset et al 2010 they found that the carbon recovery in the form of butyric acid peaked at ph 4 85 and 5 2 with a percentage of 40 34 and 40 62 masset et al 2010 feng et al also reported that butyric acid fermentation was observed in mildly acidic conditions around ph 5 0 feng et al 2018 moreover it was reported that butyric acid was dominant in the distribution of vfas at ph 5 and 6 pervez et al 2022a therefore it was referred that the optimal ph for butyric acid production was also correlated to the dominated microbes within the bioreactor this hypothesis was supported by dwidar dwidar et al 2013 they pointed out that the optimum ph for individual growth and butyric acid production of bacillus strain and clostridium tyrobutyricum was 7 0 and 6 0 respectively however when the two strain was co cultured the optimal ph for butyric acid production was 5 5 microbial community dynamic succession analysis has important implications for revealing the optimal ph for butyric acid production which would be discussed further below c 6 h 12 o 6 c h 3 c h 2 c h 2 co o h 2 h 2 2 c o 2 1 δ g 0 37 c 228 19 kj mol on the other hand the increased butyric acid was possibly derived from the chain elongation in this experiment the lactic acid 1 79 g l present in the broth could act as an electron donor involved in the chain elongation reaction which provided energy and acetyl coa there are two routes for lactic acid elongating to butyric acid 1 chain elongation based on one cycle of reverse β oxidation and 2 linear chain elongation candry et al 2020 when without sufficient electron donors in the bioreactors the acetyl coa derived from lactic acid oxidation would flow to reverse β oxidation and convert to butyric acid as the end product rather than hexanoic acid through one cycle eq 3 4 in the second route the acetyl coa from the lactic acid oxidation process was not flowed to reverse β oxidation cycle instead it converted to butyl coa and butyric acid sequentially without the production of hexanoic acid in this study the substrate like lactic and acetic acid and product butyric acid related to the chain elongation reaction did not show a trend of one falling with the rising of another but the concentrations of both were increasing in addition butyric acid production from lactic acid becomes more exergonic with the decreasing ph this suggested that an elevated ph was not beneficial for the conversion of lactic acid to butyric acid therefore the resurgence of butyric acid production was presumably mainly associated with the contribution of glucose fermentation fig 3 in addition to ph parameters related to the fermentation microenvironment such as orp and conductivity also have

periods are demonstrated in fig 4 in the uncoupled stage the ph in both reactors decreased from 6 76 to below 4 80 butyric acid became detectable at ph 5 55 and 5 29 in r1 and r2 respectively afterwards the broth ph of two reactors was in situ controlled at the range of ph 4 80 5 50 by ised the stability of ph in bioreactors shown in fig 4 a b during the ised anmbr operation stage suggested that our strategy was effective to regulate the proton balance in the broth this was due to the inorganic carbon ions in the initial product solution successfully exchanged with carboxylic anion and thereby introduced to the broth as a buffer reagent to regulate the proton balance in the bioreactors fig 1 since butyric and acetic acid were the typical product of the butyric acid type fermentation pathway the sum of these two metabolites could directly reflect the prevalence of butyric acid fermentation as a response to the coupling strategy the sum of the butyric and acetic acid fractions increased which can account for 94 92 of the product in the broth at 184 h this suggested that the micro environment regulated in this study was beneficial to butyric acid type fermentation however the butyric acid type fermentation was weakened to some extent at around 200 300 h due to the occurrence of chain elongation as discussed above to alleviate the consumption of butyric acid in chain elongation the appropriate solution should be developed accordingly to prevent the occurrence of chain elongation such as adjusting the partial pressure of h2 removing products in time and optimizing the micro environment to further investigate the effect of promoted ph on butyric acid production the broth ph in bioreactor r1 was promoted to 6 87 by ised as a result the percentage of typical metabolites from butyric acid type fermentation in r1 has increased again fig 4a indicating the advantage of promoted ph conditions on the butyric acid fermentation at this time moreover the value of conductivity reflects the content of free ions in the broth as shown in figure s1 the conductivity in both reactors was almost stable below 10 000 us cm at the first 200 h while it was a little higher than 10 000 us cm at the last 200 h both the improvement of carboxylic acid production and the product spectrum broadening in the broth contributed to increased conductivity this might lead to the mass production of lactic acid in the last 200 h fig 2 which was validated in the correlation heat map analysis that the abundance of lactic acid producing bacteria lactobacillus was positively related to the increased conductivity fig 8 oxidation reduction potential orp is an essential parameter related to fermentation conditions as it can reflect the existence of oxidative or reductive substances i e oxygen level within the fermentation bioreactor it can be obtained from figure s2 that orp rapidly dropped to 375 mv at 24 h indicating under fully anaerobic conditions the decreased orp with operation time was due to the consumption of a small amount of remaining oxygen by facultative anaerobes such as lactic acid bacteria it can explain the dominance of lactic acid type fermentation in the uncoupled period during the ised anmbr operation stage the ised operation made a slight periodic variation on the orp profile for example the orp before and after the first ised operation was 358 mv and 173 mv respectively the orp was then rapidly decreased to 438 mv after 5 h s fermentation due to the assumption of remaining oxygen by facultative anaerobic microbes nevertheless an early work pointed out that the fully anaerobic conditions when orp ranged from 200 to 300 mv played a negative effect on vfas production during acidogenesis yin et al 2016 instead maximal vfas yield was accomplished when orp was between 100 and 200 mv this was because the situation enabled the higher vfas yield from facultative acidogens similarly in this study the periodic ised operation leads to limited aeration conditions in bioreactors which benefit the production of carboxylic acids theoretically lower orp favors more reduced products such as butyric acid while higher orp promotes the production of more oxidized products such as lactic acid by facultative anaerobic microbes lactic acid could be elongated to butyric acid through chain elongation based on reverse β oxidation and linear conversion it is worth noting that except for the initial no gas flushing was performed to maintain the anaerobic circumstance which greatly reduced the operational cost during this process to conclude the ised anmbr integrated strategy provided the unique fermentation micro environment which was thought to be favorable for the production of butyric acid 3 3 carbon balance the ised anmbr integrated strategy not only facilitated the butyric acid type fermentation and also had a great benefit for overall carbon recovery as shown in fig 5 a the carbon conversion rate in both bioreactors was over 96 09 which was greatly higher than the reported values below 70 among them about 68 36 of carbon flowed to butyric acid throughout the whole process followed by acetic acid 13 46 in r1 due to the relatively higher lactic acid production in r2 the percentage of butyric acid recovery in r2 was slightly low 51 06 during the ised anmbr operation stage the existed carboxylate in broth was replaced by the same molar of inorganic carbon the electrode reaction in this process has nothing to do with carbon balance herein the improved carbon recovery rate may be due to the application of the closed carbon loop strategy that allows the inorganic carbon source to be used for acid production by homoacetogens fig 5b this was also proposed in a recent study that a higher acetic acid production 5 85 g l was observed with a na2co3 buffered anaerobic system dahiya and mohan 2019 to further confirm the contribution of inorganic carbon to the promoted carbon recovery the stable isotopic tracing experiment was performed na2 13co3 and nah13co3 were supplemented as the inorganic carbon isotopic tracer to the anaerobic fermentation bioreactor with glucose as the sole organic substrate it was known that the natural abundance of 12c and 13c was 98 892 and 1 108 respectively as shown in fig 5c when without 13c labeled inorganic carbon added the abundance of 13c in the metabolic products was 1 213 1 373 which was close to the natural abundance indicating the accuracy of the analytical method when small amounts of inorganic carbon isotopic tracers the molar ratio of 13c labeled inorganic carbon to non labeled organic carbon substrate was 5 100 were added in bioreactor ⅱ the abundance of 13c in product acetic acid ethanol and butyric acid was 3 185 3 361 and 2 182 respectively this was higher than the natural abundance of 13c 1 108 it indicated the inorganic carbon was reutilized for acetic acid production and also participated in the formation of other products such as ethanol and butyric acid when the molar ratio of 13c labeled inorganic carbon to non labeled organic carbon substrate improved to 10 100 the abundance of 13c in acetic acid correspondingly reach 4 657 this once again verifies that inorganic carbon was indeed involved in acidogenic fermentation and the assimilation of inorganic carbon increased with the dosage of isotopic tracers in addition samples collected from the bioreactor ⅰ at 0 72 and 120 h were analyzed as shown in fig 5d only a trace amount of acetic acid was detected at 0 h which was derived from the inoculum and the abundance of 13c was 1 116 the relative abundance of 13c in acetic acid was the highest at 72 h which was 5 026 the abundance of 13c in major metabolites hardly changed from 72 h to 120 h this indicated that the utilization of inorganic carbon was mainly carried out in the first 72 h interestingly the glucose was exhausted within the first 72 h during the glucose fermentation a large amount of hydrogen was usually accompanied which was also verified by gas composition analysis in this experiment this process could provide the substrates for the homoacetogenesis pathway which was conducive to the assimilation of inorganic carbon as mentioned above it can be concluded that the assimilation of inorganic carbon played an important role in enhanced carbon recovery during the fermentation process in this study 3 4 microbial community inoculum and microbial samples were analyzed to investigate the response of the microbial community to the regulated micro environment there were 505 otus detected in the inoculum while 288 otus and 390 otus were observed in the reactor r1 and r2 at 347 h r1 7 and r2 7 respectively this suggested that microbial diversity decreased with fermentation progress the shannon and chao1 index also showed a continuously decreasing trend table s1 indicating that the richness and biodiversity in both bioreactors decreased along with time these results demonstrated that the fermentation micro environment shaped in this study was beneficial for decreasing the biocomplexity of the microbial consortia which was advantageous to fermenting more simplex fermentation products in broth the top ten major dominant microbes in the two reactors were listed at the class and genus level fig 6 at the class level clostridia 67 56 bacilli 7 72 and gammaproteobacteria 7 27 were detected in the inoculum most species belonging to the classes bacilli and gammaproteobacteria were characterized by their facultative aerobic growth for example lactobacillales belongs to the bacilli class which was responsible for lactic acid production enterobacteriaceae belongs to the gammaproteobacteria class which can ferment sugars to lactic acid and various other products zhou et al 2017 during the uncoupled period the abundance of gammaproteobacteria reached 19 17 and 30 73 in r1 and r2 which could explain the consumption of remaining oxygen and decreased orp therefore a large amount of lactic acid was produced in this period during the ised anmbr operation stage as a response to the regulated micro environment the class clostridia the biggest contributor to butyric acid production became more prevalent in both reactors the highest abundance of clostridia reached 80 16 in r1 which was highly related to the increased butyric acid production in both bioreactors in the first 200 h most species belonging to clostridia are obligate anaerobes which became active when the oxygen was completely depleted the increased obligated anaerobes also verified the anaerobic environment in two bioreactors which coincides with the orp profile figure s2 at the genus level genus clostridium sensu stricto 1 was predominant in the inoculum with an abundance of 35 37 during the ised anmbr operation stage the abundance of clostridium sensu stricto 1 decreased with time in both reactors the percentage was 10 41 10 81 in two bioreactors at the end alternatively clostridium sensu stricto 11 was greatly enriched and showed a tendency of rapid improvement from 0 01 inoculum to 40 18 and 24 41 in r1 and r2 at 237 5 h thus it s reasonable to assume that the contribution of clostridium sensu stricto 11 to butyric acid production was much higher than clostridium sensu stricto 1 in this research in general clostridium was chemoorganotrophic and nearly all species of the genus clostridium can produce butyric acid as a major fermentation product such as clostridium acetobutyricum clostridium sensu stricto 11 clostridium perfringens clostridium sensu stricto 1 besides some species belonging to clostridium are chemoautotrophic as well such as clostridium ljungdahlii and clostridium drakei were involved in the homoacetogensis process to produce acetic acid from h2 co2 in the wood ljungdahl pathway pan et al 2021 these homoacetogens mostly belong to the genus clostridium sensu stricto 12 surprisingly this genus was emerged and greatly enriched with the operation in two bioreactors with the highest proportion of 8 00 besides the occurrence of blautia 4 93 also provides the possibility for the homoacetogensis process in this study pan et al 2021 therefore the production of carboxylic acids was contributed by both glucose fermentation and homoacetogenesis at the species level clostridium butyricum 20 29 was highly dominated in the inoculum which then decreased to 4 82 along with the operation of the integrated system alternatively other butyric acid producers such as clostridium perfringens clostridium tyrobutyricum were enriched as a response to the ised anmbr coupling strategy the dynamic microbial community within the bioreactor could lead to the deviation of the optimal ph for butyric acid production dwidar et al 2013 in addition to homoacetogens the genus clostridium sensu stricto 12 also included the typical chain elongator clostridium kluyveri which was responsible for hexanoic acid production from acetic butyric acid due to the distinctive demand of this strain for inorganic carbon it was considered that the periodic introduction of inorganic carbon in this study was advantageous for the emerging and growth of chain elongation related functional microbe cavalcante et al 2017 besides the relative abundance of caproiciproducens increased in both reactors with the highest percentage of 34 69 caproiciproducens belong to the ruminococcaceae family and were capable of using lactate and sugars for chain elongation in which the short chain carboxylic acids such as acetic acid were elongated by the sequential addition of two carbon units derived from acetyl coa such as acetic acid to butyric acid and butyric acid to hexanoic acid contreras dávila et al 2020 zagrodnik et al 2020 the increased abundance of these two genera was responsible for the occurrence of hexanoic acid from the chain elongation process this was similar to the early report in which hydrolysis acidification and chain elongation occurred sequentially during food waste fermentation contreras dávila et al 2020 they found that hexanoic acid was formed while lactic acid was consumed at ph 4 7 5 3 which was closed to the condition in this study therefore it can be inferred that the chain elongation reaction occurred and further affected the product spectrum furthermore the relationship between environmental factors with different microbial consortia at the genus level was investigated according to the correlation heat map analysis presented in fig 7 the two genera faecalibacterium and lachnoclostridium belonging to the class clostridia were significantly positively associated with butyric acid production in addition clostridium sensu stricto 11 also had a positive impact on both acetic and butyric acid production in addition lactobacillus was positively related to the increased conductivity the variance partitioning canonical correspondence analysis could specify the contribution of each environmental factor to the variation of the microbial community the result showed that a percentage of 47 13 of dynamic variation of the microbial community can be explained by the broth ph while about 52 87 was associated with the concentration of carboxylic acids including acetic butyric and lactic acid this result illustrated that the concentration of carboxylic acid and broth ph were both crucial for the succession of the microbiome in bioreactors 3 5 proposed metabolic pathway a possible related fermentation metabolic pathway in this study was proposed fig 8 three types of metabolisms were involved in the whole process 1 the metabolic pathway ⅰ mainly refers to the production of short chain carboxylic acids from glucose fermentation 2 the metabolic pathway ⅱ the production of acetic acid from the homoacetogensis process 3 the metabolic pathway ⅲ the production of medium chain carboxylic acids from microbial chain elongation process in this experiment butyric acid was the target product in addition to the typical butyric acid metabolic pathway from glucose fermentation butyric acid could also be produced through chain elongation process the unique chain elongation process occurs when there is an abundant supply of electron donors e g lactic acid and electron acceptors e g acetic acid as well as a high enough h2 partial pressure spirito et al 2014 when acetic acid was the electron acceptor the acetyl coa derived from lactic acid oxidation would flow to reverse β oxidation and convert to butyric acid furthermore the experimental results showed that the homoacetogensis also promoted the production of carboxylic acids meanwhile homoacetogensis can also be regarded as a c1 to c2 chain elongation pathway with h2 as an electron donor lactic acid type fermentation was dominant due to the presence of a small amount of oxygen in the broth and the existence of lactic acid producing bacteria derived from the inoculum in the uncoupled period afterward the ised anmbr integrating strategy alleviated the product inhibition and buffered the broth ph which offered the desired micro environment for the butyric acid producers i e clostridium as shown in fig 8 during butyric acid type fermentation the diversions of acetyl coa were the key process which includes 1 acetic acid production acetyl coa was converted to acetyl phosphate assisted by pta and the acetyl phosphate was subsequently utilized to produce acetic acid by ak 2 butyric acid production acetyl coa was converted to butyryl coa then turned to butyryl phosphate and butyric acid sequentially catalyzed by ptb and bk respectively jiang et al 2018 therefore acetic acid was always produced as a byproduct in butyric acid type fermentation the activities of bk were much low than those of ptb in investigated samples which suggested that the reaction of butyryl phosphate to butyric acid was the rate limiting step overall the activities of pta and ak showed a slightly decreasing trend while the activities of ptb and bk increased along the operation which was consistent with the product spectrum the highest enzyme activities of ptb and bk were detected in sample t1 2 which were 1048 16 and 417 46 u l fig 8 respectively in addition the inorganic carbon was introduced into the broth by ised and subsequently participated in acid production through the wood ljungdahl pathway by homoacetogens in this pathway the metabolic pathway ⅱ the methyl group was combined with the carbonyl branch to produce acetyl coa which acts as a key node for the production of carboxylic acids due to its intersection with many metabolic pathways and transformations shi and tu 2015 therefore the metabolic pathway ⅱ was also favorable for strengthening the metabolic pathways related to acetyl coa like butyric acid type fermentation this was supported by the result of the stable isotope experiment as shown in fig 8 the relative abundance of 13c in the main metabolites e g butyric acid was greatly higher than that in the natural samples 1 11 at the later stage of the experiment due to the enrichment of chain elongation related microbes the short chain carboxylic acids such as acetic acid or butyric acid were elongated into hexanoic acid when lactic acid ethanol glucose acted as the electron donors as shown in the metabolic pathway iii in conclusion the closed carbon loop strategy enabled the simultaneous removal of carboxylic acid and the introduction of inorganic carbon which resulted in the significant strengthening of the butyric acid metabolic pathway during acidogenic fermentation conclusions we developed the ised anmbr coupling system for the selective production of butyric acid and reutilization of acidogenic off gasses during acidogenic fermentation it shaped the unique micro environment and drove the mixed culture fermentation towards a certain product or combination of carboxylic acids the results indicated that the mass fraction of butyric acid was significantly enhanced to 76 05 while the concentration of butyric acid was 11 17 times that of the uncoupled period clostridia with the capability of butyric acid producing and homoacetogenesis dominated 80 16 the reactors advanced isotope and metabolic analyses supported the hypothesis of a combination of three pathways that led to high butyric acid production in the coupled system this study provides a new approach for organic waste valorization into more tailored and higher value products through further exploration of parameters and optimization of systematic design it is expected more tunable fermentation products and higher titer and yield could be achieved in such processes further study is

15351,municipal sewage especially the produced sewage sludge is a significant source releasing mercury hg to the environment however the hg speciation especially methylmercury mehg transformation in sewage sludge treatment process remains poorly understood this study investigated the transformation of hg speciation especially mehg in sludge composting the distribution of hg transformation related gene pairs hgcab and merab and their putative microbial hosts were comprehensively analyzed both hg from 3 16 0 22 mg kg to 3 20 0 19 mg kg and mehg content from 4 77 0 64 ng g to 4 36 0 37 ng g were not obviously changed before and after composting but about 19 69 of hg and 27 36 of mehg were lost according to mass balance calculation the metagenomic analysis further revealed that anaerobes desulfobacterota and euryarchaeota were the mainly putative hg methylators especially carrying high abundance of hgca gene in the initial periods of composting among the 151 reconstructed metagenome assembled genomes mags only 4 hgca gene carriers myxococcota firmicutes cyclobacteriaceae and methanothermobacter and 16 merb gene carriers were identified but almost all of the mags carried hgcb gene and mera gene the mera gene was widely distributed in genomes which indicated the widespread functionality of microbes for reducing hg ii to hg 0 the hgca carrying microbes tends to present the similar metabolic pathways including methanogenesis and sulfur metabolism besides both the irregular distribution of hgca in various species including actinobacteria archaea bacteroidetes desulfobacterota euryarchaeota and nitrospirae etc and opposite evolution trends between hgca gene abundance and its host genome abundance can be an indication of horizontal gene transfer or gene deletions of hgca during composting our findings thus revealed that sludge composting is not only a hotspot for hg speciation transformation but also a potential hotspot for mehg transformation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge composting methylmercury metagenomic analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mercury hg is a globally neurotoxic pollutant especially methylmercury mehg one form of organomercury is highly toxic to human bodies and also easy to be biomagnified in food web christakis et al 2021 recently high amounts of hg occurred in the municipal sewage has drawn great attention for example the global mercury assessment report 2018 un 2019 issued by united nations environment programme compiled that municipal sewage is a significant source releasing hg to the environment which would be about one quarter of the global mercury release total in the meantime over 70 of hg in wastewater can be transported into the waste sewage sludge which would be an important hg source into the environment liu et al 2018 mao et al 2016 with the increasing treatment efficiency and capacity of wastewater huge amounts of waste sewage sludge produced every year kor bicakci and eskicioglu 2019 except for incineration and landfill land application is the main way for sewage sludge disposal generally by anaerobic digestion or composting sewage sludge will be stabilized and enriched in nutrients e g nitrogen and phosphorus and humic substances thus to be an organic fertilizer for land application xiong et al 2022 but it is still worried that the high content of hg enriched in sewage sludge will have ecological risks for its globally transformation and bio accumulation especially with the production of mehg wang and mao 2019 the reported values of hg in sewage sludge ranged from 0 5 to 5 0 mg kg and mehg varied from 0 3 to 13 1 ng g cheng et al 2019 the content of both hg and mehg is comparative or even higher than the content in contaminated environment such as soil at hg mining site sediments and paddy soils liu et al 2021a rothenberg et al 2014 the technologies for removing heavy metals from sewage sludge are still attracting increasing attention but need more studies including the understanding of mechanisms and treatment cost geng et al 2020 the commonly treatment process for stabilizing sewage sludge such as anaerobic digestion and composting usually resulted in the increase of heavy metal content cai et al 2007 and the biological treatment generally tends to passivate hg speciation by transforming its chemical form from bioavailable fraction to residual fraction janowska et al 2017 previous studies janowska et al 2017 song et al 2021 showed that the reduced bioavailability of heavy metals were mainly driven by the interaction of organic compounds and metabolism of functional microbes in sludge composting this biological process is potentially a hotspot for hg speciation transformation and also hg methylation understanding the transformation of hg and mehg in sludge treatment process is important for controlling hg ecological risks however the hg transformation especially hg methylation and mehg demethylation in sludge composting is still poorly understood recently several studies cheng et al 2021 janowska et al 2017 mao et al 2017 investigated the evolution of hg and mehg during sludge composting but some contradictory results were found for example cheng et al 2021 found that mehg content was decreased from 6 8 0 5 ng g to 2 6 0 3 ng g after sludge composting they thought that sludge composting mainly led to the mehg demethylation due to aeration in contrast mao et al 2017 found that mehg content in composting product was increased to 1 21 2 25 ng g which was 4 10 times as high as the mehg content in original composting material mao et al 2017 considered that mehg was produced during the initial periods 0 3 d of composting because of hg methylation with sulfate reduction these studies imply that the deep understanding of hg and mehg transformation during sludge composting is still needed both hg methylation and mehg demethylation are mainly driven by the microbial metabolism christakis et al 2021 mcdaniel et al 2020 generally anaerobes are the main methylators responsible for hg methylation a gene pair hgca and hgcb has been identified in all tested anaerobes that drives hg methylation for generating mehg parks et al 2013 the gene hgca encodes a corrinoid protein that donates a methyl group to hg ii the gene hgcb encodes an iron sulfur cluster protein which is to provide electrons to the cobalt ion of hgca protein which is necessary for maintaining the methylation demethylation cycle regnell and watras 2019 while for biotic demethylation of mehg it is mainly a process that microbes use mer operon for hg resistance and detoxification the operon code by merb gene for organomercury lyase merb which catalyzes the protonolytic cleavage of the chg bond in mehg to ch4 and hg ii and then hg ii is reduced to hg 0 through the activity of mercuric reductase mera encoded by mera gene christakis et al 2021 the gene pairs of hgca b and mera b are important molecular biomarkers for deciphering the biotic transformation of hg and mehg during biological process lin et al 2021 overall sludge composting would be an important hotspot for either hg methylation or mehg demethylation revealing the transformation of hg and mehg is important to find efficient way for reducing hg ecological risks of sludge after composting therefore in this study we analyzed the hg and mehg content in sludge in an industrial composting process to evaluate the potential hg methylation or mehg demethylation finally a deep understanding on hg methylation and mehg demethylation in sludge composting was presented by metagenomic analysis specifically targeting hgca b pairs and mera b pairs this study will promote the understanding of hg and mehg transformation during sludge composting which will be important for controlling hg ecological risks of sludge for land application 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge composting and sampling full scale sludge composting was performed in an industrial sludge treatment plant the dewatered sludge with water content of 80 6 was mixed with rice hull and the composted sludge with the mixture ratio of 18 and 200 by wet weight of sewage sludge thus the water content of mixed compost material was adjusted to 62 8 the basic physic chemical characters of these raw materials were included in the supporting information the mixed material was composted by groove type compost with the pile size of 37 m in length 5 m in width and 1 8 m in height during the composting aeration was performed with 5 5 h d and the pile was turned at 4 d 10 d and 17 d the turning over process was determined following the general composting process in this plant in general before 17 d composting would stay at high temperature with high oxygen consumption and microbial metabolic activity thus two turning over processes were needed to mix the materials and after the high temperature period only one time at 17 d turning over process was carried out composting was finished at 25 d therefore sampling was performed at 1 d df31 4 d df34 10 d df310 17 d df317 and 25 d df325 details on the sampling process was also described in the supporting information 2 2 mercury analysis the samples were freeze drying first and then grinded and screened with nylon mesh 100 mesh total hg content was measured by using a hydra c direct mercury analyzer leeman labs inc usa mehg was analyzed by using an automatic mehg analyzer cvafs brooks rand model iii brooks rand laboratories usa before analysis mehg was extracted according to the protocol as lei et al 2019 described briefly mehg was extracted from sludge samples with 25 koh methanol w w and incubated at 70 c for 4 h the digests were diluted with deionized water and used for mehg analysis each sample was measured for triplicate the recoveries of mehg basing on the measuring of certified soil material erm cc580 were 88 106 6 the chemical speciation of hg was analyzed by using the chemical sequential extraction procedure suggested by the european community bureau of reference bcr which classified the chemical speciation into four fractions including exchangeable reducible oxidizable and residual fraction tytła et al 2016 2 3 dna extraction and metagenomics sequencing dna extraction was performed by a fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals us using 0 5 g of dried samples according to the manufacturer s protocol nanodrop 2000 thermo scientific usa was used to determine the dna concentration the extracted dna samples were sent to majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china for the small fragment library construction and pair end 150 bp sequencing by using hiseq 4000 platform the raw sequence data approximately 10 gbp per sample were deposited in ncbi with accession number of bioproject id prjna875240 2 4 metagenomic assembly and binning metagenomic assembly and binning procedure was carried out basing on liu et al 2021 raw illumina paired end reads 2 150 bp were quality controlled by using kneaddata pipeline https bitbucket org biobakery kneaddata which used trimmomatic v0 39 for trimming bolger et al 2014 all clean reads from different samples were co assembled with megahit v1 2 9 bolger et al 2014 metagenome assembled genomes mags were recovered by using metawrap pipeline v 1 3 2 uritskiy et al 2018 for detail bins were simultaneously clustered from assembled contigs by using concoct v1 0 0 alneberg et al 2014 maxbin2 wu et al 2016 and metabat2 v2 12 1 kang et al 2015 and then the bins were merged and refined to mags the qualities of derived mags were examined using checkm mags were further quantified by using salmon v1 5 0 patro et al 2017 both gtdb tk v1 5 0 chaumeil et al 2020 and taxator tk v1 3 3 dröge et al 2015 were used to predict the taxonomy of each mag genome annotation was conducted with prokka v1 13 seemann 2014 phylogenetic tree of the reconstructed mags was visualized by itol letunic and bork 2019 furthermore kegg pathways of each mags were predicted with blastkoala https www kegg jp blastkoala and completeness of the pathways was estimated by kegg decoder graham et al 2018 2 5 searching and quantifying for hgcab and merab genes the newly published pipeline marky coco capo et al 2022 was used to find and quantify the hgca b and mera b like genes in each sample which is based on the hg mate hg cycling microorganisms in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems database gionfriddo et al 2021 details on the usage and according software in this pipeline can be found in https github com ericcapo marky coco the counts number of hgca b and mera b like genes in each sample was further normalized as reads per kilobase per million rpkm besides hgca b and mera b encoded amino acid sequences from hg mate database was also used to search for hgca b and mera b like genes in mags by hmmer v3 3 2 and then cd hit v4 6 was used to remove redundant genes of hgca b and mera b sequences in all mags under a 99 sequence identity threshold relative abundance of hgca genes found in mags from each sample was also evaluated as lin et al 2021 since all reported methylators only carry one copy of hgca gene in the genome in brief paired end reads were assigned to these hgca gene sequences with bwa mem algorithm bbmap http jgi doe gov data and tools bbtools was used to calculate the average coverage and then microbecensus nayfach and pollard 2015 was used to estimate the genome equivalent of each sample relative abundance of representative hgca genes found in mags in each sample was calculated by the formula hgca coverage genome equivalent 3 results and discussions 3 1 changes of hg speciation and mehg during sludge composting the total hg content in the original compost material was 3 16 0 22 mg kg which increased to 3 56 0 20 mg kg at the day of 10 d but at the end of composting the hg content decreased back to 3 20 0 19 mg kg no significant increment of hg content between the start and end of composting was observed fig 1 a indeed during the sludge composting the content of heavy metals generally tends to be increased due to the decreased mass of organic matters along with composting cai et al 2007 the no significant increase of hg content indicated that hg seems to be lost during sludge composting this result was consistent with cheng et al 2021 who observed obvious hg loss with 25 decrease of hg content after composting by calculating the hg mass in the whole compost material according to hg content and total mass of compost material details in supporting information it was found that about 19 69 of hg was lost after sludge composting this occurred especially at the late period from 10 d of sludge composting fig 1b possibly due to the formation of hg 0 and its emission into atmosphere in the meantime from the result of hg speciation fig 1e obvious transformation of hg speciation was observed especially transformation between the residual fraction and oxidizable fraction occurred during sludge composting in detail at 4 d residual fraction of hg was simulated and transferred into oxidizable fraction this was possibly due to the large amounts of soluble organics such as organic acids released during the initial period which would bind some hg from residual form veeken and hamelers 1999 the temperature along with composting in supporting information showed that the high temperature period maintained from 2 d to 16 d with temperature over 60 c except for the temperature after turning over at 4 d and 10 d at the same time both ph and soluble nh3 n increased obviously in initial days 1 4 d which was from 7 71 to 8 48 and from 3 99 to 4 9 mg g respectively toc was also increased from 4 84 mg g at 1 d to 8 33 mg g at 4 d in supporting information these results implied that intense decomposition of insoluble and high molecular organics happened in initial periods of composting the generated soluble organics potentially bind hg thus transferred it into oxidizable fraction along with the following sludge composting the released soluble organics such as organic acids were degraded gradually zhao et al 2018 which was also supported by the decrease of toc from 9 88 mg g at 10 d to 5 09 mg g at 17 d thus the residual fraction of hg gradually increased from 42 26 at 4 d to 74 66 at 25 d which resulted in the overall hg passivation and the oxidizable fraction of hg decreased from 30 97 to 21 52 after composting noticeably at the day of 17 d the reducible fraction of hg was obviously increased to 10 91 hg ii is one of the main fraction of reducible fraction of hg zheng et al 2012 microbes may play a direct role in hg ii reduction in terrestrial soils to form hg 0 through the expression of mercuric reductase genes mera pannu et al 2014 this transformation pattern of hg speciation was a potential indication for obvious hg loss from the day of 17 d the mehg content did not obviously change which only changed from 4 77 0 64 ng g to 4 36 0 37 ng g before and after composting but at the day of 10 d mehg content was obviously decreased from 4 36 0 37 ng g to 3 75 0 57 ng g which indicated that hg demethylation perhaps dominated from 4 d to 10 d but at 17 d the reversely increased mehg content suggested that the demethylation seems to be weakened overall the calculated mehg mass was decreased from 0 41 0 05 g to 0 30 0 03 g before and after composting thus about 27 36 of mehg was removed therefore by sludge composting mehg demethylation was overall dominant this result was consistent with cheng et al 2021 who also found that mehg was mainly demethylated after composting but during composting hg methylation also existed simultaneously indeed a dynamic process with both hg methylation and mehg demethylation generally occur simultaneously during the microbial process the competitive simultaneous methylation and demethylation were widely observed in diverse environmental systems such as sediments wetlands and freshwater lakes barkay and gu 2021 in aquatic soil systems mehg concentration is governed by balance of hg methylation and mehg demethylation strickman et al 2022 for example strickman et al 2022 found that in rice paddy soil mehg concentration was determined by hg methylation in non vegetated soil while was reversely controlled by demethylation in the soil with plants it was suggested that the net mehg concentration was controlled by the leverage between methylation and demethylation an observed decrease of mehg concentration may imply that a stronger mehg demethylation than hg methylation this simultaneous methylation and demethylation process was also supported by recent findings of the complex roles of methanogens wu et al 2020 found that the methanogenesis driven by methanogens played complex roles in controlling mehg cycling which directly affected the mehg degradation via oxidative demethylation and indirectly affected mehg production by out competing other microbial guilds therefore the observed increase of mehg content after composting in the study of mao et al 2017 was potentially the result of stronger hg methylation than mehg demethylation however the obvious mehg removal in this study and in the work of cheng et al 2021 indicated that the stronger mehg demethylation than hg methylation it is suggested that net mehg content controlled by this competitive and dynamic process should be determined by the changed environment which was determined by the strategies of aeration or turning over during composting but still needs some more evidences 3 2 distribution patterns of hgca b and mera b genes during composting by searching for the hgca b and mera b protein sequences from the predicted open reading frame orf the potential methylators carrying hgca genes and the abundance of these genes in each sample were obtained fig 2 the results showed that the potential methylators carrying hgca genes were mainly desulfobacterota and euryarchaeota which are mainly related to sulfate reduction and methanogenesis respectively according to the unnormalized hgca coverage values fig 2a it was found that the abundance of hgca genes in both desulfobacterota and euryarchaeota was high in the initial period of composting 1 4 day and gradually decreased from 4 d this indicated that the hg methylation tended to be weakened from 4 d which was consistent with the result of obvious decrease of mehg content at 10 d both desulfobacterota and euryarchaeota are anaerobes their high abundance in 1 4 d indicated that the anaerobic environment derived from the excess biodegradable organics which would be the main reason for hg methylation in initial period of sludge composting as mao et al 2017 described desulfobacterota is the phylum of bacteria which encompasses sulfate reducing and related fermentative constituting the bulk of strict anaerobes within previously classified as deltaproteobacteria murphy et al 2021 this phylum of bacteria is primarily associated with the mehg production with the capacity of methylating mercury jones et al 2019 euryarchaeota is the phylum contains methanogens driving for methanogenesis liu et al 2021b it is also the commonly known hg methylators mcdaniel et al 2020 besides recent study christakis et al 2021 also suggest that euryarchaeota may carried merb gene which detoxify mehg with demethylation therefore the appearance of euryarchaeota implied the possibility of simultaneous methylation and demethylation in composting as aforementioned besides the nitrospirae which is functionalized in nitrogen metabolism also carrying hgca genes showed the increased coverage at 10 d but disappeared in the following process along with composting obvious evolution of these potential methylators was observed fig 2b the emerge of nitrospirae only at 10 d and irregular distribution of hgca fig 2b suggested that the process of horizontal gene transfers hgt or gene deletions may happen during composting process villar et al 2020 horizontal gene transfer is considered to be the primary reason which lead to the phylogenetical diversity of putative mercury methylators mcdaniel et al 2020 for example some newly found species dehalococcoides chloroflexi potentially carrying hgcab possibly resulting from the horizontal gene transfer podar et al 2015 this is also the potential reason that lots of hgca carrying methylators were not identified to any known taxonomy fig 2a which means that some more unknown methylators perhaps exist in sludge composting which carrying hgca genes from horizontal gene transfer furthermore these genes showed different distribution patterns along with sludge composting the hgca gene abundance mean rpkm value in each sample was high at the initial periods 1 4 d as shown in table 1 after composting hgca genes abundance was significantly reduced fig 2c but for hgcb gene its abundance tended to significantly increase at the late period 17 25d of composting table 1 and fig 2d although they are the gene pairs for hg methylation they showed different distribution patterns along with sludge composting this was the same as mera b gene pairs the mera gene did not show obviously change but merb gene showed the dynamic change especially the increase at late period of composting what s more according to the number of genes searched within the hg related genes sequences mera gene sequences was the most widely distributed in over 2000 genes in each sample while the number of hgca gene was less than 100 the reason was perhaps that the microbes carrying hgca genes were mostly anaerobes such as desulfobacterota and euryarchaeota while for mera genes their host microbes can be aerobic microorganism christakis et al 2021 in composting the anaerobic environment was more likely formed in the initial period but with the exhaustion of biodegradable organics and increase of porosity along with composting the aerobic environment tends to be dominated yamada and kawase 2006 tables 2 and 3 3 3 mag reconstruction and putative hg methylator identification to further investigate the putative hg methylator and mehg demethylator in sludge composting the mag was reconstructed and used to search for the hgca b and mera b gene pairs overall 151 mags including 150 bacteria and 1 archaea were reconstructed for the bacteria most of them belongs to the phylum of actinobacteriota firmicutes and proteobacteria fig 3 a and some other main functional microbes likely nitrospirota for nitrogen metabolism could also be rebuilt only one archaea namely methanothermobacter which belongs to methanobacteriota was reconstructed according to their abundance along with sludge composting the reconstructed mags were clustered into four groups fig 3b in cluster 1 the mags only had high abundance at the beginning of composting in cluster 2 the mags had high abundance through the whole composting process in cluster 3 the abundance of mags increased along with composting while the abundance of mags in cluster 4 tends to be decreased at the late period of composting the changed abundance of these mags could indicate the evolution of composting process with explanation of 76 8 fig 3c among these mags only four of them are potential methylators carrying hgca gene and only three mags carried both hgca and hgcb gene bin104 which taxonomy belongs to myxococcota in gtdb tk database and myxococcales in ncbi database carried both hgca and hgcb genes myxococcota is the taxonomy splitted from deltaproteobacteria potentially related to sulfate reducing murphy et al 2021 bin107 carrying both hgca and hgcb gene belongs to firmicutes and another methylator carrying both hgca and hgcb gene is bin145 which is methanothermobacter related to methanogenesis furthermore it was found that hgcb gene and mera gene were widely distributed in the reconstructed mags 148 mags were found carrying hgcb gene and all of the mags 151 carried mera like genes whereas merb was only found in 16 mags these results were also consistent with overall distribution of hgca b and mera b genes as showed in 3 2 the mera gene is capable of reducing hg ii to hg 0 its widely distribution in microbes imply that most of the microbes along with sludge composting have the potential ability for reducing hg ii to hg 0 this was also the possibly main reason that obvious hg loss was observed during sludge composting both in this study and in the work of cheng et al 2021 3 4 association between hg transformation and metabolic functions during composting it is well known that hg methylation and mehg demethylation are mainly associated with some special metabolic processes such as sulfate iron reduction and methanogenesis yu et al 2018 because most of the reconstructed mags carried hgcb and mera like genes only the function completeness of the mags carrying hgca and merb like genes were presented as shown in fig 4 it was found that the mags bin107 bin145 b104 and bin139 carrying hgca like genes presented the nearest metabolic pathways according to the clustering results fig 4 and all of the mags carrying hgca like genes have the potentially metabolic functions related to methanogenesis and also have some functions relating to sulfur metabolism though not all of them belongs to methanogens their nearest metabolic pathways especially in methanogenesis and sulfur metabolism means that the associated functions between the hg methylation and methanogenesis sulfur metabolism perhaps plays the key role for hg methylation in the initial periods of sludge composting furthermore the abundance of most hgca like genes showed the similar evolution trends as its host mags bin145 bin139 and bin107 except for bin 104 the abundance of hgca like genes in bin104 showed the reversed trend compared to the abundance of bin104 during composting fig 5 this was perhaps due to the horizontal gene transfers or gene deletions in response to stress villar et al 2020 some microbes such as bin104 seem to lose the metabolic functions for hg methylation during composting it is also the same for the mags carrying merb like genes most of them presented similar metabolic pathways most of them were lack of the metabolism in methanogenesis but possessed the functions in sulfur and nitrogen metabolisms this phenomenon suggested that methanogenesis was perhaps not the functions associated with organomercury demethylation furthermore almost all of these mags encoded genes for arsenic reduction suggesting the high selection pressures from arsenic during sludge composting it was speculated that microbes presented metabolic functions in hg transformation was also regulated by stress from multiple heavy metals during sludge composting this was possibly derived from the co selection of heavy metals because of sharing some common route same genetic element such as plasmid transposon or integron baker austin et al 2006 fig 6 a showed the mainly well known hg methylation and mehg demethylation pathways summarized from previous studies upon previous knowledge biotic methylation is mainly carried out by the sulfate reducing bacteria srb iron reducing bacteria irb and methanogens under partly known metabolic pathways such as the acetyl coenzyme a acetyl coa pathway parks et al 2013 this process is the transformation of methyl groups from ch3 h4folate ch3 thf in reductive acetyl coa process to cob i alamin hgca co i hgca and then form ch3 co iii hgca and then hg ii is catalyzed by hgca putative corrinoid protein to generate ch3hgr and co hgca which is reduced back to co i hgca by hgcb 2 4fe 4s ferredoxin again this process has been confirmed in srb and irb ma et al 2019 except for this acetyl coa related pathway the knowledge on metabolic pathways for methylation is still limited other alternative pathways such as biosynthesis of l methionine was proposed to methylate hg ii but still needs more evidences ma et al 2019 due to the limited knowledge and non sufficient evidences only from the genome information it is hard to build the whole metabolic pathway of hg methylation and demethylation from the reconstructed mag but the annotated genome sequences data s1 still provided the evidence of acetyl coa pathway for hg ii methylation according to the existence of related genes enzymes and functions related to acetyl coa pathway as shown in fig 6b this microbial metabolic process is impacted by the existence of sulfur dissolved organic matters dom etc on the one hand the produced sulfide can react with hg ii to generate hgs thus reduce hg ii bioavailability on the other hand sulfate is also the electron acceptor for srb to stimulate methylation previous study ma et al 2019 suggested that the sulfate concentration less than 1 mg l would restrict the hg ii methylation for insufficient sulfate but if sulfate concentration was high possibly over 20 mg l production of mehg would be also inhibited due to the accumulation of sulfide appropriate concentration of sulfate can promote mehg production during the composting process the dissolved sulfate was gradually increased from 1 59 mg g to 3 27 mg g table s2 in supporting information as mao et al 2017 described the release of dissolved sulfate in initial periods before 3 d will improve the sulfate reducing metabolic process which promote hg ii methylation but in the late period of composting after 4 d the high level of sulfate concentration perhaps improved the generation of hgs speciation which increased from 0 41 mg kg at 1 d to 0 78 mg kg at 10 d in supporting information that would be an indication for obvious decrease of mehg content at 10 d in the meantime for mehg demethylation except for abiotic demethylation the main biotic demethylation includes reductive oxidative and methanotrophic demethylation the known pathways for mehg demethylation are shown in fig 6a reductive demethylation mainly by the mer system is broadly distributed among prokaryotes facilitating growth in the presence of high hg concentration which is the process for detoxicity by reducing hg ii to hg 0 that evaporates into atmosphere barkay and gu 2021 previous studies suggest that the oxidative demethylation is favored in anoxic environments with low hg concentration while reductive demethylation is favored in oxic and high hg environments barkay and gu 2021 thus it reasonable that reductive demethylation by the mer system should be the mainly biotic demethylation process for the high concentration of hg and mainly oxic environment in late period of sludge composting therefore our findings according to metagenomic analysis especially newly developed pipeline and database for mining hgca b and mera b genes information from the genomes capo et al 2022 lin et al 2021 pointed a deep understanding on the patterns of hg methylation and mehg demethylation in sludge composting which has never been investigated before sludge composting is a hotspot for hg speciation transformation and also a potential hotspot for hg methylation and mehg demethylation according to the profile of hgca gene and the abundance of its carriers desulfobacterota euryarchaeota and reconstructed genomes including myxococcota and methanothermobacter and the changes of hg speciation along with composting we proposed that initial periods of sludge composting tends to be a hotspot for hg ii methylation for the sufficient dissolved organics sulfate and anaerobic or anoxic environment at the same time with the increment of residual hg speciation including hgs elevated hg concentration and oxic environment in late periods of compositing hg ii methylation will be weakened while the detoxicity via reducing hg ii to hg 0 by mer system will be dominated for the wide distribution of mera gene overall because of the external aeration evolution of methylators and changed hg speciation during composting mehg demethylation presented as the dominated process and reduction of hg ii to hg 0 occurred in the late period these were the potential reasons why about 19 69 of hg and 27 36 of mehg were lost after composting however further understandings including the evidence on transformation of specific hg speciation hgs hg2 hg0 etc the coevolution with organic matters and other heavy metals and the impacts of composting process control aeration turning etc are still needed in the future studies 4 conclusion this study performed metagenomic insights into the transformation of hg speciation especially mehg in sludge composting sludge composting is a hotspot for hg speciation transformation including the hg lost with potential reduction of hg ii to hg 0 and hg speciation passivated it is also a potential hotspot for hg methylation and mehg demethylation but overall mehg demethylation was dominated metagenomic analysis further confirmed these results by the findings of high abundance of hgca and its carriers in the initial period of composting the wide distribution of mera gene in the genome also indicated the high ability of microbes in sludge composting to reduce hg ii to hg 0 furthermore both the irregular distribution of hgca in various species including actinobacteria archaea bacteroidetes desulfobacterota euryarchaeota and nitrospirae etc and opposite evolution trends between the abundance of hgca gene and its host genome bin104 myxococcota can be an indication of horizontal gene transfer or gene deletions of hgca during composting our results improved the understanding of hg and mehg transformation during sludge composting which will be also important for controlling hg

15351,municipal sewage especially the produced sewage sludge is a significant source releasing mercury hg to the environment however the hg speciation especially methylmercury mehg transformation in sewage sludge treatment process remains poorly understood this study investigated the transformation of hg speciation especially mehg in sludge composting the distribution of hg transformation related gene pairs hgcab and merab and their putative microbial hosts were comprehensively analyzed both hg from 3 16 0 22 mg kg to 3 20 0 19 mg kg and mehg content from 4 77 0 64 ng g to 4 36 0 37 ng g were not obviously changed before and after composting but about 19 69 of hg and 27 36 of mehg were lost according to mass balance calculation the metagenomic analysis further revealed that anaerobes desulfobacterota and euryarchaeota were the mainly putative hg methylators especially carrying high abundance of hgca gene in the initial periods of composting among the 151 reconstructed metagenome assembled genomes mags only 4 hgca gene carriers myxococcota firmicutes cyclobacteriaceae and methanothermobacter and 16 merb gene carriers were identified but almost all of the mags carried hgcb gene and mera gene the mera gene was widely distributed in genomes which indicated the widespread functionality of microbes for reducing hg ii to hg 0 the hgca carrying microbes tends to present the similar metabolic pathways including methanogenesis and sulfur metabolism besides both the irregular distribution of hgca in various species including actinobacteria archaea bacteroidetes desulfobacterota euryarchaeota and nitrospirae etc and opposite evolution trends between hgca gene abundance and its host genome abundance can be an indication of horizontal gene transfer or gene deletions of hgca during composting our findings thus revealed that sludge composting is not only a hotspot for hg speciation transformation but also a potential hotspot for mehg transformation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge composting methylmercury metagenomic analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mercury hg is a globally neurotoxic pollutant especially methylmercury mehg one form of organomercury is highly toxic to human bodies and also easy to be biomagnified in food web christakis et al 2021 recently high amounts of hg occurred in the municipal sewage has drawn great attention for example the global mercury assessment report 2018 un 2019 issued by united nations environment programme compiled that municipal sewage is a significant source releasing hg to the environment which would be about one quarter of the global mercury release total in the meantime over 70 of hg in wastewater can be transported into the waste sewage sludge which would be an important hg source into the environment liu et al 2018 mao et al 2016 with the increasing treatment efficiency and capacity of wastewater huge amounts of waste sewage sludge produced every year kor bicakci and eskicioglu 2019 except for incineration and landfill land application is the main way for sewage sludge disposal generally by anaerobic digestion or composting sewage sludge will be stabilized and enriched in nutrients e g nitrogen and phosphorus and humic substances thus to be an organic fertilizer for land application xiong et al 2022 but it is still worried that the high content of hg enriched in sewage sludge will have ecological risks for its globally transformation and bio accumulation especially with the production of mehg wang and mao 2019 the reported values of hg in sewage sludge ranged from 0 5 to 5 0 mg kg and mehg varied from 0 3 to 13 1 ng g cheng et al 2019 the content of both hg and mehg is comparative or even higher than the content in contaminated environment such as soil at hg mining site sediments and paddy soils liu et al 2021a rothenberg et al 2014 the technologies for removing heavy metals from sewage sludge are still attracting increasing attention but need more studies including the understanding of mechanisms and treatment cost geng et al 2020 the commonly treatment process for stabilizing sewage sludge such as anaerobic digestion and composting usually resulted in the increase of heavy metal content cai et al 2007 and the biological treatment generally tends to passivate hg speciation by transforming its chemical form from bioavailable fraction to residual fraction janowska et al 2017 previous studies janowska et al 2017 song et al 2021 showed that the reduced bioavailability of heavy metals were mainly driven by the interaction of organic compounds and metabolism of functional microbes in sludge composting this biological process is potentially a hotspot for hg speciation transformation and also hg methylation understanding the transformation of hg and mehg in sludge treatment process is important for controlling hg ecological risks however the hg transformation especially hg methylation and mehg demethylation in sludge composting is still poorly understood recently several studies cheng et al 2021 janowska et al 2017 mao et al 2017 investigated the evolution of hg and mehg during sludge composting but some contradictory results were found for example cheng et al 2021 found that mehg content was decreased from 6 8 0 5 ng g to 2 6 0 3 ng g after sludge composting they thought that sludge composting mainly led to the mehg demethylation due to aeration in contrast mao et al 2017 found that mehg content in composting product was increased to 1 21 2 25 ng g which was 4 10 times as high as the mehg content in original composting material mao et al 2017 considered that mehg was produced during the initial periods 0 3 d of composting because of hg methylation with sulfate reduction these studies imply that the deep understanding of hg and mehg transformation during sludge composting is still needed both hg methylation and mehg demethylation are mainly driven by the microbial metabolism christakis et al 2021 mcdaniel et al 2020 generally anaerobes are the main methylators responsible for hg methylation a gene pair hgca and hgcb has been identified in all tested anaerobes that drives hg methylation for generating mehg parks et al 2013 the gene hgca encodes a corrinoid protein that donates a methyl group to hg ii the gene hgcb encodes an iron sulfur cluster protein which is to provide electrons to the cobalt ion of hgca protein which is necessary for maintaining the methylation demethylation cycle regnell and watras 2019 while for biotic demethylation of mehg it is mainly a process that microbes use mer operon for hg resistance and detoxification the operon code by merb gene for organomercury lyase merb which catalyzes the protonolytic cleavage of the chg bond in mehg to ch4 and hg ii and then hg ii is reduced to hg 0 through the activity of mercuric reductase mera encoded by mera gene christakis et al 2021 the gene pairs of hgca b and mera b are important molecular biomarkers for deciphering the biotic transformation of hg and mehg during biological process lin et al 2021 overall sludge composting would be an important hotspot for either hg methylation or mehg demethylation revealing the transformation of hg and mehg is important to find efficient way for reducing hg ecological risks of sludge after composting therefore in this study we analyzed the hg and mehg content in sludge in an industrial composting process to evaluate the potential hg methylation or mehg demethylation finally a deep understanding on hg methylation and mehg demethylation in sludge composting was presented by metagenomic analysis specifically targeting hgca b pairs and mera b pairs this study will promote the understanding of hg and mehg transformation during sludge composting which will be important for controlling hg ecological risks of sludge for land application 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge composting and sampling full scale sludge composting was performed in an industrial sludge treatment plant the dewatered sludge with water content of 80 6 was mixed with rice hull and the composted sludge with the mixture ratio of 18 and 200 by wet weight of sewage sludge thus the water content of mixed compost material was adjusted to 62 8 the basic physic chemical characters of these raw materials were included in the supporting information the mixed material was composted by groove type compost with the pile size of 37 m in length 5 m in width and 1 8 m in height during the composting aeration was performed with 5 5 h d and the pile was turned at 4 d 10 d and 17 d the turning over process was determined following the general composting process in this plant in general before 17 d composting would stay at high temperature with high oxygen consumption and microbial metabolic activity thus two turning over processes were needed to mix the materials and after the high temperature period only one time at 17 d turning over process was carried out composting was finished at 25 d therefore sampling was performed at 1 d df31 4 d df34 10 d df310 17 d df317 and 25 d df325 details on the sampling process was also described in the supporting information 2 2 mercury analysis the samples were freeze drying first and then grinded and screened with nylon mesh 100 mesh total hg content was measured by using a hydra c direct mercury analyzer leeman labs inc usa mehg was analyzed by using an automatic mehg analyzer cvafs brooks rand model iii brooks rand laboratories usa before analysis mehg was extracted according to the protocol as lei et al 2019 described briefly mehg was extracted from sludge samples with 25 koh methanol w w and incubated at 70 c for 4 h the digests were diluted with deionized water and used for mehg analysis each sample was measured for triplicate the recoveries of mehg basing on the measuring of certified soil material erm cc580 were 88 106 6 the chemical speciation of hg was analyzed by using the chemical sequential extraction procedure suggested by the european community bureau of reference bcr which classified the chemical speciation into four fractions including exchangeable reducible oxidizable and residual fraction tytła et al 2016 2 3 dna extraction and metagenomics sequencing dna extraction was performed by a fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals us using 0 5 g of dried samples according to the manufacturer s protocol nanodrop 2000 thermo scientific usa was used to determine the dna concentration the extracted dna samples were sent to majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china for the small fragment library construction and pair end 150 bp sequencing by using hiseq 4000 platform the raw sequence data approximately 10 gbp per sample were deposited in ncbi with accession number of bioproject id prjna875240 2 4 metagenomic assembly and binning metagenomic assembly and binning procedure was carried out basing on liu et al 2021 raw illumina paired end reads 2 150 bp were quality controlled by using kneaddata pipeline https bitbucket org biobakery kneaddata which used trimmomatic v0 39 for trimming bolger et al 2014 all clean reads from different samples were co assembled with megahit v1 2 9 bolger et al 2014 metagenome assembled genomes mags were recovered by using metawrap pipeline v 1 3 2 uritskiy et al 2018 for detail bins were simultaneously clustered from assembled contigs by using concoct v1 0 0 alneberg et al 2014 maxbin2 wu et al 2016 and metabat2 v2 12 1 kang et al 2015 and then the bins were merged and refined to mags the qualities of derived mags were examined using checkm mags were further quantified by using salmon v1 5 0 patro et al 2017 both gtdb tk v1 5 0 chaumeil et al 2020 and taxator tk v1 3 3 dröge et al 2015 were used to predict the taxonomy of each mag genome annotation was conducted with prokka v1 13 seemann 2014 phylogenetic tree of the reconstructed mags was visualized by itol letunic and bork 2019 furthermore kegg pathways of each mags were predicted with blastkoala https www kegg jp blastkoala and completeness of the pathways was estimated by kegg decoder graham et al 2018 2 5 searching and quantifying for hgcab and merab genes the newly published pipeline marky coco capo et al 2022 was used to find and quantify the hgca b and mera b like genes in each sample which is based on the hg mate hg cycling microorganisms in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems database gionfriddo et al 2021 details on the usage and according software in this pipeline can be found in https github com ericcapo marky coco the counts number of hgca b and mera b like genes in each sample was further normalized as reads per kilobase per million rpkm besides hgca b and mera b encoded amino acid sequences from hg mate database was also used to search for hgca b and mera b like genes in mags by hmmer v3 3 2 and then cd hit v4 6 was used to remove redundant genes of hgca b and mera b sequences in all mags under a 99 sequence identity threshold relative abundance of hgca genes found in mags from each sample was also evaluated as lin et al 2021 since all reported methylators only carry one copy of hgca gene in the genome in brief paired end reads were assigned to these hgca gene sequences with bwa mem algorithm bbmap http jgi doe gov data and tools bbtools was used to calculate the average coverage and then microbecensus nayfach and pollard 2015 was used to estimate the genome equivalent of each sample relative abundance of representative hgca genes found in mags in each sample was calculated by the formula hgca coverage genome equivalent 3 results and discussions 3 1 changes of hg speciation and mehg during sludge composting the total hg content in the original compost material was 3 16 0 22 mg kg which increased to 3 56 0 20 mg kg at the day of 10 d but at the end of composting the hg content decreased back to 3 20 0 19 mg kg no significant increment of hg content between the start and end of composting was observed fig 1 a indeed during the sludge composting the content of heavy metals generally tends to be increased due to the decreased mass of organic matters along with composting cai et al 2007 the no significant increase of hg content indicated that hg seems to be lost during sludge composting this result was consistent with cheng et al 2021 who observed obvious hg loss with 25 decrease of hg content after composting by calculating the hg mass in the whole compost material according to hg content and total mass of compost material details in supporting information it was found that about 19 69 of hg was lost after sludge composting this occurred especially at the late period from 10 d of sludge composting fig 1b possibly due to the formation of hg 0 and its emission into atmosphere in the meantime from the result of hg speciation fig 1e obvious transformation of hg speciation was observed especially transformation between the residual fraction and oxidizable fraction occurred during sludge composting in detail at 4 d residual fraction of hg was simulated and transferred into oxidizable fraction this was possibly due to the large amounts of soluble organics such as organic acids released during the initial period which would bind some hg from residual form veeken and hamelers 1999 the temperature along with composting in supporting information showed that the high temperature period maintained from 2 d to 16 d with temperature over 60 c except for the temperature after turning over at 4 d and 10 d at the same time both ph and soluble nh3 n increased obviously in initial days 1 4 d which was from 7 71 to 8 48 and from 3 99 to 4 9 mg g respectively toc was also increased from 4 84 mg g at 1 d to 8 33 mg g at 4 d in supporting information these results implied that intense decomposition of insoluble and high molecular organics happened in initial periods of composting the generated soluble organics potentially bind hg thus transferred it into oxidizable fraction along with the following sludge composting the released soluble organics such as organic acids were degraded gradually zhao et al 2018 which was also supported by the decrease of toc from 9 88 mg g at 10 d to 5 09 mg g at 17 d thus the residual fraction of hg gradually increased from 42 26 at 4 d to 74 66 at 25 d which resulted in the overall hg passivation and the oxidizable fraction of hg decreased from 30 97 to 21 52 after composting noticeably at the day of 17 d the reducible fraction of hg was obviously increased to 10 91 hg ii is one of the main fraction of reducible fraction of hg zheng et al 2012 microbes may play a direct role in hg ii reduction in terrestrial soils to form hg 0 through the expression of mercuric reductase genes mera pannu et al 2014 this transformation pattern of hg speciation was a potential indication for obvious hg loss from the day of 17 d the mehg content did not obviously change which only changed from 4 77 0 64 ng g to 4 36 0 37 ng g before and after composting but at the day of 10 d mehg content was obviously decreased from 4 36 0 37 ng g to 3 75 0 57 ng g which indicated that hg demethylation perhaps dominated from 4 d to 10 d but at 17 d the reversely increased mehg content suggested that the demethylation seems to be weakened overall the calculated mehg mass was decreased from 0 41 0 05 g to 0 30 0 03 g before and after composting thus about 27 36 of mehg was removed therefore by sludge composting mehg demethylation was overall dominant this result was consistent with cheng et al 2021 who also found that mehg was mainly demethylated after composting but during composting hg methylation also existed simultaneously indeed a dynamic process with both hg methylation and mehg demethylation generally occur simultaneously during the microbial process the competitive simultaneous methylation and demethylation were widely observed in diverse environmental systems such as sediments wetlands and freshwater lakes barkay and gu 2021 in aquatic soil systems mehg concentration is governed by balance of hg methylation and mehg demethylation strickman et al 2022 for example strickman et al 2022 found that in rice paddy soil mehg concentration was determined by hg methylation in non vegetated soil while was reversely controlled by demethylation in the soil with plants it was suggested that the net mehg concentration was controlled by the leverage between methylation and demethylation an observed decrease of mehg concentration may imply that a stronger mehg demethylation than hg methylation this simultaneous methylation and demethylation process was also supported by recent findings of the complex roles of methanogens wu et al 2020 found that the methanogenesis driven by methanogens played complex roles in controlling mehg cycling which directly affected the mehg degradation via oxidative demethylation and indirectly affected mehg production by out competing other microbial guilds therefore the observed increase of mehg content after composting in the study of mao et al 2017 was potentially the result of stronger hg methylation than mehg demethylation however the obvious mehg removal in this study and in the work of cheng et al 2021 indicated that the stronger mehg demethylation than hg methylation it is suggested that net mehg content controlled by this competitive and dynamic process should be determined by the changed environment which was determined by the strategies of aeration or turning over during composting but still needs some more evidences 3 2 distribution patterns of hgca b and mera b genes during composting by searching for the hgca b and mera b protein sequences from the predicted open reading frame orf the potential methylators carrying hgca genes and the abundance of these genes in each sample were obtained fig 2 the results showed that the potential methylators carrying hgca genes were mainly desulfobacterota and euryarchaeota which are mainly related to sulfate reduction and methanogenesis respectively according to the unnormalized hgca coverage values fig 2a it was found that the abundance of hgca genes in both desulfobacterota and euryarchaeota was high in the initial period of composting 1 4 day and gradually decreased from 4 d this indicated that the hg methylation tended to be weakened from 4 d which was consistent with the result of obvious decrease of mehg content at 10 d both desulfobacterota and euryarchaeota are anaerobes their high abundance in 1 4 d indicated that the anaerobic environment derived from the excess biodegradable organics which would be the main reason for hg methylation in initial period of sludge composting as mao et al 2017 described desulfobacterota is the phylum of bacteria which encompasses sulfate reducing and related fermentative constituting the bulk of strict anaerobes within previously classified as deltaproteobacteria murphy et al 2021 this phylum of bacteria is primarily associated with the mehg production with the capacity of methylating mercury jones et al 2019 euryarchaeota is the phylum contains methanogens driving for methanogenesis liu et al 2021b it is also the commonly known hg methylators mcdaniel et al 2020 besides recent study christakis et al 2021 also suggest that euryarchaeota may carried merb gene which detoxify mehg with demethylation therefore the appearance of euryarchaeota implied the possibility of simultaneous methylation and demethylation in composting as aforementioned besides the nitrospirae which is functionalized in nitrogen metabolism also carrying hgca genes showed the increased coverage at 10 d but disappeared in the following process along with composting obvious evolution of these potential methylators was observed fig 2b the emerge of nitrospirae only at 10 d and irregular distribution of hgca fig 2b suggested that the process of horizontal gene transfers hgt or gene deletions may happen during composting process villar et al 2020 horizontal gene transfer is considered to be the primary reason which lead to the phylogenetical diversity of putative mercury methylators mcdaniel et al 2020 for example some newly found species dehalococcoides chloroflexi potentially carrying hgcab possibly resulting from the horizontal gene transfer podar et al 2015 this is also the potential reason that lots of hgca carrying methylators were not identified to any known taxonomy fig 2a which means that some more unknown methylators perhaps exist in sludge composting which carrying hgca genes from horizontal gene transfer furthermore these genes showed different distribution patterns along with sludge composting the hgca gene abundance mean rpkm value in each sample was high at the initial periods 1 4 d as shown in table 1 after composting hgca genes abundance was significantly reduced fig 2c but for hgcb gene its abundance tended to significantly increase at the late period 17 25d of composting table 1 and fig 2d although they are the gene pairs for hg methylation they showed different distribution patterns along with sludge composting this was the same as mera b gene pairs the mera gene did not show obviously change but merb gene showed the dynamic change especially the increase at late period of composting what s more according to the number of genes searched within the hg related genes sequences mera gene sequences was the most widely distributed in over 2000 genes in each sample while the number of hgca gene was less than 100 the reason was perhaps that the microbes carrying hgca genes were mostly anaerobes such as desulfobacterota and euryarchaeota while for mera genes their host microbes can be aerobic microorganism christakis et al 2021 in composting the anaerobic environment was more likely formed in the initial period but with the exhaustion of biodegradable organics and increase of porosity along with composting the aerobic environment tends to be dominated yamada and kawase 2006 tables 2 and 3 3 3 mag reconstruction and putative hg methylator identification to further investigate the putative hg methylator and mehg demethylator in sludge composting the mag was reconstructed and used to search for the hgca b and mera b gene pairs overall 151 mags including 150 bacteria and 1 archaea were reconstructed for the bacteria most of them belongs to the phylum of actinobacteriota firmicutes and proteobacteria fig 3 a and some other main functional microbes likely nitrospirota for nitrogen metabolism could also be rebuilt only one archaea namely methanothermobacter which belongs to methanobacteriota was reconstructed according to their abundance along with sludge composting the reconstructed mags were clustered into four groups fig 3b in cluster 1 the mags only had high abundance at the beginning of composting in cluster 2 the mags had high abundance through the whole composting process in cluster 3 the abundance of mags increased along with composting while the abundance of mags in cluster 4 tends to be decreased at the late period of composting the changed abundance of these mags could indicate the evolution of composting process with explanation of 76 8 fig 3c among these mags only four of them are potential methylators carrying hgca gene and only three mags carried both hgca and hgcb gene bin104 which taxonomy belongs to myxococcota in gtdb tk database and myxococcales in ncbi database carried both hgca and hgcb genes myxococcota is the taxonomy splitted from deltaproteobacteria potentially related to sulfate reducing murphy et al 2021 bin107 carrying both hgca and hgcb gene belongs to firmicutes and another methylator carrying both hgca and hgcb gene is bin145 which is methanothermobacter related to methanogenesis furthermore it was found that hgcb gene and mera gene were widely distributed in the reconstructed mags 148 mags were found carrying hgcb gene and all of the mags 151 carried mera like genes whereas merb was only found in 16 mags these results were also consistent with overall distribution of hgca b and mera b genes as showed in 3 2 the mera gene is capable of reducing hg ii to hg 0 its widely distribution in microbes imply that most of the microbes along with sludge composting have the potential ability for reducing hg ii to hg 0 this was also the possibly main reason that obvious hg loss was observed during sludge composting both in this study and in the work of cheng et al 2021 3 4 association between hg transformation and metabolic functions during composting it is well known that hg methylation and mehg demethylation are mainly associated with some special metabolic processes such as sulfate iron reduction and methanogenesis yu et al 2018 because most of the reconstructed mags carried hgcb and mera like genes only the function completeness of the mags carrying hgca and merb like genes were presented as shown in fig 4 it was found that the mags bin107 bin145 b104 and bin139 carrying hgca like genes presented the nearest metabolic pathways according to the clustering results fig 4 and all of the mags carrying hgca like genes have the potentially metabolic functions related to methanogenesis and also have some functions relating to sulfur metabolism though not all of them belongs to methanogens their nearest metabolic pathways especially in methanogenesis and sulfur metabolism means that the associated functions between the hg methylation and methanogenesis sulfur metabolism perhaps plays the key role for hg methylation in the initial periods of sludge composting furthermore the abundance of most hgca like genes showed the similar evolution trends as its host mags bin145 bin139 and bin107 except for bin 104 the abundance of hgca like genes in bin104 showed the reversed trend compared to the abundance of bin104 during composting fig 5 this was perhaps due to the horizontal gene transfers or gene deletions in response to stress villar et al 2020 some microbes such as bin104 seem to lose the metabolic functions for hg methylation during composting it is also the same for the mags carrying merb like genes most of them presented similar metabolic pathways most of them were lack of the metabolism in methanogenesis but possessed the functions in sulfur and nitrogen metabolisms this phenomenon suggested that methanogenesis was perhaps not the functions associated with organomercury demethylation furthermore almost all of these mags encoded genes for arsenic reduction suggesting the high selection pressures from arsenic during sludge composting it was speculated that microbes presented metabolic functions in hg transformation was also regulated by stress from multiple heavy metals during sludge composting this was possibly derived from the co selection of heavy metals because of sharing some common route same genetic element such as plasmid transposon or integron baker austin et al 2006 fig 6 a showed the mainly well known hg methylation and mehg demethylation pathways summarized from previous studies upon previous knowledge biotic methylation is mainly carried out by the sulfate reducing bacteria srb iron reducing bacteria irb and methanogens under partly known metabolic pathways such as the acetyl coenzyme a acetyl coa pathway parks et al 2013 this process is the transformation of methyl groups from ch3 h4folate ch3 thf in reductive acetyl coa process to cob i alamin hgca co i hgca and then form ch3 co iii hgca and then hg ii is catalyzed by hgca putative corrinoid protein to generate ch3hgr and co hgca which is reduced back to co i hgca by hgcb 2 4fe 4s ferredoxin again this process has been confirmed in srb and irb ma et al 2019 except for this acetyl coa related pathway the knowledge on metabolic pathways for methylation is still limited other alternative pathways such as biosynthesis of l methionine was proposed to methylate hg ii but still needs more evidences ma et al 2019 due to the limited knowledge and non sufficient evidences only from the genome information it is hard to build the whole metabolic pathway of hg methylation and demethylation from the reconstructed mag but the annotated genome sequences data s1 still provided the evidence of acetyl coa pathway for hg ii methylation according to the existence of related genes enzymes and functions related to acetyl coa pathway as shown in fig 6b this microbial metabolic process is impacted by the existence of sulfur dissolved organic matters dom etc on the one hand the produced sulfide can react with hg ii to generate hgs thus reduce hg ii bioavailability on the other hand sulfate is also the electron acceptor for srb to stimulate methylation previous study ma et al 2019 suggested that the sulfate concentration less than 1 mg l would restrict the hg ii methylation for insufficient sulfate but if sulfate concentration was high possibly over 20 mg l production of mehg would be also inhibited due to the accumulation of sulfide appropriate concentration of sulfate can promote mehg production during the composting process the dissolved sulfate was gradually increased from 1 59 mg g to 3 27 mg g table s2 in supporting information as mao et al 2017 described the release of dissolved sulfate in initial periods before 3 d will improve the sulfate reducing metabolic process which promote hg ii methylation but in the late period of composting after 4 d the high level of sulfate concentration perhaps improved the generation of hgs speciation which increased from 0 41 mg kg at 1 d to 0 78 mg kg at 10 d in supporting information that would be an indication for obvious decrease of mehg content at 10 d in the meantime for mehg demethylation except for abiotic demethylation the main biotic demethylation includes reductive oxidative and methanotrophic demethylation the known pathways for mehg demethylation are shown in fig 6a reductive demethylation mainly by the mer system is broadly distributed among prokaryotes facilitating growth in the presence of high hg concentration which is the process for detoxicity by reducing hg ii to hg 0 that evaporates into atmosphere barkay and gu 2021 previous studies suggest that the oxidative demethylation is favored in anoxic environments with low hg concentration while reductive demethylation is favored in oxic and high hg environments barkay and gu 2021 thus it reasonable that reductive demethylation by the mer system should be the mainly biotic demethylation process for the high concentration of hg and mainly oxic environment in late period of sludge composting therefore our findings according to metagenomic analysis especially newly developed pipeline and database for mining hgca b and mera b genes information from the genomes capo et al 2022 lin et al 2021 pointed a deep understanding on the patterns of hg methylation and mehg demethylation in sludge composting which has never been investigated before sludge composting is a hotspot for hg speciation transformation and also a potential hotspot for hg methylation and mehg demethylation according to the profile of hgca gene and the abundance of its carriers desulfobacterota euryarchaeota and reconstructed genomes including myxococcota and methanothermobacter and the changes of hg speciation along with composting we proposed that initial periods of sludge composting tends to be a hotspot for hg ii methylation for the sufficient dissolved organics sulfate and anaerobic or anoxic environment at the same time with the increment of residual hg speciation including hgs elevated hg concentration and oxic environment in late periods of compositing hg ii methylation will be weakened while the detoxicity via reducing hg ii to hg 0 by mer system will be dominated for the wide distribution of mera gene overall because of the external aeration evolution of methylators and changed hg speciation during composting mehg demethylation presented as the dominated process and reduction of hg ii to hg 0 occurred in the late period these were the potential reasons why about 19 69 of hg and 27 36 of mehg were lost after composting however further understandings including the evidence on transformation of specific hg speciation hgs hg2 hg0 etc the coevolution with organic matters and other heavy metals and the impacts of composting process control aeration turning etc are still needed in the future studies 4 conclusion this study performed metagenomic insights into the transformation of hg speciation especially mehg in sludge composting sludge composting is a hotspot for hg speciation transformation including the hg lost with potential reduction of hg ii to hg 0 and hg speciation passivated it is also a potential hotspot for hg methylation and mehg demethylation but overall mehg demethylation was dominated metagenomic analysis further confirmed these results by the findings of high abundance of hgca and its carriers in the initial period of composting the wide distribution of mera gene in the genome also indicated the high ability of microbes in sludge composting to reduce hg ii to hg 0 furthermore both the irregular distribution of hgca in various species including actinobacteria archaea bacteroidetes desulfobacterota euryarchaeota and nitrospirae etc and opposite evolution trends between the abundance of hgca gene and its host genome bin104 myxococcota can be an indication of horizontal gene transfer or gene deletions of hgca during composting our results improved the understanding of hg and mehg transformation during sludge composting which will be also important for controlling hg

15352,many coastal ecosystems suffer from eutrophication algal blooms and dead zones due to excessive anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen n and phosphorus p this has led to regional restoration efforts that focus on managing watershed loads of n and p in chesapeake bay the largest estuary in the united states dual nutrient reductions of n and p have been pursued since the 1980s however it remains unclear whether nutrient limitation an indicator of restriction of algal growth by supplies of n and p has changed in the tributaries of chesapeake bay following decades of reduction efforts toward that end we analyzed historical data from nutrient addition bioassay experiments and data from the chesapeake bay long term water quality monitoring program for six stations in three tidal tributaries i e patuxent potomac and choptank rivers classification and regression tree cart models were developed using concurrent collections of water quality parameters for each bioassay monitoring location during 1990 2003 which satisfactorily predicted the bioassay based measures of nutrient limitation classification accuracy 96 predictions from the cart models using water quality monitoring data showed enhanced nutrient limitation over the period of 1985 2020 at four of the six stations including the downstream station in each of these three tributaries these results indicate detectable long term water quality improvements in the tidal tributaries overall this research provides a new analytical tool for detecting signs of ecosystem recovery following nutrient reductions more broadly the approach can be adapted to other waterbodies with long term bioassays and water quality data sets to detect ecosystem recovery graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nutrient limitation phytoplankton water quality long term monitoring nutrient management ecosystem recovery data availability data and code that support the findings of this study are available in zhang 2022 1 introduction eutrophication has been a major environmental issue in many coastal ecosystems around the world primarily caused by excessive anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen n and phosphorus p boesch 2019 cloern 2001 kemp et al 2009 malone and newton 2020 smith 2003 consequently many restoration programs were developed to reduce watershed nutrient loads boesch 2019 with the goal of lowering concentrations of n and p among other elements to levels that usually limit algal growth cloern et al 2014 conley 1999 elser et al 2007 hecky and kilham 1988 in general inland waters rivers and lakes are often p limited due to a high n p ratio in riverine sources e g fennel and testa 2019 and n fixation hecky and kilham 1988 schindler 1974 while marine waters are often n limited due to slow n fixation and sediment release of p hecky and kilham 1988 paerl 2018 as transitional zones between fresh and marine waters estuaries can exhibit more complex patterns cloern et al 2014 elser et al 2007 for example chesapeake bay a large and complex estuary has shown limitation of algal growth by n p light l or silicate which vary in space and season conley and malone 1992 fisher et al 1999 1992 malone et al 1996 despite efforts to reduce watershed loads of nutrients towards restoring water quality in estuaries detecting broadly consistent estuarine effects of nutrient reductions from interannual to decadal time scales is complicated by spatial heterogeneity and interannual variability in the strength of the response signal to anthropogenic and natural drivers boynton et al 2008 fisher et al 2021 langendorf et al 2021 lefcheck et al 2018 murphy et al 2022 ruhl and rybicki 2010 testa et al 2019 for chesapeake bay coordinated management efforts among the bay jurisdictions began in the 1980s to reduce nutrient loads in addition the bay total maximum daily load tmdl was established in 2010 by the u s environmental protection agency usepa to enforce nutrient reductions to improve habitat health that can fully support living resource survival growth and reproduction u s environmental protection agency 2003 2010 reductions in nutrient loads are expected to lead to enhanced nutrient limitation of phytoplankton growth however after more than three decades of reduction efforts it remains unclear whether nutrient limitation an indicator of restriction of algal growth by supplies of n and p has changed in the tidal tributaries of chesapeake bay a major obstacle in characterizing such changes is the lack of consistent nutrient bioassay experiments conducted on samples of the tidal waters to assess change in nutrient limitation throughout the restoration period although n p molar ratios can be computed from the rich monitoring record of estuarine nutrient concentrations to indicate the relative abundance of n and p such ratios may incorrectly characterize the limiting nutrient and they cannot elucidate the importance of factors such as light and silicate chorus and spijkerman 2021 ekholm 2008 ptacnik et al 2010 therefore development of new analysis tools is needed to address this challenge and help detect signs of ecosystem recovery recently zhang et al 2021 developed an empirical approach using classification and regression trees cart to integrate temporally limited nutrient bioassay results with more comprehensive tidal water quality monitoring samples to analyze nutrient limitation patterns in the mainstem of chesapeake bay specifically cart was used to predict nutrient limitation for years when bioassay experiments were not available the authors reported that the mainstem has become more limited by n during 1990 2017 which is consistent with the fact that n load from the bay watershed has declined over the last three decades hirsch et al 2010 hyer et al 2021 zhang et al 2015 the authors also noted some reduction in p limitation in the mainstem which is consistent with the facts that 1 flow normalized total p load to the mainstem has increased since the mid 1990s largely due to reduced trapping of sediment and associated p by the lower susquehanna river reservoir system hirsch 2012 langland 2015 zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 and 2 flow normalized dissolved orthophosphate load has increased in recent years fanelli et al 2019 in this work our main objective is to apply a novel statistical approach using long term monitoring data to investigate whether watershed nutrient load reductions have led to expanded nutrient limitation in the major tributaries of chesapeake bay these tributaries are closer to terrestrial nutrient and sediment sources and are more representative of typical estuaries and their response to local management actions than the mainstem of chesapeake bay which responds to geographically diverse nutrient inputs and management we assembled historical data from nutrient bioassay experiments 1990 2003 and surface samples collected from the chesapeake bay program cbp s long term fixed site water quality monitoring network 1985 2020 in three tidal tributaries choptank patuxent and potomac rivers to analyze nutrient limitation at six locations fig 1 four hypotheses were tested hypothesis 1 nutrient limitation patterns differ between these tributaries and the mainstem of the bay due to differences in n and p loading from their local watersheds hypothesis 2 cart can leverage concurrent tidal water quality monitoring data to reproduce historical nutrient bioassays results hypothesis 3 long term changes in nutrient limitation are more prevalent in the tributaries than the mainstem due to proximity to managed nutrient sources and hypothesis 4 the tidal tributaries have become more limited by nutrients following nutrient reductions correspondingly the specific goals of this work are as follows fig 2 goal 1 to characterize the seasonal patterns of nutrient limitation in the three tributaries goal 2 to develop cart models to predict bioassay based nutrient limitation using tidal water quality monitoring data in the concurrent period of 1990 2003 goal 3 to apply the cart models to water quality monitoring data in periods without bioassay data to predict nutrient limitation and explore temporal changes and goal 4 to evaluate long term changes in nutrient limitation in each tributary in the context of long term changes in estuarine nutrient concentrations and watershed loads if successful this approach could detect long term changes in ecosystem functioning and provide a quantitative tool that uses monitoring data to identify and evaluate ecosystem recovery following nutrient reductions in coastal ecosystems 2 data we used existing data sets in this research here we briefly describe the data acknowledge the data sources and refer the reader to the original sources for more details 2 1 bioassays bioassay experiments were conducted on water samples collected at six stations in the three tributaries to characterize the response of algal growth or biomass accumulation to nutrient additions fisher and gustafson 2003 2005 fisher et al 1999 1992 these six stations located in the choptank et5 1 et5 2 patuxent tf1 5 le1 1 and potomac tf2 3 le2 2 rivers fig 1 had 55 128 61 136 60 and 133 bioassays performed over the period of 1990 2003 respectively table s1 fig s1 the choptank watershed is primarily agricultural whereas the patuxent watershed has a large fraction of developed land the potomac watershed is the second largest tributary to the bay with several large urban centers e g washington d c but its upper watershed is primarily forested fisher et al 2006 irani and claggett 2010 keisman et al 2020 for each station nutrient limitation was characterized using three related metrics namely bioassay categories nutrient indices and nutrient limitation classes fig 2 the six bioassay categories represent algal responses to nutrient additions namely exn exclusive n prn primary n bnp balanced n and p prp primary p exp exclusive p and nor no response as established by fisher et al 1999 the bioassay categories were converted to nutrient indices ranging between 0 no response and 1 response to one single resource see table s2 the nutrient indices were then aggregated for each month at each station to calculate the average n index p index and l index representing the bioassay data period i e 1990 2003 finally the nutrient indices were used to determine the nutrient limitation classes 1 n limitation if n index 0 4 2 p limitation if p index 0 4 3 np limitation if both indices 0 4 or 4 nor light limitation otherwise in situ light limitation was assumed when n and p additions did not stimulate growth greater than the controls all of which were incubated at 50 ambient light this scheme reduced the bioassay samples n 467 to a data set of 72 nutrient limitation classes i e 6 stations x 12 months the bioassay data are archived in zhang 2022 2 2 water quality monitoring data the cbp partnership maintains a long term tidal water quality monitoring program with 100 stations distributed along the mainstem and its tributaries tango and batiuk 2016 u s environmental protection agency 2010 water quality monitoring data at the six tributary stations for the period of 1985 2020 were downloaded from the cbp water quality database https datahub chesapeakebay net see table s1 and fig s2 for data coverage readers are referred to zhang et al 2021 for details of the monitoring data including the initial screening of the relevant physical chemical and biological parameters as well as the pre processing steps see table 1 for the parameters which were pre processed as follows 1 negative and missing values were removed 2 only data collected in the surface and above pycnocline water column layers were kept because they are most relevant for algal growth 3 multiple values on the same day if any were averaged for each layer i e surface and above pycnocline and then the surface and above pycnocline layer means were averaged in addition watershed daily river discharges nutrient loads and sediment loads were computed by aggregating monitoring data from the nontidal watershed and adjoining tidal watershed fig 1 for each station the nontidal watershed is monitored at or near its fall line i e transition location between nontidal and tidal influence by the u s geological survey usgs through its river input monitoring rim program fig 1 table s1 the rim station represents 16 40 and 82 of the entire watershed for the choptank patuxent and potomac rivers respectively loads at the station called rim loads are reported by the usgs using the weighted regressions on time discharge and season wrtds method mason et al 2021 the watershed adjacent to tidal waters is not monitored and its loads called below rim loads and river flows were estimated from the cbp phase 6 watershed model chesapeake bay program 2020 using the tidal segments above each station see table s1 for example the watershed load for patuxent tf1 5 is the sum of its rim load usgs station 01594440 and below rim load tidal segments wbrtf and paxtf the watershed load for patuxent le1 1 is the sum of its rim load usgs station 01594440 and below rim load tidal segments wbrtf paxtf paxoh and paxmh like the bioassay data the water quality monitoring data are archived in zhang 2022 3 methods 3 1 cart cart models were developed to relate the nutrient bioassay categories in table s2 response variable to a set of initially selected water quality parameters in table 1 explanatory variables for the period of 1990 2003 for each tributary station fig 2 cart was chosen because it has previously been used to model nutrient limitation in the mainstem of chesapeake bay zhang et al 2021 in brief cart splits the full data which are contained in the top node on the tree sequentially into subgroups intermediate nodes and stops at the bottom of the tree terminal nodes breiman 1984 at every node except the terminal nodes cart evaluates all possible split points for each explanatory variable and selects the variable and split point that can lead to two most dissimilar subgroups ideally cart trees should not be too large over fit or too small under fit and should have informative splitting rules and pure terminal nodes breiman 1984 loh 2014 cart can incorporate multiple explanatory variables and thus utilize information beyond nutrient concentrations e g water temperature in addition cart allows flexibility in relating the response variable to the explanatory variables including multiple cutoffs and interactions e g a variable can appear multiple times on the tree with different splitting thresholds moreover our prior work zhang et al 2021 showed similar classification performance between cart and other machine learning methods i e random forest and boosted trees 3 2 exhaustive search of candidate variables to determine the optimal cart models an exhaustive search algorithm was developed in r statistical software to evaluate all possible combinations of the candidate variables for predicting nutrient bioassay results at each tributary station fig 2 this new algorithm searches for a global optimum because the model form can start with any explanatory variable and incrementally add any of the remaining variables to improve prediction for parsimony this algorithm was set to allow no more than six variables note that some model forms had fewer than six variables because the algorithm sampled the variables with replacement cart models were implemented in the rpart package therneau and atkinson 2019 with the following parameterization minsplit 2 maxdepth 5 cp 0 01 in the exhaustive search all candidate model forms were evaluated using the leave one out cross validation loocv which provides a fair assessment of the model s classification accuracy and gives insights on how well the model generalizes to a new data set in each iteration one data record was left out and treated as new data the remaining data records were used to train the model which was then used to make the prediction for the left out data for each model the overall accuracy was calculated as the weighted average of the category based accuracies 3 3 ensemble models for each tributary station three model forms with the highest loocv accuracy were retained for the next step in general the three cart model forms selected for bioassay prediction at each station have different trees and different best performing bioassay categories based on their confusion matrices see table s3 therefore an ensemble model was developed for each tributary station to combine the strength of the three model forms fig 2 this approach compares predictions from each of the three cart models and selects the predicted class that has the highest probability for cases where model predictions diverge the prediction with the highest probability is selected the advantage of such an ensemble model approach has been demonstrated in our prior analysis of the mainstem nutrient limitation zhang et al 2021 like the observed bioassay categories predictions of bioassay categories from the ensemble model for each tributary station were converted to nutrient indices which were then aggregated to long term 1990 2003 average nutrient indices for each calendar month finally the average nutrient indices were used to determine the nutrient limitation classes as described in section 2 1 the cart predicted nutrient limitation classes were compared with the bioassay based classes to quantify the performance of the cart ensemble models the r code for the cart model analysis is archived in zhang 2022 3 4 model application to explore potential temporal changes in nutrient limitation the ensemble model for each of the six tributary stations was applied to new periods without bioassay data to predict nutrient limitation fig 2 first predictions were made for two decadal periods i e 1985 1994 and 2011 2020 and the resulting decadal average nutrient limitation classes were compared to assess temporal changes note that all available water quality monitoring data i e all months and years were used in this analysis as opposed to the model development step where only those paired with the bioassay samples were used table s1 an additional means of quantifying changes in nutrient limitation new relative to zhang et al 2021 was to apply the ensemble models to three year running windows over the period of 1985 2020 to compute average nutrient indices for each window and then to compute the mann kendall trends of the nutrient indices kendall 1975 sen 1968 this approach has three advantages 1 it avoids the subjectivity in choosing the thresholds e g 0 4 when converting nutrient indices to nutrient limitation classes see section 2 1 2 it avoids the choice of two temporal periods and fully utilizes the entire period of data for detecting changes and 3 it better distinguishes nutrient indices that belong to the same nutrient limitation classes e g two n indices 0 6 and 0 7 both correspond to n limitation but the latter indicates a stronger n limitation 3 5 tributary stories to provide a portrait of long term changes for each of the three tributaries the cart estimated changes in nutrient limitation were evaluated in the context of estimated changes in monitored estuarine nutrient concentrations and estimated changes in watershed loads fig 2 for estuarine concentrations tn tp and tss long term trends were calculated by first fitting generalized additive models gams to the observed data for the period of 1985 2020 with explanatory variables including date day of year and upstream river flow the fitted gam models were then used to estimate what the estuarine concentrations would have been if freshwater flow had been average for the entire period i e flow adjusted concentrations the percent change of these flow adjusted concentrations between the start and end of the period of interest is the gam trend murphy et al 2019 for watershed loads tn tp din dip and ss the rim load and below rim load were aggregated for each monitoring station see section 2 2 and the long term trends were calculated using the mann kendall test kendall 1975 sen 1968 furthermore watershed loads were divided by river discharges to obtain the so called flow weighted concentrations fwcs which can better reveal temporal trends in the riverine inputs by constraining the effect of interannual variability in river discharges zhang et al 2022a 4 results 4 1 seasonal patterns of tributary nutrient limitation goal 1 historical nutrient bioassays 1990 2003 provide a summary of the seasonal patterns of nutrient limitation in each of the three tidal tributaries left side of each graph in fig 3 in the choptank river at the upstream station et5 1 nor is prevalent i e 9 out of 12 months with the exception that the warmer months july september are classified as n limitation at the downstream station et5 2 nor is less prevalent i e 2 out of 12 months and most months show n limitation p limitation or both with n limitation most common in the patuxent river at the upstream station tf1 5 nor is prevalent in the early months of the year january may whereas the later months are classified as n limitation p limitation or both with n limitation most common at the downstream station le1 1 nor is absent and most months are classified as n limitation i e 10 out of 12 months in the potomac river at the upstream station tf2 3 nor is prevalent i e 10 out of 12 months except that august and september are classified as p limitation at the downstream station le2 2 all four types of nutrient limitation are present generally with nor in the winter months p limitation in the spring months and n limitation in the summer fall months overall the upstream stations in these tributaries are strongly dominated by nor followed by n limitation during warm seasons with rare occurrence of p and np limitation in contrast the downstream stations show limited presence of nor moderately more p and np limitation and much more n limitation 4 2 development of cart models for modeling tributary nutrient limitation goal 2 the exhaustive search algorithm identified three cart model forms for bioassay prediction at each tributary station the ensemble model for each station combined the strength of the three selected models by preserving the highest classification accuracy for each applicable bioassay category table 2 for example the ensemble model for et5 1 has an accuracy of 82 and 96 for exn n 11 and nor n 24 respectively and an overall accuracy of 86 for all bioassay categories n 43 for all six tributary stations the ensemble models have an overall accuracy between 69 and 88 with a median of 82 the ensemble models were further evaluated for nutrient limitation classes in the 1990 2003 period which were converted from the bioassay categories for each month at each station right side of each graph in fig 3 of the 72 cases i e 12 months x 6 stations only three showed mismatches between the cart based and the bioassay based nutrient limitation classes including one month at et5 2 choptank one month at le1 1 patuxent and one month at t2 3 potomac therefore the station specific cart models satisfactorily reproduced the bioassay based nutrient limitation classes classification accuracy 1 3 72 100 96 in comparison our cart models published for the mainstem of chesapeake bay zhang et al 2021 when applied to these tributary stations resulted in 36 mismatches accuracy 1 36 72 100 50 with the bioassay based nutrient limitation classes fig s3 our ensemble models for the tributary stations have selected different combinations of explanatory variables suggesting different controls on nutrient limitation table 2 for example the two patuxent stations are both affected by din and dip but only the upstream station tf1 5 is also affected by watershed relevant variables i e river discharge q ws the ratio of din to dip dindip ws and the ratio of tn to tp tntp ws among the six stations the most common explanatory variables selected by cart are din dip n 6 dindip ws n 5 and dindip ratio wtemp tss and tp n 4 specifically din dip and dindip ws are influential at all three upstream stations whereas din dip tp and wtemp are influential at all three downstream stations 4 3 application of cart models for quantifying temporal changes in nutrient limitation goal 3 cart predictions of nutrient limitation for the six tributary stations showed temporal changes between the two decadal periods 1985 1994 vs 2011 2020 fig 4 of the 72 station month pairs enhanced nutrient limitation occurred in 6 pairs at the upstream stations and 13 pairs at the downstream stations of these pairs 15 involved nor changing to n p or np limitation and 4 involved n or p limitation changing to np limitation only two station month pairs showed weakened nutrient limitation one at choptank et5 1 n changing to nor and the other at potomac le2 2 p changing to nor overall four of these six stations i e all three downstream stations plus patuxent tf1 5 were predicted by the ensemble models to have clearly become more limited by nutrients mann kendall trends quantified for the cart estimated monthly nutrient indices over the period of 1985 2020 table 3 are generally consistent with the comparisons between the two decadal periods fig 4 overall four of the six stations i e all three downstream stations plus patuxent tf1 5 were predicted by the ensemble models to show a preponderance of increasing n or p indices i e enhanced nutrient limitation collectively these four stations showed 24 months of enhanced n limitation 16 months of enhanced p limitation and 17 months of weakened l limitation by contrast choptank et5 1 showed mixed changes in nutrient indices and tf2 3 potomac river showed limited change 4 4 development of tributary stories on long term changes goal 4 here we provide a portrait of long term changes in the three tributaries by linking the estimated changes in nutrient limitation with the estimated changes in monitored estuarine nutrient concentrations and estimated changes in watershed loads and their flow weighted concentrations fwcs table 4 in the choptank river et5 1 showed mixed changes the lack of a sustained reduction in n limitation is consistent with the statistically significant increase in estuarine tn concentration at this station although fwcs of tn din tp and dip showed statistically significant declines their watershed loads and ss loads showed non significant trends in contrast with et5 1 et5 2 showed a recovery trajectory i e more n and p limitation and less nor these changes are consistent with the statistically significant declines in estuarine tn tp and tss concentrations at this station tn din tp and dip all showed statistically significant declines in terms of fwc although only dip showed a statistically significant decline in terms of load in the patuxent river tf1 5 and le1 1 both showed recovery trajectories i e more n and p limitation and less nor these changes are consistent with the statistically significant declines in estuarine tn and tp concentrations at these stations they are also consistent with the statistically significant declines in tn din and dip loads and significant declines in tn din tp and dip fwcs in the potomac river tf2 3 showed limited change in nutrient limitation this is not consistent with the statistically significant declines in estuarine tn tp and tss concentrations at this station or the statistically significant declines in tn din and dip loads and their fwcs in contrast with tf2 3 le2 2 showed a recovery trajectory i e more n and p limitation and less nor these changes are consistent with the statistically significant declines in estuarine tn and tp concentrations at this station they are also consistent with the statistically significant declines in tn din and dip loads and their fwcs 5 discussion 5 1 hypothesis 1 nutrient limitation patterns differ between these tributaries and the mainstem of the bay due to differences in n and p loading from their local watersheds the bioassay results show different seasonal and spatial patterns of nutrient limitation in the tributaries fig 3 the spatial contrast predominant nor upstream n and p limitation downstream is consistent with high turbidity and or high ambient nutrient concentrations at upstream stations in close proximity to watershed loads and in contrast lower turbidity and lower nutrient concentrations at downstream stations indicating high rates of sedimentation and nutrient assimilation e g plant uptake denitrification that limit seaward nutrient fluxes buchanan 2020 fisher et al 2021 noe et al 2020 testa et al 2013 these results are consistent with the tidal monitoring data which show small proportions of bloom limiting concentrations of din and dip at the upstream stations but much larger proportions of bloom limiting concentrations at the downstream stations fig 5 this spatial contrast in nutrient limitation in the tributaries is consistent with the mainstem of the bay fisher et al 1999 kemp et al 2005 zhang et al 2021 although the spatial scales differ between the tributaries and the mainstem they consistently show nor in the upper regions due to conditions of nutrient saturation and high turbidity in contrast with more frequent nutrient limitation in the lower more saline regions thus our results do not support hypothesis 1 5 2 hypothesis 2 cart can leverage concurrent tidal water quality monitoring data to reproduce historical nutrient bioassays results the station specific cart models satisfactorily reproduced the bioassay based nutrient limitation classes using tidal water quality monitoring data classification accuracy 96 fig 3 by contrast the cart models previously published for the mainstem zhang et al 2021 failed to adequately reproduce nutrient limitation in the tributaries accuracy 50 fig s3 therefore we recommend the development of station specific cart models for the tidal tributaries to capture unique patterns and drivers of nutrient limitation these results support hypothesis 2 and show that cart is an accurate estimation tool for characterizing nutrient limitation for times without bioassay measurements thereby greatly expanding the temporal scales of such assessment in this regard bioassay measurements in other major tributaries e g james rappahannock and york would be helpful for development of cart models depending on the availability of resources sampling monthly or seasonally for several years at each selected location to capture different conditions could help with model development our ensemble models for the tributary stations have selected different combinations of explanatory variables table 2 suggesting different controls on nutrient limitation among the six stations the most common explanatory variables selected by cart are din dip dindip ws dindip ratio wtemp tss and tp specifically din dip and dindip ws are influential at all three upstream stations whereas din dip tp and wtemp are influential at all three downstream stations the selected variables show that phytoplankton growth can be affected by estuarine chemical biological and physical conditions as well as watershed inputs notably din and dip concentrations are selected by the ensemble models of all six tributary stations which represent the amount of nutrients available for phytoplankton growth at a given moment when light tss and other factors are not controlling phytoplankton growth nutrient concentrations determine how much of the light induced potential of phytoplankton for photosynthesis and growth can be realized buchanan 2020 fisher et al 1999 1992 concentrations above bloom limiting thresholds i e 0 07 mg l 1 for din 0 007 mg l 1 for dip are associated with a lack of response to nutrient additions fisher and gustafson 2003 and riverine concentrations typically exceed these thresholds by 2 3 orders of magnitude fisher et al 2021 in addition tss increases light attenuation and leads to enhanced light limitation in situ bilotta and brazier 2008 buchanan 2020 cerco et al 2013 testa et al 2019 turner et al 2021 beyond these chemical parameters wtemp represents the integrated effect of seasonal shifts due to temperature effects on maximum phytoplankton growth rates day length and daylight available for photosynthesis as well as seasonal changes in mixing light field and plankton community composition droop 1983 fisher et al 1999 1992 kemp et al 2005 malone et al 1996 the local variations in these potential controls on phytoplankton growth can lead to spatial and temporal variations in light and nutrient limitation in the tributaries and our cart models reveal these local controls lastly we note that the performance of the tributary cart models is inevitably constrained by the precision of bioassay experiments the sample size of each bioassay category and the inherent variability in water samples fisher and gustafson 2003 2005 fisher et al 1999 1992 moreover a key assumption of cart is the stationarity in the derived relationships this caveat can inadvertently force predictions for new periods to strictly follow a particular splitting rule of the classification tree to fall into a fixed terminal node class regardless of any changes in explanatory variables irrelevant to that splitting rule zhang et al 2021 in this regard additional bioassays can be useful for validating and or re calibrating these cart models following known changes in local watershed inputs or developing new cart models in tributaries where no bioassays have yet been done furthermore the tidal water quality monitoring data can provide some level of validation for example the cart inference on the nutrient limitation conditions and changes is generally supported by the patterns of estuarine din and dip concentrations fig 5 5 3 hypothesis 3 long term changes in nutrient limitation are more prevalent in the tributaries than the mainstem due to proximity to managed nutrient sources our results also support hypothesis 3 predictions from the cart models showed long term recovery trajectories at four of the six tributary stations including all three downstream stations which indicate long term water quality improvements table 3 fig 4 in contrast with nutrient limitation in the mainstem of the bay zhang et al 2021 nutrient limitation in these tributaries have had more occurrences of change specifically enhanced nutrient limitation is observed with 19 station month pairs in the decadal comparison fig 4 the mainstem of the bay is influenced by nutrient inputs from all major tributaries among which the susquehanna river is the largest in terms of freshwater and nutrient inputs hagy et al 2004 murphy et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 as reported previously the mainstem has become more limited by n in the more recent period consistent with the long term reduction in n load hirsch et al 2010 hyer et al 2021 zhang et al 2015 however the mainstem showed some reduction in p limitation consistent with increases in tp and dip loads fanelli et al 2019 hirsch 2012 zhang et al 2013 2016 compared to the mainstem the three tributaries analyzed in this study especially their upstream stations are less influenced by the susquehanna river in addition these tributaries are embedded within the landscape and closer to watershed sources than the mainstem these configurations can result in generally stronger responses in the tributaries to nutrient reductions than the mainstem as shown in the cart estimated changes in nutrient limitation furthermore each of the three tributaries analyzed include major wastewater treatment plants wwtps that were upgraded during the study period boynton et al 2008 fisher et al 2021 lyerly et al 2014 ruhl and rybicki 2010 in addition to local nutrient sources these tributaries are also connected with the mainstem of the bay and the generally stronger responses at the downstream stations than the upstream stations may suggest that these tributaries are also positively influenced by the water quality improvement in the mainstem that reflects watershed wide nutrient reductions 5 4 hypothesis 4 the tidal tributaries have become more limited by nutrients following nutrient reductions our results also provide evidence that supports hypothesis 4 table 4 the long term recovery trajectories observed in these tributaries align well with other documented water quality improvements that have been linked to management efforts toward nutrient reductions boynton et al 2008 2013 fisher et al 2021 jones 2020 lefcheck et al 2018 murphy et al 2022 2011 ruhl and rybicki 2010 testa et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 2018 these efforts have been pursued through the implementation of wastewater atmospheric agricultural and urban stormwater source controls to address the reduction goals outlined in the chesapeake bay partnership agreements chesapeake bay partnership 1983 chesapeake executive council 1987 2000 2014 and the bay tmdl u s environmental protection agency 2010 in the choptank river the mixed trends at et5 1 indicate the lack of sufficient reduction in nutrient loads with n believed to be affected by a groundwater legacies due to accumulations of historical agricultural inputs chang et al 2021 hirsch et al 2010 and b a long term increase in river discharge data not shown in addition concentrations at et5 1 have not declined to sufficiently low levels to trigger nutrient limitation as demonstrated by the small proportions of bloom limiting concentrations of din and dip fig 5 therefore stronger reductions in nutrient loads are needed for making progress at et5 1 by contrast the recovery trajectory at et5 2 highlights the importance of nutrient reductions from the below rim watershed since nonpoint sources in the choptank have shown a statistically significant increase fisher et al 2021 this recovery can be attributed to point source reductions as achieved by the p detergent ban and technology upgrades at wwtps especially the cambridge and easton wwtps fisher et al 2021 lyerly et al 2014 in the patuxent river both stations showed enhanced nutrient limitation consistent with reductions in nutrient loads from the watershed for n the reduction reflects a combination of reductions in rim load and below rim load driven by biological nutrient removal at major wwtps boynton et al 2008 lyerly et al 2014 and reductions of atmospheric deposition eshleman et al 2013 lyerly et al 2014 like the choptank river the patuxent river has benefited from p reduction from point sources owing to the p detergent ban and technology upgrades at wwtps boynton et al 2008 lyerly et al 2014 in the potomac river tf2 3 showed a lack of change in nutrient limitation despite the significant declines in estuarine concentrations and watershed loads given that tf2 3 has been dominated by nor fig 3 it is likely that light availability is still the primary limiting factor to phytoplankton growth which can hinder the responses of phytoplankton to nutrient reductions another explanation is that nutrient reductions from the watershed have not resulted in sufficiently low estuarine concentrations to trigger nutrient limitation as demonstrated by the small proportions of bloom limiting concentrations of din and dip fig 5 in addition to external sources internally accumulated nutrients may play a role and delay the response of water column nutrient concentrations to watershed load reductions jones 2020 by contrast the recovery trajectory at le2 2 highlights the importance of instream processing and or nutrient reductions from the below rim watershed especially in the areas between the two stations the reduction in n loads reflects a combination of reductions in rim load and below rim load with some of the major reductions attributed to point sources and atmospheric deposition while the atmospheric deposition reduction is linked to the clean air act eshleman et al 2013 lyerly et al 2014 the point source reduction is attributed to biological nutrient removal at major wwtps in the d c metropolitan region especially the blue plains advanced wwtp the largest of its kind in the bay watershed lyerly et al 2014 ruhl and rybicki 2010 the reduction in p loads is primarily due to the detergent ban and technology upgrades at wwtps lyerly et al 2014 ruhl and rybicki 2010 5 5 summary and management implications our results demonstrate long term recovery trajectories in the tidal tributaries to chesapeake bay which have management implications for chesapeake bay and other coastal ecosystems the first main message is that management efforts focused on dual nutrient reductions have resulted in long term water quality improvements in the tidal tributaries of chesapeake bay this conclusion inferred from our cart predictions is consistent with studies on other waterbodies for example monitoring and bioassay data collected in the james river which is the third largest tributary to chesapeake bay showed that nutrient reductions have led to declined nutrient concentrations and enhanced nutrient limitation wood and bukaveckas 2013 a study on the continental shelf of the northern gulf of mexico predicted an expansion of p limitation following reductions in dip concentrations in the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers laurent et al 2012 and their results compare well with observations in the neuse river estuary the reduction of p load due to a p detergent ban and improved wastewater removal resulted in a decrease in upstream freshwater phytoplankton and nuisance algal blooms paerl et al 2004 in a danish study coastal waters showed clear signs of improvement following reductions of n and p loads since 1990 including significant declines in nutrient concentrations stronger potential p limitation in the 1990s and stronger potential n limitation thereafter riemann et al 2015 in the river loire france total phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biomass declined significantly since 1991 due to the reduction of riverine p minaudo et al 2021 similarly an irish study on 18 river systems reported significant reductions of p load from 15 watersheds which led to parallel improvements in estuarine water in eight downstream systems with significant decreases in estuarine p concentration longphuirt et al 2016 in the inner oslofjorden norway declined p concentration has contributed to the decrease in chlorophyll a from 1980s to 1990s lundsør et al 2020 in the toyama bay japan 25 years of reduction of p load especially from wwtps has led to significant reductions of riverine loads and enhanced p limitation in coastal waters katazakai and zhang 2021 another main message is that nutrient reductions have not always resulted in enhanced nutrient limitation in tidal waters of chesapeake bay e g tf2 3 this may be because 1 the phytoplankton are still mainly limited by light availability or other factors 2 external nutrient loads have not been reduced sufficiently to lower the estuarine nutrient concentrations 3 internally accumulated nutrients are delaying the response of water column concentrations to reductions of external inputs jones 2020 and or 4 top down controls of phytoplankton by grazers cohen et al 1984 or competition for nutrients from submerged aquatic vegetation duarte 1995 van gerven et al 2015 only occasionally limit phytoplankton growth at these tributary stations we note that different locations of the tributaries can exhibit divergent trajectories and responses therefore restoration may be most effective if strategies are tailored to locally specific characteristics wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2022a while management actions toward reducing nutrients from point and atmospheric sources seem to have resulted in the greatest water quality improvements so far continued nutrient reductions under the bay tmdl especially nonpoint sources are critical to restoring the bay and its tributaries ator et al 2020 hyer et al 2021 sabo et al 2022 zhang et al 2022a 2022b 6 conclusions large scale nutrient reduction goals have been in place for decades as targets to restore water quality and habitat health in chesapeake bay and many other estuaries worldwide boesch 2019 cloern 2001 kemp et al 2009 malone and newton 2020 smith 2003 management actions resulting in reductions in nutrient loads are expected to lead to enhanced nutrient limitation of phytoplankton growth but it was unclear whether nutrient limitation has changed in the tidal tributaries following decades of reduction efforts in this context we demonstrate that machine learning approaches i e cart can provide an innovative analysis tool to combine historical data from bioassay experiments with data from the tidal water quality monitoring network for enhancing water quality characterization and assessing water quality response to management actions specifically we have extended the previous work of zhang et al 2021 to develop cart models for analyzing nutrient limitation in three tributaries of chesapeake bay cart satisfactorily reproduced the bioassay based nutrient limitation patterns at the tributary stations classification accuracy 96 such an approach can greatly expand our ability to characterize nutrient limitation from the long term tidal water quality monitoring data both for characterizing current conditions and for predicting temporal changes in nutrient limitation our results demonstrate long term recovery trajectories in the tidal tributaries to chesapeake bay which have management implications for chesapeake bay and other ecosystems overall this research provides a new analytical tool for detecting changes in ecosystem functioning from long term monitoring data and presents signs of ecosystem recovery following nutrient reductions the approach can be adapted to other

15352,many coastal ecosystems suffer from eutrophication algal blooms and dead zones due to excessive anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen n and phosphorus p this has led to regional restoration efforts that focus on managing watershed loads of n and p in chesapeake bay the largest estuary in the united states dual nutrient reductions of n and p have been pursued since the 1980s however it remains unclear whether nutrient limitation an indicator of restriction of algal growth by supplies of n and p has changed in the tributaries of chesapeake bay following decades of reduction efforts toward that end we analyzed historical data from nutrient addition bioassay experiments and data from the chesapeake bay long term water quality monitoring program for six stations in three tidal tributaries

introduction eutrophication has been a major environmental issue in many coastal ecosystems around the world primarily caused by excessive anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen n and phosphorus p boesch 2019 cloern 2001 kemp et al 2009 malone and newton 2020 smith 2003 consequently many restoration programs were developed to reduce watershed nutrient loads boesch 2019 with the goal of lowering concentrations of n and p among other elements to levels that usually limit algal growth cloern et al 2014 conley 1999 elser et al 2007 hecky and kilham 1988 in general inland waters rivers and lakes are often p limited due to a high n p ratio in riverine sources e g fennel and testa 2019 and n fixation hecky and kilham 1988 schindler 1974 while marine waters are often n limited due to slow n fixation and sediment release of p hecky and kilham 1988 paerl 2018 as transitional zones between fresh and marine waters estuaries can exhibit more complex patterns cloern et al 2014 elser et al 2007 for example chesapeake bay a large and complex estuary has shown limitation of algal growth by n p light l or silicate which vary in space and season conley and malone 1992 fisher et al 1999 1992 malone et al 1996 despite efforts to reduce watershed loads of nutrients towards restoring water quality in estuaries detecting broadly consistent estuarine effects of nutrient reductions from interannual to decadal time scales is complicated by spatial heterogeneity and interannual variability in the strength of the response signal to anthropogenic and natural drivers boynton et al 2008 fisher et al 2021 langendorf et al 2021 lefcheck et al 2018 murphy et al 2022 ruhl and rybicki 2010 testa et al 2019 for chesapeake bay coordinated management efforts among the bay jurisdictions began in the 1980s to reduce nutrient loads in addition the bay total maximum daily load tmdl was established in 2010 by the u s environmental protection agency usepa to enforce nutrient reductions to improve habitat health that can fully support living resource survival growth and reproduction u s environmental protection agency 2003 2010 reductions in nutrient loads are expected to lead to enhanced nutrient limitation of phytoplankton growth however after more than three decades of reduction efforts it remains unclear whether nutrient limitation an indicator of restriction of algal growth by supplies of n and p has changed in the tidal tributaries of chesapeake bay a major obstacle in characterizing such changes is the lack of consistent nutrient bioassay experiments conducted on samples of the tidal waters to assess change in nutrient limitation throughout the restoration period although n p molar ratios can be computed from the rich monitoring record of estuarine nutrient concentrations to indicate the relative abundance of n and p such ratios may incorrectly characterize the limiting nutrient and they cannot elucidate the importance of factors such as light and silicate chorus and spijkerman 2021 ekholm 2008 ptacnik et al 2010 therefore development of new analysis tools is needed to address this challenge and help detect signs of ecosystem recovery recently zhang et al 2021 developed an empirical approach using classification and regression trees cart to integrate temporally limited nutrient bioassay results with more comprehensive tidal water quality monitoring samples to analyze nutrient limitation patterns in the mainstem of chesapeake bay specifically cart was used to predict nutrient limitation for years when bioassay experiments were not available the authors reported that the mainstem has become more limited by n during 1990 2017 which is consistent with the fact that n load from the bay watershed has declined over the last three decades hirsch et al 2010 hyer et al 2021 zhang et al 2015 the authors also noted some reduction in p limitation in the mainstem which is consistent with the facts that 1 flow normalized total p load to the mainstem has increased since the mid 1990s largely due to reduced trapping of sediment and associated p by the lower susquehanna river reservoir system hirsch 2012 langland 2015 zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 and 2 flow normalized dissolved orthophosphate load has increased in recent years fanelli et al 2019 in this work our main objective is to apply a novel statistical approach using long term monitoring data to investigate whether watershed nutrient load reductions have led to expanded nutrient limitation in the major tributaries of chesapeake bay these tributaries are closer to terrestrial nutrient and sediment sources and are more representative of typical estuaries and their response to local management actions than the mainstem of chesapeake bay which responds to geographically diverse nutrient inputs and management we assembled historical data from nutrient bioassay experiments 1990 2003 and surface samples collected from the chesapeake bay program cbp s long term fixed site water quality monitoring network 1985 2020 in three tidal tributaries choptank patuxent and potomac rivers to analyze nutrient limitation at six locations fig 1 four hypotheses were tested hypothesis 1 nutrient limitation patterns differ between these tributaries and the mainstem of the bay due to differences in n and p loading from their local watersheds hypothesis 2 cart can leverage concurrent tidal water quality monitoring data to reproduce historical nutrient bioassays results hypothesis 3 long term changes in nutrient limitation are more prevalent in the tributaries than the mainstem due to proximity to managed nutrient sources and hypothesis 4 the tidal tributaries have become more limited by nutrients following nutrient reductions correspondingly the specific goals of this work are as follows fig 2 goal 1 to characterize the seasonal patterns of nutrient limitation in the three tributaries goal 2 to develop cart models to predict bioassay based nutrient limitation using tidal water quality monitoring data in the concurrent period of 1990 2003 goal 3 to apply the cart models to water quality monitoring data in periods without bioassay data to predict nutrient limitation and explore temporal changes and goal 4 to evaluate long term changes in nutrient limitation in each tributary in the context of long term changes in estuarine nutrient concentrations and watershed loads if successful this approach could detect long term changes in ecosystem functioning and provide a quantitative tool that uses monitoring data to identify and evaluate ecosystem recovery following nutrient reductions in coastal ecosystems 2 data we used existing data sets in this research here we briefly describe the data acknowledge the data sources and refer the reader to the original sources for more details 2 1 bioassays bioassay experiments were conducted on water samples collected at six stations in the three tributaries to characterize the response of algal growth or biomass accumulation to nutrient additions fisher and gustafson 2003 2005 fisher et al 1999 1992 these six stations located in the choptank et5 1 et5 2 patuxent tf1 5 le1 1 and potomac tf2 3 le2 2 rivers fig 1 had 55 128 61 136 60 and 133 bioassays performed over the period of 1990 2003 respectively table s1 fig s1 the choptank watershed is primarily agricultural whereas the patuxent watershed has a large fraction of developed land the potomac watershed is the second largest tributary to the bay with several large urban centers e g washington d c but its upper watershed is primarily forested fisher et al 2006 irani and claggett 2010 keisman et al 2020 for each station nutrient limitation was characterized using three related metrics namely bioassay categories nutrient indices and nutrient limitation classes fig 2 the six bioassay categories represent algal responses to nutrient additions namely exn exclusive n prn primary n bnp balanced n and p prp primary p exp exclusive p and nor no response as established by fisher et al 1999 the bioassay categories were converted to nutrient indices ranging between 0 no response and 1 response to one single resource see table s2 the nutrient indices were then aggregated for each month at each station to calculate the average n index p index and l index representing the bioassay data period i e 1990 2003 finally the nutrient indices were used to determine the nutrient limitation classes 1 n limitation if n index 0 4 2 p limitation if p index 0 4 3 np limitation if both indices 0 4 or 4 nor light limitation otherwise in situ light limitation was assumed when n and p additions did not stimulate growth greater than the controls all of which were incubated at 50 ambient light this scheme reduced the bioassay samples n 467 to a data set of 72 nutrient limitation classes i e 6 stations x 12 months the bioassay data are archived in zhang 2022 2 2 water quality monitoring data the cbp partnership maintains a long term tidal water quality monitoring program with 100 stations distributed along the mainstem and its tributaries tango and batiuk 2016 u s environmental protection agency 2010 water quality monitoring data at the six tributary stations for the period of 1985 2020 were downloaded from the cbp water quality database https datahub chesapeakebay net see table s1 and fig s2 for data coverage readers are referred to zhang et al 2021 for details of the monitoring data including the initial screening of the relevant physical chemical and biological parameters as well as the pre processing steps see table 1 for the parameters which were pre processed as follows 1 negative and missing values were removed 2 only data collected in the surface and above pycnocline water column layers were kept because they are most relevant for algal growth 3 multiple values on the same day if any were averaged for each layer i e surface and above pycnocline and then the surface and above pycnocline layer means were averaged in addition watershed daily river discharges nutrient loads and sediment loads were computed by aggregating monitoring data from the nontidal watershed and adjoining tidal watershed fig 1 for each station the nontidal watershed is monitored at or near its fall line i e transition location between nontidal and tidal influence by the u s geological survey usgs through its river input monitoring rim program fig 1 table s1 the rim station represents 16 40 and 82 of the entire watershed for the choptank patuxent and potomac rivers respectively loads at the station called rim loads are reported by the usgs using the weighted regressions on time discharge and season wrtds method mason et al 2021 the watershed adjacent to tidal waters is not monitored and its loads called below rim loads and river flows were estimated from the cbp phase 6 watershed model chesapeake bay program 2020 using the tidal segments above each station see table s1 for example the watershed load for patuxent tf1 5 is the sum of its rim load usgs station 01594440 and below rim load tidal segments wbrtf and paxtf the watershed load for patuxent le1 1 is the sum of its rim load usgs station 01594440 and below rim load tidal segments wbrtf paxtf paxoh and paxmh like the bioassay data the water quality monitoring data are archived in zhang 2022 3 methods 3 1 cart cart models were developed to relate the nutrient bioassay categories in table s2 response variable to a set of initially selected water quality parameters in table 1 explanatory variables for the period of 1990 2003 for each tributary station fig 2 cart was chosen because it has previously been used to model nutrient limitation in the mainstem of chesapeake bay zhang et al 2021 in brief cart splits the full data which are contained in the top node on the tree sequentially into subgroups intermediate nodes and stops at the bottom of the tree terminal nodes breiman 1984 at every node except the terminal nodes cart evaluates all possible split points for each explanatory variable and selects the variable and split point that can lead to two most dissimilar subgroups ideally cart trees should not be too large over fit or too small under fit and should have informative splitting rules and pure terminal nodes breiman 1984 loh 2014 cart can incorporate multiple explanatory variables and thus utilize information beyond nutrient concentrations e g water temperature in addition cart allows flexibility in relating the response variable to the explanatory variables including multiple cutoffs and interactions e g a variable can appear multiple times on the tree with different splitting thresholds moreover our prior work zhang et al 2021 showed similar classification performance between cart and other machine learning methods i e random forest and boosted trees 3 2 exhaustive search of candidate variables to determine the optimal cart models an exhaustive search algorithm was developed in r statistical software to evaluate all possible combinations of the candidate variables for predicting nutrient bioassay results at each tributary station fig 2 this new algorithm searches for a global optimum because the model form can start with any explanatory variable and incrementally add any of the remaining variables to improve prediction for parsimony this algorithm was set to allow no more than six variables note that some model forms had fewer than six variables because the algorithm sampled the variables with replacement cart models were implemented in the rpart package therneau and atkinson 2019 with the following parameterization minsplit 2 maxdepth 5 cp 0 01 in the exhaustive search all candidate model forms were evaluated using the leave one out cross validation loocv which provides a fair assessment of the model s classification accuracy and gives insights on how well the model generalizes to a new data set in each iteration one data record was left out and treated as new data the remaining data records were used to train the model which was then used to make the prediction for the left out data for each model the overall accuracy was calculated as the weighted average of the category based accuracies 3 3 ensemble models for each tributary station three model forms with the highest loocv accuracy were retained for the next step in general the three cart model forms selected for bioassay prediction at each station have different trees and different best performing bioassay categories based on their confusion matrices see table s3 therefore an ensemble model was developed for each tributary station to combine the strength of the three model forms fig 2 this approach compares predictions from each of the three cart models and selects the predicted class that has the highest probability for cases where model predictions diverge the prediction with the highest probability is selected the advantage of such an ensemble model approach has been demonstrated in our prior analysis of the mainstem nutrient limitation zhang et al 2021 like the observed bioassay categories predictions of bioassay categories from the ensemble model for each tributary station were converted to nutrient indices which were then aggregated to long term 1990 2003 average nutrient indices for each calendar month finally the average nutrient indices were used to determine the nutrient limitation classes as described in section 2 1 the cart predicted nutrient limitation classes were compared with the bioassay based classes to quantify the performance of the cart ensemble models the r code for the cart model analysis is archived in zhang 2022 3 4 model application to explore potential temporal changes in nutrient limitation the ensemble model for each of the six tributary stations was applied to new periods without bioassay data to predict nutrient limitation fig 2 first predictions were made for two decadal periods i e 1985 1994 and 2011 2020 and the resulting decadal average nutrient limitation classes were compared to assess temporal changes note that all available water quality monitoring data i e all months and years were used in this analysis as opposed to the model development step where only those paired with the bioassay samples were used table s1 an additional means of quantifying changes in nutrient limitation new relative to zhang et al 2021 was to apply the ensemble models to three year running windows over the period of 1985 2020 to compute average nutrient indices for each window and then to compute the mann kendall trends of the nutrient indices kendall 1975 sen 1968 this approach has three advantages 1 it avoids the subjectivity in choosing the thresholds e g 0 4 when converting nutrient indices to nutrient limitation classes see section 2 1 2 it avoids the choice of two temporal periods and fully utilizes the entire period of data for detecting changes and 3 it better distinguishes nutrient indices that belong to the same nutrient limitation classes e g two n indices 0 6 and 0 7 both correspond to n limitation but the latter indicates a stronger n limitation 3 5 tributary stories to provide a portrait of long term changes for each of the three tributaries the cart estimated changes in nutrient limitation were evaluated in the context of estimated changes in monitored estuarine nutrient concentrations and estimated changes in watershed loads fig 2 for estuarine concentrations tn tp and tss long term trends were calculated by first fitting generalized additive models gams to the observed data for the period of 1985 2020 with explanatory variables including date day of year and upstream river flow the fitted gam models were then used to estimate what the estuarine concentrations would have been if freshwater flow had been average for the entire period i e flow adjusted concentrations the percent change of these flow adjusted concentrations between the start and end of the period of interest is the gam trend murphy et al 2019 for watershed loads tn tp din dip and ss the rim load and below rim load were aggregated for each monitoring station see section 2 2 and the long term trends were calculated using the mann kendall test kendall 1975 sen 1968 furthermore watershed loads were divided by river discharges to obtain the so called flow weighted concentrations fwcs which can better reveal temporal trends in the riverine inputs by constraining the effect of interannual variability in river discharges zhang et al 2022a 4 results 4 1 seasonal patterns of tributary nutrient limitation goal 1 historical nutrient bioassays 1990 2003 provide a summary of the seasonal patterns of nutrient limitation in each of the three tidal tributaries left side of each graph in fig 3 in the choptank river at the upstream station et5 1 nor is prevalent i e 9 out of 12 months with the exception that the warmer months july september are classified as n limitation at the downstream station et5 2 nor is less prevalent i e 2 out of 12 months and most months show n limitation p limitation or both with n limitation most common in the patuxent river at the upstream station tf1 5 nor is prevalent in the early months of the year january may whereas the later months are classified as n limitation p limitation or both with n limitation most common at the downstream station le1 1 nor is absent and most months are classified as n limitation i e 10 out of 12 months in the potomac river at the upstream station tf2 3 nor is prevalent i e 10 out of 12 months except that august and september are classified as p limitation at the downstream station le2 2 all four types of nutrient limitation are present generally with nor in the winter months p limitation in the spring months and n limitation in the summer fall months overall the upstream stations in these tributaries are strongly dominated by nor followed by n limitation during warm seasons with rare occurrence of p and np limitation in contrast the downstream stations show limited presence of nor moderately more p and np limitation and much more n limitation 4 2 development of cart models for modeling tributary nutrient limitation goal 2 the exhaustive search algorithm identified three cart model forms for bioassay prediction at each tributary station the ensemble model for each station combined the strength of the three selected models by preserving the highest classification accuracy for each applicable bioassay category table 2 for example the ensemble model for et5 1 has an accuracy of 82 and 96 for exn n 11 and nor n 24 respectively and an overall accuracy of 86 for all bioassay categories n 43 for all six tributary stations the ensemble models have an overall accuracy between 69 and 88 with a median of 82 the ensemble models were further evaluated for nutrient limitation classes in the 1990 2003 period which were converted from the bioassay categories for each month at each station right side of each graph in fig 3 of the 72 cases i e 12 months x 6 stations only three showed mismatches between the cart based and the bioassay based nutrient limitation classes including one month at et5 2 choptank one month at le1 1 patuxent and one month at t2 3 potomac therefore the station specific cart models satisfactorily reproduced the bioassay based nutrient limitation classes classification accuracy 1 3 72 100 96 in comparison our cart models published for the mainstem of chesapeake bay zhang et al 2021 when applied to these tributary stations resulted in 36 mismatches accuracy 1 36 72 100 50 with the bioassay based nutrient limitation classes fig s3 our ensemble models for the tributary stations have selected different combinations of explanatory variables suggesting different controls on nutrient limitation table 2 for example the two patuxent stations are both affected by din and dip but only the upstream station tf1 5 is also affected by watershed relevant variables i e river discharge q ws the ratio of din to dip dindip ws and the ratio of tn to tp tntp ws among the six stations the most common explanatory variables selected by cart are din dip n 6 dindip ws n 5 and dindip ratio wtemp tss and tp n 4 specifically din dip and dindip ws are influential at all three upstream stations whereas din dip tp and wtemp are influential at all three downstream stations 4 3 application of cart models for quantifying temporal changes in nutrient limitation goal 3 cart predictions of nutrient limitation for the six tributary stations showed temporal changes between the two decadal periods 1985 1994 vs 2011 2020 fig 4 of the 72 station month pairs enhanced nutrient limitation occurred in 6 pairs at the upstream stations and 13 pairs at the downstream stations of these pairs 15 involved nor changing to n p or np limitation and 4 involved n or p limitation changing to np limitation only two station month pairs showed weakened nutrient limitation one at choptank et5 1 n changing to nor and the other at potomac le2 2 p changing to nor overall four of these six stations i e all three downstream stations plus patuxent tf1 5 were predicted by the ensemble models to have clearly become more limited by nutrients mann kendall trends quantified for the cart estimated monthly nutrient indices over the period of 1985 2020 table 3 are generally consistent with the comparisons between the two decadal periods fig 4 overall four of the six stations i e all three downstream stations plus patuxent tf1 5 were predicted by the ensemble models to show a preponderance of increasing n or p indices i e enhanced nutrient limitation collectively these four stations showed 24 months of enhanced n limitation 16 months of enhanced p limitation and 17 months of weakened l limitation by contrast choptank et5 1 showed mixed changes in nutrient indices and tf2 3 potomac river showed limited change 4 4 development of tributary stories on long term changes goal 4 here we provide a portrait of long term changes in the three tributaries by linking the estimated changes in nutrient limitation with the estimated changes in monitored estuarine nutrient concentrations and estimated changes in watershed loads and their flow weighted concentrations fwcs table 4 in the choptank river et5 1 showed mixed changes the lack of a sustained reduction in n limitation is consistent with the statistically significant increase in estuarine tn concentration at this station although fwcs of tn din tp and dip showed statistically significant declines their watershed loads and ss loads showed non significant trends in contrast with et5 1 et5 2 showed a recovery trajectory i e more n and p limitation and less nor these changes are consistent with the statistically significant declines in estuarine tn tp and tss concentrations at this station tn din tp and dip all showed statistically significant declines in terms of fwc although only dip showed a statistically significant decline in terms of load in the patuxent river tf1 5 and le1 1 both showed recovery trajectories i e more n and p limitation and less nor these changes are consistent with the statistically significant declines in estuarine tn and tp concentrations at these stations they are also consistent with the statistically significant declines in tn din and dip loads and significant declines in tn din tp and dip fwcs in the potomac river tf2 3 showed limited change in nutrient limitation this is not consistent with the statistically significant declines in estuarine tn tp and tss concentrations at this station or the statistically significant declines in tn din and dip loads and their fwcs in contrast with tf2 3 le2 2 showed a recovery trajectory i e more n and p limitation and less nor these changes are consistent with the statistically significant declines in estuarine tn and tp concentrations at this station they are also consistent with the statistically significant declines in tn din and dip loads and their fwcs 5 discussion 5 1 hypothesis 1 nutrient limitation patterns differ between these tributaries and the mainstem of the bay due to differences in n and p loading from their local watersheds the bioassay results show different seasonal and spatial patterns of nutrient limitation in the tributaries fig 3 the spatial contrast predominant nor upstream n and p limitation downstream is consistent with high turbidity and or high ambient nutrient concentrations at upstream stations in close proximity to watershed loads and in contrast lower turbidity and lower nutrient concentrations at downstream stations indicating high rates of sedimentation and nutrient assimilation e g plant uptake denitrification that limit seaward nutrient fluxes buchanan 2020 fisher et al 2021 noe et al 2020 testa et al 2013 these results are consistent with the tidal monitoring data which show small proportions of bloom limiting concentrations of din and dip at the upstream stations but much larger proportions of bloom limiting concentrations at the downstream stations fig 5 this spatial contrast in nutrient limitation in the tributaries is consistent with the mainstem of the bay fisher et al 1999 kemp et al 2005 zhang et al 2021 although the spatial scales differ between the tributaries and the mainstem they consistently show nor in the upper regions due to conditions of nutrient saturation and high turbidity in contrast with more frequent nutrient limitation in the lower more saline regions thus our results do not support hypothesis 1 5 2 hypothesis 2 cart can leverage concurrent tidal water quality monitoring data to reproduce historical nutrient bioassays results the station specific cart models satisfactorily reproduced the bioassay based nutrient limitation classes using tidal water quality monitoring data classification accuracy 96 fig 3 by contrast the cart models previously published for the mainstem zhang et al 2021 failed to adequately reproduce nutrient limitation in the tributaries accuracy 50 fig s3 therefore we recommend the development of station specific cart models for the tidal tributaries to capture unique patterns and drivers of nutrient limitation these results support hypothesis 2 and show that cart is an accurate estimation tool for characterizing nutrient limitation for times without bioassay measurements thereby greatly expanding the temporal scales of such assessment in this regard bioassay measurements in other major tributaries e g james rappahannock and york would be helpful for development of cart models depending on the availability of resources sampling monthly or seasonally for several years at each selected location to capture different conditions could help with model development our ensemble models for the tributary stations have selected different combinations of explanatory variables table 2 suggesting different controls on nutrient limitation among the six stations the most common explanatory variables selected by cart are din dip dindip ws dindip ratio wtemp tss and tp specifically din dip and dindip ws are influential at all three upstream stations whereas din dip tp and wtemp are influential at all three downstream stations the selected variables show that phytoplankton growth can be affected by estuarine chemical biological and physical conditions as well as watershed inputs notably din and dip concentrations are selected by the ensemble models of all six tributary stations which represent the amount of nutrients available for phytoplankton growth at a given moment when light tss and other factors are not controlling phytoplankton growth nutrient concentrations determine how much of the light induced potential of phytoplankton for photosynthesis and growth can be realized buchanan 2020 fisher et al 1999 1992 concentrations above bloom limiting thresholds i e 0 07 mg l 1 for din 0 007 mg l 1 for dip are associated with a lack of response to nutrient additions fisher and gustafson 2003 and riverine concentrations typically exceed these thresholds by 2 3 orders of magnitude fisher et al 2021 in addition tss increases light attenuation and leads to enhanced light limitation in situ bilotta and brazier 2008 buchanan 2020 cerco et al 2013 testa et al 2019 turner et al 2021 beyond these chemical parameters wtemp represents the integrated effect of seasonal shifts due to temperature effects on maximum phytoplankton growth rates day length and daylight available for photosynthesis as well as seasonal changes in mixing light field and plankton community composition droop 1983 fisher et al 1999 1992 kemp et al 2005 malone et al 1996 the local variations in these potential controls on phytoplankton growth can lead to spatial and temporal variations in light and nutrient limitation in the tributaries and our cart models reveal these local controls lastly we note that the performance of the tributary cart models is inevitably constrained by the precision of bioassay experiments the sample size of each bioassay category and the inherent variability in water samples fisher and gustafson 2003 2005 fisher et al 1999 1992 moreover a key assumption of cart is the stationarity in the derived relationships this caveat can inadvertently force predictions for new periods to strictly follow a particular splitting rule of the classification tree to fall into a fixed terminal node class regardless of any changes in explanatory variables irrelevant to that splitting rule zhang et al 2021 in this regard additional bioassays can be useful for validating and or re calibrating these cart models following known changes in local watershed inputs or developing new cart models in tributaries where no bioassays have yet been done furthermore the tidal water quality monitoring data can provide some level of validation for example the cart inference on the nutrient limitation conditions and changes is generally supported by the patterns of estuarine din and dip concentrations fig 5 5 3 hypothesis 3 long term changes in nutrient limitation are more prevalent in the tributaries than the mainstem due to proximity to managed nutrient sources our results also support hypothesis 3 predictions from the cart models showed long term recovery trajectories at four of the six tributary stations including all three downstream stations which indicate long term water quality improvements table 3 fig 4 in contrast with nutrient limitation in the mainstem of the bay zhang et al 2021 nutrient limitation in these tributaries have had more occurrences of change specifically enhanced nutrient limitation is observed with 19 station month pairs in the decadal comparison fig 4 the mainstem of the bay is influenced by nutrient inputs from all major tributaries among which the susquehanna river is the largest in terms of freshwater and nutrient inputs hagy et al 2004 murphy et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 as reported previously the mainstem has become more limited by n in the more recent period consistent with the long term reduction in n load hirsch et al 2010 hyer et al 2021 zhang et al 2015 however the mainstem showed some reduction in p limitation consistent with increases in tp and dip loads fanelli et al 2019 hirsch 2012 zhang et al 2013 2016 compared to the mainstem the three tributaries analyzed in this study especially their upstream stations are less influenced by the susquehanna river in addition these tributaries are embedded within the landscape and closer to watershed sources than the mainstem these configurations can result in generally stronger responses in the tributaries to nutrient reductions than the mainstem as shown in the cart estimated changes in nutrient limitation furthermore each of the three tributaries analyzed include major wastewater treatment plants wwtps that were upgraded during the study period boynton et al 2008 fisher et al 2021 lyerly et al 2014 ruhl and rybicki 2010 in addition to local nutrient sources these tributaries are also connected with the mainstem of the bay and the generally stronger responses at the downstream stations than the upstream stations may suggest that these tributaries are also positively influenced by the water quality improvement in the mainstem that reflects watershed wide nutrient reductions 5 4 hypothesis 4 the tidal tributaries have become more limited by nutrients following nutrient reductions our results also provide evidence that supports hypothesis 4 table 4 the long term recovery trajectories observed in these tributaries align well with other documented water quality improvements that have been linked to management efforts toward nutrient reductions boynton et al 2008 2013 fisher et al 2021 jones 2020 lefcheck et al 2018 murphy et al 2022 2011 ruhl and rybicki 2010 testa et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 2018 these efforts have been pursued through the implementation of wastewater atmospheric agricultural and urban stormwater source controls to address the reduction goals outlined in the chesapeake bay partnership agreements chesapeake bay partnership 1983 chesapeake executive council 1987 2000 2014 and the bay tmdl u s environmental protection agency 2010 in the choptank river the mixed trends at et5 1 indicate the lack of sufficient reduction in nutrient loads with n believed to be affected by a groundwater legacies due to accumulations of historical agricultural inputs chang et al 2021 hirsch et al 2010 and b a long term increase in river discharge data not shown in addition concentrations at et5 1 have not declined to sufficiently low levels to trigger nutrient limitation as demonstrated by the small proportions of bloom limiting concentrations of din and dip fig 5 therefore stronger reductions in nutrient loads are needed for making progress at et5 1 by contrast the recovery trajectory at et5 2 highlights the importance of nutrient reductions from the below rim watershed since nonpoint sources in the choptank have shown a statistically significant increase fisher et al 2021 this recovery can be attributed to point source reductions as achieved by the p detergent ban and technology upgrades at wwtps especially the cambridge and easton wwtps fisher et al 2021 lyerly et al 2014 in the patuxent river both stations showed enhanced nutrient limitation consistent with reductions in nutrient loads from the watershed for n the reduction reflects a combination of reductions in rim load and below rim load driven by biological nutrient removal at major wwtps boynton et al 2008 lyerly et al 2014 and reductions of atmospheric deposition eshleman et al 2013 lyerly et al 2014 like the choptank river the patuxent river has benefited from p reduction from point sources owing to the p detergent ban and technology upgrades at wwtps boynton et al 2008 lyerly et al 2014 in the potomac river tf2 3 showed a lack of change in nutrient limitation despite the significant declines in estuarine concentrations and watershed loads given that tf2 3 has been dominated by nor fig 3 it is likely that light availability is still the primary limiting factor to phytoplankton growth which can hinder the responses of phytoplankton to nutrient reductions another explanation is that nutrient reductions from the watershed have not resulted in sufficiently low estuarine concentrations to trigger nutrient limitation as demonstrated by the small proportions of bloom limiting concentrations of din and dip fig 5 in addition to external sources internally accumulated nutrients may play a role and delay the response of water column nutrient concentrations to watershed load reductions jones 2020 by contrast the recovery trajectory at le2 2 highlights the importance of instream processing and or nutrient reductions from the below rim watershed especially in the areas between the two stations the reduction in n loads reflects a combination of reductions in rim load and below rim load with some of the major reductions attributed to point sources and atmospheric deposition while the atmospheric deposition reduction is linked to the clean air act eshleman et al 2013 lyerly et al 2014 the point source reduction is attributed to biological nutrient removal at major wwtps in the d c metropolitan region especially the blue plains advanced wwtp the largest of its kind in the bay watershed lyerly et al 2014 ruhl and rybicki 2010 the reduction in p loads is primarily due to the detergent ban and technology upgrades at wwtps lyerly et al 2014 ruhl and rybicki 2010 5 5 summary and management implications our results demonstrate long term recovery trajectories in the tidal tributaries to chesapeake bay which have management implications for chesapeake bay and other coastal ecosystems the first main message is that management efforts focused on dual nutrient reductions have resulted in long term water quality improvements in the tidal tributaries of chesapeake bay this conclusion inferred from our cart predictions is consistent with studies on other waterbodies for example monitoring and bioassay data collected in the james river which is the third largest tributary to chesapeake bay showed that nutrient reductions have led to declined nutrient concentrations and enhanced nutrient limitation wood and bukaveckas 2013 a study on the continental shelf of the northern gulf of mexico predicted an expansion of p limitation following reductions in dip concentrations in the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers laurent et al 2012 and their results compare well with observations in the neuse river estuary the reduction of p load due to a p detergent ban and improved wastewater removal resulted in a decrease in upstream freshwater phytoplankton and nuisance algal blooms paerl et al 2004 in a danish study coastal waters showed clear signs of improvement following reductions of n and p loads since 1990 including significant declines in nutrient concentrations stronger potential p limitation in the 1990s and stronger potential n limitation thereafter riemann et al 2015 in the river loire france total phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biomass declined significantly since 1991 due to the reduction of riverine p minaudo et al 2021 similarly an irish study on 18 river systems reported significant reductions of p load from 15 watersheds which led to parallel improvements in estuarine water in eight downstream systems with significant decreases in estuarine p concentration longphuirt et al 2016 in the inner oslofjorden norway declined p concentration has contributed to the decrease in chlorophyll a from 1980s to 1990s lundsør et al 2020 in the toyama bay japan 25 years of reduction of p load especially from wwtps has led to significant reductions of riverine loads and enhanced p limitation in coastal waters katazakai and zhang 2021 another main message is that nutrient reductions have not always resulted in enhanced nutrient limitation in tidal waters of chesapeake bay e g tf2 3 this may be because 1 the phytoplankton are still mainly limited by light availability or other factors 2 external nutrient loads have not been reduced sufficiently to lower the estuarine nutrient concentrations 3 internally accumulated nutrients are delaying the response of water column concentrations to reductions of external inputs jones 2020 and or 4 top down controls of phytoplankton by grazers cohen et al 1984 or competition for nutrients from submerged aquatic vegetation duarte 1995 van gerven et al 2015 only occasionally limit phytoplankton growth at these tributary stations we note that different locations of the tributaries can exhibit divergent trajectories and responses therefore restoration may be most effective if strategies are tailored to locally specific characteristics wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2022a while management actions toward reducing nutrients from point and atmospheric sources seem to have resulted in the greatest water quality improvements so far continued nutrient reductions under the bay tmdl especially nonpoint sources are critical to restoring the bay and its tributaries ator et al 2020 hyer et al 2021 sabo et al 2022 zhang et al 2022a 2022b 6 conclusions large scale nutrient reduction goals have been in place for decades as targets to restore water quality and habitat health in chesapeake bay and many other estuaries worldwide boesch 2019 cloern 2001 kemp et al 2009 malone and newton 2020 smith 2003 management actions resulting in reductions in nutrient loads are expected to lead to enhanced nutrient limitation of phytoplankton growth but it was unclear whether nutrient limitation has changed in the tidal tributaries following decades of reduction efforts in this context we demonstrate that machine learning approaches i e cart can provide an innovative analysis tool to combine historical data from bioassay experiments with data from the tidal water quality monitoring network for enhancing water quality characterization and assessing water quality response to management actions specifically we have extended the previous work of zhang et al 2021 to develop cart models for analyzing nutrient limitation in three tributaries of chesapeake bay cart satisfactorily reproduced the bioassay based nutrient limitation patterns at the tributary stations classification accuracy 96 such an approach can greatly expand our ability to characterize nutrient limitation from the long term tidal water quality monitoring data both for characterizing current conditions and for predicting temporal changes in nutrient limitation our results demonstrate long term recovery trajectories in the tidal tributaries to chesapeake bay which have management implications for chesapeake bay and other ecosystems overall this research provides a new analytical tool for detecting changes in ecosystem functioning from long term monitoring data and presents signs of ecosystem recovery following nutrient reductions the approach can be adapted to other

utilized a fractional factorial experiment and arctic cyanobacteria pseudanabaena biceps strain pccc o 153 to capture the complexity of interacting climate factors nano polystyrene nano ps and 2 2 4 4 tetrabromodipenyl ether bde 47 the short term binary toxicity of nano ps and bde 47 was then examined through experiments toxicity units and reference models the toxic mechanism was further revealed

attributing to the aggregation of nano ps the adsorption of bde 47 and the wrapping of both contaminants by released extracellular polymeric substances binary toxicity was caused by the chain

presence of nano ps this is the first study to access the hazardous effects of a mixture of anthropogenic contaminants on arctic cyanobacteria under ambient and future climates graphical abstract

production of plastic reached 8 3 billion tonnes among which 6 3 billion tonnes is trash coach 2021 large quantities of plastic pollution have been found in the arctic although arctic regions are still perceived as pristine bergmann et al 2022 weathering and degradation can generate small plastic particles such as microplastics size 5mm and nanoplastics size 1µm microplastics have been widely found in arctic polar waters lakes snow sea ice deep sea sediment and benthic organisms bergmann et al 2017 fang et al 2018 gonzález pleiter et al 2020 lusher et al 2015 peeken et al 2018 in contrast we lack information about the occurrence of nanoplastics in the arctic because they are not detectable by standard sampling and measuring protocols materić et al 2022 however due to their smaller size the abundance and the uptake of nanoplastics by arctic different transfer levels are expected to be a higher concern than microplastics due to their persistence persistent organic pollutants pops are transported long distances in the atmosphere and accumulate in the arctic where low temperatures cause their deposition ma et al 2011 among those pops polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes will surpass polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs to become the most prevalent organohalogen compound in canadian arctic regions by 2050 hale et al 2008 pbdes are a class of brominated flame retardants and they are additives which are mixed directly into the product during manufacture talsness 2008 since pbdes do not react with other material they can migrate out of the product and be released into the environment de wit et al 2010 pbdes are ubiquitous in the arctic such as in the air freshwater marine sediment soil and biotas hale et al 2008 polymer particles can act as a carrier to adsorb pbdes xu et al 2019 and alter the bioavailability of pbdes as inevitable contaminants in the arctic polymer particles and pbdes attract increasing attention on their hazardous effects wang reported that co exposure of nano ps 80 nm and bde 47 caused serious damage to the retinal structure of zebrafish danio rerio wang et al 2022 xia found micro ps increased negative effects of decabromodiphenyl ether bde 209 on hemocyte phagocytosis in gills and digestive gland of scallops chlamys farreri xia et al 2020 both studies demonstrated the exacerbation of the toxic effects of pbdes in the presence of polymer particles in contrast another study reported that nano ps 100 nm reduced the toxic effects of triphenyltin tpt on alga s costatum because of the aggregation and the adsorption prevented tpt entering smaller algal cells yi et al 2019a thus co exposure of nanoplastics and pbdes may have species specific effects arctic organisms are not only affected by anthropogenic contaminants but also affected by climate change nowhere on earth has dramatic climate change as the arctic canadian arctic is now warming three times faster than the rest of the world screen 2017 further warming is expected if the current growth in greenhouse gas e g co2 emissions continues overland et al 2014 one third of the co2 in the atmosphere dissolves in waters and can lead to acidification sugie et al 2020 sea ice melt induced sea level rise can cause seawater intrusion increasing the salinity of freshwater in arctic cañedo argüelles et al 2019 the consideration of climate change would get close to the authentic influence while investigating the impact of anthropogenic contaminants yang analyzed the complexity of interacting environmental factors of light temperature co2 and nanoplastics to microalga s obliquus yang et al 2020 ambient co2 and lower temperatures enhanced nanoplastic toxicity elevated co2 and warmer temperatures reduced the damage o brien explored the impact of multiple stressors of climate change and tire wear particles on duckweed and microbes o brien et al 2022 warmer temperatures and tire leachate stimulated microbial and duckweed growth and caused adverse effects on microbes and duckweed however interactions between climate change shifting parameters and the mixture of nanoplastics and pbdes are largely unknown cyanobacteria are the predominant biota in cold arctic environments e g glaciers ice shelves and ice capped lakes vincent 2000 they are the primary colonizers of glacial moraines and play a vital role in the carbon and nitrogen economy of tundra and polar desert soils vincent 2000 the accumulated impact on cyanobacteria might affect the arctic aquatic ecosystem and the atmosphere composition our study was to explore the impact of the mixture of nano ps and bde 47 on arctic cyanobacteria under ambient and future climates factor significance was examined among climate change shifting environmental parameters as well as nano ps and bde 47 through a fractional factorial design we then hypothesized that the high surface area and the hydrophobic nature of nano ps could drive the adsorption of bde 47 to nano ps decreasing the bioavailability of bde 47 after adsorption experiments binary toxicity was studied through experiments toxicity unit and reference models toxic mechanism was explored through biochemical analyses correlation analyses and multivariate statistics this is the first study to access the hazardous effects of a mixture of anthropogenic contaminants on arctic cyanobacteria under ambient and future climates this study presented a creative thinking to provide a valuable and solid statistical evaluation of mixture toxicity to arctic natural species which can support the environmental risk assessment for nanoplastics and co existing contaminants 2 materials and methods 2 1 test species pseudanabaena biceps strain pccc o 153 was obtained from the polar cyanobacteria culture collection

potential of nano ps were determined by a zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments uk bde 47 was used as a representative pbde since bde 47 was one of the predominant congeners and major sources of pbdes in the arctic rivers la guardia et al 2006 bde 47 was purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa with a purity higher than 99 2 3 climate change impact analyses based on a fractional factorial screening a 26 3 fractional factorial design was performed to screen significant factors from climate factors and contaminant exposures table s1 the six factors include temperature ph salinity size of nano ps 25 and 800 nm and their concentrations 1 05 and 43 91 mg l as well as bde 47 concentrations 2 5 and 800 µg l the temperature range was set from 8 to 20 c since it considered the optimal growth temperature for strain pccc o 153 the normal temperature in the arctic and the predicted extreme arctic temperature in 100 years screen 2017 the ph range was between 7 1 and 7 9 including the predicted ph changes for freshwater over a 100 year period weiss et al 2018 salinity was changed from 0 5 to 3 5 since sea level rise caused by global warming could increase freshwater salinity

northhampton usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 combined effects of nano ps bde 47 and environmental variables related to climate change to elucidate the significance of nano ps bde 47 and climate factors we administered one set of fractional factorial experiments from which we emphasized on the impact from single factors the gradients were set from ambient to future climate conditions within 100 years a half normal plot of factors is shown in fig 1 this plot was to compare the statistical significance of factors through the display of all positive and negative factors with the significant factors far from the line xin et al 2016 thus the sequence of significance was f bde 47 concentrations e nano ps concentrations d nanoplastic size c salinity b ph af temperature bde 47 concentrations table s2 this indicated contaminants i e bde 47 nano ps played more important roles than environmental factors in affecting cell growth thus pccc o 153 was likely to be tolerant of the variable factors and more sensitive to both contaminants bde 47 concentrations contributed to the most 41 13 to cell growth table s3 and had negative effects as shown in fig 1 any increase in bde 47 concentrations led to a considerable decrease in cell density different cyanobacteria showed different sensitivity similar to us pseudanabaena was remarkably inhibited while exposed to bde 47 whereas m flos aquae o planctonica synechocystis and nostoc showed bde 47 tolerance chalifour and tam 2016 salinity and temperature bde 47 concentrations also negatively affected cell density fig 1 contributing to 12 55 and 1 19 commonly an inhibition in cell division occurred when salinity increased associated with a depression in photosynthetic activity masojídek et al 2000 xin s study also showed elevated salinity 0 25 15 decreased algal biomass for chlorococcum sp xin et al 2019b however for botryococcus braunii cell biomass increased when salinity changed from 1 to 5 rao et al 2007 nano ps concentrations nanoplastic size and ph had positive effects indicating any increase would lead to cell biomass increase their corresponding contributions were 22 74 16 41 and 3 16 respectively table s3 nano ps concentration and size ranked the second and third most important factors other studies also verified the importance of nanoplastics on cell growth among multiple environmental stressors yang s study reported nanoplastics were the most important stressor to affect alga s obliquus among interacting environmental stressors including light temperature co2 and nanoplastics yang et al 2020 it showed stronger inhibition in algal biomass with elevating nanoplastic concentrations guo found nanoplastics ranked the second most important factor to affect cyanobacteria m aeruginosa among h2o2 nanoplastics temperature and light guo et al 2021 moreover our study showed smaller ps 25 nm had less cell biomass than larger ps 800 nm which was consistent with most studies zhao reported nano ps 65 and 100 nm had more hazardous effects than micro ps 1µm on the dinoflagellate k mikimotoi zhao et al 2020b reichelt found micro and nanoplastic in the range of 0 04 3000 µm showed a significant positive effect on algal growth with increasing particle size reichelt and gorokhova 2020 however wu demonstrated that larger microplastics 1 µm showed more adverse effects than nanoplastics 100 nm on the growth of m aeruginosa challenging the belief that smaller microplastics were more toxic wu et al 2021 furthermore ph change could result from co2 concentration variation our study showed cell density increased with elevated ph from 7 1 to 7 9 indicting strain pccc o 153 preferred weak alkaline environments surprisingly temperature was not a significant factor for cell density compared to others with temperature increasing from 8 to 20 c optical density decreased from 0 031 to 0 030 fig 1 as an arctic isolate pccc o 153 grew over a wide temperature range 5 30 c and it had broad tolerances to the variable temperature regime which characterized its environment vincent 2000 yang s study also indicated warmer temperatures had weak effects on algal growth and only extreme conditions dramatically amplified algal biomass contributing to the wide temperature tolerance of scenedesmus species 10 40 c yang et al 2020 3 2 binary toxicity individual toxicity was included in si based on tu approach fig 2 a showed the co existence of nano ps and bde 47 had antagonistic effects on cell growth since observed tu was lower than predicted tu it indicated that the mixture of nano ps and bde 47 caused lower toxic effects than individuals most reports showed the mixture of nanoplastics and emerging contaminants could enhance adverse effects for example micro ps 5 µm did not significantly affect the toxic effects of triphenyltin chloride tptcl on c pyrenoidosa whereas nano ps 550 nm increased the effects of tptcl yi et al 2019a moreover nano ps 50 and 500 nm caused a stronger accumulation in marine rotifer compared to micro ps 6 µm jeong et al 2018 the pre exposure of nano ps inhibited multixenobiotic resistance enhancing toxicity of bde 47 and triclosan to b koreanus however the opposite effects occurred as well nano ps 100 nm reduced the toxic effects of triphenyltin on s costatum more than micro ps 5 µm yi et al 2019a b nano ps with a size of 100 and 550 nm reduced the toxicity of dibutyl phthalate to c pyrenoidosa at its low concentrations no matter how much ps was present li et al 2020 fig 2 b showed observed data did not exactly follow either ca or ia model both ca and ia models were developed on the basis of the assumption that co existing substances had the same endpoint in the same direction and that the substances acted by similar ca or dissimilar ia mode of action the main reason to cause the unsimilar to both models could be that nano ps and bde 47 had different endpoints and different modes of action as well as the existence of interaction between nano ps and bde 47 however the trend that the observed data followed was similar to that ia model did indicating the prediction capability of ia model was higher than that of ca model for our case ia model sited at the left hand side of observed data indicating ia model overestimated the binary toxicity ca model sited at the right hand side of observed data indicating ca model underestimated the binary toxicity other studies also applied ia model to simulate the antagonistic effects of plastic particles and emerging contaminants on microalgae you used ia model to study the joint toxicity of nanoplastics and ciprofloxacin to cyanobacterium synechocystis sp you et al 2021 all experimental data were lower than expected values demonstrating that the binary toxicity was antagonistic zhu applied ia model to assess the binary toxicity of microplastics and triclosan to marine microalga s costatum zhu et al 2019 since all expected data of four tested microplastics pe ps polyvinyl chloride pvc pvc800 were larger than the experimental data the interaction was antagonistic 3 3 mechanism analyses 3 3 1 characterization of nano ps and adsorption of bde 47 the hydrodynamic size of 25 and 800 nm ps was 39 8 0 67 and 810 4 5 41 nm in bg 11 respectively the zeta potential of 25 and 800 nm ps in bg 11was 8 32 1 29 and 23 3 2 58 mv in bg 11 respectively since particles could be considered unstable from 30 to 30 mv angel et al 2015 nano ps25 and nano ps800 were probably unstable and could aggregate nano ps25 had a greater potential to aggregate particle size was affected by aggregation during the exposure making it challenging to consider in the risk assessment reichelt and gorokhova 2020 the uncontrolled particle aggregation and settling could be enhanced at higher nano ps concentrations reichelt and gorokhova 2020 nano ps aggregation precipitation and adsorption reduced the bioavailability of bde 47 bde 47 was identified to be adsorbed rapidly by nano ps and reached an equilibrium sorption capacity of 7 31 ng g within 150 min fig s3 due to a highly hydrophobic surface ps was highly compatible with hydrophobic substances resulting in the possibility of being potential carriers and sinks of organic pollutants such as bde 209 triphenyltin chloride chlorpyrifos oil nickel garrido et al 2019 kim et al 2017 xia et al 2020 yang et al 2021 yi et al 2019a ps with smaller size and larger specific surface area in the current study had more available sorption sites for bde 47 low crystallinity of ps determined ps had a high sorption capacity of organic matter which was another essential factor affecting bde 47 sorption xu et al 2019 the adsorption also depended on the hydrophobic interaction between nano ps and bde 47 the octanol water partition coefficient kow of bde 47 was 6 81 indicating high hydrophobicity and sorption affinity with high br content xu et al 2019 the large molecular size and high hydrophobicity made bde 47 easily adsorbed by nano ps thus nano ps could reduce the bioavailability of bde 47 3 3 2 effects on cell growth when bde 47 increased from 0 to 200 µg l cell density followed a dose response relationship under the presence of nano ps fig 3 a the inhibition rate under co exposure increased compared to individual bde 47 exposure however the inhibition rate did not increase to a large extend when nano ps concentration increased the inhibition rate did not surpass 40 the mixture showed antagonistic effects in detail for 12 5 µg l bde 47 when nano ps increased from 21 to 43 91 mg l the inhibition rate did not increase significantly when nano ps increased from 43 91 to 87 82 mg l the inhibition rate increased from 17 43 to 32 30 for 50 µg l bde 47 when nano ps increased from 21 to 43 91 mg l the inhibition rate decreased significantly when nano ps increased from 43 91 to 87 82 mg l the inhibition rate increased from 25 98 to 32 38 for 200 µg l bde 47 the inhibition rate increased from 25 11 to 35 63 all the way when nano ps increased from 21 to 87 82 mg l similarly when the concentration of nano ps increased from 0 to 87 82 mg l cell density also followed a dose response relationship under the presence of bde 47 fig s2 however at a specific concentration of nano ps the inhibition rate did not increase at a fast rate when bde 47 concentration increased 3 3 3 morphological observation sem images of cells exposed to nano ps bde 47 and their mixtures after 96 h were shown in fig 4 cells in the untreated group showed intact cellular structure with complete shape and smooth surface when bde 47 was at 12 5 µg l slight deformation and band folds occurred when bde 47 was at 200 µg l the deformation was aggravated the girdle drastically shrunk and cell shape and size changed when nano ps increased from 43 91 to 87 82 mg l needle and fiber shaped materials gathered on cell surface forming aggregation clusters this indicated spherical beads of nano ps aggregated into needles and fibers which were the most commonly observed microplastics in the field reichelt and gorokhova 2020 plastic aggregation could cause shading effects block light from reaching photosynthetic centers eliminate nutrient uptake and damage cell walls wu et al 2021 when nano ps was at 43 91 mg l and bde 47 increased its concentrations from 12 5 to 200 µg l cells had more deformation and shrinkage moreover there were large quantities of released extracellular polymeric substances eps attached to cell surface contaminants can stimulate cells to secrete more eps to protect cells the mixture could generate more eps to detoxify the cells by encapsulating nanoplastics and reducing direct contact between contaminants and cells huang et al 2021 3 3 4 changes of photosynthetic pigments as shown in fig 3 b when nano ps was at 43 91 mg l chl a increased with bde 47 increasing to 12 5 µg l and decreased with continuous bde 47 increase this change was opposite to inhibition rate when nano ps was at 43 91 mg l the inhibition rate decreased with bde 47 increasing to 12 5 µg l and increased with continuous bde 47 increase for the mixture increased chl a indicated increased cell biomass compared to individual exposures leading to the decreased inhibition rate this stimulatory effect may be attributed to hormesis resulting from low levels of potentially toxic substances xin et al 2019a nano ps aggregation and bde 47 adsorption may reduce the amount of both contaminants acting on cells the low doses of contaminants led to regulatory overcorrections by biosynthetic control mechanisms causing excessive production the accumulation of chl a was also accompanied by the inhibition in cell divisions under stressors in addition when bde 47 was at 50 µg l chl a content was not significantly different from non bde 47 exposure but significantly lower than 12 5 µg l bde 47 exposure when bde 47 was at 200 µg l chl a content was significantly lower than non bde 47 and 12 5 µg l bde 47 exposure thus bde 47 at increased concentrations higher than 12 5 µg l enhanced the binary toxicity 3 3 5 oxidative stress ros could be continuously generated as by products via metabolic pathways in the chloroplasts mitochondria and peroxisomes when photosynthetic species were exposed to environmental stressors liu et al 2007 although oxidative stress could be the main reason to cause growth inhibition by the individuals it might not contribute to growth inhibition for mixtures ros increased significantly in the co exposure of 12 5 µg l bde 47 and 43 91 mg l nano ps compared to individual exposures fig 3 c at the same time mda concentration significantly increased compared to individual exposure fig 3 d the increase in ros and mda were corresponding to increased cell growth and photosynthetic pigments which could be attributed to hormesis previous studies reported that growth stimulation in cyanobacteria caused by low dose contaminants e g metal oxide nanoparticles antibiotics steroid estrogens microplastics was accompanied by increases in ros and mda bai et al 2019 liu et al 2015 wan et al 2015 the reason for such responses could be the increases of cellular metabolic rate and over production of critical biomolecules while being poised for defense from low dose of threat goswami et al 2015 thus high metabolic activity of low dose stimulation was associated with elevated ros production treatments with bde 47 increasing from 50 to 200 µg l had no significant difference from non bde exposure the change in ros was consistent with that in mda this was consistent with gu s study gu et al 2020 when bde 47 was at 0 and 0 1 µg l there was significantly increased ros and mda to mussels in the presence of micro ps when bde 47 was at 10 µg l micro ps did not affect ros and mda production 3 3 6 variation in total proteins the change in the total protein followed a dose response relationship at 96 h as shown in fig 3 e when nano ps was at 43 91 mg l soluble protein only had a significant reduction at 200 µg l of bde 47 compared to non bde 47 exposure fig 3 e it was consistent that the mixture had antagonistic effects on proteins the reduction of protein might decrease the water retention capacity of cells and make cells aggregate easier our results showed ros did not contribute to protein loss however an inhibition in chl a content was consistent with the inhibition in protein pigment protein complexes could form through binding photosynthetic pigments and specific proteins satoh et al 2001 specifically 34 9 and 57 5 of chl a was combined with chl a protein complexes of psii and p700 chl a protein complex the formation of pigment protein complexes played an important role in adaptation to light harvesting environments thus protein content was positively related to chl a content contributing to the consistent inhibition in protein content and chl a content 3 4 correlation analyses and toxicity prediction pearson correlation coefficients could be used to access the linear relationship among multiple endpoints table s4 for individual bde 47 exposure growth inhibition was negatively correlated with chl a and protein content chl a and protein content were positively correlated with each other with a coefficient of 0 993 ros was not significantly correlated to any other endpoints for individual nano ps exposure growth inhibition was correlated with chl a protein content ros and lipid peroxidation with coefficient of 0 951 0 986 0 796 and 0 796 respectively ros was negatively correlated to growth inhibition and lipid peroxidation and was positively correlated to chl a content and protein content similar situation occurred to the mixture exposure for the mixture of nano ps and bde 47 growth inhibition was all negatively correlated with chl a protein content ros and lipid peroxidation it indicated that oxidative stress of the combined effects was mainly affected by the presence of nano ps pca analyses were performed to analyze the correlation among endpoints fig 5 a pca clearly resolved the data into two major components together they accounted for 90 07 of the variability in the original data pc1 accounted for 57 80 of the variation and pc2 for 32 27 endpoints for bde 47 distributed in four quadrants endpoints for nano ps distributed in three quadrants endpoints for the mixture distributed in two quadrants the narrowing down effects for the mixture was probably attributed to the chain reactions among multiple endpoints the toxic effects on one endpoint might probably trigger an effect on another leading to domino effects or the effects on multiple endpoints could act jointly to produce combined effects for the mixture the chain reaction seems to occur more generally than the individuals considering the role of internal interactions growth inhibition rate could be complicated with linear or nonlinear features of chl a protein content ros and lipid peroxidation sca and mlr model were applied to simulate and predict growth inhibition rate model calibration and verification selected randomly sampled data r 2 and root mean square error rmse could be used to access model accuracy sca is a multivariate statistical technology this method is effective for reflecting the non functional relationships between independent and dependent variables it is powerful for prediction among discrete and continuous variables huang 1992 which are difficult to be resolved by conventional methods such as artificial neural network and multi variate regression analysis sun et al 2009 as shown in figure s4 observed data and predicted data of calibration and validation for individuals and mixtures did not show a good linear correlation based on the values of r 2 and rmse these data indicated that the relationship between growth inhibition and other endpoints i e photosynthetic pigment protein content and oxidative stress was not nonlinear mlr is a statistical technique which applies several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable revealing a linear inter relationship maulud et al 2020 as shown in fig 6 observed and predicted data of calibration and validation for individuals and mixtures showed a good linear correlation based on the values of r 2 and rmse these data indicated that growth inhibition and other endpoints i e photosynthetic pigment protein content and oxidative stress had a linear relationship linear relationships can support statistical analysis to determine the presence of correlations and causal relationships between variables when photosynthetic pigment protein content and oxidative stress experienced changes growth inhibition rate changed accordingly stepwise linear regression slr was further used to determine relationships between a response variable and explanatory variables leaving the most related ones table s5 xin et al 2020 for individual bde 47 exposure growth inhibition presented a better regression with protein content suggesting 99 4 of correlation could be explained it indicated bde 47 had the most significant effects on proteins proteins are dominant players relating to both biomass and functionality in cells accounting for approximately half of the total dry mass milo 2013 for individual nano ps exposure growth inhibition rate presented a better regression with protein and chl a content suggesting 99 0 of correlation could be explained it indicated nano ps had significant impacts on proteins and photosynthetic pigments it was reported that ps could reduce chl a yields photosynthetic activities and soluble proteins through affecting the crystalline structure of the water soluble chlorophyll proteins dong et al 2021 for the mixture growth inhibition presented a better regression with protein content and lipid peroxidation suggesting 98 2 of correlation could be explained it indicated the mixture had significant influences on proteins and lipids which could be attributed to the presence of nano ps as reported co existence of nano ps and bde 47 caused stronger oxidative damage and more severe immune stress in mussels gu et al 2020 heat shock proteins and lipid peroxidation were two targets also the mixture of nano ps and bde 47 caused oxidative damage on lipid components and inhibited p glycoproteins and multidrug resistance proteins in rotifers jeong et al 2018 4 conclusions cyanobacteria appeared about three billions years ago they are widely distributed on the planet and can survive in the most hostile environments sánchez baracaldo et al 2022 in the extreme polar habitats cyanobacteria are not only the dominant phototrophs but also most of the microbial biomass most cyanobacteria isolates are likely to be tolerant of the variable factors e g temperature co2 level salinity light which characterize their environment vincent 2000 under such a strong capacity of tolerance to variable natural conditions the present work suggested that arctic cyanobacteria pseudanabaena biceps strain pccc o 153 was more sensitive to nano ps and pbde than natural condition changes under ambient and future climates the mixture of nano ps and bde 47 had antagonistic effects on strain pccc o 153 fig 5 b after 96 h it is likely that the aggregation of nano ps and the adsorption of bde 47 reduced contaminants to enter cells and weaken further adverse effects the released eps wrapped nano ps and bde 47 and also prevented their entrance into cells the binary toxicity probably resulted from the chain reactions triggered by combining individual contaminants growth inhibition could be better simulated and predicted by multiple linear regression model than nonlinear model indicating cell growth was closely affected by photosynthetic pigment protein content and oxidative stress based on ia model nano ps and bde 47 had different modes of action bde 47 acted on total proteins significantly while nano ps affected soluble proteins photosynthetic pigment or probably chlorophyll proteins nano ps was the main reason to cause oxidative stress for the mixture total protein was a sensitive target for both exposures of mixtures and individuals thus compared to climate change arctic cyanobacteria could be more vulnerable to polystyrene nanoplastics and flame retardants transporting to the arctic in short term exposure polystyrene nanoplastics and flame retardants are likely to have more hazardous effects in combinations than climate change shifting factors in arctic waters this is the first study to access the hazardous effects of a mixture of anthropogenic contaminants on arctic cyanobacteria under ambient and future climates the vector role and non degradable properties of nanoplastics extends the life time of emerging contaminants in arctic waters long term effects for the mixture need further exploration although antagonistic effects of the mixture caused less damage on arctic cyanobacteria it could facilitate the entrance of contaminants to arctic food web whatever the impact of anthropogenic contaminants will be they probably originate from distant human sources

15353,cyanobacteria are the predominant biota in the arctic interactive effects on arctic cyanobacteria between climate change shifting parameters and anthropogenic contaminants are largely unknown we utilized a fractional factorial experiment and arctic cyanobacteria pseudanabaena biceps strain pccc o 153 to capture the complexity of interacting climate factors nano polystyrene nano ps and 2 2 4 4 tetrabromodipenyl ether bde 47 the short term binary toxicity of nano ps and bde 47 was then examined through experiments toxicity units and reference models the toxic mechanism was further revealed through biochemical analyses and multivariate statistics we found that bde 47 and nano ps had more hazardous effects than changing climate conditions the mixture had antagonistic effects on pccc o 153 attributing to the aggregation of nano ps the adsorption of bde 47 and the wrapping of both contaminants by released extracellular polymeric substances binary toxicity was caused by the chain reactions triggered by combining individual contaminants total protein was a sensitive target and positively correlated to chlorophyll pigment oxidative stress for the mixture mainly resulted from the presence of nano ps this is the first study to access the hazardous effects of a mixture of anthropogenic contaminants on arctic cyanobacteria under ambient and future climates graphical abstract

production of plastic reached 8 3 billion tonnes among which 6 3 billion tonnes is trash coach 2021 large quantities of plastic pollution have been found in the arctic although arctic regions are still perceived as pristine bergmann et al 2022 weathering and degradation can generate small plastic particles such as microplastics size 5mm and nanoplastics size 1µm microplastics have been widely found in arctic polar waters lakes snow sea ice deep sea sediment and benthic organisms bergmann et al 2017 fang et al 2018 gonzález pleiter et al 2020 lusher et al 2015 peeken et al 2018 in contrast we lack information about the occurrence of nanoplastics in the arctic because they are not detectable by standard sampling and measuring protocols materić et al 2022 however due to their smaller size the abundance and the uptake of nanoplastics by arctic different transfer levels are expected to be a higher concern than microplastics due to their persistence persistent organic pollutants pops are transported long distances in the atmosphere and accumulate in the arctic where low temperatures cause their deposition ma et al 2011 among those pops polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes will surpass polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs to become the most prevalent organohalogen compound in canadian arctic regions by 2050 hale et al 2008 pbdes are a class of brominated flame retardants and they are additives which are mixed directly into the product during manufacture talsness 2008 since pbdes do not react with other material they can migrate out of the product and be released into the environment de wit et al 2010 pbdes are ubiquitous in the arctic such as in the air freshwater marine sediment soil and biotas hale et al 2008 polymer particles can act as a carrier to adsorb pbdes xu et al 2019 and alter the bioavailability of pbdes as inevitable contaminants in the arctic polymer particles and pbdes attract increasing attention on their hazardous effects wang reported that co exposure of nano ps 80 nm and bde 47 caused serious damage to the retinal structure of zebrafish danio rerio wang et al 2022 xia found micro ps increased negative effects of decabromodiphenyl ether bde 209 on hemocyte phagocytosis in gills and digestive gland of scallops chlamys farreri xia et al 2020 both studies demonstrated the exacerbation of the toxic effects of pbdes in the presence of polymer particles in contrast another study reported that nano ps 100 nm reduced the toxic effects of triphenyltin tpt on alga s costatum because of the aggregation and the adsorption prevented tpt entering smaller algal cells yi et al 2019a thus co exposure of nanoplastics and pbdes may have species specific effects arctic organisms are not only affected by anthropogenic contaminants but also affected by climate change nowhere on earth has dramatic climate change as the arctic canadian arctic is now warming three times faster than the rest of the world screen 2017 further warming is expected if the current growth in greenhouse gas e g co2 emissions continues overland et al 2014 one third of the co2 in the atmosphere dissolves in waters and can lead to acidification sugie et al

stressors of climate change and tire wear particles on duckweed and microbes o brien et al 2022 warmer temperatures and tire leachate stimulated microbial and duckweed growth and caused adverse effects on microbes and duckweed however interactions between climate change shifting parameters and the mixture of nanoplastics and pbdes are largely unknown cyanobacteria are the predominant biota in cold arctic environments e g glaciers ice shelves and ice capped lakes vincent 2000 they are the primary colonizers of glacial moraines and play a vital role in the carbon and nitrogen economy of tundra and polar desert soils vincent 2000 the accumulated impact on cyanobacteria might affect the arctic aquatic ecosystem and the atmosphere composition our study was to explore the impact of the mixture of nano ps and bde 47 on arctic cyanobacteria under ambient and future climates factor significance was examined among climate change shifting environmental parameters as well as nano ps and bde 47 through a fractional factorial design we then hypothesized that the high surface area and the hydrophobic nature of nano ps could drive the adsorption of bde 47 to nano ps decreasing the bioavailability of bde 47 after adsorption experiments binary toxicity was studied through experiments toxicity unit and reference models toxic mechanism was explored through biochemical analyses correlation analyses and multivariate statistics this is the first study to access the hazardous effects of a mixture of anthropogenic contaminants on arctic cyanobacteria under ambient and future climates this study presented a creative thinking to provide a valuable and solid statistical evaluation of mixture toxicity to arctic natural species which can support the environmental risk assessment for nanoplastics and co existing contaminants 2 materials and methods 2 1 test species pseudanabaena biceps strain pccc o 153 was obtained from the polar cyanobacteria culture collection pccc centre d études nordiques cen université laval québec canada it was isolated from bylot island canadian arctic in an epilithic pond 73 209000n 78 479200w in 1993 vézina and vincent 1997 the

potential of nano ps were determined by a zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments uk bde 47 was used as a representative pbde since bde 47 was one of the predominant congeners and major sources of pbdes in the arctic rivers la guardia et al 2006 bde 47 was purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa with a purity higher than 99 2 3 climate change impact analyses based on a fractional factorial screening a 26 3 fractional factorial design was performed to screen significant factors from climate factors and contaminant exposures table s1 the six factors include temperature ph salinity size of nano ps 25 and 800 nm and their concentrations 1 05 and 43 91 mg l as well as bde 47 concentrations 2 5 and 800 µg l the temperature range was set from 8 to 20 c since it considered the optimal growth temperature for strain pccc o 153 the normal temperature in the arctic and the predicted extreme arctic temperature in 100 years screen 2017 the ph range was between 7 1 and 7 9 including the predicted ph changes for freshwater over a 100 year period weiss et al 2018 salinity was changed from 0 5 to 3 5 since sea level rise caused by global warming could increase freshwater salinity

northhampton usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 combined effects of nano ps bde 47 and environmental variables related to climate change to elucidate the significance of nano ps bde 47 and climate factors we administered one set of fractional factorial experiments from which we emphasized on the impact from single factors the gradients were set from ambient to future climate conditions within 100 years a half normal plot of factors is shown in fig 1 this plot was to compare the statistical significance of factors through the display of all positive and negative factors with the significant factors far from the line xin et al 2016 thus the sequence of significance was f bde 47 concentrations e nano ps concentrations d nanoplastic size c salinity b ph af temperature bde 47 concentrations table s2 this indicated contaminants i e bde 47 nano ps played more important roles than environmental factors in affecting cell growth thus pccc o 153 was likely to be tolerant of the variable factors and more sensitive to both contaminants bde 47 concentrations contributed to the most 41 13 to cell growth table s3 and had negative effects as shown in fig 1 any increase in bde 47 concentrations led to a considerable decrease in cell density different cyanobacteria showed different sensitivity similar to us pseudanabaena was remarkably inhibited while exposed to bde 47 whereas m flos aquae o planctonica synechocystis and nostoc showed bde 47 tolerance chalifour and tam 2016 salinity and temperature bde 47 concentrations also negatively affected cell density fig 1 contributing to 12 55 and 1 19 commonly an inhibition in cell division occurred when salinity increased associated with a depression in photosynthetic activity masojídek et al 2000 xin s study also showed elevated salinity 0 25 15 decreased algal biomass for chlorococcum sp xin et al 2019b however for botryococcus braunii cell biomass increased when salinity changed from 1 to 5 rao et al 2007 nano ps concentrations nanoplastic size and ph had positive effects indicating any increase would lead to cell biomass increase their corresponding contributions were 22 74 16 41 and 3 16 respectively table s3 nano ps concentration and size ranked the second and third most important factors other studies also verified the importance of nanoplastics on cell growth among multiple environmental stressors yang s study reported nanoplastics were the most important stressor to affect alga s obliquus among interacting environmental stressors including light temperature co2 and nanoplastics yang et al 2020 it showed stronger inhibition in algal biomass with elevating nanoplastic concentrations guo found nanoplastics ranked the second most important factor to affect cyanobacteria m aeruginosa among h2o2 nanoplastics temperature and light guo et al 2021 moreover our study showed smaller ps 25 nm had less cell biomass than larger ps 800 nm which was consistent with most studies zhao reported nano ps 65 and 100 nm had more hazardous effects than micro ps 1µm on the dinoflagellate k mikimotoi zhao et al 2020b reichelt found micro and nanoplastic in the range of 0 04 3000 µm showed a significant positive effect on algal growth with increasing particle size reichelt and gorokhova 2020 however wu demonstrated that larger microplastics 1 µm showed more adverse effects than nanoplastics 100 nm on the growth of m aeruginosa challenging the belief that smaller microplastics were more toxic wu et al 2021 furthermore ph change could result from co2 concentration variation our study showed cell density increased with elevated ph from 7 1 to 7 9 indicting strain pccc o 153 preferred weak alkaline environments surprisingly temperature was not a significant factor for cell density compared to others with temperature increasing from 8 to 20 c optical density decreased from 0 031 to 0 030 fig 1 as an arctic isolate pccc o 153 grew over a wide temperature range 5 30 c and it had broad tolerances to the variable temperature regime which characterized its environment vincent 2000 yang s study also indicated warmer temperatures had weak effects on algal growth and only extreme conditions dramatically amplified algal biomass contributing to the wide temperature tolerance of scenedesmus species 10 40 c yang et al 2020 3 2 binary toxicity individual toxicity was included in si based on tu approach fig 2 a showed the co existence of nano ps and bde 47 had antagonistic effects on cell growth since observed tu was lower than predicted tu it indicated that the mixture of nano ps and bde 47 caused lower toxic effects than individuals most reports showed the mixture of nanoplastics and emerging contaminants could enhance adverse effects for example micro ps 5 µm did not significantly affect the toxic effects of triphenyltin chloride tptcl on c pyrenoidosa whereas nano ps 550 nm increased the effects of tptcl yi et al 2019a moreover nano ps 50 and 500 nm caused a stronger accumulation in marine rotifer compared to micro ps 6 µm jeong et al 2018 the pre exposure of nano ps inhibited multixenobiotic resistance enhancing toxicity of bde 47 and triclosan to b koreanus however the opposite effects occurred as well nano ps 100 nm reduced the toxic effects of triphenyltin on s costatum more than micro ps 5 µm yi et al 2019a b nano ps with a size of 100 and 550 nm reduced the toxicity of dibutyl phthalate to c pyrenoidosa at its low concentrations no matter how much ps was present li et al 2020 fig 2 b showed observed data did not exactly follow either ca or ia model both ca and ia models were developed on the basis of the assumption that co existing substances had the same endpoint in the same direction and that the substances acted by similar ca or dissimilar ia mode of action the main reason to cause the unsimilar to both models could be that nano ps and bde 47 had different endpoints and different modes of action as well as the existence of interaction between nano ps and bde 47 however the trend that the observed data followed was similar to that ia model did indicating the prediction capability of ia model was higher than that of ca model for our case ia model sited at the left hand side of observed data indicating ia model overestimated the binary toxicity ca model sited at the right hand side of observed data indicating ca model underestimated the binary toxicity other studies also applied ia model to simulate the antagonistic effects of plastic particles and emerging contaminants on microalgae you used ia model to study the joint toxicity of nanoplastics and ciprofloxacin to cyanobacterium synechocystis sp you et al 2021 all experimental data were lower than expected values demonstrating that the binary toxicity was antagonistic zhu applied ia model to assess the binary toxicity of microplastics and triclosan to marine microalga s costatum zhu et al 2019 since all expected data of four tested microplastics pe ps polyvinyl chloride pvc pvc800 were larger than the experimental data the interaction was antagonistic 3 3 mechanism analyses 3 3 1 characterization of nano ps and adsorption of bde 47 the hydrodynamic size of 25 and 800 nm ps was 39 8 0 67 and 810 4 5 41 nm in bg 11 respectively the zeta potential of 25 and 800 nm ps in bg 11was 8 32 1 29 and 23 3 2 58 mv in bg 11 respectively since particles could be considered unstable from 30 to 30 mv angel et al 2015 nano ps25 and nano ps800 were probably unstable and could aggregate nano ps25 had a greater potential to aggregate particle size was affected by aggregation during the exposure making it challenging to consider in the risk assessment reichelt and gorokhova 2020 the uncontrolled particle aggregation and settling could be enhanced at higher nano ps concentrations reichelt and gorokhova 2020 nano ps aggregation precipitation and adsorption reduced the bioavailability of bde 47 bde 47 was identified to be adsorbed rapidly by nano ps and reached an equilibrium sorption capacity of 7 31 ng g within 150 min fig s3 due to a highly hydrophobic surface ps was highly compatible with hydrophobic substances resulting in the possibility of being potential carriers and sinks of organic pollutants such as bde 209 triphenyltin chloride chlorpyrifos oil nickel garrido et al 2019 kim et al 2017 xia et al 2020 yang et al 2021 yi et al 2019a ps with smaller size and larger specific surface area in the current study had more available sorption sites for bde 47 low crystallinity of ps determined ps had a high sorption capacity of organic matter which was another essential factor affecting bde 47 sorption xu et al 2019 the adsorption also depended on the hydrophobic interaction between nano ps and bde 47 the octanol water partition coefficient kow of bde 47 was 6 81 indicating high hydrophobicity and sorption affinity with high br content xu et al 2019 the large molecular size and high hydrophobicity made bde 47 easily adsorbed by nano ps thus nano ps could reduce the bioavailability of bde 47 3 3 2 effects on cell growth when bde 47 increased from 0 to 200 µg l cell density followed a dose response relationship under the presence of nano ps fig 3 a the inhibition rate under co exposure increased compared to individual bde 47 exposure however the inhibition rate did not increase to a large extend when nano ps concentration increased the inhibition rate did not surpass 40 the mixture showed antagonistic effects in detail for 12 5 µg l bde 47 when nano ps increased from 21 to 43 91 mg l the inhibition rate did not increase significantly when nano ps increased from 43 91 to 87 82 mg l the inhibition rate increased from 17 43 to 32 30 for 50 µg l bde 47 when nano ps increased from 21 to 43 91 mg l the inhibition rate decreased significantly when nano ps increased from 43 91 to 87 82 mg l the inhibition rate increased from 25 98 to 32 38 for 200 µg l bde 47 the inhibition rate increased from 25 11 to 35 63 all the way when nano ps increased from 21 to 87 82 mg l similarly when the concentration of nano ps increased from 0 to 87 82 mg l cell density also followed a dose response relationship under the presence of bde 47 fig s2 however at a specific concentration of nano ps the inhibition rate did not increase at a fast rate when bde 47 concentration increased 3 3 3 morphological observation sem images of cells exposed to nano ps bde 47 and their mixtures after 96 h were shown in fig 4 cells in the untreated group showed intact cellular structure with complete shape and smooth surface when bde 47 was at 12 5 µg l slight deformation and band folds occurred when bde 47 was at 200 µg l the deformation was aggravated the girdle drastically shrunk and cell shape and size changed when nano ps increased from 43 91 to 87 82 mg l needle and fiber shaped materials gathered on cell surface forming aggregation clusters this indicated spherical beads of nano ps aggregated into needles and fibers which were the most commonly observed microplastics in the field reichelt and gorokhova 2020 plastic aggregation could cause shading effects block light from reaching photosynthetic centers eliminate nutrient uptake and damage cell walls wu et al 2021 when nano ps was at 43 91 mg l and bde 47 increased its concentrations from 12 5 to 200 µg l cells had more deformation and shrinkage moreover there were large quantities of released extracellular polymeric substances eps attached to cell surface contaminants can stimulate cells to secrete more eps to protect cells the mixture could generate more eps to detoxify the cells by encapsulating nanoplastics and reducing direct contact between contaminants and cells huang et al 2021 3 3 4 changes of photosynthetic pigments as shown in fig 3 b when nano ps was at 43 91 mg l chl a increased with bde 47 increasing to 12 5 µg l and decreased with continuous bde 47 increase this change was opposite to inhibition rate when nano ps was at 43 91 mg l the inhibition rate decreased with bde 47 increasing to 12 5 µg l and increased with continuous bde 47 increase for the mixture increased chl a indicated increased cell biomass compared to individual exposures leading to the decreased inhibition rate this stimulatory effect may be attributed to hormesis resulting from low levels of potentially toxic substances xin et al 2019a nano ps aggregation and bde 47 adsorption may reduce the amount of both contaminants acting on cells the low doses of contaminants led to regulatory overcorrections by biosynthetic control mechanisms causing excessive production the accumulation of chl a was also accompanied by the inhibition in cell divisions under stressors in addition when bde 47 was at 50 µg l chl a content was not significantly different from non bde 47 exposure but significantly lower than 12 5 µg l bde 47 exposure when bde 47 was at 200 µg l chl a content was significantly lower than non bde 47 and 12 5 µg l bde 47 exposure thus bde 47 at increased concentrations higher than 12 5 µg l enhanced the binary toxicity 3 3 5 oxidative stress ros could be continuously generated as by products via metabolic pathways in the chloroplasts mitochondria and peroxisomes when photosynthetic species were exposed to environmental stressors liu et al 2007 although oxidative stress could be the main reason to cause growth inhibition by the individuals it might not contribute to growth inhibition for mixtures ros increased significantly in the co exposure of 12 5 µg l bde 47 and 43 91 mg l nano ps compared to individual exposures fig 3 c at the same time mda concentration significantly increased compared to individual exposure fig 3 d the increase in ros and mda were corresponding to increased cell growth and photosynthetic pigments which could be attributed to hormesis previous studies reported that growth stimulation in cyanobacteria caused by low dose contaminants e g metal oxide nanoparticles antibiotics steroid estrogens microplastics was accompanied by increases in ros and mda bai et al 2019 liu et al 2015 wan et al 2015 the reason for such responses could be the increases of cellular metabolic rate and over production of critical biomolecules while being poised for defense from low dose of threat goswami et al 2015 thus high metabolic activity of low dose stimulation was associated with elevated ros production treatments with bde 47 increasing from 50 to 200 µg l had no significant difference from non bde exposure the change in ros was consistent with that in mda this was consistent with gu s study gu et al 2020 when bde 47 was at 0 and 0 1 µg l there was significantly increased ros and mda to mussels in the presence of micro ps when bde 47 was at 10 µg l micro ps did not affect ros and mda production 3 3 6 variation in total proteins the change in the total protein followed a dose response relationship at 96 h as shown in fig 3 e when nano ps was at 43 91 mg l soluble protein only had a significant reduction at 200 µg l of bde 47 compared to non bde 47 exposure fig 3 e it was consistent that the mixture had antagonistic effects on proteins the reduction of protein might decrease the water retention capacity of cells and make cells aggregate easier our results showed ros did not contribute to protein loss however an inhibition in chl a content was consistent with the inhibition in protein pigment protein complexes could form through binding photosynthetic pigments and specific proteins satoh et al 2001 specifically 34 9 and 57 5 of chl a was combined with chl a protein complexes of psii and p700 chl a protein complex the formation of pigment protein complexes played an important role in adaptation to light harvesting environments thus protein content was positively related to chl a content contributing to the consistent inhibition in protein content and chl a content 3 4 correlation analyses and toxicity prediction pearson correlation coefficients could be used to access the linear relationship among multiple endpoints table s4 for individual bde 47 exposure growth inhibition was negatively correlated with chl a and protein content chl a and protein content were positively correlated with each other with a coefficient of 0 993 ros was not significantly correlated to any other endpoints for individual nano ps exposure growth inhibition was correlated with chl a protein content ros and lipid peroxidation with coefficient of 0 951 0 986 0 796 and 0 796 respectively ros was negatively correlated to growth inhibition and lipid peroxidation and was positively correlated to chl a content and protein content similar situation occurred to the mixture exposure for the mixture of nano ps and bde 47 growth inhibition was all negatively correlated with chl a protein content ros and lipid peroxidation it indicated that oxidative stress of the combined effects was mainly affected by the presence of nano ps pca analyses were performed to analyze the correlation among endpoints fig 5 a pca clearly resolved the data into two major components together they accounted for 90 07 of the variability in the original data pc1 accounted for 57 80 of the variation and pc2 for 32 27 endpoints for bde 47 distributed in four quadrants endpoints for nano ps distributed in three quadrants endpoints for the mixture distributed in two quadrants the narrowing down effects for the mixture was probably attributed to the chain reactions among multiple endpoints the toxic effects on one endpoint might probably trigger an effect on another leading to domino effects or the effects on multiple endpoints could act jointly to produce combined effects for the mixture the chain reaction seems to occur more generally than the individuals considering the role of internal interactions growth inhibition rate could be complicated with linear or nonlinear features of chl a protein content ros and lipid peroxidation sca and mlr model were applied to simulate and predict growth inhibition rate model calibration and verification selected randomly sampled data r 2 and root mean square error rmse could be used to access model accuracy sca is a multivariate statistical technology this method is effective for reflecting the non functional relationships between independent and dependent variables it is powerful for prediction among discrete and continuous variables huang 1992 which are difficult to be resolved by conventional methods such as artificial neural network and multi variate regression analysis sun et al 2009 as shown in figure s4 observed data and predicted data of calibration and validation for individuals and mixtures did not show a good linear correlation based on the values of r 2 and rmse these data indicated that the relationship between growth inhibition and other endpoints i e photosynthetic pigment protein content and oxidative stress was not nonlinear mlr is a statistical technique which applies several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable revealing a linear inter relationship maulud et al 2020 as shown in fig 6 observed and predicted data of calibration and validation for individuals and mixtures showed a good linear correlation based on the values of r 2 and rmse these data indicated that growth inhibition and other endpoints i e photosynthetic pigment protein content and oxidative stress had a linear relationship linear relationships can support statistical analysis to determine the presence of correlations and causal relationships between variables when photosynthetic pigment protein content and oxidative stress experienced changes growth inhibition rate changed accordingly stepwise linear regression slr was further used to determine relationships between a response variable and explanatory variables leaving the most related ones table s5 xin et al 2020 for individual bde 47 exposure growth inhibition presented a better regression with protein content suggesting 99 4 of correlation could be explained it indicated bde 47 had the most significant effects on proteins proteins are dominant players relating to both biomass and functionality in cells accounting for approximately half of the total dry mass milo 2013 for individual nano ps exposure growth inhibition rate presented a better regression with protein and chl a content suggesting 99 0 of correlation could be explained it indicated nano ps had significant impacts on proteins and photosynthetic pigments it was reported that ps could reduce chl a yields photosynthetic activities and soluble proteins through affecting the crystalline structure of the water soluble chlorophyll proteins dong et al 2021 for the mixture growth inhibition presented a better regression with protein content and lipid peroxidation suggesting 98 2 of correlation could be explained it indicated the mixture had significant influences on proteins and lipids which could be attributed to the presence of nano ps as reported co existence of nano ps and bde 47 caused stronger oxidative damage and more severe immune stress in mussels gu et al 2020 heat shock proteins and lipid peroxidation were two targets also the mixture of nano ps and bde 47 caused oxidative damage on lipid components and inhibited p glycoproteins and multidrug resistance proteins in rotifers jeong et al 2018 4 conclusions cyanobacteria appeared about three billions years ago they are widely distributed on the planet and can survive in the most hostile environments sánchez baracaldo et al 2022 in the extreme polar habitats cyanobacteria are not only the dominant phototrophs but also most of the microbial biomass most cyanobacteria isolates are likely to be tolerant of the variable factors e g temperature co2 level salinity light which characterize their environment vincent 2000 under such a strong capacity of tolerance to variable natural conditions the present work suggested that arctic cyanobacteria pseudanabaena biceps strain pccc o 153 was more sensitive to nano ps and pbde than natural condition changes under ambient and future climates the mixture of nano ps and bde 47 had antagonistic effects on strain pccc o 153 fig 5 b after 96 h it is likely that the aggregation of nano ps and the adsorption of bde 47 reduced contaminants to enter cells and weaken further adverse effects the released eps wrapped nano ps and bde 47 and also prevented their entrance into cells the binary toxicity probably resulted from the chain reactions triggered by combining individual contaminants growth inhibition could be better simulated and predicted by multiple linear regression model than nonlinear model indicating cell growth was closely affected by photosynthetic pigment protein content and oxidative stress based on ia model nano ps and bde 47 had different modes of action bde 47 acted on total proteins significantly while nano ps affected soluble proteins photosynthetic pigment or probably chlorophyll proteins nano ps was the main reason to cause oxidative stress for the mixture total protein was a sensitive target for both exposures of mixtures and individuals thus compared to climate change arctic cyanobacteria could be more vulnerable to polystyrene nanoplastics and flame retardants transporting to the arctic in short term exposure polystyrene nanoplastics and flame retardants are likely to have more hazardous effects in combinations than climate change shifting factors in arctic waters this is the first study to access the hazardous effects of a mixture of anthropogenic contaminants on arctic cyanobacteria under ambient and future climates the vector role and non degradable properties of nanoplastics extends the life time of emerging contaminants in arctic waters long term effects for the mixture need further exploration although antagonistic effects of the mixture caused less damage on arctic cyanobacteria it could facilitate the entrance of contaminants to arctic food web whatever the impact of anthropogenic contaminants will be they probably originate from distant human sources

15354,polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are found ubiquitously in contaminated aquatic sediments they are difficult to degrade particularly the high molecular weight pahs e g benzo a pyrene bap in this study cao2 assisted with ferrous ion fe ii citric acid ca was applied for the first time in bap degradation in aquatic sediment among the treatment processes we studied cao2 fe ⅱ ca could effectively degrade bap at circumneutral ph 7 0 0 3 reaching a maximum of nearly 80 under optimal conditions 0 84 mm cao2 0 21 mm fe ⅱ and 0 35 mm ca in per gram of dry sediment contrary to some external environmental factors such as temperature common metal ions and natural organic matters a certain amount of moisture content and inorganic anions cl so4 2 exhibited a positive effect on bap degradation which can probably be contributed to the improved mass transfer rate in the non homogeneous sediment water mixture and a higher level of free radicals the degradation kinetic dominated by hydroxyl radicals included three main stages contribution 29 4 43 1 and 2 4 to bap degradation respectively based on the theoretical calculations of density functional theory a pathway for bap degradation was proposed for the treatment of actual contaminated sediment the cao2 fe ii ca process could realize the elimination of black odor and effective removal of pahs from the sediment as well as negligible ecotoxicity on benthic organisms this study provides a reference and guidance for the use of cao2 based fenton like systems in treating pah contaminated black odor river sediments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords calcium peroxide cao2 fe ii citric acid ca complex fenton like process circumneutral ph benzo a pyrene bap black odor sediment data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs persistent organic pollutants with aromatic rings are discharged into the environment primarily through the incomplete combustion or pyrolysis of organic materials liu et al 2021 owing to their endocrine disrupting effects and carcinogenicity wang et al 2020 16 pah compounds have been identified as priority pollutants by the u s environmental protection agency usepa pahs are highly hydrophobic but they also can be adsorbed onto organic matter or surface of fine particles and may eventually enter aquatic sediments high pah contents total concentration of 16 priority pahs 16 pahs up to 1956 mg kg were detected in sediments from urban rivers in different countries and regions liu et al 2021 scoggins et al 2007 reported that the average pah concentrations could reach 3500 mg kg dw in urban river sediment polluted by coal tars in austin texas ofori et al 2021 recorded pah concentrations as high as 1821 5 mg kg in the river sediments of the niger delta region of nigeria when influenced by external environmental factors long term stagnant pollutants e g pahs and organic carbon in the sediment may be re released into the water column through biodegradation or desorption leading to an imbalance in oxygen supply and consumption in the water column wang et al 2022 as a result the water and sediment gradually turn black and develops odors losing its original ecological function over time therefore the removal of pahs should be considered during the treatment of black odorous river sediments calcium peroxide cao2 is a cost effective safe and environmentally friendly chemical that has been widely used for the in situ remediation of black odor rivers and sediments wang et al 2019 xu et al 2018 owing to the energetic peroxide covalent bond o o cao2 can react with water to produce o2 and h2o2 eqs 1 2 lu et al 2017 subsequently removing some persistent organic contaminants such as pahs from sediments the degradation efficiency of cao2 alone is relatively low guo et al 2011 qian et al 2016 studies have shown that cao2 fe ii can rapidly degrade pahs in the aqueous solution cheng et al 2016 usman et al 2016 as h2o2 the hydrolysate of cao2 can be activated by fe ii to form the fenton reaction eq 3 the resulting free radicals i e oh o2 can thus lead to the efficient degradation of pahs 1 2 ca o 2 2 h 2 o o 2 2 ca oh 2 2 ca o 2 2 h 2 o h 2 o 2 ca oh 2 3 fe ii h 2 o 2 oh o h fe iii however most studies have only focused on the treatment of pahs with low molecular weights lmw such as naphthalene nap gholami et al 2019 anthracene ant turek szytow et al 2012 and phenanthrene phe sun et al 2020 rarely involving high molecular weight hmw pahs such as benzo a pyrene bap with five rings such pollutants are often observed in contaminated sediments lu et al 2017 wang et al 2020 are hard to degrade and may pose a greater risk to the environment and human health qian et al 2016 zhang et al 2015a liang et al 2021 the world health organization classifies bap as a level i human carcinogen and the european union has set an indicative limit of 1 ng m3 for bap wang et al 2020 therefore it is crucial to explore a more efficient approach for the treatment of hmw pahs in contaminated sediments the use of fe ii chelating agents such as citric acid ca fu et al 2016a oxalic acid oa venny et al 2012 and glutamic acid ga fu et al 2016b can enhance the fenton fenton like reactions leading to enhanced degradation of organic contaminants cheng et al 2016 usman et al 2016 among them ca is an eco friendly metal chelator with a tricarboxylic acid structure which can bind with iron ions to form reversible fe ii ca complexes zhang et al 2019 this unique structure facilitates the transfer of electrons to metal ions and reduces the standard redox potential of fe ii fe iii coupling fe ii fe iii 0 77 v fe ii fe iii ca 0 037 v yuan et al 2019 moreover the reactivity of ca k ho ca 3 2 108 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 6 with ionized species of ho was lower than that of oa and ga zhang et al 2019 avoiding the competition with the target organic species for free radicals more importantly the fe ii ca complex can maintain the concentration of fe ions which provides feasible conditions for the fenton reaction in order to remove organic contaminants under neutral conditions wang et al 2021 hence it is reasonable to speculate that the cao2 fe ii ca process can remove organic contaminants like hmw pahs under circumneutral conditions however to our knowledge there has been little relevant research conducted the process availability and the involved removal mechanisms of hmw pahs especially in the aquatic sediment system are still unknown to avoid the destruction of sediment habitats through the alteration of acid base environment this study is the first attempt to investigate the treatment of the hmw pahs in a non homogeneous sediment environment at circumneutral ph using the cao2 fe ii ca system the specific objectives were 1 to investigate the removal efficiency of typical hmw pahs contamination bap as an example by the cao2 fe ii ca process and the effects of different factors 2 to establish kinetic modeling of bap degradation and elucidate its degradation mechanism 3 to propose a pathway for bap degradation based on the density functional theory dft and 4 to demonstrate the feasibility of cao2 fe ii ca oxidation application in actual pah contaminated black odor river sediment as well as to evaluate the ecotoxicity of the remediated sediment 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and sediment samples all chemicals used were of analytical grade cao2 75 0 200 mesh ca c6h8o7 99 ferrous chloride fecl2 99 0 potassium

supplementary material the physicochemical characteristics and pah contents of the sediment samples are given in table s1 as more than 55 of the sediment composition was sand the natural river sand from the longgang river longgang district shenzhen china 22 7599 n 113 8363 e with a mean grain size of 245 μm diameter was selected as the model sediment for the simulation experiments the details of the pre treatment procedures for sand are provided in text s1 2 2 experiment procedure oxidation experiments with cao2 fe ii ca were conducted using the following two systems 1 model pollutant i e sand spiked with bap and 2 actual black odor sediment i e sediment spiked with 16 pahs in the first system a solution of bap with dichloromethane dcm was added to the sand at approximately 2 15 µg kg dry weight dw dcm was then evaporated by continuous stirring to uniformly distribute the bap in the sand in the second system the actual sediment samples were continuously stirred in chloroform at 60 c until the organic extracts dried approximately 45 min which helped to increase the availability of pahs then a solution of 16 pahs with dcm was added into sediments and after removing dcm by continuous stirring and evaporation the contaminated sediment with the content of 16 pahs of 8 22 0 20 µg kg dw was obtained table s2 2 2 1 simulation tests seven sets of batch tests were conducted in triplicate to investigate the effects of cao2 fe ii ca treatment on bap degradation and the detailed experiment conditions are listed in table 1 the model polluted sand without any oxidation treatment was used as a control ck the reaction was generally carried out at a ph of 7 0 0 3 temperature of 25 0 1 0 c and a sediment moisture content of 70 0 2 0 unless otherwise specified each set of tests was performed with 300 ml of bap spiked sand and 700 ml of deionized water in a 1 l beaker for dosing different amounts of fe ii and ca were first added to the sediment followed by cao2 the whole reaction was carried out for 240 min with continuous stirring at 200 rpm subsequently 5 ml of samples were taken at 1 5 10 30 60 90 120 and 240 min for each set of tests for further analysis after the optimization of cao2 fe ii and ca dosage the effects of various factors including ph temperature moisture content generated ca oh 2 metal ions cu2 ni2 zn2 al2 mn2 and pb2 inorganic ions cl and so4 2 natural organic matter noms of humic acid ha and reducible sulfur rs on the degradation of bap by the cao2 fe ii ca system were investigated the details of these batch test procedures are given in text s2 2 2 2 actual black odor sediment tests in the actual black odor sediment tests cao2 fe ii ca treatment for 16 pahs degradation was conducted under fixed conditions according to the ratio of

oxalate method was used for spectrophotometric determination of h2o2 at 400 nm sellers et al 1980 the available fe ii concentration was determined by 1 10 phenanthroline spectrophotometry tamura et al 1974 pahs from the sediment were extracted using automated solid phase extraction spe with dcm and then analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms wang et al 2020 the existence of reactive oxygen species ross was detected using electron spin resonance esr spectrometry gao et al 2020 the ph value acid volatile sulfide avs content and total organic carbon toc content were determined according to our previously reported analysis methods wang et al 2022 density functional theory dft calculations were conducted to determine the mechanism and main pathway of bap degradation the toxicity predictions of bap and its degradation intermediates were performed using the ecological structure activity relationships ecosar class program v 2 0 li et al 2022 the ecotoxicological effects of remediated sediments were determined using luminous bacteria of vibrio fischeri and chironomus riparius biotoxicity tests as described by wang et al 2022 a detailed description of the above methods and tools is in text s3 s6 statistical analyses were conducted using spss 25 0 software spss inc chicago il usa with a mean value standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of different cao2 fenton like processes under circumneutral conditions fig 1 a shows bap degradation in different treatment systems at circumneutral ph 7 0 0 3 there was almost no degradation of bap in the cao2 ca fe ii cao2 ca and fe ii ca systems in the cao2 fe ii system only approximately 27 5 of the bap was degraded and most of it was removed after 5 min the bap degradation efficiency of the cao2 fe ii ca system was more remarkable than that of the cao2 fe ii system nearly 30 of bap was rapidly removed within 1 min followed by a fast decrease of the degradation rate of 72 4 before 60 min and an almost complete stop of degradation during the next 180 min these results suggest that the fe ii fe iii ca complex can effectively enhance the removal of bap without adding ca the generated fe ⅲ would form an iron hydroxide fe oh 3 precipitate which hinders the conversion of fe ii fe iii and reduces the oxidation capacity xu et al 2019 moreover yu et al 2018 showed that the coordination between fe ii fe iii and ca could accelerate electron transfer between fe ii and fe iii thus facilitating the fenton reaction eqs 4 5 dulova et al 2017 also demonstrated that the rich carboxylic acid groups of ca can serve as electron shuttle channels to shift the produced electrons to redox active metal ions as the fe ii fe iii ca complex can maintain the concentration level of available iron ions sun et al 2021 it is possible to remove bap by using the cao2 fe ii ca system under neutral conditions 4 fe ii ca fe ii ca 5 fe ii ca h 2 o 2 fe iii ca o h oh the variation of h2o2 concentrations with time in cao2 cao2 fe ⅱ and cao2 fe ⅱ ca systems is shown in fig 1b the same trend was observed in different reaction systems that is the concentration of h2o2 increased to the maximum level within 30 min and then gradually decreased with increasing reaction time and the order of the maximum concentration of h2o2 in different reaction systems followed the sequence of cao2 cao2 fe ii cao2 fe ii ca in the cao2 alone system the apparent rate constant of cao2 dissolution in sediment to produce h2o2 was about 3 27 10 2 mm min 1 text s7 fig s1 which was 2 2 times lower than in the aqueous phase wang et al 2016 this is principally because the dissolution of cao2 was influenced by the non homogeneous sediment water medium solid liquid interface mass transfer and solubility yap et al 2015 in the cao2 fe ii system the h2o2 concentration decreased obviously and the highest h2o2 concentration approximately 35 6 mg l was nearly half of that in the cao2 alone system indicating that the presence of fe ii could effectively catalyze h2o2 produced by cao2 dissolution while in the cao2 fe ii ca system the highest h2o2 concentration was only 10 7 mg l seriously lower than the above two systems obviously the addition of ca facilitated the consumption of h2o2 thus exhibiting higher efficiency of the fenton reaction the soluble fe concentrations were measured as shown in fig s2 in the absence of the ca system soluble fe ii was almost completely consumed in 5 min and the concentration of soluble fe iii increased rapidly after the first 1 min whereas in the ca added system soluble fe ii lasted for 30 min and the concentration of soluble fe iii was maintained at a high level without any precipitation therefore it can be inferred that the initial ionic fe ii rapidly activated the h2o2 that was dissolved by cao2 within 1 min and then both free fe ii and fe ii fe iii ca contributed significantly to the degradation of bap during 30 min and the formed fe ii fe iii ca complexes greatly improved the stability of iron table s3 eqs s5 s7 s11 s13 li et al 2005 as level of soluble fe ii was extremely low after 60 min and we believed that almost all of the soluble fe was in form of fe iii ca complex in this event the transformation of fe iii ca to fe ii ca became a rate limiting step making bap unable to be degraded by h2o2 quickly xu et al 2019 yap et al 2015 in summary the role of ca in the cao2 fe ii ca system could be explained from three perspectives 1 it benefitted for the inhibition of the formation of iron hydroxide precipitate at circumneutral ph and the maintenance of the cyclic conversion between fe ii ca and fe iii ca as evidenced by the higher soluble fe iii and fe ii concentration in the presence of ca than without ca fig s2 2 with the help of ca the standard redox potential of fe ii ca fe iii ca coupling also decreased making the fenton reaction more likely to occur escaping from the limitation of cyclic conversion of fe species the fenton reaction in the cao2 fe ii ca system lasted longer than in a reaction system without ca fig s2 3 the formation of the coordination structures of fe ii ca fe iii ca complexes could rapidly drive the electron transfer and accelerate the decomposition of h2o2 thus showing more effective bap degradation in a short time 3 2 factors influencing the cao2 fe ii ca treatment efficiency 3 2 1 cao2 fe ⅱ and ca dosage fig 2 a c shows the effects of cao2 fe ii and ca dosages on bap degradation with the augment of cao2 amount from 0 21 to 0 84 mm g dw the bap removal efficiency increased from 54 3 to 74 9 fig 2a theoretically the more cao2 the more h2o2 is generated and the intensified fenton reaction thus enhances the degradation of pollutants to some extent xue et al 2018 however increasing cao2 dosage to 1 05 and 1 26 mm g dw inhibited bap removal this might be caused by the self decomposition of excess h2o2 eq 6 and the quenching effect of h2o2 on the reactive oxygen radicals eqs 7 8 zhang wang and li 2015b additionally this effect may also be caused by a ph increase which was discussed below in section 3 2 2 6 2 h 2 o 2 2 h 2 o o 2 7 ho h 2 o 2 h 2 o h o 2 k 5 0 10 7 m 1 s 1 8 ho ho h 2 o 2 k 5 5 10 9 m 1 s 1 ca oh 2 is one of the most dominant products of cao2 based fenton like reaction eqs 1 2 qian et al 2013 with the increase of ca oh 2 content from 0 to 1 26 mm g dw the bap removal efficiency could be improved by 5 2 fig s3 this phenomenon was different from other reports xue et al 2018 tang et al 2020 lu et al 2020 which claimed that the ca oh 2 could inhibit the fenton fenton like reaction yuan et al 2019 reported that ca oh 2 could react with cheating agents to form cac2o4 ksp 2 3 10 9 which has an higher solubility product than fe oh 3 ksp 1 1 10 36 in this case fe oh 3 is more ready to reach saturated concentration and precipitated first which was unfavourable for the fenton like reaction therefore the slight increase in bap removal efficiency with increasing ca oh 2 content may be not related to the production of cac2o4 in the present study however the generation of fe oh 3 might also lead to the consumption of a large amount of oh and the decrease of solution ph the latter to some extent was helpful for the occurrence of cao2 fe ⅱ ca fenton like reaction as mentioned above the contribution of ca oh 2 to bap degradation obtained under optimum conditions was calculated to be less than 2 based on the stoichiometric conversion values between cao2 and ca oh 2 the reason for this slight increase thus needs to be further verified in the future experiments as an activator of h2o2 in the fenton reaction fe ii also plays a major role in this fenton like process as the amount of fe ⅱ increased from 0 07 to 0 21 mm g dw the bap removal efficiency increased from 64 3 to 77 5 fig 2b but a continued increase to 0 35 mm g dw led to a decline of bap degradation efficiency to 58 6 it might be due to the excess fe ii competing with the pollutants for the consumption of the reactive oxygen radicals wang et al 2018 the presence of ca apparently enhanced the removal rate of bap in the sediment treated with cao2 fe ii fig 2c because of the formation of the fe ii fe iii ca complex eqs s6 s7 de luca et al 2014 when the ca dose was increased to 0 35 mm g dw the bap degradation efficiency reached a maximum of 77 1 but when the ca dose continued to increase to 0 49 mm g dw the bap degradation efficiency decreased to 70 1 this may be due to the consumption of oh by excess ca pan et al 2018 moreover zhang et al 2019 claimed that with increasing ca dosing the increased complexation ratio of fe and ca reinforced the steric hindrance effect on fe ii such effects not only made h2o2 less accessible to the active sites of fe ii fe iii ca but also affected the speed of the electron shuttle which was adverse to the fenton reaction and bap degradation 3 2 2 initial ph fig 2d shows the effects of the initial ph 3 0 11 0 on the bap degradation efficiency of the cao2 fe ii ca process the results showed that a high bap degradation efficiency was observed in the initial ph range of 3 0 7 0 when the initial ph was over 9 0 the degradation efficiency of bap was lower a decrease in bap degradation with increasing initial ph might be due to the invalid decomposition of cao2 mostly into o2 or fewer active species existing at high ph values pan et al 2018 although the cao2 fe ii ca system enhanced the removal efficiency of bap at ph 3 0 such strongly acidic conditions were not recommended due to the possibility of the release of soluble organic matter and heavy metals wang et al 2022 moreover the strongly acidic conditions may also aggravate the toxic effects on the entire benthic ecosystem of the river sediment given this the maximum acceptable ph for river sediment remediation should be maintained is approximately 7 0 where the residual bap content can meet the effects range low erl value 430 µg kg when compared with the other processes such as peroxymonosulfate pms activation hung et al 2021 reported previously the cao2 fe ii ca treatment retained competitive advantages in the bap removal 80 vs 65 at a ph of around 7 0 moreover in order to investigate the effect of initial ph on the existing form of complexed metal the iron species distributions were analyzed by simulation using chemical composition modeling software visual minteq v 3 1 fig s4 it was found that the level of bap was significantly reduced at ph 7 where fe ii ions was mainly present as feca and fehca in the presence of ca with a further increase in ph the species of fe shift to fe oh 2 and fe oh 2 and the bap removal efficiency decreased significantly it can be inferred that the contribution of fe oh 2 and fe oh 2 to h2o2 activation was minor this observation was also consistent with the linear relationship between the percentage of feca and bap degradation at different ph values further demonstrating that feca contributes significantly to the activation of h2o2 in the cao2 fe ii ca fenton like system 3 2 3 temperature and moisture content increasing the operating temperature increase effectiveness of fenton fenton like reactions zazo et al 2011 however in this study as the reaction temperature increased from 15 2 c to 40 2 c bap removal decreased from 76 8 to 71 3 fig 3 a this might be explained by cao2 decomposition mainly into o2 rather than h2o2 at higher temperatures wang et al 2016 moisture content plays a critical role in limiting advanced oxidation techniques for contaminated sediment remediation yap et al 2015 with an increase in moisture content from 30 to 90 the bap degradation efficiency increased from 53 3 to 79 2 fig 3a this might be because in complex sediment environments mass transfer rates in stagnant heterogeneous sediment water mixtures lacking free water were significantly lower than those in homogeneous aqueous solutions 3 2 4 co existing ions and natural organic matters six common metal ions in natural soil sediments wang et al 2021 cu2 ni2 zn2 al3 mn2 and pb2 were chosen to investigate the influences of coexisting metal ions on the removal of bap by the cao2 fe ii ca system as shown in fig 3b the degradation of bap showed a decreasing trend in the presence of different metal ions the main reason for this was these ions could compete with fe for ca and inhibit the formation of fe ii fe iii ca complexes xu et al 2019 thus affecting the fenton reaction common inorganic anions such as cl and so4 2 usually exist in natural sediment systems as shown in fig 3c the presence of cl contributed to the degradation of bap which was probably due to the production of the strong oxidants cl redox potential of 2 4 v and cl2 eq 9 11 both of which had similar reaction rate constants with ho similarly the presence of so4 2 also facilitated bap degradation as shown in fig 3c as the so4 2 content increased from 0 to 2 5 mm g dw the bap degradation efficiency increased from 62 4 to 77 2 which can be attributed to the generation of so4 eq 12 9 c l ho clho 10 clh o h cl h 2 o 11 cl c l cl 2 12 ho so 4 so 4 o h natural organic matters noms such as has and rss are important components of soil and sediment the effects of different doses of has and rss on bap degradation were investigated fig 3d when the amount of has and rss increased from 0 to 0 05 mm g dw the degradation efficiency of bap decreased from 74 5 and 73 3 to 49 2 and 42 7 respectively a similar phenomenon was observed by lu et al 2020 ha or rs act as a potential contaminant and could become scavengers by competing with bap for ross thus inhibiting the bap removal 3 3 reaction mechanism of cao2 fe ii ca process 3 3 1 identification of primary reactive species the reactive oxygen species present in the cao2 fe ii ca system are shown in fig 4 there was a significant decrease in the degradation efficiency of bap with the addition of different scavenging agents fig 4a which suggested that ho o2 and 1o2 might be produced and responsible for the bap removal in the cao2 fe ii ca system according to the chemiluminescence and uv vis spectra ma et al 2007 proved the presence of ho and o2 on the surface of cao2 in contact with water and stated that o2 was originated from ho and h2o2 in cao2 suspension eq 13 while 1o2 can be produced from o2 eq 14 and or through a disproportionation reaction of h2o2 that catalyzed by ca ii in the cao2 system as described by eq 15 zhang wang and li 2015b 13 ho 2 h 2 o 2 h 2 o o 2 h 14 2 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 1 o 2 2 o h 15 2 h 2 o 2 c a 2 2 h 2 o α 1 o 2 1 α 3 o 2 the experiment results with different concentrations of scavenging agents are also presented in fig s5 the addition of excessive ba 50 mm could not completely inhibit the bap degradation indicating that other reactive oxygen radicals also played a role in the reaction in addition to ho similar inhibition phenomenon also happened when excessive nbt was added however the degree of inhibition was less severe in this case which seemed to imply a lesser role of o2 in bap degradation than ho l histidine has generally been employed to scavenge both the ho k 5 109 m 1 s 1 and 1o2 k 5 107 m 1 s 1 in many studies compared to adding excessive ba excessive l histidine 5 mm could not only suppress degradation of bap effectively but even to a lower level suggesting that the 1o2 facilitated the degradation of part bap compared with ho the contribution of 1o2 to bap degradation was relatively minor and ho was regarded as the core reactive radical in the fenton and fenton like processes to further highlight the role of ho the variations of free radicals along with time are shown in fig 4b initially only ho with a peak height ratio of 1 2 2 1 was observed the corresponding intensity was the highest at 1 min then decayed but remained at a certain level within 30 min this suggested that ho was the predominant reactive species during this period pan et al 2018 the o2 adduct with a weak peak height ratio of 1 1 1 1 was also observed after 10 min further indicating that the existence of o2 might be involved in the oxidative degradation reaction as o2 could be easily consumed by ho eq 16 it only played a limited role in the bap degradation which was in agreement with the scavenging experiment results 16 ho o 2 h 2 o o 2 k 8 9 10 9 with regard to 1o2 it was not detectable using esr which was probably due to the low concentration or its rapid transformation rate pan et al 2018 reported that water owns a high first order rate constant with 1o2 k water 2 5 105 s 1 which was over 300 times higher than bap with 1o2 k bap 1 0 106 m 1 s 1 therefore the occurrence of 1o2 had low opportunity to react with bap 3 3 2 reaction kinetics during different stages fig 5 shows the bap removal curve within 150 min in the cao2 fe ii ca reaction system in the literatures the degradation processes were generally segmented and kinetically fitted to accurately reflect the changes in the content of the substrate and the dominant reactions performed at different time periods ling et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 by doing this more detailed and clear description of the degradation process of pollutants in a fenton like reaction could be obtained therefore this universally accepted and feasible method was also employed in the present study it could be observed that the bap removal curve could be divided into three stages and each period followed a pseudo first order reaction kinetic model with a high fitting coefficient r2 0 90 fig s6 the first stage was the rapid destruction of bap i e the reaction occurs within 1 min the second stage was the fast degradation of bap from 1 to 30 min and the third stage corresponded to the slow degradation of bap i e the reaction after 30 min specifically stage 1 corresponded to the rapid degradation of bap within t1 1 min in this initial stage sufficient cao2 ensures the continuous running of fenton reaction where a large amount of ionic fe ii is consumed according to the rate equation text s8 of fe ii consumption reported previously wu et al 2014 it was calculated that approximately 90 of fe ii 2 85 mm was exhausted within 1 min which was in agreement with the results mentioned in section 3 2 1 despite of the generation of fe iii and complexed iron species the initial ionic fe ii was still the major motivity to the decomposition of h2o2 into ho the resulting ho during this period might contribute to approximately 29 4 of the bap degradation the apparent rate constant of which could reach 3 481 101 min 1 stage 2 was the fast degradation of bap between t1 and t2 30 min in this phase abundant ca make the complexed iron species predominant at circumneutral ph as the bap concentration is still at a high level of 1 52 mg kg dw 5 88 mm g dw which was about 27 times higher than the fe ii fe iii ca concentration in this event the generated ross have a higher chance of reacting with bap rather than complexed iron species and h2o2 again under similar conditions chen et al 2021 reported that the reaction apparent rate constant for the reaction between the fe ii fe iii ca complex and oh was 2 0 108 m 1 s 1 which was lower than those for the reaction between bap and oh k 8 99 109 m 1 s 1 and the reaction between h2o2 and oh k 9 33 108 m 1 s 1 in the process of uv peracetic acid for degradation of bap pan et al 2018 the overall bap removal in stage 2 was approximately 43 1 with the apparent rate constant of 2 51 10 2 min 1 stage 3 corresponded to the slow degradation of bap after t2 30 min the beginning of this stage was indicated by the depletion of cao2 and stable concentration of residual h2o2 in the system mang et al 2016 in this stage fe ii fe iii ca competed for oh because of the low concentration of bap and h2o2 the decomplexation of fe ii fe iii ca may result in the decreasing concentration of soluble fe iii and the oxidative degradation of ca li et al 2022 which would make the bap degradation even more difficult the overall bap degradation in stage 3 was only approximately 2 4 with the apparent rate constant of 0 11 10 2 min 1 on the whole the contribution to bap removal at different stages in the cao2 fe ii ca process showed the following sequence stage 2 43 1 stage 1 29 4 stage 3 2 4 3 4 degradation intermediates and pathways of bap 3 4 1 dft calculation on bap reactive sites fig 6 shows the dft based fukui indices of bap including electrophilic reactivity f and radical attack tendency f 0 as shown in fig 6a the top three carbon atom with the highest f and f 0 values were observed at c7 f f 0 0 075 0 0723 c29 f f 0 0 0627 0 0612 and c25 f f 0 0 0577 0 0552 respectively among them the c7 atom was the most vulnerable to the attack of electrophilic oh radical which was the main ros generated during the degradation of bap by the cao2 fe ii ca system this agreed with the charge distribution values of bap molecules obtained from natural population analysis npa table s4 the corresponding distribution of the highest occupied molecular orbits homo e homo 0 247 ev and lowest unoccupied molecular orbits lumo e lumo 0 039 ev of bap is shown in fig 6 b it depicts the wavelike manner of electrons in bap and shows the visualization of electron rich or electron deficient positions ji et al 2021 3 4 2 proposed bap degradation pathway fig 7 presents the main pathway of the proposed bap degradation in the cao2 fe ii ca system the intermediates identified by the gc ms analysis are presented in fig s7 and mass spectra are available in table s5 based on the position of carbon atoms with high f and f 0 values fig 6 and thermodynamic and physicochemical properties of the bap degradation process the highest δg value obtained from dft calculation indicates that the reaction for oh generation on initial bap step 1 δg 1 35 82 kcal mol might be the limiting step further oxidation caused the ring opening of im1 to form the intermediate 1 2 dihydroxy anthraquinone im2 δg 2 596 85 kcal mol next the ring opening reaction of im2 led to im3 formed step 3 δg 3 115 55 kcal mol which is an important intermediate widely present during the degradation of bap bendouz et al 2017 then im3 broke the bond to form phthalic acid im4 step 4 δg4 138 38 kcal mol due to the high energy of the reaction process the formation of im5 step 5 δg 5 211 05 kcal mol remained thermodynamically spontaneous even though it showed a big energy gap between im4 and im5 fig s8 the resulting benzoic formic anhydride was further oxidized and cleaved to smaller molecular weight compounds that is benzoylformic acid benzoic acid and benzyl alcohol step 6 δg 6 315 49 kcal mol lee et al 2001 and finally mineralized to co2 and h2o step 7 δg 9 102 15 kcal mol the real time abundances of bap degradation intermediates and their retention times rt are listed in tables s5 s6 among them im1 im3 im4 and im7 were the most abundant intermediates which accumulated within the first 1 min of the reaction and then decreased rapidly no evident signal intermediates were observed after 150 min of reaction the toxicity predictions of bap and its degradation intermediates by qsar analysis in the ecosar program revealed that the primary degradation products im1 and im2 showed similar toxicity to that of bap which indicates that the oxidation of a certain carbon site of bap could not reduce its toxicity fig s9 while im3 8 presented much lower toxicity and im6 8 was not harmful indicating that the opening of the benzene ring was conducive to detoxification in general the toxicity of bap degradation intermediates decreases with decreasing molecular weight fig s10 shows the toc variation in the reaction system along with the time after 96 h of reaction 72 11 of the toc was removed suggesting that the cao2 fe ii ca system had a high mineralization capacity for bap 3 5 feasibility verification for actual black odor sediment treatment 3 5 1 black odor elimination and pahs degradation changes in the physicochemical properties of the avs color ph and toc of the sediment after cao2 fe ii ca remediation are shown in figs 8 a and s8 the avs content declined from 1800 mg kg dw to approximately 30 mg kg dw the black odor sediment changed to earth yellow and the odor gradually vanished wang et al 2022 indicated that avs was a major contributor to black sediments and odors which were formed mainly under reducing conditions therefore the oxygen sources provided by cao2 dissolution were critical for the remediation of black odor sediments fig s11 shows that the ph variation fluctuated between 6 7 7 3 and the toc content decreased from 4 8 to approximately 2 6 0 2 in the remediated sediment indicating that cao2 fe ii ca treatment can effectively remove organic pollutants from the sediment and maintain an environmentally suitable ph for the growth of benthic organisms however the altered physico chemical properties of sediments may change the present forms of heavy metals eq 17 lu et al 2017 demonstrated that cao2 addition could affect the organic matter sulfide bound heavy metals and increase the fraction of exchangeable form of heavy metals which poses a vulnerability to the ecological safety of urban water in the construction of sponge cities consequently further studies should evaluate the potential risk of heavy metal release from overlying water bodies when cao2 fe ii ca treatment is applied 17 o 2 h 2 o 2 ms m 2 so 4 2 fig 8b shows the pahs variation in the cao2 fe ⅱ ca remediated sediment the residual pahs decreased from 9300 µg kg dw to approximately 2500 µg kg dw after 30 d of treatment lower than the erl 4022 µg kg dw in addition the degradation efficiency of various pahs reached nearly 80 regardless of the low phe medium fln and high molecular bap weight of pahs all these results demonstrated that the cao2 fe ii ca system exhibited a good treatment capacity for contaminated sediment 3 5 2 ecotoxicological effects fig 9 shows the results of the luminous bacteria based toxicity tests and c riparius survival tests of the cao2 fe ii ca remediated sediment as shown in fig 9a the luminescence intensity of vibrio fischeri in the cao2 fe ii ca treated sediment ranged from 81 2 to 88 0 before 15 d which was lower than that of the ck group p 0 01 this might be related to the generation of h2o2 from cao2 dissolution which was proven to negatively correlate with the relative luminescence intensity of v fischeri wang et al 2022 however the luminescence intensity of the test group was greater than 80 which indicated slight toxicity wang et al 2022 this effect was further reduced with increasing treatment time after 15 d indicating that the ecotoxicity of the amended sediment gradually decreased and finally created a non toxic and friendly environment for the luminescent bacteria fig 9b shows the results of the bioassay performed with c riparius a slight decrease in the survival rate of c riparius was found upon exposure to the cao2 fe ii ca treatment sediments which was approximately 5 lower than that in the ck group p 0 01 subsequently the survival rate of c riparius improved gradually increasing to 87 5 by 30 d of remediation these results are in agreement with the results of luminous bacteria based toxicity tests therefore the cao2 fe ii ca system was not only effective in black odor elimination and removal of pahs from sediments but also showed negligible biotoxicity to benthic organisms thus promoting the gradual recovery of sediment ecology 4 conclusion in this study the effects of cao2 fe ii ca treatment on bap degradation under circumneutral conditions were investigated the mechanism kinetic model and pathways of bap degradation in this process were revealed and the remediation feasibility for actual pah contaminated black odor sediment was evaluated the results showed that the mass transfer rate was limited in the non homogeneous sediment water mixture and h2o2 yield from dissolved cao2 was about 1 4 times lower than in the homogeneous aqueous solutions nevertheless the cao2 fe ii ca system effectively removed nearly 80 of bap at circumneutral ph under optimal conditions in this process ho o2 and 1o2 were generated among which ho was the dominant species during bap degradation and three stages of kinetic modeling revealed the bap degradation process and its mechanism the main pathway for bap degradation was proposed and the toxicity of bap degradation intermediates and products was found to decrease with decreasing molecular weight regarding actual black odor sediment cao2 fe ii ca treatment was demonstrated to eliminate the black odor and effectively remove of pahs from the sediment while exerting negligible ecotoxicity on benthic organisms overall this study provides reference and guidance for using cao2 based fenton like systems in treating practical pah contaminated black odor river sediments further studies are required to analyze the potential changes in heavy metal forms and to evaluate the potential heavy metal release risk in overlying water bodies when cao2 fe ii ca treatment is applied

15354,polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are found ubiquitously in contaminated aquatic sediments they are difficult to degrade particularly the high molecular weight pahs e g benzo a pyrene bap in this study cao2 assisted with ferrous ion fe ii citric acid ca was applied for the first time in bap degradation in aquatic sediment among the treatment processes we studied cao2 fe ⅱ ca could effectively degrade bap at circumneutral ph 7 0 0 3 reaching a maximum of nearly 80 under optimal conditions 0 84 mm cao2 0 21 mm fe ⅱ and 0 35 mm ca in per gram of dry sediment contrary to some external environmental factors such as temperature common metal ions and natural organic matters a certain amount of moisture content and inorganic anions cl so4 2 exhibited a positive effect on bap degradation which can probably be contributed to the improved mass transfer rate in the non homogeneous sediment water mixture and a higher level of free radicals the degradation kinetic dominated by hydroxyl radicals included three main stages contribution 29 4 43 1 and 2 4 to bap degradation respectively based on the theoretical calculations of density functional theory a pathway for bap degradation was proposed for the treatment of actual contaminated sediment the cao2 fe ii ca process could realize the elimination of black odor and effective removal of pahs from the sediment as well as negligible ecotoxicity on benthic organisms this study provides a reference and guidance for the use of cao2 based fenton like systems in treating pah contaminated black odor river sediments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords calcium peroxide cao2 fe ii citric acid ca complex fenton like process circumneutral ph benzo a pyrene bap black odor sediment data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs persistent organic pollutants with aromatic rings are discharged into the environment primarily through the incomplete combustion or pyrolysis of organic materials liu et al 2021 owing to their endocrine disrupting effects and carcinogenicity wang et al 2020 16 pah compounds have been identified as priority pollutants by the u s environmental protection agency usepa pahs are highly hydrophobic but they also can be adsorbed onto organic matter or surface of fine particles and may eventually enter aquatic sediments high pah contents total concentration of 16 priority pahs 16 pahs up to 1956 mg kg were detected in sediments from urban rivers in different countries and regions liu et al 2021 scoggins et al 2007 reported that the average pah concentrations could reach 3500 mg kg dw in urban river sediment polluted by coal tars in austin texas ofori et al 2021 recorded pah concentrations as high as 1821 5 mg kg in the river sediments of the niger delta region of nigeria when influenced by external environmental factors long term stagnant pollutants e g pahs and organic carbon in the sediment may be re released into the water column through biodegradation or desorption leading to an imbalance in oxygen supply and consumption in the water column wang et al 2022 as a result the water and sediment gradually turn black and develops odors losing its original ecological function over time therefore the removal of pahs should be considered during the treatment of black odorous river sediments calcium peroxide cao2 is a cost effective safe and environmentally friendly chemical that has been widely used for the in situ remediation of black odor rivers and sediments wang et al 2019 xu et al 2018 owing to the energetic peroxide covalent bond o o cao2 can react with water to produce o2 and h2o2 eqs 1 2 lu et al 2017 subsequently removing some persistent organic contaminants such as pahs from sediments the degradation efficiency of cao2 alone is relatively low guo et al 2011 qian et al 2016 studies have shown that cao2 fe ii can rapidly degrade pahs in the aqueous solution cheng et al 2016 usman et al 2016 as h2o2 the hydrolysate of cao2 can be activated by fe ii to form the fenton reaction eq 3 the resulting free radicals i e oh o2 can thus lead to the efficient degradation of pahs 1 2 ca o 2 2 h 2 o o 2 2 ca oh 2 2 ca o 2 2 h 2 o h 2 o 2 ca oh 2 3 fe ii h 2 o 2 oh o h fe iii however most studies have only focused on the treatment of pahs with low molecular weights lmw such as naphthalene nap gholami et al 2019 anthracene ant turek szytow et al 2012 and phenanthrene phe sun et al 2020 rarely involving high molecular weight hmw pahs such as benzo a pyrene bap with five rings such pollutants are often observed in contaminated sediments lu et al 2017 wang et al 2020 are hard to degrade and may pose a greater risk to the environment and human health qian et al 2016 zhang et al 2015a liang et al 2021 the world health organization classifies bap as a level i human carcinogen and the european union has set an indicative limit of 1 ng m3 for bap wang et al 2020 therefore it is crucial to explore a more efficient approach for the treatment of hmw pahs in contaminated sediments the use of fe ii chelating agents such as citric acid ca fu et al 2016a oxalic acid oa venny et al 2012 and glutamic acid ga fu et al 2016b can enhance the fenton fenton like reactions leading to enhanced degradation of organic contaminants cheng et al 2016 usman et al 2016 among them ca is an eco friendly metal chelator with a tricarboxylic acid structure which can bind with iron ions to form reversible fe ii ca complexes zhang et al 2019 this unique structure facilitates the transfer of electrons to metal ions and reduces the standard redox potential of fe ii fe iii coupling fe ii fe iii 0 77 v fe ii fe iii ca 0 037 v yuan et al 2019 moreover the reactivity of ca k ho ca 3 2 108 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 6 with ionized species of ho was lower than that of oa and ga zhang et al 2019 avoiding the competition with the target organic species for free radicals more importantly the fe ii ca complex can maintain the concentration of fe ions which provides feasible conditions for the fenton reaction in order to remove organic contaminants under neutral conditions wang et al 2021 hence it is reasonable to speculate that the cao2 fe ii ca process can remove organic contaminants like hmw pahs under circumneutral conditions however to our knowledge there has been little relevant research conducted the process availability and the involved removal mechanisms of hmw pahs especially in the aquatic sediment system are still unknown to avoid the destruction of sediment habitats through the alteration of acid base environment this study is the first attempt to investigate the treatment of the hmw pahs in a non homogeneous sediment environment at circumneutral ph using the cao2 fe ii ca system the specific objectives were 1 to investigate the removal efficiency of typical hmw pahs contamination bap as an example by the cao2 fe ii ca process and the effects of different factors 2 to establish kinetic modeling of bap degradation and elucidate its degradation mechanism 3 to propose a pathway for bap degradation based on the density functional theory dft and 4 to demonstrate the feasibility of cao2 fe ii ca oxidation application in actual pah contaminated black odor river sediment as well as to evaluate the ecotoxicity of

from the longgang river longgang district shenzhen china 22 7599 n 113 8363 e with a mean grain size of 245 μm diameter was selected as the model sediment for the simulation experiments the details of the pre treatment procedures for sand are provided in text s1 2 2 experiment procedure oxidation experiments with cao2 fe ii ca were conducted using the following two systems 1 model pollutant i e sand spiked with bap and 2 actual black odor sediment i e sediment spiked with 16 pahs in the first system a solution of bap with dichloromethane dcm was added to the sand at approximately 2 15 µg kg dry weight dw dcm was then evaporated by continuous stirring to uniformly distribute the bap in the sand in the second system the actual sediment samples were continuously stirred in chloroform at 60 c until the organic extracts dried approximately 45 min which helped to increase the availability of pahs then a solution of 16 pahs with dcm was added into sediments and after removing dcm by continuous stirring and evaporation the contaminated sediment with the content of 16 pahs of 8 22 0 20 µg kg dw was obtained table s2 2 2 1 simulation tests seven sets of batch tests were conducted in triplicate to investigate the effects of cao2 fe ii ca treatment on bap degradation and the detailed experiment conditions are listed in table 1 the model polluted sand without any oxidation treatment was used as a control ck the reaction was generally carried out at a ph of 7 0 0 3 temperature of 25 0 1 0 c and a sediment moisture content of 70 0 2 0 unless otherwise specified each set of tests was performed with 300 ml of bap spiked sand and 700 ml of deionized water in a 1 l beaker for dosing different amounts of fe ii and ca were first added to the sediment followed by cao2 the whole

text s2 2 2 2 actual black odor sediment tests in the actual black odor sediment tests cao2 fe ii ca treatment for 16 pahs degradation was conducted under fixed conditions according to the ratio of

oxalate method was used for spectrophotometric determination of h2o2 at 400 nm sellers et al 1980 the available fe ii concentration was determined by 1 10 phenanthroline spectrophotometry tamura et al 1974 pahs from the sediment were extracted using automated solid phase extraction spe with dcm and then analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms wang et al 2020 the existence of reactive oxygen species ross was detected using electron spin resonance esr spectrometry gao et al 2020 the ph value acid volatile sulfide avs content and total organic carbon toc content were determined according to our previously reported analysis methods wang et al 2022 density functional theory dft calculations were conducted to determine the mechanism and main pathway of bap degradation the toxicity predictions of bap and its degradation intermediates were performed using the ecological structure activity relationships ecosar class program v 2 0 li et al 2022 the ecotoxicological effects of remediated sediments were determined using luminous bacteria of vibrio fischeri and chironomus riparius biotoxicity tests as described by wang et al 2022 a detailed description of the above methods and tools is in text s3 s6 statistical analyses were conducted using spss 25 0 software spss inc chicago il usa with a mean value standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of different cao2 fenton like processes under circumneutral conditions fig 1 a shows bap degradation in different treatment systems at circumneutral ph 7 0 0 3 there was almost no degradation of bap in the cao2 ca fe ii cao2 ca and fe ii ca systems in the cao2 fe ii system only approximately 27 5 of the bap was degraded and most of it was removed after 5 min the bap degradation efficiency of the cao2 fe ii ca system was more remarkable than that of the cao2 fe ii system nearly 30 of bap was rapidly removed within 1 min followed by a fast decrease of the degradation rate of 72 4 before 60 min and an almost complete stop of degradation during the next 180 min these results suggest that the fe ii fe iii ca complex can effectively enhance the removal of bap without adding ca the generated fe ⅲ would form an iron hydroxide fe oh 3 precipitate which hinders the conversion of fe ii fe iii and reduces the oxidation capacity xu et al 2019 moreover yu et al 2018 showed that the coordination between fe ii fe iii and ca could accelerate electron transfer between fe ii and fe iii thus facilitating the fenton reaction eqs 4 5 dulova et al 2017 also demonstrated that the rich carboxylic acid groups of ca can serve as electron shuttle channels to shift the produced electrons to redox active metal ions as the fe ii fe iii ca complex can maintain the concentration level of available iron ions sun et al 2021 it is possible to remove bap by using the cao2 fe ii ca system under neutral conditions 4 fe ii ca fe ii ca 5 fe ii ca h 2 o 2 fe iii ca o h oh the variation of h2o2 concentrations with time in cao2 cao2 fe ⅱ and cao2 fe ⅱ ca systems is shown in fig 1b the same trend was observed in different reaction systems that is the concentration of h2o2 increased to the maximum level within 30 min and then gradually decreased with increasing reaction time and the order of the maximum concentration of h2o2 in different reaction systems followed the sequence of cao2 cao2 fe ii cao2 fe ii ca in the cao2 alone system the apparent rate constant of cao2 dissolution in sediment to produce h2o2 was about 3 27 10 2 mm min 1 text s7 fig s1 which was 2 2 times lower than in the aqueous phase wang et al 2016 this is principally because the dissolution of cao2 was influenced by the non homogeneous sediment water medium solid liquid interface mass transfer and solubility yap et al 2015 in the cao2 fe ii system the h2o2 concentration decreased obviously and the highest h2o2 concentration approximately 35 6 mg l was nearly half of that in the cao2 alone system indicating that the presence of fe ii could effectively catalyze h2o2 produced by cao2 dissolution while in the cao2 fe ii ca system the highest h2o2 concentration was only 10 7 mg l seriously lower than the above two systems obviously the addition of ca facilitated the consumption of h2o2 thus exhibiting higher efficiency of the fenton reaction the soluble fe concentrations were measured as shown in fig s2 in the absence of the ca system soluble fe ii was almost completely consumed in 5 min and the concentration of soluble fe iii increased rapidly after the first 1 min whereas in the ca added system soluble fe ii lasted for 30 min and the concentration of soluble fe iii was maintained at a high level without any precipitation therefore it can be inferred that the initial ionic fe ii rapidly activated the h2o2 that was dissolved by cao2 within 1 min and then both free fe ii and fe ii fe iii ca contributed significantly to the degradation of bap during 30 min and the formed fe ii fe iii ca complexes greatly improved the stability of iron table s3 eqs s5 s7 s11 s13 li et al 2005 as level of soluble fe ii was extremely low after 60 min and we believed that almost all of the soluble fe was in form of fe iii ca complex in this event the transformation of fe iii ca to fe ii ca became a rate limiting step making bap unable to be degraded by h2o2 quickly xu et al 2019 yap et al 2015 in summary the role of ca in the cao2 fe ii ca system could be explained from three perspectives 1 it benefitted for the inhibition of the formation of iron hydroxide precipitate at circumneutral ph and the maintenance of the cyclic conversion between fe ii ca and fe iii ca as evidenced by the higher soluble fe iii and fe ii concentration in the presence of ca than without ca fig s2 2 with the help of ca the standard redox potential of fe ii ca fe iii ca coupling also decreased making the fenton reaction more likely to occur escaping from the limitation of cyclic conversion of fe species the fenton reaction in the cao2 fe ii ca system lasted longer than in a reaction system without ca fig s2 3 the formation of the coordination structures of fe ii ca fe iii ca complexes could rapidly drive the electron transfer and accelerate the decomposition of h2o2 thus showing more effective bap degradation in a short time 3 2 factors influencing the cao2 fe ii ca treatment efficiency 3 2 1 cao2 fe ⅱ and ca dosage fig 2 a c shows the effects of cao2 fe ii and ca dosages on bap degradation with the augment of cao2 amount from 0 21 to 0 84 mm g dw the bap removal efficiency increased from 54 3 to 74 9 fig 2a theoretically the more cao2 the more h2o2 is generated and the intensified fenton reaction thus enhances the degradation of pollutants to some extent xue et al 2018 however increasing cao2 dosage to 1 05 and 1 26 mm g dw inhibited bap removal this might be caused by the self decomposition of excess h2o2 eq 6 and the quenching effect of h2o2 on the reactive oxygen radicals eqs 7 8 zhang wang and li 2015b additionally this effect may also be caused by a ph increase which was discussed below in section 3 2 2 6 2 h 2 o 2 2 h 2 o o 2 7 ho h 2 o 2 h 2 o h o 2 k 5 0 10 7 m 1 s 1 8 ho ho h 2 o 2 k 5 5 10 9 m 1 s 1 ca oh 2 is one of the most dominant products of cao2 based fenton like reaction eqs 1 2 qian et al 2013 with the increase of ca oh 2 content from 0 to 1 26 mm g dw the bap removal efficiency could be improved by 5 2 fig s3 this phenomenon was different from other reports xue et al 2018 tang et al 2020 lu et al 2020 which claimed that the ca oh 2 could inhibit the fenton fenton like reaction yuan et al 2019 reported that ca oh 2 could react with cheating agents to form cac2o4 ksp 2 3 10 9 which has an higher solubility product than fe oh 3 ksp 1 1 10 36 in this case fe oh 3 is more ready to reach saturated concentration and precipitated first which was unfavourable for the fenton like reaction therefore the slight increase in bap removal efficiency with increasing ca oh 2 content may be not related to the production of cac2o4 in the present study however the generation of fe oh 3 might also lead to the consumption of a large amount of oh and the decrease of solution ph the latter to some extent was helpful for the occurrence of cao2 fe ⅱ ca fenton like reaction as mentioned above the contribution of ca oh 2 to bap degradation obtained under optimum conditions was calculated to be less than 2 based on the stoichiometric conversion values between cao2 and ca oh 2 the reason for this slight increase thus needs to be further verified in the future experiments as an activator of h2o2 in the fenton reaction fe ii also plays a major role in this fenton like process as the amount of fe ⅱ increased from 0 07 to 0 21 mm g dw the bap removal efficiency increased from 64 3 to 77 5 fig 2b but a continued increase to 0 35 mm g dw led to a decline of bap degradation efficiency to 58 6 it might be due to the excess fe ii competing with the pollutants for the consumption of the reactive oxygen radicals wang et al 2018 the presence of ca apparently enhanced the removal rate of bap in the sediment treated with cao2 fe ii fig 2c because of the formation of the fe ii fe iii ca complex eqs s6 s7 de luca et al 2014 when the ca dose was increased to 0 35 mm g dw the bap degradation efficiency reached a maximum of 77 1 but when the ca dose continued to increase to 0 49 mm g dw the bap degradation efficiency decreased to 70 1 this may be due to the consumption of oh by excess ca pan et al 2018 moreover zhang et al 2019 claimed that with increasing ca dosing the increased complexation ratio of fe and ca reinforced the steric hindrance effect on fe ii such effects not only made h2o2 less accessible to the active sites of fe ii fe iii ca but also affected the speed of the electron shuttle which was adverse to the fenton reaction and bap degradation 3 2 2 initial ph fig 2d shows the effects of the initial ph 3 0 11 0 on the bap degradation efficiency of the cao2 fe ii ca process the results showed that a high bap degradation efficiency was observed in the initial ph range of 3 0 7 0 when the initial ph was over 9 0 the degradation efficiency of bap was lower a decrease in bap degradation with increasing initial ph might be due to the invalid decomposition of cao2 mostly into o2 or fewer active species existing at high ph values pan et al 2018 although the cao2 fe ii ca system enhanced the removal efficiency of bap at ph 3 0 such strongly acidic conditions were not recommended due to the possibility of the release of soluble organic matter and heavy metals wang et al 2022 moreover the strongly acidic conditions may also aggravate the toxic effects on the entire benthic ecosystem of the river sediment given this the maximum acceptable ph for river sediment remediation should be maintained is approximately 7 0 where the residual bap content can meet the effects range low erl value 430 µg kg when compared with the other processes such as peroxymonosulfate pms activation hung et al 2021 reported previously the cao2 fe ii ca treatment retained competitive advantages in the bap removal 80 vs 65 at a ph of around 7 0 moreover in order to investigate the effect of initial ph on the existing form of complexed metal the iron species distributions were analyzed by simulation using chemical composition modeling software visual minteq v 3 1 fig s4 it was found that the level of bap was significantly reduced at ph 7 where fe ii ions was mainly present as feca and fehca in the presence of ca with a further increase in ph the species of fe shift to fe oh 2 and fe oh 2 and the bap removal efficiency decreased significantly it can be inferred that the contribution of fe oh 2 and fe oh 2 to h2o2 activation was minor this observation was also consistent with the linear relationship between the percentage of feca and bap degradation at different ph values further demonstrating that feca contributes significantly to the activation of h2o2 in the cao2 fe ii ca fenton like system 3 2 3 temperature and moisture content increasing the operating temperature increase effectiveness of fenton fenton like reactions zazo et al 2011 however in this study as the reaction temperature increased from 15 2 c to 40 2 c bap removal decreased from 76 8 to 71 3 fig 3 a this might be explained by cao2 decomposition mainly into o2 rather than h2o2 at higher temperatures wang et al 2016 moisture content plays a critical role in limiting advanced oxidation techniques for contaminated sediment remediation yap et al 2015 with an increase in moisture content from 30 to 90 the bap degradation efficiency increased from 53 3 to 79 2 fig 3a this might be because in complex sediment environments mass transfer rates in stagnant heterogeneous sediment water mixtures lacking free water were significantly lower than those in homogeneous aqueous solutions 3 2 4 co existing ions and natural organic matters six common metal ions in natural soil sediments wang et al 2021 cu2 ni2 zn2 al3 mn2 and pb2 were chosen to investigate the influences of coexisting metal ions on the removal of bap by the cao2 fe ii ca system as shown in fig 3b the degradation of bap showed a decreasing trend in the presence of different metal ions the main reason for this was these ions could compete with fe for ca and inhibit the formation of fe ii fe iii ca complexes xu et al 2019 thus affecting the fenton reaction common inorganic anions such as cl and so4 2 usually exist in natural sediment systems as shown in fig 3c the presence of cl contributed to the degradation of bap which was probably due to the production of the strong oxidants cl redox potential of 2 4 v and cl2 eq 9 11 both of which had similar reaction rate constants with ho similarly the presence of so4 2 also facilitated bap degradation as shown in fig 3c as the so4 2 content increased from 0 to 2 5 mm g dw the bap degradation efficiency increased from 62 4 to 77 2 which can be attributed to the generation of so4 eq 12 9 c l ho clho 10 clh o h cl h 2 o 11 cl c l cl 2 12 ho so 4 so 4 o h natural organic matters noms such as has and rss are important components of soil and sediment the effects of different doses of has and rss on bap degradation were investigated fig 3d when the amount of has and rss increased from 0 to 0 05 mm g dw the degradation efficiency of bap decreased from 74 5 and 73 3 to 49 2 and 42 7 respectively a similar phenomenon was observed by lu et al 2020 ha or rs act as a potential contaminant and could become scavengers by competing with bap for ross thus inhibiting the bap removal 3 3 reaction mechanism of cao2 fe ii ca process 3 3 1 identification of primary reactive species the reactive oxygen species present in the cao2 fe ii ca system are shown in fig 4 there was a significant decrease in the degradation efficiency of bap with the addition of different scavenging agents fig 4a which suggested that ho o2 and 1o2 might be produced and responsible for the bap removal in the cao2 fe ii ca system according to the chemiluminescence and uv vis spectra ma et al 2007 proved the presence of ho and o2 on the surface of cao2 in contact with water and stated that o2 was originated from ho and h2o2 in cao2 suspension eq 13 while 1o2 can be produced from o2 eq 14 and or through a disproportionation reaction of h2o2 that catalyzed by ca ii in the cao2 system as described by eq 15 zhang wang and li 2015b 13 ho 2 h 2 o 2 h 2 o o 2 h 14 2 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 1 o 2 2 o h 15 2 h 2 o 2 c a 2 2 h 2 o α 1 o 2 1 α 3 o 2 the experiment results with different concentrations of scavenging agents are also presented in fig s5 the addition of excessive ba 50 mm could not completely inhibit the bap degradation indicating that other reactive oxygen radicals also played a role in the reaction in addition to ho similar inhibition phenomenon also happened when excessive nbt was added however the degree of inhibition was less severe in this case which seemed to imply a lesser role of o2 in bap degradation than ho l histidine has generally been employed to scavenge both the ho k 5 109 m 1 s 1 and 1o2 k 5 107 m 1 s 1 in many studies compared to adding excessive ba excessive l histidine 5 mm could not only suppress degradation of bap effectively but even to a lower level suggesting that the 1o2 facilitated the degradation of part bap compared with ho the contribution of 1o2 to bap degradation was relatively minor and ho was regarded as the core reactive radical in the fenton and fenton like processes to further highlight the role of ho the variations of free radicals along with time are shown in fig 4b initially only ho with a peak height ratio of 1 2 2 1 was observed the corresponding intensity was the highest at 1 min then decayed but remained at a certain level within 30 min this suggested that ho was the predominant reactive species during this period pan et al 2018 the o2 adduct with a weak peak height ratio of 1 1 1 1 was also observed after 10 min further indicating that the existence of o2 might be involved in the oxidative degradation reaction as o2 could be easily consumed by ho eq 16 it only played a limited role in the bap degradation which was in agreement with the scavenging experiment results 16 ho o 2 h 2 o o 2 k 8 9 10 9 with regard to 1o2 it was not detectable using esr which was probably due to the low concentration or its rapid transformation rate pan et al 2018 reported that water owns a high first order rate constant with 1o2 k water 2 5 105 s 1 which was over 300 times higher than bap with 1o2 k bap 1 0 106 m 1 s 1 therefore the occurrence of 1o2 had low opportunity to react with bap 3 3 2 reaction kinetics during different stages fig 5 shows the bap removal curve within 150 min in the cao2 fe ii ca reaction system in the literatures the degradation processes were generally segmented and kinetically fitted to accurately reflect the changes in the content of the substrate and the dominant reactions performed at different time periods ling et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 by doing this more detailed and clear description of the degradation process of pollutants in a fenton like reaction could be obtained therefore this universally accepted and feasible method was also employed in the present study it could be observed that the bap removal curve could be divided into three stages and each period followed a pseudo first order reaction kinetic model with a high fitting coefficient r2 0 90 fig s6 the first stage was the rapid destruction of bap i e the reaction occurs within 1 min the second stage was the fast degradation of bap from 1 to 30 min and the third stage corresponded to the slow degradation of bap i e the reaction after 30 min specifically stage 1 corresponded to the rapid degradation of bap within t1 1 min in this initial stage sufficient cao2 ensures the continuous running of fenton reaction where a large amount of ionic fe ii is consumed according to the rate equation text s8 of fe ii consumption reported previously wu et al 2014 it was calculated that approximately 90 of fe ii 2 85 mm was exhausted within 1 min which was in agreement with the results mentioned in section 3 2 1 despite of the generation of fe iii and complexed iron species the initial ionic fe ii was still the major motivity to the decomposition of h2o2 into ho the resulting ho during this period might contribute to approximately 29 4 of the bap degradation the apparent rate constant of which could reach 3 481 101 min 1 stage 2 was the fast degradation of bap between t1 and t2 30 min in this phase abundant ca make the complexed iron species predominant at circumneutral ph as the bap concentration is still at a high level of 1 52 mg kg dw 5 88 mm g dw which was about 27 times higher than the fe ii fe iii ca concentration in this event the generated ross have a higher chance of reacting with bap rather than complexed iron species and h2o2 again under similar conditions chen et al 2021 reported that the reaction apparent rate constant for the reaction between the fe ii fe iii ca complex and oh was 2 0 108 m 1 s 1 which was lower than those for the reaction between bap and oh k 8 99 109 m 1 s 1 and the reaction between h2o2 and oh k 9 33 108 m 1 s 1 in the process of uv peracetic acid for degradation of bap pan et al 2018 the overall bap removal in stage 2 was approximately 43 1 with the apparent rate constant of 2 51 10 2 min 1 stage 3 corresponded to the slow degradation of bap after t2 30 min the beginning of this stage was indicated by the depletion of cao2 and stable concentration of residual h2o2 in the system mang et al 2016 in this stage fe ii fe iii ca competed for oh because of the low concentration of bap and h2o2 the decomplexation of fe ii fe iii ca may result in the decreasing concentration of soluble fe iii and the oxidative degradation of ca li et al 2022 which would make the bap degradation even more difficult the overall bap degradation in stage 3 was only approximately 2 4 with the apparent rate constant of 0 11 10 2 min 1 on the whole the contribution to bap removal at different stages in the cao2 fe ii ca process showed the following sequence stage 2 43 1 stage 1 29 4 stage 3 2 4 3 4 degradation intermediates and pathways of bap 3 4 1 dft calculation on bap reactive sites fig 6 shows the dft based fukui indices of bap including electrophilic reactivity f and radical attack tendency f 0 as shown in fig 6a the top three carbon atom with the highest f and f 0 values were observed at c7 f f 0 0 075 0 0723 c29 f f 0 0 0627 0 0612 and c25 f f 0 0 0577 0 0552 respectively among them the c7 atom was the most vulnerable to the attack of electrophilic oh radical which was the main ros generated during the degradation of bap by the cao2 fe ii ca system this agreed with the charge distribution values of bap molecules obtained from natural population analysis npa table s4 the corresponding distribution of the highest occupied molecular orbits homo e homo 0 247 ev and lowest unoccupied molecular orbits lumo e lumo 0 039 ev of bap is shown in fig 6 b it depicts the wavelike manner of electrons in bap and shows the visualization of electron rich or electron deficient positions ji et al 2021 3 4 2 proposed bap degradation pathway fig 7 presents the main pathway of the proposed bap degradation in the cao2 fe ii ca system the intermediates identified by the gc ms analysis are presented in fig s7 and mass spectra are available in table s5 based on the position of carbon atoms with high f and f 0 values fig 6 and thermodynamic and physicochemical properties of the bap degradation process the highest δg value obtained from dft calculation indicates that the reaction for oh generation on initial bap step 1 δg 1 35 82 kcal mol might be the limiting step further oxidation caused the ring opening of im1 to form the intermediate 1 2 dihydroxy anthraquinone im2 δg 2 596 85 kcal mol next the ring opening reaction of im2 led to im3 formed step 3 δg 3 115 55 kcal mol which is an important intermediate widely present during the degradation of bap bendouz et al 2017 then im3 broke the bond to form phthalic acid im4 step 4 δg4 138 38 kcal mol due to the high energy of the reaction process the formation of im5 step 5 δg 5 211 05 kcal mol remained thermodynamically spontaneous even though it showed a big energy gap between im4 and im5 fig s8 the resulting benzoic formic anhydride was further oxidized and cleaved to smaller molecular weight compounds that is benzoylformic acid benzoic acid and benzyl alcohol step 6 δg 6 315 49 kcal mol lee et al 2001 and finally mineralized to co2 and h2o step 7 δg 9 102 15 kcal mol the real time abundances of bap degradation intermediates and their retention times rt are listed in tables s5 s6 among them im1 im3 im4 and im7 were the most abundant intermediates which accumulated within the first 1 min of the reaction and then decreased rapidly no evident signal intermediates were observed after 150 min of reaction the toxicity predictions of bap and its degradation intermediates by qsar analysis in the ecosar program revealed that the primary degradation products im1 and im2 showed similar toxicity to that of bap which indicates that the oxidation of a certain carbon site of bap could not reduce its toxicity fig s9 while im3 8 presented much lower toxicity and im6 8 was not harmful indicating that the opening of the benzene ring was conducive to detoxification in general the toxicity of bap degradation intermediates decreases with decreasing molecular weight fig s10 shows the toc variation in the reaction system along with the time after 96 h of reaction 72 11 of the toc was removed suggesting that the cao2 fe ii ca system had a high mineralization capacity for bap 3 5 feasibility verification for actual black odor sediment treatment 3 5 1 black odor elimination and pahs degradation changes in the physicochemical properties of the avs color ph and toc of the sediment after cao2 fe ii ca remediation are shown in figs 8 a and s8 the avs content declined from 1800 mg kg dw to approximately 30 mg kg dw the black odor sediment changed to earth yellow and the odor gradually vanished wang et al 2022 indicated that avs was a major contributor to black sediments and odors which were formed mainly under reducing conditions therefore the oxygen sources provided by cao2 dissolution were critical for the remediation of black odor sediments fig s11 shows that the ph variation fluctuated between 6 7 7 3 and the toc content decreased from 4 8 to approximately 2 6 0 2 in the remediated sediment indicating that cao2 fe ii ca treatment can effectively remove organic pollutants from the sediment and maintain an environmentally suitable ph for the growth of benthic organisms however the altered physico chemical properties of sediments may change the present forms of heavy metals eq 17 lu et al 2017 demonstrated that cao2 addition could affect the organic matter sulfide bound heavy metals and increase the fraction of exchangeable form of heavy metals which poses a vulnerability to the ecological safety of urban water in the construction of sponge cities consequently further studies should evaluate the potential risk of heavy metal release from overlying water bodies when cao2 fe ii ca treatment is applied 17 o 2 h 2 o 2 ms m 2 so 4 2 fig 8b shows the pahs variation in the cao2 fe ⅱ ca remediated sediment the residual pahs decreased from 9300 µg kg dw to approximately 2500 µg kg dw after 30 d of treatment lower than the erl 4022 µg kg dw in addition the degradation efficiency of various pahs reached nearly 80 regardless of the low phe medium fln and high molecular bap weight of pahs all these results demonstrated that the cao2 fe ii ca system exhibited a good treatment capacity for contaminated sediment 3 5 2 ecotoxicological effects fig 9 shows the results of the luminous bacteria based toxicity tests and c riparius survival tests of the cao2 fe ii ca remediated sediment as shown in fig 9a the luminescence intensity of vibrio fischeri in the cao2 fe ii ca treated sediment ranged from 81 2 to 88 0 before 15 d which was lower than that of the ck group p 0 01 this might be related to the generation of h2o2 from cao2 dissolution which was proven to negatively correlate with the relative luminescence intensity of v fischeri wang et al 2022 however the luminescence intensity of the test group was greater than 80 which indicated slight toxicity wang et al 2022 this effect was further reduced with increasing treatment time after 15 d indicating that the ecotoxicity of the amended sediment gradually decreased and finally created a non toxic and friendly environment for the luminescent bacteria fig 9b shows the results of the bioassay performed with c riparius a slight decrease in the survival rate of c riparius was found upon exposure to the cao2 fe ii ca treatment sediments which was approximately 5 lower than that in the ck group p 0 01 subsequently the survival rate of c riparius improved gradually increasing to 87 5 by 30 d of remediation these results are in agreement with the results of luminous bacteria based toxicity tests therefore the cao2 fe ii ca system was not only effective in black odor elimination and removal of pahs from sediments but also showed negligible biotoxicity to benthic organisms thus promoting the gradual recovery of sediment ecology 4 conclusion in this study the effects of cao2 fe ii ca treatment on bap degradation under circumneutral conditions were investigated the mechanism kinetic model and pathways of bap degradation in this process were revealed and the remediation feasibility for actual pah contaminated black odor sediment was evaluated the results showed that the mass transfer rate was limited in the non homogeneous sediment water mixture and h2o2 yield from dissolved cao2 was about 1 4 times lower than in the homogeneous aqueous solutions nevertheless the cao2 fe ii ca system effectively removed nearly 80 of bap at circumneutral ph under optimal conditions in this process ho o2 and 1o2 were generated among which ho was the dominant species during bap degradation and three stages of kinetic modeling revealed the bap degradation process and its mechanism the main pathway for bap degradation was proposed and the toxicity of bap degradation intermediates and products was found to decrease with decreasing molecular weight regarding actual black odor sediment cao2 fe ii ca treatment was demonstrated to eliminate the black odor and effectively remove of pahs from the sediment while exerting negligible ecotoxicity on benthic organisms overall this study provides reference and guidance for using cao2 based fenton like systems in treating practical pah contaminated black odor river sediments further studies are required to analyze the potential changes in heavy metal forms and to evaluate the potential heavy metal release risk in overlying water bodies when cao2 fe ii ca treatment is applied
