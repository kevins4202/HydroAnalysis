7695,study region upper ewaso ng iro catchment is located in eastern africa a water scarce region study focus streamflow is in decline in the catchment despite the pattern of increasing amounts of rainfall in the east african region this study explored historical human water interplays to understand the coevolution of hydrological systems and societal development and to identify the dominant features contributing to water deficits and water related conflicts in the lowland zone of the catchment a socio hydrological conceptual framework was used to mimic and explain the two way coupling between human and hydrological systems new hydrological insights for the region the results show that the dominant features that have likely contributed to changes in lowland streamflow and water related conflicts include population growth land use cover changes and economic dynamics the dry season flows have been extremely reduced with a 100 reduction observed in the month of february especially between 2010 and 2020 while the wet season flows have increased by about 10 and 15 in the upland and midland zones respectively the decreasing trends in the streamflow against increasing amounts of rainfall emphasize the direct role humans have on catchment water availability east africa being a water scarce region there is a need to shift the focus from the sustainable natural flows perspective to the amount of water retained during wet seasons perspective improving land conservation activities to increase water infiltration during wet seasons and the need to bring all stakeholders together for collective understanding graphical abstract ga1 keywords socio hydrological modeling social development water scarcity upland lowland gradient human water interactions 1 introduction water scarcity can be attributed to natural processes such as climate changes and proliferated by the evolving human water interactions globally water resources availability is confronted with increasing complexities due to the evolving nature of demographic economic and technological trends availability of distributed resources and uncertainties brought about by climate change cosgrove and loucks 2015 van emmerik et al 2014 evers et al 2017 the intensity of these challenges is accelerated by evolving human adaptation to the changing environment cosgrove and loucks 2015 for many parts of tropical regions especially those that experience orographic precipitation the human water systems are majorly shaped by the upland lowland continuum in which hydrological dynamics experienced in lowland areas are majorly influenced by the upland anthropogenic behavior brown and king 2006 mukhwana 2016 mwendwa et al 2019 van oel et al 2008 this leads to emergents such as water scarcity and water related conflicts between upland and lowland communities berhanu et al 2016 for water scarce regions such as east africa elmi mohamed 2013 kebede and taye 2021 understanding the evolving human water interactions is an important aspect of a sustainable approach to water resources management evers et al 2017 for a long time the hydrology literature has been dominated by conventional hydrological modeling that aimed at providing insights into the catchment hydrological issues conventional models are used in research for various purposes including water balance estimations forecasting hydrological conditions and informing policies and strategies for short and long term water management however such conventional models do not directly account for the feedback between hydrological and human sub systems limiting insights into the roles of humans and social development in hydrological processes garcia et al 2016 additionally conventional models differ in their model structures complexities input data requirements the number of parameters involved etc hence their application is limited to the specific research being carried out for instance kumar singh and marcy 2017 found that different conventional hydrological models differ significantly in water balance estimations under different climate change scenarios wagener et al 2010 and van noordwijk 2019 recommended a new paradigm for hydrological studies by adopting a concept of a full hydrological perspective and recognizing humans as an integral part of the overall hydrologic system generally there is a need for integrated approaches that explicitly incorporate processes that represent the coexistence between people and water systems ceola et al 2014 van emmerik et al 2014 gleick and palaniappan 2010 ostrom 2009 to manage water resources and minimize water related conflicts the integrated water resources management approach iwrm is widely practiced globally jain and singh 2003 nepal et al 2014 iwrm involves strategic manipulation of the interactions between natural processes socio economic activities and institutional arrangements relevant to a river basin jain and singh 2003 savenije and van der zaag 2008 however for iwrm to realize its potential the evolution of socio hydrological dynamics needs to be well understood loucks and van beek 2017 massuel et al 2018 nepal et al 2014 pandey et al 2020 yu et al 2020 additionally iwrm does not necessarily account for the dynamics of relevant interactions and feedback between water and people sivapalan et al 2012 therefore advanced approaches such as socio hydrological modeling that study the effects of dynamic interactions and feedback between water and people are highly recommended di baldassarre et al 2019 sivapalan et al 2012 socio hydrological modeling provides an approach that helps to explain or gain insight into the co evolutionary dynamics of the human water coupled system van emmerik et al 2014 used the socio hydrological framework to explain the dominant features of a river basin such as reservoir capacity population size irrigation area environmental flows etc kandasamy et al 2014 applied a socio hydrological model to explain interactions and feedback between agricultural development and environmental health di baldassarre et al 2013 used a socio hydrological modeling approach to conceptualize the interplays of the complex web of interactions and feedback mechanisms between hydrological and social processes the socio hydrological modeling enables exploring the human water interplays thereby increasing an understanding of how the overall socio hydrological system works in this study we used a case of the upper ewaso ng iro catchment located in kenya a country in the east africa region whose over 80 of its land is classified as arid and semi arid areas ouma et al 2018 the catchment is a fragile tropical watershed located on the leeward side of mt kenya forest which functions as an important water tower for the east african region wamucii et al 2021 the highland lowland continuum has topographic and atmospheric circulation conditions that produce steep climatic and ecological gradients resulting in humid and semiarid conditions that change within a relatively short distance mccord et al 2015 ngigi et al 2007 fundamentally the catchment population has close economic ties with natural resources and climate dependent sectors such as agricultural production in the upland zones and pastoralism and tourism activities in the lowland zones the upland lowland water related conflicts have increased over the years in the upper ewaso ng iro river basin in kenya the period 2000 2020 has seen frequent and even fatal conflicts between lowland and upland communities hirji 2000 kiteme 2020 mutiga et al 2010 based on conventional hydrological modeling past studies in the catchment revealed decreasing streamflow patterns during dry seasons despite the pattern of increasing rainfall amounts in the east african region kimwatu et al 2021 mutiga et al 2011 notter 2003 notter et al 2007 omwoyo et al 2017 however conventional hydrological studies do not capture coupled human water system feedbacks which is seen as a gap in strategically informing water resources governance and management garcia et al 2016 sivapalan et al 2012 our preliminary analysis revealed a decreasing pattern of annual streamflow at a selected point in the study area against an increasing annual rainfall pattern fig 1 a fig 1 b and c show the conceptual water balance and dry season flow in an upland lowland gradient the decreasing streamflow despite the patterns of increasing amounts of rainfall is an important finding that underlines the need for further research especially on human water interactions as the changes in streamflow seem to be beyond the changes in the natural systems according to previous research in the study area the changes in the dry season streamflow can be attributed to a combination of low rainfall rapidly growing human population agricultural intensification increasing water abstractions and degradation of natural resource base among other factors gichuki 2006 kiteme 2020 van der laan et al 2021 liniger et al 2005 liniger and gichuki 1994 mutiga et al 2010 2011 ngigi et al 2008 ongaji 2021 wiesmann et al 2000 however the factors that are believed to contribute to complex water related challenges are only autonomously reported with no clear human water interactions and feedback it is therefore necessary to develop an integrated framework that explores the coevolution of human water dynamics this paper aims to understand the causes and effects of changes in water availability in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment by assessing relevant historical human water interplays and their effects this is achieved through constructing a conceptual socio hydrological framework that helps in creating an understanding of what has been happening in the past between the 1980 s and 2020 s we adopt a stylized approach to study the mechanisms behind the socio hydrological dynamics in the selected study site this helped in creating an understanding of how the system works particularly in linking the dynamics in the upland zone to the conditions observed in the lowland zone of the upper ewaso ng iro catchment the socio hydrological framework contains five components that represent co evolution hydrology land use dynamics population dynamics catchment economics and community sensitivity we adopted a parameterization procedure guided by a literature review preliminary analyses and expert judgment validation approach of key historical processes the specific question to be answered is what are the key socio hydrological dynamics that can be linked to the decreasing streamflow despite increasing trends of amounts of rainfall in the upper ewaso ng iro basin a study site that covers parts of the upland midland and lowland zones of the larger catchment was selected and used to explore the historical socio hydrological dynamics along an upland lowland gradient relevant to a large part of the ewaso ng iro catchment to ensure a focus on the dynamic human water interactions we used long term mean values for the physical water balance elements such as precipitation potential evapotranspiration and runoff 2 methodology sivapalan and blöschl 2015 opined that socio hydrological modelling can take three major lines of inquiry a historical b comparative or c process socio hydrology in this study we applied a chronosequence approach deluca et al 2002 grünzweig et al 2004 kneitel 2010 sivapalan and blöschl 2015 in the conceptualization and parameterization of the socio hydrological model this involved using different sub basins within the selected study site to study the coevolutionary dynamics of humans and water this was important as different sub basins may pose unique characteristics such as land use land cover types presence of industries population culture etc which may influence water patterns in space and time this helped in understanding the historical perspectives and patterns to understand how humans have coevolved with hydrological dynamics in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment a conceptual socio hydrological framework attempts to chronologically trace the changes in water availability as a result of societal developments along the upland lowland gradient parameterization and validation of socio hydrological model components were achieved through a detailed literature review preliminary analyses and carrying out community discussions and key informant interviews 2 1 study area the upper ewaso ng iro catchment is located on the north west of the mt kenya forested water tower and covers an area of 15 285 km2 stretching from the upland along the fringes of two forested water towers to an outlet point known as archer s post fig 2a the larger part of the catchment is covered by woody grassland areas fig 2b the aberdares water tower and mt kenya water tower maintain high precipitation on average 1200 mm yr 1 and 1400 mm yr 1 respectively wamucii et al 2021 hence discharging runoff to drier lowland areas mt kenya contributes a major share to the streamflow in the basin notter 2003 we divided the catchment into upland midland and lowland parts based on aridity indices the aridity index was calculated as a ratio of long term rainfall and evapotranspiration p pet fig 3 a the rainfall p was sourced from the chirps database funk et al 2015 and evapotranspiration pet was sourced from the cru database ekström et al 2007 harris et al 2020 the upland zone is a humid area with an aridity index above 0 65 the midland zone stretches from humid to semi arid areas i e aridity indexes ranging from 0 65 to 0 5 the lowland zone includes semi arid to arid areas i e aridity index below 0 5 the study area fig 3 b was selected to evaluate in detail the socio hydrological dynamics and especially to study the influence of the societal development in the upland zone on the changes observed in the lowland zone the mean annual rainfall ranges from 1500 mm in the mt kenya water tower to 350 mm in the arid lowlands around archer s post mungai et al 2004 high population densities are concentrated in the upland areas small scale and large scale agriculture is mainly practiced in the upland and midland zones studies have reported that the growing demand for water in the upland areas results in water shortages in the lowland areas aarts 2012 notter 2003 principally there are three major approaches in this study a developing a descriptive conceptual model of how upland communities influence the lowland streamflow based on literature review b validation of conceptual model components processes and simulations through community and stakeholder discussions including transect walks within the study site and c developing a refined conceptual socio hydrological model based on information gathered from the publications and through fieldwork activities 2 2 the descriptive conceptual socio hydrological model guided by the steps put forward in sivapalan and blöschl 2015 we first developed a descriptive conceptual model of how upland communities influence the lowland streamflow fig 4 shows the generic conceptual causal loop diagram for the upper ewaso ng iro catchment one of the major societal developments is the growing population which is a major driver of hydrological changes in the upper ewaso ng iro river basin mutiga et al 2011 as the population grows the demand for space and available opportunities such as businesses and horticulture among others increase this leads to the transformation of landforms including the expansion of cropland areas the expansion of the cropland areas leads to decreases in other land covers such as tree cover bushland grassland areas etc these land transformations affect the water balance in different ways for instance the expansion of cropland increases the dry season irrigation water demand degradation of important land covers such as forests bushland and grasslands also affects water retention in the catchment during rainy seasons leading to increases in runoff during wet seasons and a reduction of potential flows during dry seasons the growing population also means an increasing water demand for household water consumption the catchment economics is assumed to increase with the expansion of cropland areas but potential income per capita would decrease with the growing population the changes in hydrological conditions especially during the dry season increase the community sensitivity hence the level of environmental degradation awareness however the higher profits reduce the willingness to engage in conservation activities despite the declining streamflow based on location i e upland or in the lowland areas the community members react differently e g increasing cropland areas to maximize potential returns increasing the rate of river abstractions investing in water storage boreholes immigrating in search of water etc these actions increase the level of community water related conflicts especially between upland and lowland communities 2 3 parameterization and validation of the conceptual model beyond the conceptual causal loop diagram validation of conceptual model components processes and simulations was carried out through community and stakeholder discussions including transect walks within the study site extensive literature reviews and pre analyses were also integrated into this step to ensure that the parameters included in the model components are representative of the local context the pre analysis was key in generating preliminary outputs that served as inputs for the model elements for instance pre analyses of land use cover changes were carried out to establish the actual rate of changes that were reflected in the land use component an expert judgment validation approach was adopted through community and stakeholder discussions to ensure that the model results coincide with observed historical perspectives and patterns in the study site this helped further refine the model component parameters seven focus group discussions were held with communities to draw the major historical patterns within the study site key informant interviews were conducted with key stakeholders in the upper ewaso ng iro river basin the participatory mapping of historical events was done targeting the period between the 1980 s and the 2020 s the year 1980 was selected as the base year as this is the period with the most reliable climatic data for the study site these include chirps rainfall data funk et al 2015 with a temporal coverage beginning in 1981 and potential evapotranspiration pet from climate research unit cru database with temporal coverage beginning in 1981 ekström et al 2007 harris et al 2020 the observed hydrological data are also available and reliable beginning 1980 s as shown by time series data on cetrad s website cetrad 2021 we developed a refined socio hydrological model based on information gathered from publications and fieldwork involving community stakeholder discussions and transect walks fig 5 shows the refined socio hydrology model used in this study the equations used in the five model components are summarized below more details on the parameterization of the model components and the motivation for the selected parameters are provided in annex a 2 4 the catchment hydrology component within the selected study site the mt kenya water tower contributes about 57 of the available water resources another 42 of water resources come from the upland 21 and midland 21 zones the lowland zone contributes about 1 of available water resources table a 2 this underlines the importance of the mt kenya water tower in generating streamflow for the drier lowland areas especially since the study area is on the leeward side of the mt kenya water tower we assume that the total streamflow for the study area consists of the sum of the net contributions of the different zones forest upland midland and lowland zones 1a q out q inflow q upland q midland q lowland where q out is the streamflow at the selected outlet point q inflow is the inflow from the forested water tower q upland is the net inflow from the upland zone q midland is the net flow from the midland zone and q lowland is the net flow from the lowland zone given the growing demand for water in the study site leading to excessive water abstractions see more details in annex a the hydrology component for each zone was therefore estimated as follows forested water tower i e net flows from mt kenya water tower 1b q inflow q mtk q wt abs upland zone 1c q upland q inflow q r up q up t abs midland zone 1d q midland q upland q r mid q mid t abs lowland zone 1e q lowland q midland q r lw q lw t abs total water abstractions were estimated using the following equation 1 f q t abs q pw q dr where q mtk represents runoff estimations from mt kenya water tower q wt abs is the estimated total water abstractions within the forested water tower q upland is the net inflow from the upland zone q inflow is the inflow from the water tower to the upland zone q r up is the upland internal runoff generation q up t abs is the estimated total water abstractions in the upland zone q midland is the net inflow from the midland zone q upland is the inflow from the upland zone q r mid is the midland internal runoff generation and q mid t abs is the estimated total water abstractions in the midland zone q lowland is the net inflow from the lowland zone q midland is the inflow from the midland zone q r lw is the lowland internal runoff generation q lw t abs is the estimated total water abstractions in the lowland zone q t abs is the total abstractions in each zone as a sum of the permanent water intake projects q pw and the estimated direct pumping from the river network q dr annex a 2 5 the land use dynamics component the analysis of land use cover analysis was used to construct a parameter that estimates the streamflow sustainability factor as a result of changes in land use dynamics the key assumption is that increase in cropland will reduce important land covers such as tree cover grassland and bushland the changes in land use cover affect the catchment water balance in different ways for instance a decline in natural vegetation cover results in increased surface runoff during the wet season and a decline in base flow during the dry season ahiablame et al 2019 chauhan et al 2020 guzha et al 2018 hurni et al 2005 mungai et al 2004 nugroho et al 2013 based on the results presented by guzha et al 2018 for tropical catchments in east africa we deduce that on average a one percent decrease in forest cover causes an increase in peak flow by 0 63 and a decrease in base flow by 0 39 within the study area aeschbacher et al 2005 opined that if the savannah zone and upland zone were to be completely converted into agricultural lands the peak flows would increase by 16 thus changes in land use cover have a direct impact on the water balance of a watershed the equation for the streamflow sustainability factor was therefore formulated as a fraction of the area under tree cover bushland and grassland to the area under cropland the equation for water resources sustainability factor 2a rfs f t a b a g a c a where rfs f is the streamflow sustainability factor t a is the area under tree cover b a is the area under bushland g a is the area under grassland and c a is the area under cropland the actual annual rates of change for all land use classes are provided in fig a4 the streamflow sustainability factor was integrated into the model such that it reduces potential streamflows during the dry season and increased wet flows during the wet season as described below dry season 2b q c p r c α rfs f wet season 2c q c p r c α rfs f where q c is the estimated runoff generated in each of the zones p is the precipitation r c is the runoff coefficient α is a constant value set to 0 1 as the maximum value for the streamflow sustainability factor rfs f is the streamflow sustainability factor 2 6 population dynamics component population growth in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment has been reported to be a key factor in increasing water demands ngigi et al 2008 our pre analysis show that the population grew from 193 573 persons in 2000 to approximately 334 405 persons in 2020 the population in the midland zone almost doubled 98 between 2000 and 2020 fig a 5 the population datasets for the study period were sourced from stevens and worldpop et al 2015 2020 and verified with data from the kenya national bureau of statistics knbs data portal knbs 2019 the estimated annual population numbers were used to estimate household water demand the human population numbers also affect catchment economics in the model 3a p a p p rt where p a is the estimated annual population number p rt is the annual population growth rate and p is the base population extracted from the population datasets the human population growth has been identified to exert pressure on land hence a direct link to agricultural land expansion and related water demands elmhagen et al 2015 okello et al 2015 putri et al 2019 with this understanding we proposed the population pressure factor a parameter that drives several elements of the model such as the cropland expansion along the river line river zone irrigated area and estimated daily water abstractions from the rivers 3b p fa p a a ag β where p fa is the population pressure factor on agricultural land p a is population numbers per annum a ag is the estimated annual cropland area along the river line within 800 m in the upland and midland areas β is a constant value set at 0 1 2 7 catchment economics component the catchment economics in the upland midland zones were calculated based on the dominant crops both traditional and commercial crops among small scale farmers while economics in the lowland areas were based on livestock production traditional crops 4a gp t m p m yd a m p p p yd a p short term commercial crops 4b gp c f p f yd a f s p s yd a s total gross profits 4c tgp gp t gp c where tgp is the total gross profits in the upland and midland gp t is the gross profits for traditional crops gp c is gross profits for commercial crops m p is the market price per kg of maize m yd is the maize yield per acre a m is the area in acres under maize production p p is the market price per kg of potato p yd is the potato yield per acre a p is the area in acres under potato production f p is the market price per kg of french beans f yd is the french beans yield per acre a f is the area in acres under french beans production s p is the market price per kg of snow peas s yd is the snow peas yield per acre a s is the area in acres under snow peas production the information on crop yields and market prices was sourced from the stakeholders in the study area in the lowland zone the livestock income was estimated as follows assuming an annual offtake rate of 30 for the livestock total gross profits in the lowland 4d t gp dwn 0 3 sg n sg mp 0 3 ct n ct mp annual economic gain per household 4e tg hh tgp p a where t gp dwn is the total gross profits in the lowland sg n is the total number of sheep and goats kept by households per year sg mp is the market price per sheep goat ct n is the total number of cattle kept by households per year and ct mp is the market price per animal tg hh is the annual economic gain per household p a is the estimated annual population number 2 8 community sensitivity component the community sensitivity variable was formulated to determine the degree and direction of the overall impetus for action the key equations for community sensitivity are explained below 5a ed a 1 wa f 1 p f where ed a is the level of environmental degradation awareness wa f is the dry season water availability factor and p f is the profitability factor the dry season water availability factor the dry season water availability factor was calculated as average conditions for january and february i e the driest months in the study area 5b wa f aw jan ta jan aw jan aw feb ta feb aw feb 2 where wa f is the dry season water availability factor available water is represented as aw jan and aw feb total water abstracted in the two months is represented as ta jan and ta feb as wa f reduces i e approaching 0 then the level of environmental degradation awareness increases condition affects eq 5a condition i the level of degradation awareness will however be diffused by the profitability factor in the socio hydrological system profitability factor 5c p f tg hh pi a where p f is the profitability factor tg hh is the annual economic gain per household i e earnings from crops and livestock production pi a is the fixed preferred ideal household annual income set at kshs 355 000 based on field assessments p f ranges from 0 low profitability to 1 high profitability if p f is high then environmental degradation awareness level reduces and farmers ignore hydrological conditions and invest more to exploit the immediate profits made available by the ready markets in the catchment condition affects eq 5a condition ii therefore if p f is high and short term commercial profits are higher than profits from traditional crops then farmers will increase the area under commercial crops and reduce the area under traditional crops condition affects equation 4 condition iii investing more in short term commercial crops increases the rate of water abstractions in the socio hydrological system condition affects eqs 1b 1d condition iv the small scale farmers also expand the area under cropland by clearing important land covers such as tree cover bushland grassland etc condition affects equations 2 condition v water related conflicts manifest as communities in the upland midland and lowland evolve and adapt to the changing ecosystems the emergence of conflicts was formulated as follows 5d c l aw jan d jtd aw feb d ftd 2 wa f where c l is the level of conflict aw jan is the water availability in january aw feb is the water availability in february d jtd is the estimated demand in january d ftd is the estimated demand in february and wa f is the dry season water availability factor 3 results the overall results show that land use dynamics population dynamics and catchment economic dynamics are key historical dynamics that may have contributed to the reduction in the lowland streamflow socio hydrological model simulations show a gradual increase in wet season flows and a continuous decrease in dry season flows fig 6 a c e and 6 b d f respectively a noticeable drop in the dry season net flows was simulated for the midland and lowland zones especially for the month of february where no flows are observed beginning in 1998 fig 6 d and 6 f validation of the socio hydrological simulations involved an expert judgment validation approach through community and stakeholder discussions to determine whether the model simulations and trends align with the observed historical patterns in the study site the community and stakeholders agreed with most of the socio hydrological results presented in this study a stronger agreement was observed with the results on the streamflow patterns i e decreasing dry season flows increasing wet season flows especially since the model predicted zero dry season flows for the month of february beginning in 1998 99 agreements were also observed on the results of increasing water related conflicts increasing river water abstractions especially in the midland zone and population dynamics the stakeholders were observed to have less opinion on the link between the level of awareness of environmental degradation and profitability levels as presented in this study the common agreement was that community members have maximum awareness of hydrological extremities but individual interests in profitability only override and do not reduce diffuse the level of awareness the expert judgment validation approach was therefore considered important in verifying the key results of this study with the lack of observed streamflow data at the selected outlet point of this study we further analyzed available streamflow data at points b and c in fig 2 and compared with the streamflow trends in our simulation to the existing publications fig b 1 this was mainly used as a check of the general streamflow patterns and should not be viewed as a direct validation of the streamflow results the simulated trends of increasing wet season flow and decreasing dry season flows can be confirmed by the observed streamflow data as illustrated in fig b 1 a b the observed daily river staff gauge readings also confirm a declining pattern between july 2019 and february 2022 fig b 1 c observed data by ngigi et al 2008 shows a declining pattern of annual streamflow data of up to 30 between 1960 and 2002 at the main outlet of the upper ewaso ng iro i e at archer s post outlet point a in fig 2 and fig b 1 d despite low rainfall in the month of february table a 2 this study reveals increasing water abstraction trends during the dry seasons fig 7 shows simulated net streamflow and estimated water abstractions in the month of february these trends are especially evident in the midland zones where the estimated total water demand grew enormously leading to zero streamflow to the lowland zones beginning in 1998 to understand the key socio hydrological dynamics contributing to the streamflow changes in the dry season a correlational analysis was performed based on selected variables against net flows in the dry seasons table c 1 the month of february was selected to represent dry season conditions there is a high negative correlation between land use dynamics particularly increasing cropland area and the reduced flows in the month of february in both the upland and midland zones however the changes in the area under traditional crops revealed a weak positive correlation with the reduced dry season flows in the upland zone population dynamics reveal a stronger negative correlation especially in the upland zone economics is a major factor both in the upland and midland zones especially changes in the profits earned from selling commercial crops there is also a strong negative correlation between the level of community conflicts and the dry season flows a clear negative correlation was observed between the water abstractions and the dry season flows the major land use changes include an increase in agricultural land forest cover bushland areas bareland and built up areas and a decreasing pattern in grassland areas table a 2 the land use dynamics have a direct impact on the water resources sustainability factor fig 8 a the land use changes are attributed to the growing human population fig 8 b and favorable catchment economics especially in the period between 1980 and 2000 fig 8 c these dynamics affect the catchment hydrology and it was observed that beginning in 1998 the dry season water availability dropped to zero in february in the midland zone hence no streamflow to the lowland zones fig 8 d the decreasing dry season flows increased the conflicts to maximum levels in the study site within the simulation period the water related conflicts between the lowland communities and midland communities are observed to remain relatively high the midland upland water related conflicts increased from approximately 20 in the 1980 s to maximum levels by the year 2001 fig 8 e the level of awareness of environmental degradation was observed to reduce with increasing profitability levels as reflected in fig 8 f this trend however changes beginning in 2001 when there is a decline in both the dry season water availability and profitability a slight increase in the level of environmental degradation awareness is simulated towards 2020 this indicates the importance of community sensitivity to hydrological and economic dynamics with the finding that humans influence water availability in the study site further analysis was carried out to assess the effects of the human population on dry season water availability the human population was varied whereby the population growth rate was assumed to be zero hence constant human population during the simulation period a constant human growth rate revealed no expansion of cropland in the river zone a zone where excessive river water abstractions take place this means with a constant human population there would be no sharp increase in river water abstractions as is the case with an actual human population growth rate therefore the human population pressure on the social hydrological system can explain the water deficits experienced during the dry season despite the increasing rainfall pattern assuming no human population growth in the study site considerable volumes of water would be available during all dry season months figs 9 and 10 on the contrary with an actual human population growth rate a clear decreasing pattern of water availability is observed across the decades with february recording zero volumes of water between 2000 and 2020 the difference between the naturalized flow and the simulated monthly flow with zero population growth rate reveals the impact humans have on water availability the results of this study illustrate that on average about 5 3 million cubic meters are lost during each dry month when the population growth rate is held constant this translates to dry season water loss of about 47 5 cubic meters per capita per month fig 10 shows that with increasing human population numbers there is a clear trend in the increase in the amount of water taken out during the dry months with january and february recording maximum reductions 100 in the 2010 2020 decade this emphasizes the major role humans play in the hydrological cycle of a catchment and the dry season water availability may only become more extreme under increasing human population pressure 4 discussion 4 1 the dynamics linked to the decreasing streamflow this study aimed to assess the historical human water interplays to understand the coevolution of hydrological systems and societal development and their impacts on water availability in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment despite the pattern of increasing amounts of rainfall within the simulation period both the observed and simulated streamflow reveal a decreasing pattern in the upland lowland gradient the land use dynamics population dynamics and catchment economic dynamics were identified as key historical dynamics that may have contributed to the reduction in the lowland streamflow the noticeable social development pressure is the increasing water abstractions in response to the growing water demand for both bulging populations and agricultural expansion these results align with other studies that have reported that high population growth combined with resultant changes in land use cover changes have a more significant driving force in affecting water availability than climate changes okello et al 2015 the decreasing trends in the streamflow against an increasing rainfall pattern is an important finding that emphasizes the need to account for societal development aspects in all hydrological studies the results of this study align with recommendations that the physical processes require integration with social dynamics for a comprehensive understanding of hydrological dynamics di baldassarre et al 2014 defries and eshleman 2004 van loon 2015 sivapalan et al 2012 the strength of this study is its prospective design of a socio hydrological conceptual model that adopts a parameterization based on literature reviews and preliminary analyses the preliminary analyses allowed coming up with specific rates to be included in the equations e g rate of annual population growth rate rate of land use changes etc an expert judgment validation approach was accomplished through community and stakeholder discussions to determine whether the model simulations and trends align with the observed historical patterns in the study site with a lack of real system data this type of validation that involves expert judgment is paramount eker et al 2018 schwanitz 2013 we are therefore confident that the conceptualization and the observed results in this study are representative of system behavior 4 2 the model results versus historical perspectives the socio hydrological model in this study is able to simulate human water dynamics that reflect the historical experiences within the study site an obvious historical observation is on the streamflow which was simulated to drop to minimum levels beginning in 1998 based on community discussions and previous publications aeschbacher et al 2005 ngigi et al 2007 orendo 2000 the trend of declining streamflow within the study period dropped to minimum levels around 1998 to the 2000 s zero streamflow have been reported in the month of february in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment de leeuw et al 2012 mutiga et al 2010 the rise of competition for scarce water resources and water related conflicts and the need for water resources users associations wruas manifested towards the end of the 1990 s the mimicking of near reality shows the strength of the socio hydrological model which can be used as a precursory tool to increase an understanding of the socio hydrological system in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment within the simulation period our results show that the wet season flows increased by 10 4 in the upland and 14 8 in the midland zones after which equilibrium is attained aeschbacher et al 2005 opined that if the savannah i e midland zone and upland zone were to be completely converted into agricultural lands the wet season flows would increase by a maximum of 16 the dry season flows are simulated to drop to zero levels especially in the month of february the results further reveal that the decreasing dry season flows increase the likelihood of conflicts to maximum levels this explains the high level of water related conflicts observed during dry seasons in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment gichuki 2006 liniger et al 2005 mutiga et al 2010 the conflicts are mainly reported between agriculturalists pastoralists and urban dwellers kiteme 2020 mutiga et al 2010 moreover catchment economics play a key role in reducing the willingness of the communities to engage regardless of the levels of environmental degradation community discussions revealed that as long as there are no negative impacts on economic gains humans are likely to continue with their normal behavior for instance excessive river water abstractions despite the reduced dry season flows however the level of awareness of environmental degradation changes considerably when catchment economics are negatively impacted preferences for a convenient life for instance focus on good economic returns have been identified as key limiting factors in promoting pro environmental behaviors iizuka 2000 wang et al 2020 contrary to the previous findings that portable pumps abstracted less water due to their perceived small capacity notter 2003 this study reveals that portable pumps abstract substantively more water than previously understood this is mainly because of the excessive use and the entropic nature of the usage of these pumps especially with the observation that more water is drawn from the rivers than the actual crop water requirements the steep climatic gradients that change within relatively short distances in the study area influence the water balance in the selected study area this is a result of increasing atmospheric demand and decreasing rainfall as you move to lowland areas wamucii et al 2021 this means the growth in the human population and expansion of agricultural land easily stretch into fragile and marginal areas in the middle zone areas skewing the water demands and availability for instance agricultural lands in the midland zone require more irrigation water per unit area compared to agricultural lands in the humid upland zone we argue that the socio hydrological dynamics would have been different for catchments where there are no steep climatic gradients or where agroecological zones are located far apart 4 3 the validation of the socio hydrological model a conceptual socio hydrological framework can help create an understanding of the hydrological processes in the past and guide in exploring future scenarios however one of the challenges in socio hydrological modeling is the validation of the model components srinivasan et al 2017 troy et al 2015a there is no formal calibration validation protocol for socio hydrological modeling blair and buytaert 2016 this challenge however can be bridged by the use of empirical studies to justify or derive model equations and parameters troy et al 2015b other studies have used socio centric approaches e g analyzing newspaper contents to verify and validate model variables roobavannan et al 2018 in this study we carried out a detailed literature review on relevant past publications on the upper ewaso ng iro catchment five model components that explain the co evolution were selected based on the literature review preliminary analyses e g land use cover changes streamflow patterns population growth rates etc were carried out to guide the parameterization of the model components the model simulation results and assumptions were subjected to community discussions and key informants stakeholders in the selected study site this in a way validates the model components and ensures a representation of variables of interest as suggested by melsen et al 2018 the socio hydrological framework adopted in this study was able to mimic that the water related crisis began around 1998 99 in the study area this concurs with the community s historical perspectives and documented evidence of frequent water related conflicts beginning 2000s hirji 2000 kiteme 2020 additionally the water resources users associations wruas started as local group associations meant to deal with the rising competition of scarce water resources and water related conflicts beginning in 1998 99 based on wrua records before they were formally accepted as part of government policies by the kenya water act of 2002 4 4 study limitations that said uncertainties may exist that can skew the results and their implications for instance the socio hydrological model focussed on the small scale farmers who are the majority in the study area hence not accounting for the role of large scale farming based on available historical data the study concentrated on surface water while leaving out the groundwater component for instance commercial farms have boreholes and there are also wells in some of the households in the study area the hydrological impacts of groundwater extraction use were not accounted for in the coupling of human and water systems which could have inclined the study results the conceptualized model used long term rainfall estimations hence static monthly rainfalls which resulted in the smooth lines actual daily rainfall patterns would have resulted in waves common in hydrographs the study also assumed that water abstracted from the river network is used within the selected study site and did not account for water siphoned out of the catchment if any data on water transfers were not available and further studies including detailed abstraction surveys are needed to establish water taken out if any away from the selected study site in the analysis of land use cover changes independent satellite images from the different platforms of landsat and sentinel 2 were used these two platforms have different resolutions of 30 m and 10 m respectively better accuracy in land use cover detections is however achieved in sentinel 2 compared to landsat platforms lima et al 2019 song et al 2021 the water related conflicts were formulated based on water availability in the study area and did not account for other factors that can ignite community conflicts such as land available for grazing politics cultural differences etc there is pressure from both the need for agricultural land and the increasing protected area under fencing by the increasing number of conservancy organizations in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment this reduces access to key grazing areas in the midland and lowland areas a unique type of conflict commonly referred to as grazing invasion pellis et al 2018 has been reported where the pastoralist communities forcefully enter into the conservancies during the dry season in search of pasture and water the impact of wildlife conservancies and commercial ranches in the upper ewaso ng iro in reducing grazing land areas and their contribution to community conflicts have already been documented mureithi et al 2016 pellis et al 2018 yurco 2017 the validation with communities although an innovative procedure for data scarce regions relies heavily on the ability of humans to remember their history which can skew certain components and parameters in the model despite the above uncertainties the results in this study generally reveal important insights that can shape the focus of sustainable water resources management especially for water scarce regions such as east africa river basin organizations rbos such as wruas in the case study area may play a key role in supporting conservation efforts but face challenges in ensuring sustainable streamflow this is attributed to the complex coevolution of human and water systems out pacing the ability of rbos to manage water resources for instance in the case study area water related conflicts have been reported to increase every year despite the presence of wruas in the case study area kiteme 2020 ngigi et al 2007 notter et al 2007 moreover the reduction in lowland streamflow despite an increasing trend in rainfall emphasizes the direct role humans have on catchment water availability complexity intensifies with the growing human population that leads to direct impacts e g increased river water abstractions and indirect impacts e g land transformations that affect water sustainability assuming similar socio hydrological system dynamics in the water scarce region of east africa there is a need for alternative approaches in water resources governance and management 4 5 implications for water resources governance and management one recommendation for catchments similar to upper ewaso ng iro especially for tropical catchments experiencing orographic rainfall is for improved land management practices in the context of socio hydrological dynamics observed in this study this can help mitigate the low baseflows that are increasingly being experienced during the dry seasons based on our results we argue that the increasing trend of conversion of perennial vegetation into agricultural land is not likely to reverse given the direct and indirect impacts of the growing human pressure in a catchment conversion of perennial vegetation to seasonal crops may not always be negative given that this type of conversion can reduce actual evapotranspiration from a given location schilling et al 2008 schilling and libra 2003 zhang and schilling 2006 reduced water loss through evapotranspiration may be an important hydrological factor especially for water scarce regions such as east africa therefore we argue that the adoption of land conservation activities that can reduce heavy runoff during wet seasons and retain more water through infiltration may be an opportunity to increase baseflows in the context of land use cover changes where most of the natural vegetation has been converted to agricultural lands percolation pits for instance may help reduce the resultant high surface runoff and consequently increase base flows during dry seasons akale et al 2019 veeranna and jeet 2021 water related conflicts are likely to intensify in the future there is a need to shift the focus of water resources governance and management from the sustainable natural flows perspective to the volume of water retained during wet seasons perspective therefore the important question for water scarce regions should be what amount of water is retained during the wet season that can sustain the growing water demand i e of the growing population and agricultural activities in the dry season during the transect walks in the case study area it was observed that the natural water pools fig 10 are the most important sources of water for domestic use irrigation and livestock including wildlife when the rivers are completely dry in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment the natural water pools are sections along the rivers with moderate to deep holes that store water when the rivers are flowing we argue that relying on natural water flows is not a sustainable approach and alternative approaches that integrate water harvesting and storage are needed including natural man made water pools check dams along the rivers water pans household water harvesting etc the river basin organization s concept is an important aspect of water resources management but there is a need to match their abilities with the complex socio hydrological dynamics for instance in the study site the portable pumps need to be registered with wruas this will help in estimating the total amount of water abstracted through direct pumping and help wruas to update their regulations and rationing programs and also help to quantify the amount of water abstracted the profiling of all land within a pre defined buffer zone as used in this study would be a key data point for wruas to increase the efficiency of water management and governance at the local level additionally due to the randomness and entropic usage of portable pumps it would be important for wruas to include in their rationing program the standard capacity for allowable portable pumps and the maximum number of hours a household is allowed to pump water from the rivers during dry seasons alternatively develop measures that will ensure no direct pumping of water from the rivers during dry seasons this would promote water harvesting during rainy seasons such that the pumping during dry seasons is only from the water storage e g man made or natural water pools small earth dams water pans etc this can increase efficiency especially among the irrigators who use visual satisfaction rather than the crop water requirements however for the above recommendations to take shape as wiesmann et al 2000 and laan et al 2021 suggested a need to bring all stakeholders together for collective understanding and especially to recognize that water is a shared resource this is important given the differences in cultures livelihoods and varying water needs and perspectives between upland and lowland communities this can be accomplished by increasing awareness and more informed collective decision making among different stakeholders e g through social learning approaches this can be achieved by adopting alternative participatory approaches such as serious gaming rodela et al 2019 speelman et al 2014 2019 5 conclusions this study explored historical human water interplays to understand the coevolution of hydrological systems and societal development and their impacts on the upper ewaso ng iro catchment this is especially in the context of declining streamflow in the catchment despite the pattern of increasing amounts of rainfall in the east african region the results show that social development aspects such as population growth land use cover changes and economic dynamics are the dominant features that are likely to have contributed to the changes in the lowland streamflow and consequently to water related conflicts humans have a direct role in catchment hydrology and therefore social dynamics are important aspects that need to be accounted for in all hydrological studies especially the integration of human components in the calibration and validation of the hydrological models the high correlations observed between water abstractions and the net flows are a strong indicator of the anti pro environmental behavior of stakeholders within a catchment however this study observed that human behavior is likely to change when household economics are negatively affected when communities begin to pay attention to environmental degradation by mimicking near reality a socio hydrological model can be helpful as a precursory tool to increase an understanding of how the system works the observed patterns in this study e g increasing wet season flows declining dry season flows increasing cropland areas at the expense of other land covers and increasing human population send a signal that the future is only likely to worsen and alternative solutions are indispensable especially for water scarce regions such as east africa this study observes that an increasing trend of rainfall in the east africa region does not translate to water sustainability in the case study area due to evolving human water interactions hence there is a need to shift the focus from the sustainable natural flows perspective to the amount water stored during wet seasons perspective this will reduce lowland upland conflicts and eventually lead to sustainability in the catchments especially when the water storage of a catchment matches the dry season water demands another recommendation is the adoption of land conservation activities that would promote runoff infiltration to improve baseflows since reversing the cropland expansion against a growing population may not be feasible there is also a need to bring all stakeholders together for collective understanding and especially to recognize that water is a shared resource funding this research was made possible by wageningen university through the

appendices a parameterization and validation of the socio hydrological model components parameterization of catchment hydrology component the hydrology component in this study is geared toward mimicking the historical streamflow observed in the lowland zone the streamflow in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment has been reported to have decreased by about 30 since 1960 aeschbacher et al 2005 ngigi et al 2007 this is linked to direct river water abstractions in the upland zone orendo 2000 since there is no significant decline in rainfall in the catchment aeschbacher et al 2005 moreover there is an increasing trend of rainfall in the east african forested water towers wamucii et al 2021 mt kenya water maintains higher rainfall conditions with relatively lower atmospheric energy thus generating runoff for the drier lowland areas fig a1 a c conceptualization of the generic water balance with the above understanding it is therefore necessary to conceptualize a water balance that takes into account the four zones i e forest upland midland and lowland zones hence the total streamflow for the study area consists of the sum of the net contributions of the different zones net flow inflow from the forested water tower net inflow from the upland zone net inflow from the midland zone net inflow from the lowland zone understanding the water appropriation for detailed water balance estimations based on community discussions and transect walks the appropriation of water resources in the study site is mainly for agriculture household consumption and livestock production agricultural activities are located in the upland and midland zones livestock production i e pastoralism is a key activity in the lowland zone we established that water use in the study site is structured around six different categories 1 community water projects 2 institutions e g hotels schools hospitals etc 3 riparian landowners 4 non riparian landowners 5 commercial farms and 6 illegal water abstractions fig a2 a illegal water abstractions are aggregated into one category i e water that cannot be accounted for however it is paramount to mention that illegal water abstraction can occur in any of the five categories mentioned above the major type of abstraction is the river water abstractions which are concentrated in the uplands i e inside the forested water tower and the upland zones fig a2 b gravity water intake pipes are used for community water projects institutions and commercial farms direct pumping of river water using portable pumps is a common practice for riparian landowners community discussions reported that illegal water abstractions have proliferated in the study site due usage of portable pumps non riparian landowners if not connected through community water projects may use water tankers to fetch water directly from the rivers based on community and stakeholder discussions community water projects and riparian landowners account for over 90 of total water abstracted it was established that within the selected study area there were a total of 188 gravity flow water intakes as of 2020 table a1 about 60 of gravity flow water intakes are located inside the mt kenya water tower and 40 in the upland zone however the actual number of total water abstractions may be higher and a detailed census type of survey is needed to establish the actual total water abstractions including all types of abstractions such as direct from streams rivers furrows springs boreholes dams pans shallow wells etc the number of gravity flow water intakes rarely changes over time due to strict regulations and controls exercised by wruas most of the water intakes have an average pipe size of 4 in 100 mm with a capacity to abstract 1000 m3 every 24 h the capacity of the common portable water pumps used by small scale farmers varies from 5 to 24 horsepower hp it is difficult to quantify the actual amount of water abstracted through portable pumps due to the entropic usage of the pumps for instance since most pumps are not registered with wruas most of the water pumping happens in utmost secrecy e g at night over the weekends holidays etc some households have more than one pump and it is not possible to tell at what time all pumps may be used to abstract water from the rivers the time for running these pumps is dependent on the household affordability of fuel and running time varies from 2 h to 24 h per day there is also randomness in the amount of water used on farmland this is dependent on visual satisfaction rather than the crop water requirements plates 1 and 2 shows a farmer irrigating his land planted with young seedlings of tomatoes the tomatoes are planted on sunken beds commonly known as jaruba sinks the farmers pour water directly pumped from the river into these sinks up to the satisfaction level e g when the sinks are full based on community discussions and transect walks we used agricultural land dynamics to estimate the quantity of water directly pumped from the river although this type of quantification does not give the actual volume of water abstracted it depicts a realistic quantification of water abstracted using pumps intensive irrigation activities are concentrated in the midland zone where irrigation takes place both in wet and dry seasons in the upland zone moderate irrigation activities are observed only during dry seasons we established that the expansion of agricultural land near the river course was driven by the perceived availability of river water most of the water pumping takes place up to a distance of 800 m from the river course hence the area under agriculture within a buffer of 600 m was used to give a realistic picture of water abstractions along the river course notter 2003 reported that in the savannah zone i e the midland zone a pump can be found almost every 100 m along the river line we assumed that 60 of agricultural land within the 600 m buffer zone is under irrigation in the midland zone during dry seasons while only 20 of agricultural land within the buffer zone in the upland zone is irrigated during dry seasons community discussions confirmed that during dry seasons a 2 acre farm in the midland zone would require a 13 hp portable pump running for an average of 10 h per day with an estimated capacity of 1000 liters per minute this is repeated every 3 4 days in the midland zone in the upland zone a 2 acre farm would require a 7 5 hp portable pump running for an average of 7 h per day with an estimated capacity of 600 liters per minute this is repeated once a week in the upland zone the land use cover analyses revealed that in 1985 the agricultural area within a buffer zone of 600 m was approximately 8290 and 2437 acres in the upland and midland zones respectively fig a3 this increased to 21 224 and 20 367 acres respectively in 2016 this indicates that within the 600 m of the river course the agricultural land increases annually by approximately 417 acres in the upland and 578 acres in the midland zones rainwater harvesting e g roof runoff flood flow storage was not factored in this study as it was established through community discussions that rainwater harvesting is not a common practice in the catchment a similar observation was also reported adf 2005 that there is minimal floodwater storage in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment with the above additional information the water balance was refined to take into account estimated water abstractions in each of the four zones the estimation of water abstractions total abstractions in each zone sum of the permanent water intake projects the estimated direct pumping from the river network forest zone forest zone net inflow runoff estimations from mt kenya water tower estimated total water abstractions within the forested water tower upland zone net flow in the upland zone the inflow from the water tower to the upland zone the upland internal runoff generation the estimated total water abstractions in the upland zone midland zone net flow in the midland zone inflow from the upland zone the midland internal runoff generation the estimated total water abstractions in the midland zone lowland zone net flow in the lowland zone inflow from the midland zone the lowland internal runoff generation the estimated total water abstractions in the lowland zone the runoff coefficients i e the percentage of rainfall that represents runoff were estimated from the long term values of precipitation gathered from the chirps database funk et al 2015 and the long term runoff estimations from the global runoff data centre fekete et al 2002 wamucii et al 2021 the runoff coefficients used in this study are 41 in the mt kenya water tower 24 in the upland zone 20 in the midland zone and 18 in the lowland zone table a2 parameterization of land use dynamics component the upper ewaso ng iro catchment has undergone drastic land use land cover changes over the years gichuki 2006 lanari et al 2018 mungai et al 2004 mutiga et al 2010 ngigi et al 2007 large scale ranching small scale farming and large scale horticultural enterprises transformed the upper slopes of the catchment lanari et al 2018 major water users in the upper reaches include small scale farmers and medium and large scale commercial horticulture farms that produce flowers and vegetables for export using perennial irrigation schemes the horticultural farms first appeared in the region in 1991 and gradually became powerful stakeholders that compete with small scale farmers and urban centers over seasonally scarce water increasing the potential for conflict lanari et al 2018 in the early years of the 1970 s 1980 s rainfed agricultural activities were mainly concentrated in the upland zone areas where much of the forest was cleared at the expense of agricultural lands notter 2003 the savannah midland zone was characterized by open grasslands alternating with shrubs bushland areas a zone that was mainly used for ranches and grazing areas in the 1970 s 1980 s in recent years the expansion of irrigated agricultural activities has been observed in the savannah zone principally cropland areas have been increasing over the years at the expense of other important land covers such as forest grassland bushland areas etc results presented by mutiga et al 2011 show that in the entire upper ewaso ng iro catchment between 1987 and 2003 cropland areas increased from 12 to 24 forest cover decreased from 30 to 23 grassland areas decreased from 21 to 18 bushland areas decreased from 19 to 8 among other land use cover changes the land use dynamics in this study focused on land use cover lulc changes in the catchment between the 1980 s and 2020 s landsat 5 tm satellite image of 1985 was downloaded from usgs 2019 and analyzed to represent land use cover conditions for the first period of 1980 1990 the kenya sentinel 2 land use land cover of 2016 was downloaded from rcmrd geoportal 2017 to represent land use cover conditions for the last period of 2010 2020 the land use cover analysis revealed major changes in agricultural land and grassland areas fig a4 agricultural land increased from 9 0 in 1985 to 27 6 in 2016 and grassland areas decreased from 40 7 in 1985 to 10 8 in 2016 overall there was a slight increase in tree cover bushland and bareland areas built up areas increased from 0 8 in 1985 to 1 4 in 2016 an interesting observation is the increasing tree cover outside the boundary of the water tower within the upland zone however within the water tower itself there was a slight decrease in the area under tree cover as shown in table a3 the results of increasing tree cover and bushland areas despite pressures from the human population can be attributed to the national government conservation efforts the existence of wruas that promote conservation at the local level and the growth of conservancy organizations that promote fencing in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment nevertheless there was a slight decrease in tree cover inside the mt kenya water tower which can be attributed to the increasing annual forest fires gikandi 2022 poletti et al 2019 this further indicates the presence of human activities inside the forested water towers as opined in wamucii et al 2021 the changes in agricultural land were concentrated in the upland and midland zones within the water tower the noticeable changes are increasing grassland and bareland areas decreasing bushland areas and a slight decrease in tree cover built up areas are also observed in the upland and midland areas interestingly bushland areas were observed to increase in the midland and lowland areas at the expense of grassland and bareland areas with the above understanding it was necessary to come up with a formulation that would link the land use changes and water resource availability hence we formulated a parameter that estimates the streamflow sustainability factor as a result of changes in land use dynamics since the area under cropland was the dominant change in the study site the cropland area was used as the denominator to derive the streamflow sustainability factor as other types of land use changed this means the streamflow sustainability factor will reduce with an increase in cropland areas and vice versa parameterization of population dynamics component with a growth rate estimated at 5 6 per annum the population in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment increased from 50 000 in 1960 to about 500 000 in 2000 ngigi et al 2007 based on 2019 census data the population densities varied from 800 persons per square kilometer in the upland zone to less than 24 persons per square kilometer in the lowland areas the growth in population increases the pressure on land and water resources ericksen et al 2011 kiteme 2020 providoli et al 2019 the population datasets were sourced from worldpop and verified with data from the kenya national bureau of statistics knbs worldpop is an organization that develops high resolution gridded data on population dynamics spanning the year 2000 to the present worldpop 2020 the population densities are based on specific countries population census data at a ground resolution of 100 m stevens et al 2015 the population densities for earlier years i e between 1980 and 2000 were estimated retrogressively based on annual growth rates figure a 5 shows that the population in the selected study area is concentrated in the upper reaches of the catchment the population grew from 193 573 persons in 2000 to approximately 334 405 persons in 2020 the population in the midland zone almost doubled 98 between 2000 and 2020 fig a 5 the population numbers were used to estimate the household level water demand and drive the potential per capita income in the catchment economics component population pressure factor was also constructed to drive the elements such as the expansion of agricultural land and related water abstractions along the river line putri et al 2019 used a similar concept of population pressure to look at population pressure on land and agricultural productivity parameterization of catchment economics component the catchment economics were calculated based on the dominant crops both traditional and commercial crops among small scale farmers who are the majority in the upland midland zones livestock keeping is a major economic activity in the lowland zone maize and potato are the major crops in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment kuil et al 2018 and were selected to represent traditional crops in the model the short term commercial crops are meant for export markets the two major commercial crops selected for this study were french beans and snow peas there is a growing demand for commercial crops due to the ready market facilitated by the growing number of export companies within the catchment the export companies and horticultural farms engage small scale farmers through buy back models contractual farming this has led to a shift from traditional rainfed agriculture to ever present farming activities both in the wet and dry seasons the majority of small scale farmers were also reported to have shifted from traditional crops such as maize and potato farming and ventured into short term crops for exports such as french beans and snow peas the demand for short term crops is believed to have contributed to behavioral changes toward excessive abstractions of water for irrigation purposes with reports of up to 95 of dry season water resources being abstracted from the upland and midland zones laikipia forum 2020 mkewp 2017 orendo 2000 reported that in the dry season when demand for irrigation is highest 60 80 of available water in the upper reaches is abstracted with 40 80 of it being unauthorized generally water abstractions are estimated at 20 of streamflow in the wet seasons and over 70 in the dry seasons ngigi et al 2007 with this understanding we came up with a parameterization that integrates traditional crops and commercial crops the catchment economics in the agricultural areas i e upland and midland zones were expressed as a summation of gross profits of traditional and short term commercial crops the livestock production gross profits were used to estimate economics in the lowland zone the key parameters considered for estimating economics in the upland and midland zone include the total gross profits gross from traditional crops gross from commercial crops gross profit commercial or traditional crops a multiplication between market price per unit and total crop yield in the lowland the livestock income was estimated as follows assuming an annual offtake rate of 30 for the livestock total gross profits in the lowland a multiplication between the total number of animals sheep goat and cattle sold per year and the market price per animal sheep goat and cattle the potential income was also affected by the growing human population the income per capita estimated income number of the human population parameterization of community sensitivity component community sensitivity logic has been used in socio hydrological modeling and represents an indicator of the community s socio economic and environmental values elshafei et al 2014 2015 van emmerik et al 2014 sivapalan and blöschl 2015 for instance elshafei et al 2015 used a composite socio economic sensitivity driving variable to capture the degree of a perceived threat to a community s quality of life van emmerik et al 2014 used the environmental awareness equation to track the dynamics of community sensitivity to the degradation of riparian wetlands in essence community sensitivity determines the degree and direction of the overall impetus for action in determining community sensitivity levels understanding the values and preferences of the communities is paramount values and preferences vary with time and space and they are important in river basins where upland and lowland communities are linked through water flow in the river network sivapalan and blöschl 2015 we assume that a high community sensitivity would invoke a behavioral response toward enviro centric management decisions e g a reduction in water abstractions land reclamation water metering etc if community sensitivity is low the patterns of the aggressive exploitation of available land resources to suit economic needs would manifest in the socio hydrological system in this study profitability and dry season water availability factors were formulated to trigger the levels of environmental degradation awareness factors in the study site the changes in the levels of environmental degradation awareness will then determine key actions by the communities such as the rate of water abstractions increasing cropland areas to maximize potential returns investing in water storage and immigrating in search of water among other decisions water related conflicts emerge due to different decisions in the upland lowland gradient during the community discussions it was observed that there is a blame game of persons in the uplands as the problem while very few pay attention to the impact of their activities this results in a situation where the lowland communities perceive the midland upland communities as the problem and the midland communities on the other hand perceive the upland communities as the problem interestingly the majority of the upland communities do not think that they have anything to do with the water related problems experienced in the lowland zone fig a 6 similarly wiesmann et al 2000 noted that the upland communities lack awareness of the magnitude of lowland effects caused by their land use decisions incomes are the priority and as long as there are substantial incomes very few will bother with the water related problems experienced in the lowland zone land conservation and water harvesting are not a priority in the upland zone the majority believe conservation and water harvesting are difficult and expensive and they do not have the relevant skills required fig a6 however there is a willingness to participate in land conservation and water harvesting activities in the future but with no clarity on when this can happen as dry season water availability reduces an increase in the level of environmental degradation awareness is likely to manifest in the socio hydrological system however this awareness will diffuse with perceptions of high profits mainly from short term commercial crops grown during dry seasons and ready markets within the catchment hence small scale farmers will explore different options including expanding cropland area by clearing important land covers such as tree cover bushland grassland etc reducing areas under traditional crops in exchange for commercial crops aggressive water abstractions including illegal water abstractions among other decisions all these actions will manifest in the socio hydrological system as farmers adopt new ways to exploit the high profits despite the changing hydrological conditions with the above background the following considerations were made 1 the level of environmental degradation awareness as a function of dry season water availability and profitability 2 the dry season water availability factor is calculated as average conditions for january and february i e the driest months in the study area this is based on available water after accounting for water abstractions condition i as dry season water availability reduces i e approaching 0 then the level of environmental degradation awareness increases 1 however communities are majorly after profit making especially from short term commercial crops hence the level of degradation awareness will be diffused by the profitability factor in the socio hydrological system 2 the profitability factor was formulated as a function of annual economic gain per household condition ii if the profitability factor is high i e approaching 1 then the environmental degradation awareness level reduces and farmers ignore hydrological conditions and invest more to exploit the economic opportunities condition iii if the profitability factor is high and short term commercial profits are higher than profits from traditional crops then farmers will increase the area under commercial crops and reduce the area under traditional crops condition iv investing more in short term commercial crops increases the rate of water abstraction in the socio hydrological system condition v prevailing profits will also influence small scale farmers decision to expand the area under cropland by clearing important land covers such as tree cover bushland grassland etc 1 the water related will manifest as communities in the upland midland and lowland evolve and adapt to the changing ecosystems 2 the emergence of conflicts was formulated as a function of water availability in the months of january and february the estimated water demands in the two months and the dry season water availability factor b the

7695,study region upper ewaso ng iro catchment is located in eastern africa a water scarce region study focus streamflow is in decline in the catchment despite the pattern of increasing amounts of rainfall in the east african region this study explored historical human water interplays to understand the coevolution of hydrological systems and societal development and to identify the dominant features contributing to water deficits and water related conflicts in the lowland zone of the catchment a socio hydrological conceptual framework was used to mimic and explain the two way coupling between human and hydrological systems new hydrological insights for the region the results show that the dominant features that have likely contributed to changes in lowland streamflow and water related conflicts include population growth land use cover changes and economic dynamics the dry season flows have been extremely reduced with a 100 reduction observed in the month of february especially between 2010 and 2020 while the wet season flows have increased by about 10 and 15 in the upland and midland zones respectively the decreasing trends in the streamflow against increasing amounts of rainfall emphasize the direct role humans have on catchment water availability east africa being a water scarce region there is a need to shift the focus from the sustainable natural flows perspective to the amount of water retained during wet seasons perspective improving land conservation activities to increase water infiltration during wet seasons and the need to bring all stakeholders together for collective understanding graphical abstract ga1 keywords socio hydrological modeling social development water scarcity upland lowland gradient human water interactions 1 introduction water scarcity can be attributed to natural processes such as climate changes and proliferated by the evolving human water interactions globally water resources availability is confronted with increasing complexities due to the evolving nature of demographic economic and technological trends availability of distributed resources and uncertainties brought about by climate change cosgrove and loucks 2015 van emmerik et al 2014 evers et al 2017 the intensity of these challenges is accelerated by evolving human adaptation to the changing environment cosgrove and loucks 2015 for many parts of tropical regions especially those that experience orographic precipitation the human water systems are majorly shaped by the upland lowland continuum in which hydrological dynamics experienced in lowland areas are majorly influenced by the upland anthropogenic behavior brown and king 2006 mukhwana 2016 mwendwa et al 2019 van oel et al 2008 this leads to emergents such as water scarcity and water related conflicts between upland and lowland communities berhanu et al 2016 for water scarce regions such as east africa elmi mohamed 2013 kebede and taye 2021 understanding the evolving human water interactions is an important aspect of a sustainable approach to water resources management evers et al 2017 for a long time the hydrology literature has been dominated by conventional hydrological modeling that aimed at providing insights into the catchment hydrological issues conventional models are used in research for various purposes including water balance estimations forecasting hydrological conditions and informing policies and strategies for short and long term water management however such conventional models do not directly account for the feedback between hydrological and human sub systems limiting insights into the roles of humans and social development in hydrological processes garcia et al 2016 additionally conventional models differ in their model structures complexities input data requirements the number of parameters involved etc hence their application is limited to the specific research being carried out for instance kumar singh and marcy 2017 found that different conventional hydrological models differ significantly in water balance estimations under different climate change scenarios wagener et al 2010 and van noordwijk 2019 recommended a new paradigm for hydrological studies by adopting a concept of a full hydrological perspective and recognizing humans as an integral part of the overall hydrologic system generally there is a need for integrated approaches that explicitly incorporate processes that represent the coexistence between people and water systems ceola et al 2014 van emmerik et al 2014 gleick and palaniappan 2010 ostrom 2009 to manage water resources and minimize water related conflicts the integrated water resources management approach iwrm is widely practiced globally jain and singh 2003 nepal et al 2014 iwrm involves strategic manipulation of the interactions between natural processes socio economic activities and institutional arrangements relevant to a river basin jain and singh 2003 savenije and van der zaag 2008 however for iwrm to realize its potential the evolution of socio hydrological dynamics needs to be well understood loucks and van beek 2017 massuel et al 2018 nepal et al 2014 pandey et al 2020 yu et al 2020 additionally iwrm does not necessarily account for the dynamics of relevant interactions and feedback between water and people sivapalan et al 2012 therefore advanced approaches such as socio hydrological modeling that study the effects of dynamic interactions and feedback between water and people are highly recommended di baldassarre et al 2019 sivapalan et al 2012 socio hydrological modeling provides an approach that helps to explain or gain insight into the co evolutionary dynamics of the human water coupled system van emmerik et al 2014 used the socio hydrological framework to explain the dominant features of a river basin such as reservoir capacity population size irrigation area environmental flows etc kandasamy et al 2014 applied a socio hydrological model to explain interactions and feedback between agricultural development and environmental health di baldassarre et al 2013 used a socio hydrological modeling approach to conceptualize the interplays of the complex web of interactions and feedback mechanisms between hydrological and social processes the socio hydrological modeling enables exploring the human water interplays thereby increasing an understanding of how the overall socio hydrological system works in this study we used a case of the upper ewaso ng iro catchment located in kenya a country in the east africa region whose over 80 of its land is classified as arid and semi arid areas ouma et al 2018 the catchment is a fragile tropical watershed located on the leeward side of mt kenya forest which functions as an important water tower for the east african region wamucii et al 2021 the highland lowland continuum has topographic and atmospheric circulation conditions that produce steep climatic and ecological gradients resulting in humid and semiarid conditions that change within a relatively short distance mccord et al 2015 ngigi et al 2007 fundamentally the catchment population has close economic ties with natural resources and climate dependent sectors such as agricultural production in the upland zones and pastoralism and tourism activities in the lowland zones the upland lowland water related conflicts have increased over the years in the upper ewaso ng iro river basin in kenya the period 2000 2020 has seen frequent and even fatal conflicts between lowland and upland communities hirji 2000 kiteme 2020 mutiga et al 2010 based on conventional hydrological modeling past studies in the catchment revealed decreasing streamflow patterns during dry seasons despite the pattern of increasing rainfall amounts in the east african region kimwatu et al 2021 mutiga et al 2011 notter 2003 notter et al 2007 omwoyo et al 2017 however conventional hydrological studies do not capture coupled human water system feedbacks which is seen as a gap in strategically informing water resources governance and management garcia et al 2016 sivapalan et al 2012 our preliminary analysis revealed a decreasing pattern of annual streamflow at a selected point in the study area against an increasing annual rainfall pattern fig 1 a fig 1 b and c show the conceptual water balance and dry season flow in an upland lowland gradient the decreasing streamflow despite the patterns of increasing amounts of rainfall is an important finding that underlines the need for further research especially on human water interactions as the changes in streamflow seem to be beyond the changes in the natural systems according to previous research in the study area the changes in the dry season streamflow can be attributed to a combination of low rainfall rapidly growing human population agricultural intensification increasing water abstractions and degradation of natural resource base among other factors gichuki 2006 kiteme 2020 van der laan et al 2021 liniger et al 2005 liniger and gichuki 1994 mutiga et al 2010 2011 ngigi et al 2008 ongaji 2021 wiesmann et al 2000 however the factors that are believed to contribute to complex water related challenges are only autonomously reported with no clear human water interactions and feedback it is therefore necessary to develop an integrated framework that explores the coevolution of human water dynamics this paper aims to understand the causes and effects of changes in water availability in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment by assessing relevant historical human water interplays and their effects this is achieved through constructing a conceptual socio hydrological framework that helps in creating an understanding of what has been happening in the past between the 1980 s and 2020 s we adopt a stylized approach to study the mechanisms behind the socio hydrological dynamics in the selected study site this helped in creating an understanding of how the system works particularly in linking the dynamics in the upland zone to the conditions observed in the lowland zone of the upper ewaso ng iro catchment the socio hydrological framework contains five components that represent co evolution hydrology land use dynamics population dynamics catchment economics and community sensitivity we adopted a parameterization procedure guided by a literature review preliminary analyses and expert judgment validation approach of key historical processes the specific question to be answered is what are the key socio hydrological dynamics that can be linked to the decreasing streamflow despite increasing trends of amounts of rainfall in the upper ewaso ng iro basin a study site that covers parts of the upland midland and lowland zones of the larger catchment was selected and used to explore the historical socio hydrological dynamics along an upland lowland gradient relevant to a large part of the ewaso ng iro catchment to ensure a focus on the dynamic human water interactions we used long term mean values for the physical water balance elements such as precipitation potential evapotranspiration and runoff 2 methodology sivapalan and blöschl 2015 opined that socio hydrological modelling can take three major lines of inquiry a historical b comparative or c process socio hydrology in this study we applied a chronosequence approach deluca et al 2002 grünzweig et al 2004 kneitel 2010 sivapalan and blöschl 2015 in the conceptualization and parameterization of the socio hydrological model this involved using different sub basins within the selected study site to study the coevolutionary dynamics of humans and water this was important as different sub basins may pose unique characteristics such as land use land cover types presence of industries population culture etc which may influence water patterns in space and time this helped in understanding the historical perspectives and patterns to understand how humans have coevolved with hydrological dynamics in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment a conceptual socio hydrological framework attempts to chronologically trace the changes in water availability as a result of societal developments along the upland lowland gradient parameterization and validation of socio hydrological model components were achieved through a detailed literature review preliminary analyses and carrying out community discussions and key informant interviews 2 1 study area the upper ewaso ng iro catchment is located on the north west of the mt kenya forested water tower and covers an area of 15 285 km2 stretching from the upland along the fringes of two forested water towers to an outlet point known as archer s post fig 2a the larger part of the catchment is covered by woody grassland areas fig 2b the aberdares water tower and mt kenya water tower maintain high precipitation on average 1200 mm yr 1 and 1400 mm yr 1 respectively wamucii et al 2021 hence discharging runoff to drier lowland areas mt kenya contributes a major share to the streamflow in the basin notter 2003 we divided the catchment into upland midland and lowland parts based on aridity indices the aridity index was calculated as a ratio of long term rainfall and evapotranspiration p pet fig 3 a the rainfall p was sourced from the chirps database funk et al 2015 and evapotranspiration pet was sourced from the cru database ekström et al 2007 harris et al 2020 the upland zone is a humid area with an aridity index above 0 65 the midland zone stretches from humid to semi arid areas i e aridity indexes ranging from 0 65 to 0 5 the lowland zone includes semi arid to arid areas i e aridity index below 0 5 the study area fig 3 b was selected to evaluate in detail the socio hydrological dynamics and especially to study the influence of the societal development in the upland zone on the changes observed in the lowland zone the mean annual rainfall ranges from 1500 mm in the mt kenya water tower to 350 mm in the arid lowlands around archer s post mungai et al 2004 high population densities are concentrated in the upland areas small scale and large scale agriculture is mainly practiced in the upland and midland zones studies have reported that the growing demand for water in the upland areas results in water shortages in the lowland areas aarts 2012 notter 2003 principally there are three major approaches in this study a developing a descriptive conceptual model of how upland communities influence the lowland streamflow based on literature review b validation of conceptual model components processes and simulations through community and stakeholder discussions including transect walks within the study site and c developing a refined conceptual socio hydrological model based on information gathered from the publications and through fieldwork activities 2 2 the descriptive conceptual socio hydrological model guided by the steps put forward in sivapalan and blöschl 2015 we first developed a descriptive conceptual model of how upland communities influence the lowland streamflow fig 4 shows the generic conceptual causal loop diagram for the upper ewaso ng iro catchment one of the major societal developments is the growing population which is a major driver of hydrological changes in the upper ewaso ng iro river basin mutiga et al 2011 as the population grows the demand for space and available opportunities such as businesses and horticulture among others increase this leads to the transformation of landforms including the expansion of cropland areas the expansion of the cropland areas leads to decreases in other land covers such as tree cover bushland grassland areas etc these land transformations affect the water balance in different ways for instance the expansion of cropland increases the dry season irrigation water demand degradation of important land covers such as forests bushland and grasslands also affects water retention in the catchment during rainy seasons leading to increases in runoff during wet seasons and a reduction of potential flows during dry seasons the growing population also means an increasing water demand for household water consumption the catchment economics is assumed to increase with the expansion of cropland areas but potential income per capita would decrease with the growing population the changes in hydrological conditions especially during the dry season increase the community sensitivity hence the level of environmental degradation awareness however the higher profits reduce the willingness to engage in conservation activities despite the declining streamflow based on location i e upland or in the lowland areas the community members react differently e g increasing cropland areas to maximize potential returns increasing the rate of river abstractions investing in water storage boreholes immigrating in search of water etc these actions increase the level of community water related conflicts especially between upland and lowland communities 2 3 parameterization and validation of the conceptual model beyond the conceptual causal loop diagram validation of conceptual model components processes and simulations was carried out through community and stakeholder discussions including transect walks within the study site extensive literature reviews and pre analyses were also integrated into this step to ensure that the parameters included in the model components are representative of the local context the pre analysis was key in generating preliminary outputs that served as inputs for the model elements for instance pre analyses of land use cover changes were carried out to establish the actual rate of changes that were reflected in the land use component an expert judgment validation approach was adopted through community and stakeholder discussions to ensure that the model results coincide with observed historical perspectives and patterns in the study site this helped further refine the model component parameters seven focus group discussions were held with communities to draw the major historical patterns within the study site key informant interviews were conducted with key stakeholders in the upper ewaso ng iro river basin the participatory mapping of historical events was done targeting the period between the 1980 s and the 2020 s the year 1980 was selected as the base year as this is the period with the most reliable climatic data for the study site these include chirps rainfall data funk et al 2015 with a temporal coverage beginning in 1981 and potential evapotranspiration pet from climate research unit cru database with temporal coverage beginning in 1981 ekström et al 2007 harris et al 2020 the observed hydrological data are also available and reliable beginning 1980 s as shown by time series data on cetrad s website cetrad 2021 we developed a refined socio hydrological model based on information gathered from publications and fieldwork involving community stakeholder discussions and transect walks fig 5 shows the refined socio hydrology model used in this study the equations used in the five model components are summarized below more details on the parameterization of the model components and the motivation for the selected parameters are provided in annex a 2 4 the catchment hydrology component within the selected study site the mt kenya water tower contributes about 57 of the available water resources another 42 of water resources come from the upland 21 and midland 21 zones the lowland zone contributes about 1 of available water resources table a 2 this underlines the importance of the mt kenya water tower in generating streamflow for the drier lowland areas especially since the study area is on the leeward side of the mt kenya water tower we assume that the total streamflow for the study area consists of the sum of the net contributions of the different zones forest upland midland and lowland zones 1a q out q inflow q upland q midland q lowland where q out is the streamflow at the selected outlet point q inflow is the inflow from the forested water tower q upland is the net inflow from the upland zone q midland is the net flow from the midland zone and q lowland is the net flow from the lowland zone given the growing demand for water in the study site leading to excessive water abstractions see more details in annex a the hydrology component for each zone was therefore estimated as follows forested water tower i e net flows from mt kenya water tower 1b q inflow q mtk q wt abs upland zone 1c q upland q inflow q r up q up t abs midland zone 1d q midland q upland q r mid q mid t abs lowland zone 1e q lowland q midland q r lw q lw t abs total water abstractions were estimated using the following equation 1 f q t abs q pw q dr where q mtk represents runoff estimations from mt kenya water tower q wt abs is the estimated total water abstractions within the forested water tower q upland is the net inflow from the upland zone q inflow is the inflow from the water tower to the upland zone q r up is the upland internal runoff generation q up t abs is the estimated total water abstractions in the upland zone q midland is the net inflow from the midland zone q upland is the inflow from the upland zone q r mid is the midland internal runoff generation and q mid t abs is the estimated total water abstractions in the midland zone q lowland is the net inflow from the lowland zone q midland is the inflow from the midland zone q r lw is the lowland internal runoff generation q lw t abs is the estimated total water abstractions in the lowland zone q t abs is the total abstractions in each zone as a sum of the permanent water intake projects q pw and the estimated direct pumping from the river network q dr annex a 2 5 the land use dynamics component the analysis of land use cover analysis was used to construct a parameter that estimates the streamflow sustainability factor as a result of changes in land use dynamics the key assumption is that increase in cropland will reduce important land covers such as tree cover grassland and bushland the changes in land use cover affect the catchment water balance in different ways for instance a decline in natural vegetation cover results in increased surface runoff during the wet season and a decline in base flow during the dry season ahiablame et al 2019 chauhan et al 2020 guzha et al 2018 hurni et al 2005 mungai et al 2004 nugroho et al 2013 based on the results presented by guzha et al 2018 for tropical catchments in east africa we deduce that on average a one percent decrease in forest cover causes an increase in peak flow by 0 63 and a decrease in base flow by 0 39 within the study area aeschbacher et al 2005 opined that if the savannah zone and upland zone were to be completely converted into agricultural lands the peak flows would increase by 16 thus changes in land use cover have a direct impact on the water balance of a watershed the equation for the streamflow sustainability factor was therefore formulated as a fraction of the area under tree cover bushland and grassland to the area under cropland the equation for water resources sustainability factor 2a rfs f t a b a g a c a where rfs f is the streamflow sustainability factor t a is the area under tree cover b a is the area under bushland g a is the area under grassland and c a is the area under cropland the actual annual rates of change for all land use classes are provided in fig a4 the streamflow sustainability factor was integrated into the model such that it reduces potential streamflows during the dry season and increased wet flows during the wet season as described below dry season 2b q c p r c α rfs f wet season 2c q c p r c α rfs f where q c is the estimated runoff generated in each of the zones p is the precipitation r c is the runoff coefficient α is a constant value set to 0 1 as the maximum value for the streamflow sustainability factor rfs f is the streamflow sustainability factor 2 6 population dynamics component population growth in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment has been reported to be a key factor in increasing water demands ngigi et al 2008 our pre analysis show that the population grew from 193 573 persons in 2000 to approximately 334 405 persons in 2020 the population in the midland zone almost doubled 98 between 2000 and 2020 fig a 5 the population datasets for the study period were sourced from stevens and worldpop et al 2015 2020 and verified with data from the kenya national bureau of statistics knbs data portal knbs 2019 the estimated annual population numbers were used to estimate household water demand the human population numbers also affect catchment economics in the model 3a p a p p rt where p a is the estimated annual population number p rt is the annual population growth rate and p is the base population extracted from the population datasets the human population growth has been identified to exert pressure on land hence a direct link to agricultural land expansion and related water demands elmhagen et al 2015 okello et al 2015 putri et al 2019 with this understanding we proposed the population pressure factor a parameter that drives several elements of the model such as the cropland expansion along the river line river zone irrigated area and estimated daily water abstractions from the rivers 3b p fa p a a ag β where p fa is the population pressure factor on agricultural land p a is population numbers per annum a ag is the estimated annual cropland area along the river line within 800 m in the upland and midland areas β is a constant value set at 0 1 2 7 catchment economics component the catchment economics in the upland midland zones were calculated based on the dominant crops both traditional and commercial crops among small scale farmers while economics in the lowland areas were based on livestock production traditional crops 4a gp t m p m yd a m p p p yd a p short term commercial crops 4b gp c f p f yd a f s p s yd a s total gross profits 4c tgp gp t gp c where tgp is the total gross profits in the upland and midland gp t is the gross profits for traditional crops gp c is gross profits for commercial crops m p is the market price per kg of maize m yd is the maize yield per acre a m is the area in acres under maize production p p is the market price per kg of potato p yd is the potato yield per acre a p is the area in acres under potato production f p is the market price per kg of french beans f yd is the french beans yield per acre a f is the area in acres under french beans production s p is the market price per kg of snow peas s yd is the snow peas yield per acre a s is the area in acres under snow peas production the information on crop yields and market prices was sourced from the stakeholders in the study area in the lowland zone the livestock income was estimated as follows assuming an annual offtake rate of 30 for the livestock total gross profits in the lowland 4d t gp dwn 0 3 sg n sg mp 0 3 ct n ct mp annual economic gain per household 4e tg hh tgp p a where t gp dwn is the total gross profits in the lowland sg n is the total number of sheep and goats kept by households per year sg mp is the market price per sheep goat ct n is the total number of cattle kept by households per year and ct mp is the market price per animal tg hh is the annual economic gain per household p a is the estimated annual population number 2 8 community sensitivity component the community sensitivity variable was formulated to determine the degree and direction of the overall impetus for action the key equations for community sensitivity are explained below 5a ed a 1 wa f 1 p f where ed a is the level of environmental degradation awareness wa f is the dry season water availability factor and p f is the profitability factor the dry season water availability factor the dry season water availability factor was calculated as average conditions for january and february i e the driest months in the study area 5b wa f aw jan ta jan aw jan aw feb ta feb aw feb 2 where wa f is the dry season water availability factor available water is represented as aw jan and aw feb total water abstracted in the two months is represented as ta jan and ta feb as wa f reduces i e approaching 0 then the level of environmental degradation awareness increases condition affects eq 5a condition i the level of degradation awareness will however be diffused by the profitability factor in the socio hydrological system profitability factor 5c p f tg hh pi a where p f is the profitability factor tg hh is the annual economic gain per household i e earnings from crops and livestock production pi a is the fixed preferred ideal household annual income set at kshs 355 000 based on field assessments p f ranges from 0 low profitability to 1 high profitability if p f is high then environmental degradation awareness level reduces and farmers ignore hydrological conditions and invest more to exploit the immediate profits made available by the ready markets in the catchment condition affects eq 5a condition ii therefore if p f is high and short term commercial profits are higher than profits from traditional crops then farmers will increase the area under commercial crops and reduce the area under traditional crops condition affects equation 4 condition iii investing more in short term commercial crops increases the rate of water abstractions in the socio hydrological system condition affects eqs 1b 1d condition iv the small scale farmers also expand the area under cropland by clearing important land covers such as tree cover bushland grassland etc condition affects equations 2 condition v water related conflicts manifest as communities in the upland midland and lowland evolve and adapt to the changing ecosystems the emergence of conflicts was formulated as follows 5d c l aw jan d jtd aw feb d ftd 2 wa f where c l is the level of conflict aw jan is the water availability in january aw feb is the water availability in february d jtd is the estimated demand in january d ftd is the estimated demand in february and wa f is the dry season water availability factor 3 results the overall results show that land use dynamics population dynamics and catchment economic dynamics are key historical dynamics that may have contributed to the reduction in the lowland streamflow socio hydrological model simulations show a gradual increase in wet season flows and a continuous decrease in dry season flows fig 6 a c e and 6 b d f respectively a noticeable drop in the dry season net flows was simulated for the midland and lowland zones especially for the month of february where no flows are observed beginning in 1998 fig 6 d and 6 f validation of the socio hydrological simulations involved an expert judgment validation approach through community and stakeholder discussions to determine whether the model simulations and trends align with the observed historical patterns in the study site the community and stakeholders agreed with most of the socio hydrological results presented in this study a stronger agreement was observed with the results on the streamflow patterns i e decreasing dry season flows increasing wet season flows especially since the model predicted zero dry season flows for the month of february beginning in 1998 99 agreements were also observed on the results of increasing water related conflicts increasing river water abstractions especially in the midland zone and population dynamics the stakeholders were observed to have less opinion on the link between the level of awareness of environmental degradation and profitability levels as presented in this study the common agreement was that community members have maximum awareness of hydrological extremities but individual interests in profitability only override and do not reduce diffuse the level of awareness the expert judgment validation approach was therefore considered important in verifying the key results of this study with the lack of observed streamflow data at the selected outlet point of this study we further analyzed available streamflow data at points b and c in fig 2 and compared with the streamflow trends in our simulation to the existing publications fig b 1 this was mainly used as a check of the general streamflow patterns and should not be viewed as a direct validation of the streamflow results the simulated trends of increasing wet season flow and decreasing dry season flows can be confirmed by the observed streamflow data as illustrated in fig b 1 a b the observed daily river staff gauge readings also confirm a declining pattern between july 2019 and february 2022 fig b 1 c observed data by ngigi et al 2008 shows a declining pattern of annual streamflow data of up to 30 between 1960 and 2002 at the main outlet of the upper ewaso ng iro i e at archer s post outlet point a in fig 2 and fig b 1 d despite low rainfall in the month of february table a 2 this study reveals increasing water abstraction trends during the dry seasons fig 7 shows simulated net streamflow and estimated water abstractions in the month of february these trends are especially evident in the midland zones where the estimated total water demand grew enormously leading to zero streamflow to the lowland zones beginning in 1998 to understand the key socio hydrological dynamics contributing to the streamflow changes in the dry season a correlational analysis was performed based on selected variables against net flows in the dry seasons table c 1 the month of february was selected to represent dry season conditions there is a high negative correlation between land use dynamics particularly increasing cropland area and the reduced flows in the month of february in both the upland and midland zones however the changes in the area under traditional crops revealed a weak positive correlation with the reduced dry season flows in the upland zone population dynamics reveal a stronger negative correlation especially in the upland zone economics is a major factor both in the upland and midland zones especially changes in the profits earned from selling commercial crops there is also a strong negative correlation between the level of community conflicts and the dry season flows a clear negative correlation was observed between the water abstractions and the dry season flows the major land use changes include an increase in agricultural land forest cover bushland areas bareland and built up areas and a decreasing pattern in grassland areas table a 2 the land use dynamics have a direct impact on the water resources sustainability factor fig 8 a the land use changes are attributed to the growing human population fig 8 b and favorable catchment economics especially in the period between 1980 and 2000 fig 8 c these dynamics affect the catchment hydrology and it was observed that beginning in 1998 the dry season water availability dropped to zero in february in the midland zone hence no streamflow to the lowland zones fig 8 d the decreasing dry season flows increased the conflicts to maximum levels in the study site within the simulation period the water related conflicts between the lowland communities and midland communities are observed to remain relatively high the midland upland water related conflicts increased from approximately 20 in the 1980 s to maximum levels by the year 2001 fig 8 e the level of awareness of environmental degradation was observed to reduce with increasing profitability levels as reflected in fig 8 f this trend however changes beginning in 2001 when there is a decline in both the dry season water availability and profitability a slight increase in the level of environmental degradation awareness is simulated towards 2020 this indicates the importance of community sensitivity to hydrological and economic dynamics with the finding that humans influence water availability in the study site further analysis was carried out to assess the effects of the human population on dry season water availability the human population was varied whereby the population growth rate was assumed to be zero hence constant human population during the simulation period a constant human growth rate revealed no expansion of cropland in the river zone a zone where excessive river water abstractions take place this means with a constant human population there would be no sharp increase in river water abstractions as is the case with an actual human population growth rate therefore the human population pressure on the social hydrological system can explain the water deficits experienced during the dry season despite the increasing rainfall pattern assuming no human population growth in the study site considerable volumes of water would be available during all dry season months figs 9 and 10 on the contrary with an actual human population growth rate a clear decreasing pattern of water availability is observed across the decades with february recording zero volumes of water between 2000 and 2020 the difference between the naturalized flow and the simulated monthly flow with zero population growth rate reveals the impact humans have on water availability the results of this study illustrate that on average about 5 3 million cubic meters are lost during each dry month when the population growth rate is held constant this translates to dry season water loss of about 47 5 cubic meters per capita per month fig 10 shows that with increasing human population numbers there is a clear trend in the increase in the amount of water taken out during the dry months with january and february recording maximum reductions 100 in the 2010 2020 decade this emphasizes the major role humans play in the hydrological cycle of a catchment and the dry season water availability may only become more extreme under increasing human population pressure 4 discussion 4 1 the dynamics linked to the decreasing streamflow this study aimed to assess the historical human water interplays to understand the coevolution of hydrological systems and societal development and their impacts on water availability in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment despite the pattern of increasing amounts of rainfall within the simulation period both the observed and simulated streamflow reveal a decreasing pattern in the upland lowland gradient the land use dynamics population dynamics and catchment economic dynamics were identified as key historical dynamics that may have contributed to the reduction in the lowland streamflow the noticeable social development pressure is the increasing water abstractions in response to the growing water demand for both bulging populations and agricultural expansion these results align with other studies that have reported that high population growth combined with resultant changes in land use cover changes have a more significant driving force in affecting water availability than climate changes okello et al 2015 the decreasing trends in the streamflow against an increasing rainfall pattern is an important finding that emphasizes the need to account for societal development aspects in all hydrological studies the results of this study align with recommendations that the physical processes require integration with social dynamics for a comprehensive understanding of hydrological dynamics di baldassarre et al 2014 defries and eshleman 2004 van loon 2015 sivapalan et al 2012 the strength of this study is its prospective design of a socio hydrological conceptual model that adopts a parameterization based on literature reviews and preliminary analyses the preliminary analyses allowed coming up with specific rates to be included in the equations e g rate of annual population growth rate rate of land use changes etc an expert judgment validation approach was accomplished through community and stakeholder discussions to determine whether the model simulations and trends align with the observed historical patterns in the study site with a lack of real system data this type of validation that involves expert judgment is paramount eker et al 2018 schwanitz 2013 we are therefore confident that the conceptualization and the observed results in this study are representative of system behavior 4 2 the model results versus historical perspectives the socio hydrological model in this study is able to simulate human water dynamics that reflect the historical experiences within the study site an obvious historical observation is on the streamflow which was simulated to drop to minimum levels beginning in 1998 based on community discussions and previous publications aeschbacher et al 2005 ngigi et al 2007 orendo 2000 the trend of declining streamflow within the study period dropped to minimum levels around 1998 to the 2000 s zero streamflow have been reported in the month of february in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment de leeuw et al 2012 mutiga et al 2010 the rise of competition for scarce water resources and water related conflicts and the need for water resources users associations wruas manifested towards the end of the 1990 s the mimicking of near reality shows the strength of the socio hydrological model which can be used as a precursory tool to increase an understanding of the socio hydrological system in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment within the simulation period our results show that the wet season flows increased by 10 4 in the upland and 14 8 in the midland zones after which equilibrium is attained aeschbacher et al 2005 opined that if the savannah i e midland zone and upland zone were to be completely converted into agricultural lands the wet season flows would increase by a maximum of 16 the dry season flows are simulated to drop to zero levels especially in the month of february the results further reveal that the decreasing dry season flows increase the likelihood of conflicts to maximum levels this explains the high level of water related conflicts observed during dry seasons in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment gichuki 2006 liniger et al 2005 mutiga et al 2010 the conflicts are mainly reported between agriculturalists pastoralists and urban dwellers kiteme 2020 mutiga et al 2010 moreover catchment economics play a key role in reducing the willingness of the communities to engage regardless of the levels of environmental degradation community discussions revealed that as long as there are no negative impacts on economic gains humans are likely to continue with their normal behavior for instance excessive river water abstractions despite the reduced dry season flows however the level of awareness of environmental degradation changes considerably when catchment economics are negatively impacted preferences for a convenient life for instance focus on good economic returns have been identified as key limiting factors in promoting pro environmental behaviors iizuka 2000 wang et al 2020 contrary to the previous findings that portable pumps abstracted less water due to their perceived small capacity notter 2003 this study reveals that portable pumps abstract substantively more water than previously understood this is mainly because of the excessive use and the entropic nature of the usage of these pumps especially with the observation that more water is drawn from the rivers than the actual crop water requirements the steep climatic gradients that change within relatively short distances in the study area influence the water balance in the selected study area this is a result of increasing atmospheric demand and decreasing rainfall as you move to lowland areas wamucii et al 2021 this means the growth in the human population and expansion of agricultural land easily stretch into fragile and marginal areas in the middle zone areas skewing the water demands and availability for instance agricultural lands in the midland zone require more irrigation water per unit area compared to agricultural lands in the humid upland zone we argue that the socio hydrological dynamics would have been different for catchments where there are no steep climatic gradients or where agroecological zones are located far apart 4 3 the validation of the socio hydrological model a conceptual socio hydrological framework can help create an understanding of the hydrological processes in the past and guide in exploring future scenarios however one of the challenges in socio hydrological modeling is the validation of the model components srinivasan et al 2017 troy et al 2015a there is no formal calibration validation protocol for socio hydrological modeling blair and buytaert 2016 this challenge however can be bridged by the use of empirical studies to justify or derive model equations and parameters troy et al 2015b other studies have used socio centric approaches e g analyzing newspaper contents to verify and validate model variables roobavannan et al 2018 in this study we carried out a detailed literature review on relevant past publications on the upper ewaso ng iro catchment five model components that explain the co evolution were selected based on the literature review preliminary analyses e g land use cover changes streamflow patterns population growth rates etc were carried out to guide the parameterization of the model components the model simulation results and assumptions were subjected to community discussions and key informants stakeholders in the selected study site this in a way validates the model components and ensures a representation of variables of interest as suggested by melsen et al 2018 the socio hydrological framework adopted in this study was able to mimic that the water related crisis began around 1998 99 in the study area this concurs with the community s historical perspectives and documented evidence of frequent water related conflicts beginning 2000s hirji 2000 kiteme 2020 additionally the water resources users associations wruas started as local group associations meant to deal with the rising competition of scarce water resources and water related conflicts beginning in 1998 99 based on wrua records before they were formally accepted as part of government policies by the kenya water act of 2002 4 4 study limitations that said uncertainties may exist that can skew the results and their implications for instance the socio hydrological model focussed on the small scale farmers who are the majority in the study area hence not accounting for the role of large scale farming based on available historical data the study concentrated on surface water while leaving out the groundwater component for instance commercial farms have boreholes and there are also wells in some of the households in the study area the hydrological impacts of groundwater extraction use were not accounted for in the coupling of human and water systems which could have inclined the study results the conceptualized model used long term rainfall estimations hence static monthly rainfalls which resulted in the smooth lines actual daily rainfall patterns would have resulted in waves common in hydrographs the study also assumed that water abstracted from the river network is used within the selected study site and did not account for water siphoned out of the catchment if any data on water transfers were not available and further studies including detailed abstraction surveys are needed to establish water taken out if any away from the selected study site in the analysis of land use cover changes independent satellite images from the different platforms of landsat and sentinel 2 were used these two platforms have different resolutions of 30 m and 10 m respectively better accuracy in land use cover detections is however achieved in sentinel 2 compared to landsat platforms lima et al 2019 song et al 2021 the water related conflicts were formulated based on water availability in the study area and did not account for other factors that can ignite community conflicts such as land available for grazing politics cultural differences etc there is pressure from both the need for agricultural land and the increasing protected area under fencing by the increasing number of conservancy organizations in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment this reduces access to key grazing areas in the midland and lowland areas a unique type of conflict commonly referred to as grazing invasion pellis et al 2018 has been reported where the pastoralist communities forcefully enter into the conservancies during the dry season in search of pasture and water the impact of wildlife conservancies and commercial ranches in the upper ewaso ng iro in reducing grazing land areas and their contribution to community conflicts have already been documented mureithi et al 2016 pellis et al 2018 yurco 2017 the validation with communities although an innovative procedure for data scarce regions relies heavily on the ability of humans to remember their history which can skew certain components and parameters in the model despite the above uncertainties the results in this study generally reveal important insights that can shape the focus of sustainable water resources management especially for water scarce regions such as east africa river basin organizations rbos such as wruas in the case study area may play a key role in supporting conservation efforts but face challenges in ensuring sustainable streamflow this is attributed to the complex coevolution of human and water systems out pacing the ability of rbos to manage water resources for instance in the case study area water related conflicts have been reported to increase every year despite the presence of wruas in the case study area kiteme 2020 ngigi et al 2007 notter et al 2007 moreover the reduction in lowland streamflow despite an increasing trend in rainfall emphasizes the direct role humans have on catchment water availability complexity intensifies with the growing human population that leads to direct impacts e g increased river water abstractions and indirect impacts e g land transformations that affect water sustainability assuming similar socio hydrological system dynamics in the water scarce region of east africa there is a need for alternative approaches in water resources governance and management 4 5 implications for water resources governance and management one recommendation for catchments similar to upper ewaso ng iro especially for tropical catchments experiencing orographic rainfall is for improved land management practices in the context of socio hydrological dynamics observed in this study this can help mitigate the low baseflows that are increasingly being experienced during the dry seasons based on our results we argue that the increasing trend of conversion of perennial vegetation into agricultural land is not likely to reverse given the direct and indirect impacts of the growing human pressure in a catchment conversion of perennial vegetation to seasonal crops may not always be negative given that this type of conversion can reduce actual evapotranspiration from a given location schilling et al 2008 schilling and libra 2003 zhang and schilling 2006 reduced water loss through evapotranspiration may be an important hydrological factor especially for water scarce regions such as east africa therefore we argue that the adoption of land conservation activities that can reduce heavy runoff during wet seasons and retain more water through infiltration may be an opportunity to increase baseflows in the context of land use cover changes where most of the natural vegetation has been converted to agricultural lands percolation pits for instance may help reduce the resultant high surface runoff and consequently increase base flows during dry seasons akale et al 2019 veeranna and jeet 2021 water related conflicts are likely to intensify in the future there is a need to shift the focus of water resources governance and management from the sustainable natural flows perspective to the volume of water retained during wet seasons perspective therefore the important question for water scarce regions should be what amount of water is retained during the wet season that can sustain the growing water demand i e of the growing population and agricultural activities in the dry season during the transect walks in the case study area it was observed that the natural water pools fig 10 are the most important sources of water for domestic use irrigation and livestock including wildlife when the rivers are completely dry in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment the natural water pools are sections along the rivers with moderate to deep holes that store water when the rivers are flowing we argue that relying on natural water flows is not a sustainable approach and alternative approaches that integrate water harvesting and storage are needed including natural man made water pools check dams along the rivers water pans household water harvesting etc the river basin organization s concept is an important aspect of water resources management but there is a need to match their abilities with the complex socio hydrological dynamics for instance in the study site the portable pumps need to be registered with wruas this will help in estimating the total amount of water abstracted through direct pumping and help wruas to update their regulations and rationing programs and also help to quantify the amount of water abstracted the profiling of all land within a pre defined buffer zone as used in this study would be a key data point for wruas to increase the efficiency of water management and governance at the local level additionally due to the randomness and entropic usage of portable pumps it would be important for wruas to include in their rationing program the standard capacity for allowable portable pumps and the maximum number of hours a household is allowed to pump water from the rivers during dry seasons alternatively develop measures that will ensure no direct pumping of water from the rivers during dry seasons this would promote water harvesting during rainy seasons such that the pumping during dry seasons is only from the water storage e g man made or natural water pools small earth dams water pans etc this can increase efficiency especially among the irrigators who use visual satisfaction rather than the crop water requirements however for the above recommendations to take shape as wiesmann et al 2000 and laan et al 2021 suggested a need to bring all stakeholders together for collective understanding and especially to recognize that water is a shared resource this is important given the differences in cultures livelihoods and varying water needs and perspectives between upland and lowland communities this can be accomplished by increasing awareness and more informed collective decision making among different stakeholders e g through social learning approaches this can be achieved by adopting alternative participatory approaches such as serious gaming rodela et al 2019 speelman et al 2014 2019 5 conclusions this study explored historical human water interplays to understand the coevolution of hydrological systems and societal development and their impacts on the upper ewaso ng iro catchment this is especially in the context of declining streamflow in the catchment despite the pattern of increasing amounts of rainfall in the east african region the results show that social development aspects such as population growth land use cover changes and economic dynamics are the dominant features that are likely to have contributed to the changes in the lowland streamflow and consequently to water related conflicts humans have a direct role in catchment hydrology and therefore social dynamics are important aspects that need to be accounted for in all hydrological studies especially the integration of human components in the calibration and validation of the hydrological models the high correlations observed between water abstractions and the net flows are a strong indicator of the anti pro environmental behavior of stakeholders within a catchment however this study observed that human behavior is likely to change when household economics are negatively affected when communities begin to pay attention to environmental degradation by mimicking near reality a socio hydrological model can be helpful as a precursory tool to increase an understanding of how the system works the observed patterns in this study e g increasing wet season flows declining dry season flows increasing cropland areas at the expense of other land covers and increasing human population send a signal that the future is only likely to worsen and alternative solutions are indispensable especially for water scarce regions such as east africa this study observes that an increasing trend of rainfall in the east africa region does not translate to water sustainability in the case study area due to evolving human water interactions hence there is a need to shift the focus from the sustainable natural flows perspective to the amount water stored during wet seasons perspective this will reduce lowland upland conflicts and eventually lead to sustainability in the catchments especially when the water storage of a catchment matches the dry season water demands another recommendation is the adoption of land conservation activities that would promote runoff infiltration to improve baseflows since reversing the cropland expansion against a growing population may not be feasible there is also a need to bring all stakeholders together for collective understanding and especially to recognize that water is a shared resource funding this research was made possible by wageningen university through the

appendices a parameterization and validation of the socio hydrological model components parameterization of catchment hydrology component the hydrology component in this study is geared toward mimicking the historical streamflow observed in the lowland zone the streamflow in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment has been reported to have decreased by about 30 since 1960 aeschbacher et al 2005 ngigi et al 2007 this is linked to direct river water abstractions in the upland zone orendo 2000 since there is no significant decline in rainfall in the catchment aeschbacher et al 2005 moreover there is an increasing trend of rainfall in the east african forested water towers wamucii et al 2021 mt kenya water maintains higher rainfall conditions with relatively lower atmospheric energy thus generating runoff for the drier lowland areas fig a1 a c conceptualization of the generic water balance with the above understanding it is therefore necessary to conceptualize a water balance that takes into account the four zones i e forest upland midland and lowland zones hence the total streamflow for the study area consists of the sum of the net contributions of the different zones net flow inflow from the forested water tower net inflow from the upland zone net inflow from the midland zone net inflow from the lowland zone understanding the water appropriation for detailed water balance estimations based on community discussions and transect walks the appropriation of water resources in the study site is mainly for agriculture household consumption and livestock production agricultural activities are located in the upland and midland zones livestock production i e pastoralism is a key activity in the lowland zone we established that water use in the study site is structured around six different categories 1 community water projects 2 institutions e g hotels schools hospitals etc 3 riparian landowners 4 non riparian landowners 5 commercial farms and 6 illegal water abstractions fig a2 a illegal water abstractions are aggregated into one category i e water that cannot be accounted for however it is paramount to mention that illegal water abstraction can occur in any of the five categories mentioned above the major type of abstraction is the river water abstractions which are concentrated in the uplands i e inside the forested water tower and the upland zones fig a2 b gravity water intake pipes are used for community water projects institutions and commercial farms direct pumping of river water using portable pumps is a common practice for riparian landowners community discussions reported that illegal water abstractions have proliferated in the study site due usage of portable pumps non riparian landowners if not connected through community water projects may use water tankers to fetch water directly from the rivers based on community and stakeholder discussions community water projects and riparian landowners account for over 90 of total water abstracted it was established that within the selected study area there were a total of 188 gravity flow water intakes as of 2020 table a1 about 60 of gravity flow water intakes are located inside the mt kenya water tower and 40 in the upland zone however the actual number of total water abstractions may be higher and a detailed census type of survey is needed to establish the actual total water abstractions including all types of abstractions such as direct from streams rivers furrows springs boreholes dams pans shallow wells etc the number of gravity flow water intakes rarely changes over time due to strict regulations and controls exercised by wruas most of the water intakes have an average pipe size of 4 in 100 mm with a capacity to abstract 1000 m3 every 24 h the capacity of the common portable water pumps used by small scale farmers varies from 5 to 24 horsepower hp it is difficult to quantify the actual amount of water abstracted through portable pumps due to the entropic usage of the pumps for instance since most pumps are not registered with wruas most of the water pumping happens in utmost secrecy e g at night over the weekends holidays etc some households have more than one pump and it is not possible to tell at what time all pumps may be used to abstract water from the rivers the time for running these pumps is dependent on the household affordability of fuel and running time varies from 2 h to 24 h per day there is also randomness in the amount of water used on farmland this is dependent on visual satisfaction rather than the crop water requirements plates 1 and 2 shows a farmer irrigating his land planted with young seedlings of tomatoes the tomatoes are planted on sunken beds commonly known as jaruba sinks the farmers pour water directly pumped from the river into these sinks up to the satisfaction level e g when the sinks are full based on community discussions and transect walks we used agricultural land dynamics to estimate the quantity of water directly pumped from the river although this type of quantification does not give the actual volume of water abstracted it depicts a realistic quantification of water abstracted using pumps intensive irrigation activities are concentrated in the midland zone where irrigation takes place both in wet and dry seasons in the upland zone moderate irrigation activities are observed only during dry seasons we established that the expansion of agricultural land near the river course was driven by the perceived availability of river water most of the water pumping takes place up to a distance of 800 m from the river course hence the area under agriculture within a buffer of 600 m was used to give a realistic picture of water abstractions along the river course notter 2003 reported that in the savannah zone i e the midland zone a pump can be found almost every 100 m along the river line we assumed that 60 of agricultural land within the 600 m buffer zone is under irrigation in the midland zone during dry seasons while only 20 of agricultural land within the buffer zone in the upland zone is irrigated during dry seasons community discussions confirmed that during dry seasons a 2 acre farm in the midland zone would require a 13 hp portable pump running for an average of 10 h per day with an estimated capacity of 1000 liters per minute this is repeated every 3 4 days in the midland zone in the upland zone a 2 acre farm would require a 7 5 hp portable pump running for an average of 7 h per day with an estimated capacity of 600 liters per minute this is repeated once a week in the upland zone the land use cover analyses revealed that in 1985 the agricultural area within a buffer zone of 600 m was approximately 8290 and 2437 acres in the upland and midland zones respectively fig a3 this increased to 21 224 and 20 367 acres respectively in 2016 this indicates that within the 600 m of the river course the agricultural land increases annually by approximately 417 acres in the upland and 578 acres in the midland zones rainwater harvesting e g roof runoff flood flow storage was not factored in this study as it was established through community discussions that rainwater harvesting is not a common practice in the catchment a similar observation was also reported adf 2005 that there is minimal floodwater storage in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment with the above additional information the water balance was refined to take into account estimated water abstractions in each of the four zones the estimation of water abstractions total abstractions in each zone sum of the permanent water intake projects the estimated direct pumping from the river network forest zone forest zone net inflow runoff estimations from mt kenya water tower estimated total water abstractions within the forested water tower upland zone net flow in the upland zone the inflow from the water tower to the upland zone the upland internal runoff generation the estimated total water abstractions in the upland zone midland zone net flow in the midland zone inflow from the upland zone the midland internal runoff generation the estimated total water abstractions in the midland zone lowland zone net flow in the lowland zone inflow from the midland zone the lowland internal runoff generation the estimated total water abstractions in the lowland zone the runoff coefficients i e the percentage of rainfall that represents runoff were estimated from the long term values of precipitation gathered from the chirps database funk et al 2015 and the long term runoff estimations from the global runoff data centre fekete et al 2002 wamucii et al 2021 the runoff coefficients used in this study are 41 in the mt kenya water tower 24 in the upland zone 20 in the midland zone and 18 in the lowland zone table a2 parameterization of land use dynamics component the upper ewaso ng iro catchment has undergone drastic land use land cover changes over the years gichuki 2006 lanari et al 2018 mungai et al 2004 mutiga et al 2010 ngigi et al 2007 large scale ranching small scale farming and large scale horticultural enterprises transformed the upper slopes of the catchment lanari et al 2018 major water users in the upper reaches include small scale farmers and medium and large scale commercial horticulture farms that produce flowers and vegetables for export using perennial irrigation schemes the horticultural farms first appeared in the region in 1991 and gradually became powerful stakeholders that compete with small scale farmers and urban centers over seasonally scarce water increasing the potential for conflict lanari et al 2018 in the early years of the 1970 s 1980 s rainfed agricultural activities were mainly concentrated in the upland zone areas where much of the forest was cleared at the expense of agricultural lands notter 2003 the savannah midland zone was characterized by open grasslands alternating with shrubs bushland areas a zone that was mainly used for ranches and grazing areas in the 1970 s 1980 s in recent years the expansion of irrigated agricultural activities has been observed in the savannah zone principally cropland areas have been increasing over the years at the expense of other important land covers such as forest grassland bushland areas etc results presented by mutiga et al 2011 show that in the entire upper ewaso ng iro catchment between 1987 and 2003 cropland areas increased from 12 to 24 forest cover decreased from 30 to 23 grassland areas decreased from 21 to 18 bushland areas decreased from 19 to 8 among other land use cover changes the land use dynamics in this study focused on land use cover lulc changes in the catchment between the 1980 s and 2020 s landsat 5 tm satellite image of 1985 was downloaded from usgs 2019 and analyzed to represent land use cover conditions for the first period of 1980 1990 the kenya sentinel 2 land use land cover of 2016 was downloaded from rcmrd geoportal 2017 to represent land use cover conditions for the last period of 2010 2020 the land use cover analysis revealed major changes in agricultural land and grassland areas fig a4 agricultural land increased from 9 0 in 1985 to 27 6 in 2016 and grassland areas decreased from 40 7 in 1985 to 10 8 in 2016 overall there was a slight increase in tree cover bushland and bareland areas built up areas increased from 0 8 in 1985 to 1 4 in 2016 an interesting observation is the increasing tree cover outside the boundary of the water tower within the upland zone however within the water tower itself there was a slight decrease in the area under tree cover as shown in table a3 the results of increasing tree cover and bushland areas despite pressures from the human population can be attributed to the national government conservation efforts the existence of wruas that promote conservation at the local level and the growth of conservancy organizations that promote fencing in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment nevertheless there was a slight decrease in tree cover inside the mt kenya water tower which can be attributed to the increasing annual forest fires gikandi 2022 poletti et al 2019 this further indicates the presence of human activities inside the forested water towers as opined in wamucii et al 2021 the changes in agricultural land were concentrated in the upland and midland zones within the water tower the noticeable changes are increasing grassland and bareland areas decreasing bushland areas and a slight decrease in tree cover built up areas are also observed in the upland and midland areas interestingly bushland areas were observed to increase in the midland and lowland areas at the expense of grassland and bareland areas with the above understanding it was necessary to come up with a formulation that would link the land use changes and water resource availability hence we formulated a parameter that estimates the streamflow sustainability factor as a result of changes in land use dynamics since the area under cropland was the dominant change in the study site the cropland area was used as the denominator to derive the streamflow sustainability factor as other types of land use changed this means the streamflow sustainability factor will reduce with an increase in cropland areas and vice versa parameterization of population dynamics component with a growth rate estimated at 5 6 per annum the population in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment increased from 50 000 in 1960 to about 500 000 in 2000 ngigi et al 2007 based on 2019 census data the population densities varied from 800 persons per square kilometer in the upland zone to less than 24 persons per square kilometer in the lowland areas the growth in population increases the pressure on land and water resources ericksen et al 2011 kiteme 2020 providoli et al 2019 the population datasets were sourced from worldpop and verified with data from the kenya national bureau of statistics knbs worldpop is an organization that develops high resolution gridded data on population dynamics spanning the year 2000 to the present worldpop 2020 the population densities are based on specific countries population census data at a ground resolution of 100 m stevens et al 2015 the population densities for earlier years i e between 1980 and 2000 were estimated retrogressively based on annual growth rates figure a 5 shows that the population in the selected study area is concentrated in the upper reaches of the catchment the population grew from 193 573 persons in 2000 to approximately 334 405 persons in 2020 the population in the midland zone almost doubled 98 between 2000 and 2020 fig a 5 the population numbers were used to estimate the household level water demand and drive the potential per capita income in the catchment economics component population pressure factor was also constructed to drive the elements such as the expansion of agricultural land and related water abstractions along the river line putri et al 2019 used a similar concept of population pressure to look at population pressure on land and agricultural productivity parameterization of catchment economics component the catchment economics were calculated based on the dominant crops both traditional and commercial crops among small scale farmers who are the majority in the upland midland zones livestock keeping is a major economic activity in the lowland zone maize and potato are the major crops in the upper ewaso ng iro catchment kuil et al 2018 and were selected to represent traditional crops in the model the short term commercial crops are meant for export markets the two major commercial crops selected for this study were french beans and snow peas there is a growing demand for commercial crops due to the ready market facilitated by the growing number of export companies within the catchment the export companies and horticultural farms engage small scale farmers through buy back models contractual farming this has led to a shift from traditional rainfed agriculture to ever present farming activities both in the wet and dry seasons the majority of small scale farmers were also reported to have shifted from traditional crops such as maize and potato farming and ventured into short term crops for exports such as french beans and snow peas the demand for short term crops is believed to have contributed to behavioral changes toward excessive abstractions of water for irrigation purposes with reports of up to 95 of dry season water resources being abstracted from the upland and midland zones laikipia forum 2020 mkewp 2017 orendo 2000 reported that in the dry season when demand for irrigation is highest 60 80 of available water in the upper reaches is abstracted with 40 80 of it being unauthorized generally water abstractions are estimated at 20 of streamflow in the wet seasons and over 70 in the dry seasons ngigi et al 2007 with this understanding we came up with a parameterization that integrates traditional crops and commercial crops the catchment economics in the agricultural areas i e upland and midland zones were expressed as a summation of gross profits of traditional and short term commercial crops the livestock production gross profits were used to estimate economics in the lowland zone the key parameters considered for estimating economics in the upland and midland zone include the total gross profits gross from traditional crops gross from commercial crops gross profit commercial or traditional crops a multiplication between market price per unit and total crop yield in the lowland the livestock income was estimated as follows assuming an annual offtake rate of 30 for the livestock total gross profits in the lowland a multiplication between the total number of animals sheep goat and cattle sold per year and the market price per animal sheep goat and cattle the potential income was also affected by the growing human population the income per capita estimated income number of the human population parameterization of community sensitivity component community sensitivity logic has been used in socio hydrological modeling and represents an indicator of the community s socio economic and environmental values elshafei et al 2014 2015 van emmerik et al 2014 sivapalan and blöschl 2015 for instance elshafei et al 2015 used a composite socio economic sensitivity driving variable to capture the degree of a perceived threat to a community s quality of life van emmerik et al 2014 used the environmental awareness equation to track the dynamics of community sensitivity to the degradation of riparian wetlands in essence community sensitivity determines the degree and direction of the overall impetus for action in determining community sensitivity levels understanding the values and preferences of the communities is paramount values and preferences vary with time and space and they are important in river basins where upland and lowland communities are linked through water flow in the river network sivapalan and blöschl 2015 we assume that a high community sensitivity would invoke a behavioral response toward enviro centric management decisions e g a reduction in water abstractions land reclamation water metering etc if community sensitivity is low the patterns of the aggressive exploitation of available land resources to suit economic needs would manifest in the socio hydrological system in this study profitability and dry season water availability factors were formulated to trigger the levels of environmental degradation awareness factors in the study site the changes in the levels of environmental degradation awareness will then determine key actions by the communities such as the rate of water abstractions increasing cropland areas to maximize potential returns investing in water storage and immigrating in search of water among other decisions water related conflicts emerge due to different decisions in the upland lowland gradient during the community discussions it was observed that there is a blame game of persons in the uplands as the problem while very few pay attention to the impact of their activities this results in a situation where the lowland communities perceive the midland upland communities as the problem and the midland communities on the other hand perceive the upland communities as the problem interestingly the majority of the upland communities do not think that they have anything to do with the water related problems experienced in the lowland zone fig a 6 similarly wiesmann et al 2000 noted that the upland communities lack awareness of the magnitude of lowland effects caused by their land use decisions incomes are the priority and as long as there are substantial incomes very few will bother with the water related problems experienced in the lowland zone land conservation and water harvesting are not a priority in the upland zone the majority believe conservation and water harvesting are difficult and expensive and they do not have the relevant skills required fig a6 however there is a willingness to participate in land conservation and water harvesting activities in the future but with no clarity on when this can happen as dry season water availability reduces an increase in the level of environmental degradation awareness is likely to manifest in the socio hydrological system however this awareness will diffuse with perceptions of high profits mainly from short term commercial crops grown during dry seasons and ready markets within the catchment hence small scale farmers will explore different options including expanding cropland area by clearing important land covers such as tree cover bushland grassland etc reducing areas under traditional crops in exchange for commercial crops aggressive water abstractions including illegal water abstractions among other decisions all these actions will manifest in the socio hydrological system as farmers adopt new ways to exploit the high profits despite the changing hydrological conditions with the above background the following considerations were made 1 the level of environmental degradation awareness as a function of dry season water availability and profitability 2 the dry season water availability factor is calculated as average conditions for january and february i e the driest months in the study area this is based on available water after accounting for water abstractions condition i as dry season water availability reduces i e approaching 0 then the level of environmental degradation awareness increases 1 however communities are majorly after profit making especially from short term commercial crops hence the level of degradation awareness will be diffused by the profitability factor in the socio hydrological system 2 the profitability factor was formulated as a function of annual economic gain per household condition ii if the profitability factor is high i e approaching 1 then the environmental degradation awareness level reduces and farmers ignore hydrological conditions and invest more to exploit the economic opportunities condition iii if the profitability factor is high and short term commercial profits are higher than profits from traditional crops then farmers will increase the area under commercial crops and reduce the area under traditional crops condition iv investing more in short term commercial crops increases the rate of water abstraction in the socio hydrological system condition v prevailing profits will also influence small scale farmers decision to expand the area under cropland by clearing important land covers such as tree cover bushland grassland etc 1 the water related will manifest as communities in the upland midland and lowland evolve and adapt to the changing ecosystems 2 the emergence of conflicts was formulated as a function of water availability in the months of january and february the estimated water demands in the two months and the dry season water availability factor b the

since it was established in 1907 all park visitors and some members from the surrounding community rely on this water source in the gallup sandstone aquifer advances in unconventional hydrocarbon extraction techniques including hydrofracking hf have increased the potential for hydrocarbon extraction within the san juan basin and many other locations in the u s a u s energy information administration 2015 furthermore in the last decade a rapid increase in hydrocarbon extraction in the san juan basin near ccnhp has targeted the gallup sandstone mancos shale and the surrounding units figs 1 and 2 engler et al 2015 kelley et al 2014 the 30 60 m thick gallup sandstone stone et al 1983 is stratigraphically between thick confining sequences of the lower permeability mancos shale fig 2

sandstone gallup sandstone mancos shale and morrison formation figs 2 and 3 this scenario whereby the drinking water aquifer is at the same depth as targeted hydrocarbons is likely unique in general drinking water aquifers are shallow near surface aquifers while hydrocarbon bearing units are hundreds or thousands of meters below land surface meng and ashby 2014 hence the chaco well may be more vulnerable to contamination from hydrocarbon extraction activities than many other locations during hf hydraulic fracturing fluid hff is injected into a low permeability petroleum reservoir such as shale under high pressure this fractures the rock formation horizontally and vertically increasing permeability by orders of magnitude and mobilizing fluids such as natural gas and oil which are induced to flow to a well where they are extracted hf at a single site can be economically viable for decades and a single well can undergo hf multiple times over its life cycle clark et al 2013 the process is extremely water intensive routinely requiring 4 16 million gallons of water per well clark et al 2013 following hf between 5 and 300 of the initial hff volume returns to the surface as flowback water also called produced water this produced water may be reinjected for hf or disposed of through deep well injection wastewater treatment facilities storage in ponds or released onto the ground surface or into surface waters clark et al 2013 gallegos and varela 2015 hff is a mixture of water proppants used to maintain fractures and additives to enhance production such as lubricants

waters varies between brines and formations and is controlled by many factors ideally when assessing whether groundwater is mixed with produced waters the composition of both end members is known an additional concern is the existence of fast flow pathways between geologic units created by the presence of uncased boreholes distributed around the san juan basin many of which were used for oil and gas exploration lacombe et al 1995 these boreholes as well as improperly cased or plugged boreholes have the potential to transmit fluids and gases from geologic units with high hydrostatic pressure to units with lower hydrostatic pressure perra 2021 the rate at which this short circuiting flow occurs depends on the hydrostatic pressure differences and the transmissivities of the geologic units or short circuit pathway short circuit fluid flow is potentially an important source of fluid migration in the region as there are many inactive oil and gas wells in the san juan basin figs 1 and 3 the potential for contamination from hydrocarbon extraction activities to ccnhp is largely unknown due to the lack of knowledge of groundwater flow direction geochemical evolution flow velocity and mixing between aquifers additionally baseline water chemistry in relevant aquifers has not been defined and contamination from hff and produced waters has not been assessed the objectives of this work were to complete a geochemical sampling campaign at wells within and outside of ccnhp to determine baseline water chemistry assess mixing between aquifers determine groundwater flow directions and to evaluate whether groundwater has been contaminated or could become contaminated from nearby hydrocarbon extraction activities geochemical constituents measured include major ions noble gases and isotope systems including strontium 87sr 86sr deuterium δ2h and oxygen δ18o in water and the dissolved inorganic carbon isotopes δ13c and 14c we also measured volatile organic carbon voc compounds

cliff house sandstone fig 2 the gallup sandstone is surrounded by the mancos shale and consists of sandstone shale and coal the chaco well is located near the gallup sandstone s northern extent fig 1 the point lookout sandstone is stratigraphically above the mancos shale and is composed largely of sandstone the menefee formation in contrast is composed of interbedded shale sandstone and coal kelley et al 2014 stratigraphically above this the cliff house sandstone is largely composed of sandstone all units described above are known to contain oil or natural gas within the san juan basin brister and hoffman 2002 previous studies in the san juan basin found that groundwater in the morrison formation stratigraphically below the mancos shale fig 2 had too little 14c to effectively date concluding that groundwater likely recharged 52 000 years before present ybp dam 1995 past research has found that recharge to the gallup sandstone generally occurs where the unit crops out at the surface 55 km to the south of the chaco well fig 1 stone et al 1983 and that groundwater generally flows from the south to the north through the gallup sandstone kernodle 1996 however more recent groundwater withdrawals and hydrocarbon extraction across the san juan basin may have altered groundwater flow paths 2 2 field sample collection groundwater samples were collected for water chemistry analyses from 11 wells in 2019 and 2020 following u s geological survey protocols u s geological survey 2021 sites were sampled once except for wells 602 and 603 which were sampled three times for vocs where possible historical data pre 2019 is also presented from the u s geological survey national water information system nwis u s geological survey 2021 wells sampled were artesian discharging

through cell prior to sampling at each site table 2 total dissolved solids tds were estimated as the sum of dissolved major ion constituents groundwater was discharging at the surface at all sites prior to sampling either through windmill pump or artesian flow hence no purge volume was recorded sample bottles were filled following field parameter stabilization water samples were filtered

major cations trace elements and strontium isotope samples were preserved to ph 2 by adding ultrapure nitric acid voc samples were collected in triplicate 40 ml septum capped amber glass vials filled from the bottom using a high density polyethylene tube until no air bubbles or headspace remained and then acidified to ph 2 with 1 1 hcl h2o similarly carbon isotope samples were collected in 1 l glass bottles filled from the bottom and allowed to flush three bottle volumes before being capped with a polycone cap with no headspace tritium samples were collected in 1 l poly bottles following the same bottom filling procedure and cone cap as the carbon isotope samples noble gas samples were collected in copper tubes in duplicate back pressure was applied with a restrictor on the sample tubing past the copper tube to minimize bubble formation prior to sealing the samples with refrigerator clamps weiss 1968 field alkalinity was computed from titration data using the incremental equivalence method usgs 2021 all samples were kept below 4 c following sample collection water levels at windmill sites were measured after stopping the windmill for several hours until groundwater levels were stable at artesian sites water levels were measured using a pressure transducer 2 3 water chemistry analytical methods water samples were analyzed for major cations trace elements and

and δ13c were analyzed by the national ocean sciences accelerator mass spectrometry nosams at the woods hole oceanographic institution massachusetts using accelerator mass spectrometry to estimate the initial 14c present in these samples 14c we used the program netpathxl parkhurst and charlton 2008 han and plummer 2016 which calculates 14c using the fontes and garnier model han and plummer 2013 this model corrects for the effect of carbon exchange between dissolved inorganic carbon dic and solid carbonate and soil the major unknowns are the isotopic composition of solid carbonates and soil gas once 14c was estimated age was determined through eq 1 1 t 5730 l n 2 l n c d i c 14 c 14 where t is the groundwater age in years 5730 is the half life of 14c c d i c 14 is the pmc measured in the sample and c 14 was the initial 14c present calculated through netpathxl assuming solid carbonate exchange is the dominant process impacting the carbon isotopes 2 5 noble gas solubility modeling noble gas composition is initially set during recharge to an aquifer and is controlled by the partial pressure of the gas phase mole fraction multiplied by atmospheric pressure temperature salinity and the amount of excess gas entrapped during recharge e g heaton and vogel 1981 an estimate of the initial temperature of water during recharge can be determined by the application of a solubility based model which takes the measured noble gas compositions and fits the modeled recharge parameters to the data aeschbach hertig et al 1999 we utilized the closed equilibrium ce model developed by aeschbach hertig et al 1999 for noble gas solubility modeling and the dgmeta dissolved gas modeling and environmental tracer analysis jurgens et al 2020 model to resolve noble gas recharge parameters work by stute and sonntag 1992 aeschbach hertig et al 1999 heaton and vogle 1981 and ballentine et al 2002 showed that excess air components trapped during recharge can vary in composition depending on the degree of equilibration of the trapped air gas losses and fractionation of the original air like component for implementation of the ce model measured dissolved noble gas components are compared to modeled concentration values using estimated parameters of temperature t initial concentration of entrapped air ae and the reduction of entrapped volume by dissolution and compression with the assumption that the water was fresh or low salinity and the partial pressure of the gases is associated with atmospheric pressure at the elevation of the water table 1994 m an error weighted least squares fit was used to solve for free model parameters t and ae by minimizing chi squared all data that support the results and conclusions in this study are available from u s geological survey 2021 by using the usgs site number in table 1 to compile the data 3 results 3 1 groundwater chemistry and elevation results in the gallup sandstone aquifer groundwater elevation was highest in the south and lowest in the north implying south to north groundwater flow table 1 this is consistent with the findings of kernodle 1996 sc and tds were highest in the menefee formation aquifer well 155 5710 µs cm and 3910 mg l respectively and the point lookout sandstone aquifer at well 603 table 2 generally sampled wells had low o2 concentrations 0 003 0 025 mmol l o2 basic ph 7 8 9 2 and low nitrogen and phosphorous table 2 3 2 noble gas and isotopic results noble gas concentrations shown in table 3 varied across the field site with wells 228 and the chaco well gallup sandstone aquifer generally having the highest noble gas concentrations and well 603 point lookout sandstone aquifer having the lowest with the exception of 4he for the seven sites sampled for noble gases median ne 4he ar kr and xe values were 3 49 10 7 6 99 10 6 4 53 10 4 9 4 10 8 and 9 6 10 9 cm3 g respectively table 3 the stable isotopes of water δ2h and δ18o were heaviest at well 64 point lookout sandstone aquifer and lightest at well 228 gallup sandstone aquifer in the gallup sandstone aquifer δ2h and δ18o isotopes were light with respect to other aquifers except for well 219 which was heavier than the other gallup sandstone aquifer samples fig 4 well 602 chaco well had higher 87sr 86sr values 0 70922 then the rest of the data set table 4 3 3 groundwater age tritium and carbon isotopes tritium concentrations at all sites were below the instrument detection limit 3h 0 3 pci l table 4 carbon 14 results were very low 1 pmc except for well 10 3 59 pmc table 4 in the gallup sandstone aquifer in the southern portion of the field area δ13c values ranged from 17 5 to 7 55 across the study area with the highest values at well 155 7 55 and the lowest at well 4 17 5 the lack of detectable tritium in groundwaters likely indicates no mixing with modern waters table 4 linhoff 2022 lindsey et al 2019 travis et al 2021 in the absence of inputs from modern waters carbon isotopes are generally useful indicators of geochemical processes and may help constrain groundwater age dam 1995 measured carbon isotopes in the san juan basin as part of a larger groundwater chemistry study in that study 14c varied between 0 4 pmc to 6 4 pmc and δ13c varied from 7 6 to 26 1 in seven samples collected from the gallup sandstone aquifer when interpreting groundwater ages chemical processes that alter the initial 14c of dissolved inorganic carbon dic in groundwater must be considered cartwright et al 2020 a graphical method fig 5 developed by han et al 2012 and han and plummer 2013 2016 was used to recognize processes that might prevent accurate assessment of whether a sample contained 14c that had undergone decay the method uses the pmc δ13c and hco3 composition of a sample to determine the suitability of a groundwater for age dating the two triangles in fig 5 represents the zero age zone these were constructed according to han and plummer 2016 using soil gas δ13c values of 20 and 25 from dam 1995 the soil gas δ13c values are based on gallup sandstone aquifer groundwater in the likely recharge zone south of the field site where the gallup sandstone crops out fig 1 in fig 5 all samples plot below the zero age region and hence are likely old groundwater that has undergone 14c decay and may be dated well 10 in the gallup sandstone was the youngest water 23 000 ybp followed by well 4 37 000 ybp in the cliff house sandstone table 4 and fig 2 five samples had pmc lower than the method can accurately date and hence are assumed to be older than 52 000 ybp table 4 older ages were found in the northern portion of the field area implying south to north groundwater flow these age estimates do not take into account potential redox reactions all sites had relatively low dissolved o2 concentrations as well as reduced forms of nitrogen nh3 nh4 and ch4 this could cause an overestimate of 14c ages han et al 2012 3 4 major ion results the major ion composition differs markedly between aquifers fig 6 table 5 notably mg2 and ca2 are relatively high in the cliff house sandstone and cl and hco3 are elevated in groundwaters in the point lookout sandstone so4 2 cl and na are also quite different between each aquifer with the point lookout sandstone and menefee formation waters having elevated na and cl the gallup sandstone where the chaco well is screened generally has relatively low ca2 mg2 cl and hco3 with elevated so4 2 concentrations in general all groundwater sites in the study were near calcite and quartz equilibrium and were supersaturated mineral saturation index si 0 with dolomite and undersaturated si 0 with respect to gypsum and halite table 6 both calcite and gypsum are very common secondary minerals and may be found in all rock types 3 5 organic compound detections voc were detected at five sites in the study area table 7 all samples with voc detections were from the gallup sandstone and point lookout sandstone four out of five of those sites had detections of multiple vocs this includes btex compounds which are known to be associated with hydrocarbon deposits flowback water and many adverse health effects njobuenwu et al 2005 ziemkiewicz thomas 2015 mcmahon et al 2017 spycher et al 2017 ran et al 2018 karolyte et al 2021 eleven organic compounds were detected in samples from this study table 7 organic compound detections were at low concentrations but were greater than the laboratory detection level benzene was the most frequently detected organic compound found at five sites 64 228 601 602 and 603 wells 64 and 603 had the greatest number of organic compounds detected and these two wells are both from the point lookout sandstone concentrations at well 64 were generally higher than at well 603 but both had low level concentrations well 602 was sampled by usgs in 2017 during a regional sampling effort for wells in the colorado plateaus physiographic province which included other organic compounds butane 0 398 µg l and hexane 0 073 µg l were detected in the 2017 sample above the laboratory detection level 4 discussion 4 1 noble gases dissolved noble gases are often useful in deciphering groundwater recharge sources and temperature as well as assessing past mixing with hydrocarbons and groundwater age aeschbach hertig et al 1999 ballentine et al 2002 byrne et al 2020 heaton and vogle 1981 solder et al 2020 stute and sonntag 1992 noble gas concentrations table 3 could not be fitted to the ce model using dgmeta jurgens et al 2020 based on probable elevation and mean annual temperature parameters for the area this inability to fit using likely recharge parameters assumes groundwater followed simple recharge into the aquifer and that no further noble gas partitioning occurred post isolation from the atmosphere hence estimating the recharge temperature of groundwater across the field area using noble gases is not possible in groundwater the heavier noble gases kr and xe are typically enriched relative to the light gases he and ne however in this study in all sampled sites the light noble gases were enriched relative to the heavier noble gases no samples plot close to estimated air saturated water asw or trend with air addition excess air from asw as the ce model would predict fig 7 instead the lower fxe values indicate a depletion in xe concentrations relative to 36ar and the fne values show enrichment of ne relative to 36ar this failure of the ce model to fit the recharge parameters to the measured data is due to partitioning of the light and heavy noble gas compositions one way this partitioning can occur is in the presence of a hydrocarbon phase in the subsurface during groundwater mixing with a hydrocarbon phase the solubility differences between hydrocarbons and groundwater preferentially partitions the heavy noble gases into the hydrocarbon phase this process leaves the resulting groundwater depleted in the heavy and enriched in the light noble gases this type of noble gas fluid phase partitioning can be modeled by simple rayleigh fractionation of the noble gas components between the two fluid phases driven by the differences of solubility between phases ballentine et al 2002 we used a rayleigh fractionation model of asw 15 c 1 994 m elevation encountering and losing noble gas components to a hydrocarbon phase using solubility coefficients for light oil kharaka and specht 1988 and water solubility coefficients crovetto et al 1982 at an equilibration temperature of 30 c the fractionation trend green dashed line in fig 7 begins with little change near the asw value and progresses with greater partitioning and the loss of the heavier gases to the oil component the calculations for ne and xe partitioning were made relative to the amount of ar lost from the groundwater to the oil fraction p ar 0 5 indicates 50 loss of the ar component from the groundwater to the oil the sample data remain offset from the rayleigh fractionation modeled composition of oil water interaction and asw this is likely explained as a mixture of asw containing a partitioned oil water component mixing lines a and b in fig 7 during the genesis of hydrocarbons from kerogen in a source rock the compounds produced in the early stages of hydrocarbon formation interact with connate water trapped in the system to produce groundwaters that follow the trend of the oil water partitioning from an air saturated source water with ongoing hydrocarbon maturation some amount of the connate groundwater present during the early stage of hydrocarbon formation is lost from the source rock bryne et al 2020 these hydrocarbon waters presumably migrate to permeable units surrounding the source rock forming a mix of asw compositions and hydrocarbon water that is characteristic of mixing line b fig 7 in noble gas samples taken from the gallup sandstone menefee formation and point lookout sandstone aquifers a large component of partitioned noble gas compositions sourced from the mancos shale seems to be mixed with an asw component in the aquifers the actual mixing could be asw with some excess air and groundwater that is marginally fractionated with hydrocarbon groundwater mixing line a in fig 7 alternatively the mixing could be through a much greater component of asw with less excess air mixed with a much more partitioned component sourced from the hydrocarbon bearing shale mixing line b in fig 7 the sample from the point lookout sandstone well 603 is closest to the rayleigh frationation modeled values for water oil partitioning and could in fact lie on the trend by adjusting the modeling temperature to 80 c instead of 30 c as discussed below section 4 4 mixing with hydrocarbons could be facilitated by improperly cased boreholes in the region fig 3 and 10 4 2 stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen δ18o and δ2h results are shifted to the right of the local meteoric water line lmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 12 5 vuataz and goff 1986 and may define a different meteoric water line or a past drier environment fig 4 this result was repeated in phillips et al 1986 and walvoord et al 1999 who also found a right shift in the δ18o and δ2h isotopes in san juan basin groundwaters most gallup sandstone groundwaters sampled in our study have δ18o values about 2 lighter than samples collected in the cliff house sandstone and menefee formation table 4 this could be driven by gallup sandstone recharge in the mountains south of the field area and lower elevation recharge in other formations in phillips et al 1986 a relationship was found between 14c and δ18o whereby older groundwater was generally isotopically lighter than younger groundwater suggesting cooler climates during the pleistocene in the current study older 40 000 ybp estimated 14c ages are associated with heavier δ18o and δ2h values table 4 although data are very limited this could indicate some amount of climate warming between 40 000 and 20 000 ybp 4 3 geochemical evolution of groundwater groundwaters chemically evolve through time and over distances fisher ad mullican 1997 in this field area they have had a long time to evolve section 3 3 young groundwaters tend to have ca hco3 type water because carbonate minerals weather fastest imparting ca2 and hco3 ions as calcite and dolomite saturation is reached dissolution of silicate and gypsum minerals contribute so4 2 and na and ca2 and mg2 are exchanged for adsorbed na this geochemical evolution of groundwater produces na hco3 and na so4 type waters over long flow paths and time scales fisher and mullican 1997 all groundwater sites in this study are near calcite equilibrium and are supersaturated with dolomite and undersaturated with respect to gypsum table 6 a piper diagram fig 8 shows that the dominant cation in all groundwaters is sodium na wells screened in the point lookout sandstone are na hco3 type waters and the rest of the sampled sites have na so4 type water this analysis suggests that groundwater in the cliff house sandstone is the least geochemically evolved and the menefee formation and point lookout sandstone are the most geochemically evolved in this section we will show that gallup sandstone contains groundwater both relatively young at the southernmost sampling points for the san juan basin and highly geochemically evolved in the eastern and northern portion of the field area furthermore there is evidence of mixing between aquifers if ca2 mg2 so4 2 and hco3 are largely from the dissolution of calcite dolomite and gypsum then these ions should be charge balanced but they are not in fig 9a a ratio of 1 1 between ca2 mg2 and so4 2 hco3 would indicate mineral weathering of carbonates or gypsum instead all waters plot below this line meaning that na the only other major cation must balance the excess negative charge all sites have molal ratios of na to cl that exceed one fig 9b a ratio approximately equal to one would indicate halite dissolution while a ratio greater than one generally indicates na released from silicate weathering or cation exchange for ca2 and mg2 meybeck 1987 hence in these samples silicate weathering or cation exchange is likely contributing na groundwater samples collected from the menefee formation and point lookout sandstone are the only sites where cl makes up a substantial portion of the anion balance to test the importance of cation exchange the relationships between na cl and ca2 mg2 so4 2 hco3 were examined fig 9c in this scenario na cl meq l represents the amount of na gained or lost from halite dissolution ca2 mg2 so4 2 hco3 represents the amount of ca2 and mg2 gained or lost relative to gypsum calcite and dolomite dissolution if cation exchange is a dominant and controlling process the relationship between these parameters will be linear with a slope of 1 fisher and mullican 1997 fig 9c shows that all groundwater samples plot along a straight line r2 0 97 with a slope of 0 96 hence ca2 and mg2 ions have been exchanged for na through cation exchange gypsum dissolution also explains the relatively high so4 concentrations in many of the sampled groundwaters in summary groundwater in the field area is geochemically evolved with ions largely coming from cation exchange and gypsum dissolution from this information we infer that among wells in the gallup sandstone wells from the southwest part of the field area wells 10 221 and 224 are the least geochemically evolved and wells 601 602 and 228 to the north are more geochemically evolved this is consistent with south to north groundwater flow as indicated by groundwater elevations table 1 and 14 c ages table 4 well 219 also appears to be more geochemically evolved than other wells in the gallup sandstone though it is in the southern part of the field area as discussed below section 4 4 this well is likely affected by mixing with adjacent aquifers in general little variation in 87sr 86sr values was observed with the exception of well 602 the chaco well which had a higher 87sr 86sr value fig 9d it is presently unclear why the ratio was higher at this site though higher 87sr 86sr ratios in groundwater are generally associated with greater weathering of potassium and rubidium rich minerals such k feldspar and biotite cartwright et al 2007 4 4 mixing between aquifers mixing between aquifers may be facilitated through improperly cased or plugged hydrocarbon wells in the region the chaco well well 602 and well 603 have 22 inactive hydrocarbon wells within 10 km and seven within 5 km fig 3 wells 155 and 219 have 24 hydrocarbon related boreholes wells within 1 km all of which are drilled to the menefee formation morrison formation and to unknown depths fig 10 although these hydrocarbon wells are inactive some could be conduits for vertical groundwater movement through relatively impermeable units such as the mancos shale kernodle 1996 lacombe et al 1995 a mixing line can be inferred from lower to higher concentrations of na versus cl between well 10 in the gallup sandstone and wells 603 and 155 in the point lookout sandstone and menefee formation respectively fig 9b when examining hco3 and so4 2 concentrations against na figs 11a and 11b two divergent mixing pathways are seen one towards na so4 type waters and the other towards na hco3 type waters again the younger well 10 23 000 ybp is the more dilute end member and wells 603 52 000 ybp and 155 41 000 ybp being the second and third end members with varying so4 2 and hco3 concentrations these geochemical plots show that well 155 screened in the menefee formation and well 603 screened in the point lookout sandstone represent distinct end members in the dataset the low so4 at well 603 could be indicative of so4 reduction as this site which also had the highest nh3 nh4 concentrations tables 2 and 5 waters in the gallup sandstone and cliff house sandstone appear to be mixing with waters in the menefee formation instead of the point lookout sandstone cl br ratios are often used to help differentiate different water sources and infer sources of produced water davis et al 1998 ziemkiewicz thomas 2015 for example groundwaters with cl br molar ratios 2500 are likely mixing with brine davis et al 1998 while produced waters may carry excess br potentially lowering the cl br ratio tasker et al 2020 ziemkiewicz thomas 2015 in this study cl br molar ratios varied between 229 8 and 5 409 1 with the lowest and highest values coming from well 4 cliff house sandstone and well 603 point lookout sandstone respectively in fig 11 c cl br ratios are highest for wells 155 and 603 screened in the menefee formation and point lookout sandstone respectively as evidenced by the noble gas results section 3 1 water in well 603 may be mixing with shale connate waters expelled during hydrocarbon formation water from well 155 may also be mixing with a brine water vertical mixing between aquifers is known to occur in the san juan basin generally with low rates through shale beds and higher leakage rates in localized areas associated with faults and fractures stone et al 1983 furthermore vertical gradients were found in this study which could help induce mixing table 1 mixing between aquifers is evident between geochemical end members represented by the youngest section 3 2 and most dilute gallup sandstone sample collected well 10 and the much more saline well 155 menefee formation and well 603 point lookout sandstone this also could include mixing between an unsampled aquifer deeper in the region well 219 screened in the gallup sandstone is geochemically similar to well 155 in all geochemical figures including the carbon isotopes fig 5 δ18o and δ2h fig 4 strontium isotopes fig 9d and major ion chemistry figs 6 8 9 and 11 the chaco well appears to be intermediate between the gallup sandstone and the menefee formation and cliff house sandstone end members the direction of mixing in the basin is likely from deeper to shallower depths as indicated by the groundwater level measurements table 1 it is possible that deeper unsampled groundwaters moving vertically through formations or through improperly cased boreholes are strongly influencing groundwater chemistry this may be the case in wells 219 gallup sandstone aquifer and 155 menefee formation where the many nearby inactive hydrocarbon boreholes fig 10 could have facilitated vertical mixing and groundwater chemistry homogenization implications of this research is that while groundwater movement is slow vertical mixing between aquifers is likely occurring despite the less permeable mancos shale that separates the gallup sandstone and the surrounding aquifers this mixing could be augmented through the many boreholes drilled throughout the field area figs 3 and 10 hence contaminants from hydrocarbon extraction activities in the san juan basin may travel between aquifers and could be affecting water quality in the gallup sandstone aquifer 4 5 detections of hydrocarbon related compounds and the possibility of contamination from hydrocarbon extraction activities though naturally occurring btex and other voc detections may be explained by leakage from improperly cased or failed casings of nearby oil and gas wells figs 3 and 10 for example chaco well is 5 km directly north from an inactive hydrocarbon borehole drilled into the gallup sandstone aquifer given the age of the hydrocarbon well 1956 groundwater flow directions south to north and the conductivity of the gallup sandstone aquifer 111 m y kernodle 1996 it is possible that contaminants could have migrated vertically through the borehole and then horizontally 7 km towards the chaco well the three gallup sandstone aquifer wells with voc detections were located on the north and east side of the study area downgradient of gallup sandstone wells with no voc detections the downgradient water may represent older more evolved groundwater that has had more interaction with hydrocarbon deposits or leakage through boreholes from adjacent stratigraphic units with hydrocarbon deposits in addition to evidence from noble gas analyses which suggests influence from connate water expelled from shale during hydrocarbon formation section 4 1 well 603 had highly elevated barium ba 60 73 μmol l table 5 relatively high cl 28 21 29 05 mmo l and bromide 0 0125 0 0161 mmol l these elements are commonly present in high concentrations in oil field brines and shale waters barbot et al 2013 hudak and wachal 2001 ziemkiewicz thomas 2015 notably the cl br molar ratio changed from 5409 to 1799 between 1987 and 2019 at well 603 and in 2019 the well contained trace voc detections the drop in cl br is consistent with a new source of br rich brine water though tds did not change appreciably ch4 concentrations were also significantly correlated to the cl br ratio fig 11d a finding that could implicate a similar source for high cl br and ch4 however both ch4 and high cl br ratios often have natural origins and could indicate mixing with a ch4 containing shale water davis et al 1998 li et al 2016 ziemkiewicz thomas 2015 furthermore the point lookout sandstone aquifer waters had high ch4 and low so4 potentially indicating in situ methanogenesis further work could measure stable h and c isotopes of ch4 to help distinguish methane sources bernard et al 1976 this study did not examine synthetic chemicals that could confirm direct effect from hydrocarbon extraction activities further work to determine whether hydrocarbon extraction activities such as hf are affecting drinking water resources in the san juan basin and at ccnhp could sample for synthetic organic compounds such as diethylene glycol and per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas the u s environmental protection agency reported diethylene glycol in groundwater near an extensive shale gas operation in pavillion wyoming di giulio et al 2011 pfas are extremely recalcitrant compounds often termed forever chemicals that are used in large quantities during hydrocarbon extraction glüge et al 2020 meng et al 2021 in a recent study of groundwater and soils near oil fields substantially higher concentrations of pfas were observed downgradient of oil fields compared to upgradient meng et al 2021 further work pairing these synthetic compounds with noble gas major ion voc and isotope analyses could help determine the sources of vocs found in groundwater at ccnhp and the greater san juan basin despite the extensive amount of hydrocarbon extraction taking place geochemical groundwater data in the region is sparse further work studying the effect of hydrocarbon extraction on water quality and quantity in the san juan basin could fill some of these knowledge gaps 5 conclusions despite the large number of hydrocarbon extraction wells in the san juan basin very little is known of the groundwater chemistry flow directions or the potential impact oil and gas related wells could have on drinking water sources this work shows that mixing between aquifers even through the relatively impermeable mancos shale kernodle 1996 is possible and may be facilitated through the numerous inactive oil and gas related boreholes in the region given groundwater conductivity through the gallup sandstone aquifer 111 m y kernodle 1996 it is possible that contaminants from nearby oil and gas wells targeting and not targeting the gallup sandstone could nevertheless migrate vertically and then over the course of years to decades move to the main drinking water source at ccnhp well 602 chaco well furthermore the lack of modern water in the sampled aquifers indicates that any water extraction will not be replaced by modern recharge several lines of evidence suggest groundwater contamination from nearby oil and gas extraction activity is possible or has occurred first noble gas results imply mixing with waters that have interacted with hydrocarbons section 4 1 second the presence of vocs including btex compounds also indicates interaction with hydrocarbon fluids lastly mixing between aquifers is supported by major ion and isotopic geochemical analyses this study establishes baseline geochemistry and groundwater flow direction from south to north for seldom sampled aquifers in the san juan basin that can serve to compare with future studies whether the mixing and presence of voc compounds is naturally occurring or is facilitated through oil and gas related boreholes will require further investigation further work could endeavor to analyze groundwater for synthetic chemicals used during hf mumford et al 2018 especially at the chaco well gallup sandstone and well 603 point lookout sandstone further study could also benefit from sampling produced and flowback water from active oil and gas wells to help determine the organic compounds and geochemistry that could help trace produced waters additional work could also seek to measure the stable isotopes of ch4 to help determine the sources of ch4 in the aquifer mcintosh et al 2018 credit authorship contribution

travel to the park many of whom stay at the park campground following decades of unsuccessful attempts to develop usable near surface water sources c filippone national park service written communication 2018 a 944 m deep well chaco well site 602 table 1 and fig 1 was constructed in the gallup sandstone aquifer in 1972 this provided the park with the first reliable drinking water source since it was established in 1907 all park visitors and some members from the surrounding community rely on this water source in the gallup sandstone aquifer advances in unconventional hydrocarbon extraction techniques including hydrofracking hf have increased the potential for hydrocarbon extraction within the san juan basin and many other locations in the u s a u s energy information administration 2015 furthermore in the last decade a rapid increase in hydrocarbon extraction in the san juan basin near ccnhp has targeted the gallup sandstone mancos shale and the surrounding units figs 1 and 2 engler et al 2015 kelley et al 2014 the 30 60 m thick gallup sandstone stone et al 1983 is stratigraphically between thick confining sequences of the lower permeability mancos shale fig 2 both the mancos shale and the gallup sandstone are in the san juan basin and both may contain oil or natural gas kelley et al 2014 available oil and gas well data available through the state of new mexico oil conservation division https www emnrd nm gov ocd gsc tab 0 show that hydrocarbon wells near the park were drilled in the 1950 s through 1970 s and targeted the dakota formation entrada sandstone gallup sandstone mancos shale and morrison formation figs 2 and 3 this scenario whereby the drinking water aquifer is at the same depth as targeted hydrocarbons is likely unique in general drinking water aquifers are shallow near surface aquifers while hydrocarbon bearing units are hundreds or thousands of meters below land surface meng and ashby 2014 hence the chaco well may be more vulnerable to contamination from hydrocarbon extraction activities than many other locations during hf hydraulic fracturing fluid hff is injected into a low permeability petroleum reservoir such as shale under high pressure this fractures the rock formation horizontally and vertically increasing permeability by orders of magnitude and mobilizing fluids such as natural gas and oil which are induced to flow to a well where they are extracted hf at a single site can be economically viable for decades and a single well can undergo hf multiple times over its life cycle clark et al 2013 the process is extremely water intensive routinely requiring 4 16 million gallons of water per well clark et al 2013 following hf between 5 and 300 of the initial hff volume returns to the surface as flowback water also called produced water this produced water may be reinjected for hf or disposed of through deep well injection wastewater treatment facilities storage in ponds or released onto the ground surface or into surface waters clark et al 2013 gallegos and varela 2015 hff is a mixture of water proppants used to maintain fractures and additives to enhance production such as lubricants scale reducers viscosity builders and biocides to minimize biofouling and souring of the hydrocarbon mumford et al 2018 stringfellow et al 2014 self reported chemical disclosures of fracturing fluid

waters varies between brines and formations and is controlled by many factors ideally when assessing whether groundwater is mixed with produced waters the composition of both end members is known an additional concern is the existence of fast flow pathways between geologic units created by the presence of uncased boreholes distributed around the san juan basin many of which were used for oil and gas exploration lacombe et al 1995 these boreholes as well as improperly cased or plugged boreholes have the potential to transmit fluids and gases from geologic units with high hydrostatic pressure to units with lower hydrostatic pressure perra 2021 the rate at which this short circuiting flow occurs depends on the hydrostatic pressure differences and the transmissivities of the geologic units or short circuit pathway short circuit fluid flow is potentially an important source of fluid migration in the region as there are many inactive oil and gas wells in the san juan basin figs 1 and 3 the potential for contamination from hydrocarbon extraction activities to ccnhp is largely unknown due to the lack of knowledge of groundwater flow direction geochemical evolution flow velocity and mixing between aquifers additionally baseline water chemistry in relevant aquifers has not been defined and contamination from hff and produced waters has not been assessed the objectives of this work were to complete a geochemical sampling campaign at wells within and outside of ccnhp to determine baseline water chemistry assess mixing between aquifers determine groundwater flow directions and to evaluate whether groundwater has been contaminated or could become contaminated from nearby hydrocarbon extraction activities geochemical constituents measured include major ions noble gases and isotope systems including strontium 87sr 86sr deuterium δ2h and oxygen δ18o in water and the dissolved inorganic carbon isotopes δ13c and 14c we also measured volatile organic carbon voc compounds including benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene btex compounds which are often associated with hydrocarbons 2 methods 2 1 study area between 850 and 1250 a d ccnhp fig 1 was the center of a

cliff house sandstone fig 2 the gallup sandstone is surrounded by the mancos shale and consists of sandstone shale and coal the chaco well is located near the gallup sandstone s northern extent fig 1 the point lookout sandstone is stratigraphically above the mancos shale and is composed largely of sandstone the menefee formation in contrast is composed of interbedded shale sandstone and coal kelley et al 2014 stratigraphically above this the cliff house sandstone is largely composed of sandstone all units described above are known to contain oil or natural gas within the san juan basin brister and hoffman 2002 previous studies in the san juan basin found that groundwater in the morrison formation stratigraphically below the mancos shale fig 2 had too little 14c to effectively date concluding that groundwater likely recharged 52 000 years before present ybp dam 1995 past research has found that recharge to the gallup sandstone generally occurs where the unit crops out at the surface 55 km to the south of the chaco well fig 1 stone et al 1983 and that groundwater generally flows from the south to the north through the gallup sandstone kernodle 1996 however more recent groundwater withdrawals and hydrocarbon extraction across the san juan basin may have altered groundwater flow paths 2 2 field sample collection groundwater samples were collected for water chemistry analyses from 11 wells in 2019 and 2020 following u s geological survey protocols u s geological survey 2021 sites were sampled once except for wells 602 and 603 which were sampled three times for vocs where possible historical data pre 2019 is also presented from the u s geological survey national water information system nwis u s geological survey 2021 wells sampled were artesian discharging at the surface except for sites 4 and 10 which were subartesian and sampled via windmill pump ph temperature water temperature specific conductance sc and dissolved oxygen o2 were measured in a flow through cell prior to sampling at each site table 2 total dissolved solids tds were estimated as the sum of dissolved major ion constituents groundwater was discharging at the surface at all sites prior to sampling either through windmill pump or artesian flow hence no purge volume was recorded sample bottles were filled following field parameter stabilization water samples were filtered through a gwv capsule 0 45 µm filter for major cations trace elements alkalinity nutrients and carbon and strontium isotopes samples collected for vocs tritium 3h and stable isotopes were unfiltered major cations trace elements and strontium isotope samples were preserved to ph 2 by adding ultrapure nitric acid voc samples were collected in triplicate 40 ml septum capped amber glass vials filled from the bottom using a high density polyethylene tube until no air bubbles or headspace remained and then acidified to ph 2 with 1 1 hcl h2o similarly carbon isotope samples were collected in 1 l glass bottles filled from the bottom and allowed to flush three bottle volumes before being capped with a polycone cap with no headspace tritium samples were collected in 1 l poly bottles following the same bottom filling procedure and cone cap as the carbon isotope samples noble gas samples were collected in copper tubes in duplicate back pressure was applied with a restrictor on the sample tubing past the copper tube to minimize bubble formation prior to sealing the samples with refrigerator clamps weiss 1968 field alkalinity was computed from titration data using the incremental equivalence method usgs 2021 all samples were kept below 4 c following sample collection water levels at windmill sites were measured after stopping the windmill for several hours until groundwater levels were stable at artesian sites water levels were measured using a pressure transducer 2 3 water chemistry analytical methods water samples were analyzed for major cations trace elements and nutrients by the usgs national water quality laboratory nwql in denver colorado inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry was used to analyze for cations including calcium ca2 total iron

nitrogen purged organic blank water for voc analysis two replicate samples and three laboratory spikes for voc samples results and discussion of the qa qc samples are presented in supplemental material stable isotope ratios δ18o and δ2h in h2o were measured at the usgs reston stable isotope laboratory in reston virginia samples were analyzed using mass spectrometry following methods by

and δ13c were analyzed by the national ocean sciences accelerator mass spectrometry nosams at the woods hole oceanographic institution massachusetts using accelerator mass spectrometry to estimate the initial 14c present in these samples 14c we used the program netpathxl parkhurst and charlton 2008 han and plummer 2016 which calculates 14c using the fontes and garnier model han and plummer 2013 this model corrects for the effect of carbon exchange between dissolved inorganic carbon dic and solid carbonate and soil the major unknowns are the isotopic composition of solid carbonates and soil gas once 14c was estimated age was determined through eq 1 1 t 5730 l n 2 l n c d i c 14 c 14 where t is the groundwater age in years 5730 is the half life of 14c c d i c 14 is the pmc measured in the sample and c 14 was the initial 14c present calculated through netpathxl assuming solid carbonate exchange is the dominant process impacting the carbon isotopes 2 5 noble gas solubility modeling noble gas composition is initially set during recharge to an aquifer and is controlled by the partial pressure of the gas phase mole fraction multiplied by atmospheric pressure temperature salinity and the amount of excess gas entrapped during recharge e g heaton and vogel 1981 an estimate of the initial temperature of water during recharge can be determined by the application of a solubility based model which takes the measured noble gas compositions and fits the modeled recharge parameters to the data aeschbach hertig et al 1999 we utilized the closed equilibrium ce model developed by aeschbach hertig et al 1999 for noble gas solubility modeling and the dgmeta dissolved gas modeling and environmental tracer analysis jurgens et al 2020 model to resolve noble gas recharge parameters work by stute and sonntag 1992 aeschbach hertig et al 1999 heaton and vogle 1981 and ballentine et al 2002 showed that excess air components trapped during recharge can vary in composition depending on the degree of equilibration of the trapped air gas losses and fractionation of the original air like component for implementation of the ce model measured dissolved noble gas components are compared to modeled concentration values using estimated parameters of temperature t initial concentration of entrapped air ae and the reduction of entrapped volume by dissolution and compression with the assumption that the water was fresh or low salinity and the partial pressure of the gases is associated with atmospheric pressure at the elevation of the water table 1994 m an error weighted least squares fit was used to solve for free model parameters t and ae by minimizing chi squared all data that support the results and conclusions in this study are available from u s geological survey 2021 by using the usgs site number in table 1 to compile the data 3 results 3 1 groundwater chemistry and elevation results in the gallup sandstone aquifer groundwater elevation was highest in the south and lowest in the north implying south to north groundwater flow table 1 this is consistent with the findings of kernodle 1996 sc and tds were highest in the menefee formation aquifer well 155 5710 µs cm and 3910 mg l respectively and the point lookout sandstone aquifer at well 603 table 2 generally sampled wells had low o2 concentrations 0 003 0 025 mmol l o2 basic ph 7 8 9 2 and low nitrogen and phosphorous table 2 3 2 noble gas and isotopic results noble gas concentrations shown in table 3 varied across the field site with wells 228 and the chaco well gallup sandstone aquifer generally having the highest noble gas concentrations and well 603 point lookout sandstone aquifer having the lowest with the exception of 4he for the seven sites sampled for noble gases median ne 4he ar kr and xe values were 3 49 10 7 6 99 10 6 4 53 10 4 9 4 10 8 and 9 6 10 9 cm3 g respectively table 3 the stable isotopes of water δ2h and δ18o were heaviest at well 64 point lookout sandstone aquifer and lightest at well 228 gallup sandstone aquifer in the gallup sandstone aquifer δ2h and δ18o isotopes were light with respect to other aquifers except for well 219 which was heavier than the other gallup sandstone aquifer samples fig 4 well 602 chaco well had higher 87sr 86sr values 0 70922 then the rest of the data set table 4 3 3 groundwater age tritium and carbon isotopes tritium concentrations at all sites were below the instrument detection limit 3h 0 3 pci l table 4 carbon 14 results were very low 1 pmc except for well 10 3 59 pmc table 4 in the gallup sandstone aquifer in the southern portion of the field area δ13c values ranged from 17 5 to 7 55 across the study area with the highest values at well 155 7 55 and the lowest at well 4 17 5 the lack of detectable tritium in groundwaters likely indicates no mixing with modern waters table 4 linhoff 2022 lindsey et al 2019 travis et al 2021 in the absence of inputs from modern waters carbon isotopes are generally useful indicators of geochemical processes and may help constrain groundwater age dam 1995 measured carbon isotopes in the san juan basin as part of a larger groundwater chemistry study in that study 14c varied between 0 4 pmc to 6 4 pmc and δ13c varied from 7 6 to 26 1 in seven samples collected from the gallup sandstone aquifer when interpreting groundwater ages chemical processes that alter the initial 14c of dissolved inorganic carbon dic in groundwater must be considered cartwright et al 2020 a graphical method fig 5 developed by han et al 2012 and han and plummer 2013 2016 was used to recognize processes that might prevent accurate assessment of whether a sample contained 14c that had undergone decay the method uses the pmc δ13c and hco3 composition of a sample to determine the suitability of a groundwater for age dating the two triangles in fig 5 represents the zero age zone these were constructed according to han and plummer 2016 using soil gas δ13c values of 20 and 25 from dam 1995 the soil gas δ13c values are based on gallup sandstone aquifer groundwater in the likely recharge zone south of the field site where the gallup sandstone crops out fig 1 in fig 5 all samples plot below the zero age region and hence are likely old groundwater that has undergone 14c decay and may be dated well 10 in the gallup sandstone was the youngest water 23 000 ybp followed by well 4 37 000 ybp in the cliff house sandstone table 4 and fig 2 five samples had pmc lower than the method can accurately date and hence are assumed to be older than 52 000 ybp table 4 older ages were found in the northern portion of the field area implying south to north groundwater flow these age estimates do not take into account potential redox reactions all sites had relatively low dissolved o2 concentrations as well as reduced forms of nitrogen nh3 nh4 and ch4 this could cause an overestimate of 14c ages han et al 2012 3 4 major ion results the major ion composition differs markedly between aquifers fig 6 table 5 notably mg2 and ca2 are relatively high in the cliff house sandstone and cl and hco3 are elevated in groundwaters in the point lookout sandstone so4 2 cl and na are also quite different between each aquifer with the point lookout sandstone and menefee formation waters having elevated na and cl the gallup sandstone where the chaco well is screened generally has relatively low ca2 mg2 cl and hco3 with elevated so4 2 concentrations in general all groundwater sites in the study were near calcite and quartz equilibrium and were supersaturated mineral saturation index si 0 with dolomite and undersaturated si 0 with respect to gypsum and halite table 6 both calcite and gypsum are very common secondary minerals and may be found in all rock types 3 5 organic compound detections voc were detected at five sites in the study area table 7 all samples with voc detections were from the gallup sandstone and point lookout sandstone four out of five of those sites had detections of multiple vocs this includes btex compounds which are known to be associated with hydrocarbon deposits flowback water and many adverse health effects njobuenwu et al 2005 ziemkiewicz thomas 2015 mcmahon et al 2017 spycher et al 2017 ran et al 2018 karolyte et al 2021 eleven organic compounds were detected in samples from this study table 7 organic compound detections were at low concentrations but were greater than the laboratory detection level benzene was the most frequently detected organic compound found at five sites 64 228 601 602 and 603 wells 64 and 603 had the greatest number of organic compounds detected and these two wells are both from the point lookout sandstone concentrations at well 64 were generally higher than at well 603 but both had low level concentrations well 602 was sampled by usgs in 2017 during a regional sampling effort for wells in the colorado plateaus physiographic province which included other organic compounds butane 0 398 µg l and hexane 0 073 µg l were detected in the 2017 sample above the laboratory detection level 4 discussion 4 1 noble gases dissolved noble gases are often useful in deciphering groundwater recharge sources and temperature as well as assessing past mixing with hydrocarbons and groundwater age aeschbach hertig et al 1999 ballentine et al 2002 byrne et al 2020 heaton and vogle 1981 solder et al 2020 stute and sonntag 1992 noble gas concentrations table 3 could not be fitted to the ce model using dgmeta jurgens et al 2020 based on probable elevation and mean annual temperature parameters for the area this inability to fit using likely recharge parameters assumes groundwater followed simple recharge into the aquifer and that no further noble gas partitioning occurred post isolation from the atmosphere hence estimating the recharge temperature of groundwater across the field area using noble gases is not possible in groundwater the heavier noble gases kr and xe are typically enriched relative to the light gases he and ne however in this study in all sampled sites the light noble gases were enriched relative to the heavier noble gases no samples plot close to estimated air saturated water asw or trend with air addition excess air from asw as the ce model would predict fig 7 instead the lower fxe values indicate a depletion in xe concentrations relative to 36ar and the fne values show enrichment of ne relative to 36ar this failure of the ce model to fit the recharge parameters to the measured data is due to partitioning of the light and heavy noble gas compositions one way this partitioning can occur is in the presence of a hydrocarbon phase in the subsurface during groundwater mixing with a hydrocarbon phase the solubility differences between hydrocarbons and groundwater preferentially partitions the heavy noble gases into the hydrocarbon phase this process leaves the resulting groundwater depleted in the heavy and enriched in the light noble gases this type of noble gas fluid phase partitioning can be modeled by simple rayleigh fractionation of the noble gas components between the two fluid phases driven by the differences of solubility between phases ballentine et al 2002 we used a rayleigh fractionation model of asw 15 c 1 994 m elevation encountering and losing noble gas components to a hydrocarbon phase using solubility coefficients for light oil kharaka and specht 1988 and water solubility coefficients crovetto et al 1982 at an equilibration temperature of 30 c the fractionation trend green dashed line in fig 7 begins with little change near the asw value and progresses with greater partitioning and the loss of the heavier gases to the oil component the calculations for ne and xe partitioning were made relative to the amount of ar lost from the groundwater to the oil fraction p ar 0 5 indicates 50 loss of the ar component from the groundwater to the oil the sample data remain offset from the rayleigh fractionation modeled composition of oil water interaction and asw this is likely explained as a mixture of asw containing a partitioned oil water component mixing lines a and b in fig 7 during the genesis of hydrocarbons from kerogen in a source rock the compounds produced in the early stages of hydrocarbon formation interact with connate water trapped in the system to produce groundwaters that follow the trend of the oil water partitioning from an air saturated source water with ongoing hydrocarbon maturation some amount of the connate groundwater present during the early stage of hydrocarbon formation is lost from the source rock bryne et al 2020 these hydrocarbon waters presumably migrate to permeable units surrounding the source rock forming a mix of asw compositions and hydrocarbon water that is characteristic of mixing line b fig 7 in noble gas samples taken from the gallup sandstone menefee formation and point lookout sandstone aquifers a large component of partitioned noble gas compositions sourced from the mancos shale seems to be mixed with an asw component in the aquifers the actual mixing could be asw with some excess air and groundwater that is marginally fractionated with hydrocarbon groundwater mixing line a in fig 7 alternatively the mixing could be through a much greater component of asw with less excess air mixed with a much more partitioned component sourced from the hydrocarbon bearing shale mixing line b in fig 7 the sample from the point lookout sandstone well 603 is closest to the rayleigh frationation modeled values for water oil partitioning and could in fact lie on the trend by adjusting the modeling temperature to 80 c instead of 30 c as discussed below section 4 4 mixing with hydrocarbons could be facilitated by improperly cased boreholes in the region fig 3 and 10 4 2 stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen δ18o and δ2h results are shifted to the right of the local meteoric water line lmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 12 5 vuataz and goff 1986 and may define a different meteoric water line or a past drier environment fig 4 this result was repeated in phillips et al 1986 and walvoord et al 1999 who also found a right shift in the δ18o and δ2h isotopes in san juan basin groundwaters most gallup sandstone groundwaters sampled in our study have δ18o values about 2 lighter than samples collected in the cliff house sandstone and menefee formation table 4 this could be driven by gallup sandstone recharge in the mountains south of the field area and lower elevation recharge in other formations in phillips et al 1986 a relationship was found between 14c and δ18o whereby older groundwater was generally isotopically lighter than younger groundwater suggesting cooler climates during the pleistocene in the current study older 40 000 ybp estimated 14c ages are associated with heavier δ18o and δ2h values table 4 although data are very limited this could indicate some amount of climate warming between 40 000 and 20 000 ybp 4 3 geochemical evolution of groundwater groundwaters chemically evolve through time and over distances fisher ad mullican 1997 in this field area they have had a long time to evolve section 3 3 young groundwaters tend to have ca hco3 type water because carbonate minerals weather fastest imparting ca2 and hco3 ions as calcite and dolomite saturation is reached dissolution of silicate and gypsum minerals contribute so4 2 and na and ca2 and mg2 are exchanged for adsorbed na this geochemical evolution of groundwater produces na hco3 and na so4 type waters over long flow paths and time scales fisher and mullican 1997 all groundwater sites in this study are near calcite equilibrium and are supersaturated with dolomite and undersaturated with respect to gypsum table 6 a piper diagram fig 8 shows that the dominant cation in all groundwaters is sodium na wells screened in the point lookout sandstone are na hco3 type waters and the rest of the sampled sites have na so4 type water this analysis suggests that groundwater in the cliff house sandstone is the least geochemically evolved and the menefee formation and point lookout sandstone are the most geochemically evolved in this section we will show that gallup sandstone contains groundwater both relatively young at the southernmost sampling points for the san juan basin and highly geochemically evolved in the eastern and northern portion of the field area furthermore there is evidence of mixing between aquifers if ca2 mg2 so4 2 and hco3 are largely from the dissolution of calcite dolomite and gypsum then these ions should be charge balanced but they are not in fig 9a a ratio of 1 1 between ca2 mg2 and so4 2 hco3 would indicate mineral weathering of carbonates or gypsum instead all waters plot below this line meaning that na the only other major cation must balance the excess negative charge all sites have molal ratios of na to cl that exceed one fig 9b a ratio approximately equal to one would indicate halite dissolution while a ratio greater than one generally indicates na released from silicate weathering or cation exchange for ca2 and mg2 meybeck 1987 hence in these samples silicate weathering or cation exchange is likely contributing na groundwater samples collected from the menefee formation and point lookout sandstone are the only sites where cl makes up a substantial portion of the anion balance to test the importance of cation exchange the relationships between na cl and ca2 mg2 so4 2 hco3 were examined fig 9c in this scenario na cl meq l represents the amount of na gained or lost from halite dissolution ca2 mg2 so4 2 hco3 represents the amount of ca2 and mg2 gained or lost relative to gypsum calcite and dolomite dissolution if cation exchange is a dominant and controlling process the relationship between these parameters will be linear with a slope of 1 fisher and mullican 1997 fig 9c shows that all groundwater samples plot along a straight line r2 0 97 with a slope of 0 96 hence ca2 and mg2 ions have been exchanged for na through cation exchange gypsum dissolution also explains the relatively high so4 concentrations in many of the sampled groundwaters in summary groundwater in the field area is geochemically evolved with ions largely coming from cation exchange and gypsum dissolution from this information we infer that among wells in the gallup sandstone wells from the southwest part of the field area wells 10 221 and 224 are the least geochemically evolved and wells 601 602 and 228 to the north are more geochemically evolved this is consistent with south to north groundwater flow as indicated by groundwater elevations table 1 and 14 c ages table 4 well 219 also appears to be more geochemically evolved than other wells in the gallup sandstone though it is in the southern part of the field area as discussed below section 4 4 this well is likely affected by mixing with adjacent aquifers in general little variation in 87sr 86sr values was observed with the exception of well 602 the chaco well which had a higher 87sr 86sr value fig 9d it is presently unclear why the ratio was higher at this site though higher 87sr 86sr ratios in groundwater are generally associated with greater weathering of potassium and rubidium rich minerals such k feldspar and biotite cartwright et al 2007 4 4 mixing between aquifers mixing between aquifers may be facilitated through improperly cased or plugged hydrocarbon wells in the region the chaco well well 602 and well 603 have 22 inactive hydrocarbon wells within 10 km and seven within 5 km fig 3 wells 155 and 219 have 24 hydrocarbon related boreholes wells within 1 km all of which are drilled to the menefee formation morrison formation and to unknown depths fig 10 although these hydrocarbon wells are inactive some could be conduits for vertical groundwater movement through relatively impermeable units such as the mancos shale kernodle 1996 lacombe et al 1995 a mixing line can be inferred from lower to higher concentrations of na versus cl between well 10 in the gallup sandstone and wells 603 and 155 in the point lookout sandstone and menefee formation respectively fig 9b when examining hco3 and so4 2 concentrations against na figs 11a and 11b two divergent mixing pathways are seen one towards na so4 type waters and the other towards na hco3 type waters again the younger well 10 23 000 ybp is the more dilute end member and wells 603 52 000 ybp and 155 41 000 ybp being the second and third end members with varying so4 2 and hco3 concentrations these geochemical plots show that well 155 screened in the menefee formation and well 603 screened in the point lookout sandstone represent distinct end members in the dataset the low so4 at well 603 could be indicative of so4 reduction as this site which also had the highest nh3 nh4 concentrations tables 2 and 5 waters in the gallup sandstone and cliff house sandstone appear to be mixing with waters in the menefee formation instead of the point lookout sandstone cl br ratios are often used to help differentiate different water sources and infer sources of produced water davis et al 1998 ziemkiewicz thomas 2015 for example groundwaters with cl br molar ratios 2500 are likely mixing with brine davis et al 1998 while produced waters may carry excess br potentially lowering the cl br ratio tasker et al 2020 ziemkiewicz thomas 2015 in this study cl br molar ratios varied between 229 8 and 5 409 1 with the lowest and highest values coming from well 4 cliff house sandstone and well 603 point lookout sandstone respectively in fig 11 c cl br ratios are highest for wells 155 and 603 screened in the menefee formation and point lookout sandstone respectively as evidenced by the noble gas results section 3 1 water in well 603 may be mixing with shale connate waters expelled during hydrocarbon formation water from well 155 may also be mixing with a brine water vertical mixing between aquifers is known to occur in the san juan basin generally with low rates through shale beds and higher leakage rates in localized areas associated with faults and fractures stone et al 1983 furthermore vertical gradients were found in this study which could help induce mixing table 1 mixing between aquifers is evident between geochemical end members represented by the youngest section 3 2 and most dilute gallup sandstone sample collected well 10 and the much more saline well 155 menefee formation and well 603 point lookout sandstone this also could include mixing between an unsampled aquifer deeper in the region well 219 screened in the gallup sandstone is geochemically similar to well 155 in all geochemical figures including the carbon isotopes fig 5 δ18o and δ2h fig 4 strontium isotopes fig 9d and major ion chemistry figs 6 8 9 and 11 the chaco well appears to be intermediate between the gallup sandstone and the menefee formation and cliff house sandstone end members the direction of mixing in the basin is likely from deeper to shallower depths as indicated by the groundwater level measurements table 1 it is possible that deeper unsampled groundwaters moving vertically through formations or through improperly cased boreholes are strongly influencing groundwater chemistry this may be the case in wells 219 gallup sandstone aquifer and 155 menefee formation where the many nearby inactive hydrocarbon boreholes fig 10 could have facilitated vertical mixing and groundwater chemistry homogenization implications of this research is that while groundwater movement is slow vertical mixing between aquifers is likely occurring despite the less permeable mancos shale that separates the gallup sandstone and the surrounding aquifers this mixing could be augmented through the many boreholes drilled throughout the field area figs 3 and 10 hence contaminants from hydrocarbon extraction activities in the san juan basin may travel between aquifers and could be affecting water quality in the gallup sandstone aquifer 4 5 detections of hydrocarbon related compounds and the possibility of contamination from hydrocarbon extraction activities though naturally occurring btex and other voc detections may be explained by leakage from improperly cased or failed casings of nearby oil and gas wells figs 3 and 10 for example chaco well is 5 km directly north from an inactive hydrocarbon borehole drilled into the gallup sandstone aquifer given the age of the hydrocarbon well 1956 groundwater flow directions south to north and the conductivity of the gallup sandstone aquifer 111 m y kernodle 1996 it is possible that contaminants could have migrated vertically through the borehole and then horizontally 7 km towards the chaco well the three gallup sandstone aquifer wells with voc detections were located on the north and east side of the study area downgradient of gallup sandstone wells with no voc detections the downgradient water may represent older more evolved groundwater that has had more interaction with hydrocarbon deposits or leakage through boreholes from adjacent stratigraphic units with hydrocarbon deposits in addition to evidence from noble gas analyses which suggests influence from connate water expelled from shale during hydrocarbon formation section 4 1 well 603 had highly elevated barium ba 60 73 μmol l table 5 relatively high cl 28 21 29 05 mmo l and bromide 0 0125 0 0161 mmol l these elements are commonly present in high concentrations in oil field brines and shale waters barbot et al 2013 hudak and wachal 2001 ziemkiewicz thomas 2015 notably the cl br molar ratio changed from 5409 to 1799 between 1987 and 2019 at well 603 and in 2019 the well contained trace voc detections the drop in cl br is consistent with a new source of br rich brine water though tds did not change appreciably ch4 concentrations were also significantly correlated to the cl br ratio fig 11d a finding that could implicate a similar source for high cl br and ch4 however both ch4 and high cl br ratios often have natural origins and could indicate mixing with a ch4 containing shale water davis et al 1998 li et al 2016 ziemkiewicz thomas 2015 furthermore the point lookout sandstone aquifer waters had high ch4 and low so4 potentially indicating in situ methanogenesis further work could measure stable h and c isotopes of ch4 to help distinguish methane sources bernard et al 1976 this study did not examine synthetic chemicals that could confirm direct effect from hydrocarbon extraction activities further work to determine whether hydrocarbon extraction activities such as hf are affecting drinking water resources in the san juan basin and at ccnhp could sample for synthetic organic compounds such as diethylene glycol and per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas the u s environmental protection agency reported diethylene glycol in groundwater near an extensive shale gas operation in pavillion wyoming di giulio et al 2011 pfas are extremely recalcitrant compounds often termed forever chemicals that are used in large quantities during hydrocarbon extraction glüge et al 2020 meng et al 2021 in a recent study of groundwater and soils near oil fields substantially higher concentrations of pfas were observed downgradient of oil fields compared to upgradient meng et al 2021 further work pairing these synthetic compounds with noble gas major ion voc and isotope analyses could help determine the sources of vocs found in groundwater at ccnhp and the greater san juan basin despite the extensive amount of hydrocarbon extraction taking place geochemical groundwater data in the region is sparse further work studying the effect of hydrocarbon extraction on water quality and quantity in the san juan basin could fill some of these knowledge gaps 5 conclusions despite the large number of hydrocarbon extraction wells in the san juan basin very little is known of the groundwater chemistry flow directions or the potential impact oil and gas related wells could have on drinking water sources this work shows that mixing between aquifers even through the relatively impermeable mancos shale kernodle 1996 is possible and may be facilitated through the numerous inactive oil and gas related boreholes in the region given groundwater conductivity through the gallup sandstone aquifer 111 m y kernodle 1996 it is possible that contaminants from nearby oil and gas wells targeting and not targeting the gallup sandstone could nevertheless migrate vertically and then over the course of years to decades move to the main drinking water source at ccnhp well 602 chaco well furthermore the lack of modern water in the sampled aquifers indicates that any water extraction will not be replaced by modern recharge several lines of evidence suggest groundwater contamination from nearby oil and gas extraction activity is possible or has occurred first noble gas results imply mixing with waters that have interacted with hydrocarbons section 4 1 second the presence of vocs including btex compounds also indicates interaction with hydrocarbon fluids lastly mixing between aquifers is supported by major ion and isotopic geochemical analyses this study establishes baseline geochemistry and groundwater flow direction from south to north for seldom sampled aquifers in the san juan basin that can serve to compare with future studies whether the mixing and presence of voc compounds is naturally occurring or is facilitated through oil and gas related boreholes will require further investigation further work could endeavor to analyze groundwater for synthetic chemicals used during hf mumford et al 2018 especially at the chaco well gallup sandstone and well 603 point lookout sandstone further study could also benefit from sampling produced and flowback water from active oil and gas wells to help determine the organic compounds and geochemistry that could help trace produced waters additional work could also seek to measure the stable isotopes of ch4 to help determine the sources of ch4 in the aquifer mcintosh et al 2018 credit authorship contribution

7697,study region the han river basin china study focus as the water source of the middle route project of the south to north water transfer project water security in the han river basin deeply impacts national water resource allocation this study constructed a multi dimensional flood risk assessment mdfra framework combining a comprehensive index system an integrated weight method and a clustering algorithm to assess flood risk in the han river basin we first constructed a comprehensive index system including eight hazard indexes four exposure indexes and eight vulnerability indexes in demographic economic ecological and infrastructural categories to assess flood risk the index weights were determined by the integrated weight method which integrated the shapley value and the analytic hierarchy process method sahp finally the possibilistic fuzzy c means algorithm was employed to identify flood risk levels new hydrological insights for the region the mdfra framework presents flood risk in the han river basin realistically and comprehensively revealing flood risk composition and providing more detailed risk information results show that high risk regions accounted for 34 51 of the basin area and were mainly concentrated in the mid lower reaches while middle risk 19 13 and middle high risk 23 35 regions were mainly distributed in the upstream 4 52 5 12 and 13 37 of the basin area were assigned as very low low and middle low risk regions respectively and were mainly adjacent to the danjiangkou reservoir flood prone natural conditions and dense population and assets were the causes of high flood risk while reservoir regulation and storage capacity had significantly alleviated flood risk graphical abstract ga1 keywords flood risk assessment multi dimensional flood risk integrated weight method possibilistic fuzzy c means algorithm han river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floods are one of the most frequent disasters in the world which could threaten the safety of human lives hinder social development and cause substantial economic losses throughout the world deroliya et al 2022 dong et al 2022 meng et al 2019 xu et al 2018 yang et al 2021 yu et al 2023 climate change and the intensification of human activities have changed the frequency duration and intensity of precipitation and thus influence incidences of floods bui et al 2019 pham et al 2021 additionally the rapid development of society and economy may result in greater flood losses due to increasing population density and ongoing accumulation of value assets z chen et al 2021 x chen et al 2021 kubal et al 2009 floods accounted for 44 of all disasters during 2000 2019 and have affected 1 6 billion people undrr 2020 the no 5 flood peak of the 2020 yangtze river flood affected 0 26 million people and caused a direct economic loss of 2 45 billion yuan xia and chen 2021 the 2012 flood in hanzhong city located in the han river basin resulted in 0 19 million people affected and caused a direct economic loss of 500 million yuan zhang et al 2016 flood risk assessment is a measure and a component of disaster risk management which identifies the risk distributions and provides essential information for disaster reduction contributing to strengthening resilience against and reducing flood losses kreibich et al 2022 although the current definition of risk is diverse a commonly used definition is that risk is the interactions of hazard exposure and vulnerability ipcc 2020 merz et al 2021 thus flood risk assessment is a synthetic assessment that includes three components hazard exposure and vulnerability ipcc 2020 lai et al 2015 merz et al 2021 many methods have been employed to assess flood risk and these methods are divided into three classes lyu et al 2019 xu et al 2018 the historical disaster statistical method black and burns 2002 the multi criteria analysis method de brito et al 2018 pham et al 2021 and the scenario simulation analysis method jang et al 2021 the high requirements of data quantity and quality limit the wider application of the historical disaster statistical method and the scenario simulation analysis method xiao et al 2017 yildirim and demir 2022 the multi criteria analysis method is characterized by the advantages of low requirement in data and high accuracy in results and thus has been widely used to assess flood risk lai et al 2016 wang et al 2015 yang et al 2021 the key concern in the multi criteria analysis method is to construct an entire flood risk assessment index system wu et al 2022 existing studies follow the risk concept and the constructed index system includes three components of hazard exposure and vulnerability pham et al 2021 wu et al 2022 santos et al 2020 employed twelve hazard factors three exposure variables and twenty two vulnerability factors to assess flood risk in portugal lai et al 2015 selected three hazard indexes four exposure indexes and three vulnerability indexes to construct the flood risk assessment index system in the dongjiang river basin these hazard indexes commonly reflect the magnitude and harm of floods and their triggering factors such as maximum flow velocity maximum three day precipitation average elevation and distance to the river lai et al 2015 lai et al 2016 zou et al 2013 the exposure indexes reflect the people properties and infrastructure located in areas with the potential to be affected by floods and usually include population and gross national product amadio et al 2019 chakraborty et al 2021 santos et al 2020 vulnerability is the potential to suffer harm or loss lin et al 2020 zou et al 2013 common indexes include traffic network density urbanization ratio availability and local infrastructure services lin et al 2020 ma et al 2021 pathak et al 2020 however present research regarded the flood risk as the response of the whole human system to floods without considering the differences between various sub systems such as economic demographical ecological and infrastructural systems which lead to a lack of differences in sub system index and could bring great uncertainty to flood assessment results kubal et al 2009 pathak et al 2020 in addition although the great impacts of water conservancy projects on floods have been proven tang et al 2019 wan et al 2018 few studies incorporate the regulation and storage capacity of dams and reservoirs into the flood risk assessment index system hence it is of great importance to construct a more comprehensive index system to assess flood risk from economic demographical ecological and infrastructural dimensions considering the regulation and storage capacity of water conservancy projects another crucial issue to assess flood risk is accurately calculating multiple index weights chen et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 these indexes exhibit different contributions to flood risk due to different disaster causing and response mechanisms a number of methods such as the analytic hierarchy process ahp lin et al 2020 wu et al 2015 the gray fuzzy evaluation ma et al 2022 and the entropy weight method khosravi et al 2016 have been used to determine index weights and can be divided into objective methods and subjective methods preliminarily the analytic hierarchy process ahp method has been widely applied to determine index weights due to its acceptable accuracy and simple usability lin et al 2020 wu et al 2015 however a limitation of the ahp method is its high subjectivity in determining the relative importance of each index depending on the researchers experience and knowledge lin et al 2020 an integrated weight method combining the subjective ahp method and the objective method is a feasible way to get rid of this limitation and accurately determine the index weights flood loss records which contain a large amount of information related to flood risk can help to determine index weights objectively the shapley value which can equitably partition the rewards according to factors contributions has been used to quantify driver contributions to flood peaks yang et al 2020 and allocate the share of each distributed generator in loss and emission reduction veeramsetty 2021 thus the shapley value can make use of the flood loss records to objectively determine index weights and be used to combine with the ahp method furthermore determining flood risk levels is a significant step in flood risk assessment but suffers from the absence of suitable classification standards or common methods ji et al 2013 the clustering algorithm driven by data is a data mining technology and does not need classification thresholds to identify flood risk levels this method has been used to assess aquifer vulnerability javadi et al 2017 establish hydrological regionalization agarwal et al 2016 and evaluate water pollution risk li et al 2016 and thus can be used in flood risk assessment to overcome above difficulty and then provide more accurate results the han river basin is an important grain production base and densely inhabited basin in china hu et al 2021 xu et al 2011 flood risk has increased across the whole basin with climate change increasing population density and ongoing accumulation of valuable assets and varies greatly in spatial distribution due to uneven social development and the great natural condition changes gao et al 2019 wang et al 2020 xiong et al 2021 this study aims to construct a multi dimensional framework for improving flood risk assessment mdfra to assess flood risk in the han river basin more reasonably and comprehensively this framework combined a comprehensive index system an integrated weight method and the possibilistic fuzzy c means algorithm the comprehensive index system including eight hazard indexes four exposure indexes and eight vulnerability indexes in demographic economic ecological and infrastructural categories was constructed to assess flood risk the sahp method of integrating the shapley value and the ahp method was used to determine the weights of indexes subsequently the possibilistic fuzzy c means algorithm was employed to identify flood risk levels finally the mdfra framework was applied in the han river basin to reveal the distribution characteristics of flood risk the specifical objectives are to 1 construct a comprehensive flood risk assessment index system based on the mdfra framework 2 calculate weights of each index using the sahp method 3 determine flood risk levels according to clustering results of the possibilistic fuzzy c means algorithm 4 reveal the distribution characteristics of flood risk across the han river basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the han river fig 1 30 17 34 33 n 106 25 114 33 e area of approximately 1 59 105 km² is the largest tributary of the yangtze river originating from the qin mountain in the shanxi province and flowing through the shanxi province and the hubei province jiang et al 2019 xie et al 2019 as the water source of the middle route project of the south to north water transfer project zhang et al 2022 zhao et al 2020 water security in the han river basin deeply impacts the allocation of national water resources and coordinated regional development the whole han river basin is geographically divided into the upstream the midstream and the downstream by danjiangkou station and zhongxiang station zhang et al 2022 zhu et al 2008 the han river basin is located in the subtropical monsoon climate with annual average precipitation varying from 700 to 1000 mm and annual average temperature ranging from 12 to 16 c zhou et al 2017 the topography of the han river basin changes from the western medium low mountains to the eastern hilly plain and the shape of an inverted trumpet of the water system results in poor flood capacity xie et al 2019 in addition the han river basin is an important grain producing area a densely inhabited area and an important part of the yangtze river economic belt strong precipitation concentration large topographic changes relatively developed economy and dense population have led to great flood risk in the han river basin which brings great challenges to flood management zhang et al 2022 zhao et al 2021 2 2 data the collected data for this study included runoff data precipitation data geographical data social economic data hydraulic engineering information data and reported loss data detailed information was shown in table 1 daily runoff series were obtained from 17 hydrological stations evenly distributed in the han river basin while daily precipitation series were obtained from 53 meteorological stations geographical data included digital elevation model dem normalized difference vegetation index ndvi vegetation type night light data river vector data and road information data social economic data included population density gross national product gdp density crop structure transport volume population gdp dependency ratio education level pipe length data and sewage discharge hydraulic engineering information data included the longitude latitude and storage capacity of the dams and reservoirs 2 3 framework for flood risk assessment flood risk assessment aims to accurately grasp the distribution characteristics of flood risk by comprehensively evaluating natural and social attributes of floods xu et al 2018 involving multiple disciplines of engineering social economic and environmental sciences pathak et al 2020 uneven emphasis on demographical economic ecological and infrastructural risks in existing studies might lead to great uncertainty in flood risk assessment based on this this study proposed a multi dimensional flood risk assessment mdfra framework fig 2 shows the flowchart of the application of the mdfra framework the mdfra framework consisted of four steps firstly we constructed the comprehensive flood risk assessment index system to assess flood risk the spatial distributions of these indexes were quantified by frequency analysis and gis technique or obtained from remote sensing open street map and survey records subsequently the shapley value and the ahp method sahp were integrated to determine the weights of each index finally the possibilistic fuzzy c means algorithm was employed to identify flood risk levels the specific methods and the flood risk assessment index system are presented in the following sections the mdfra framework deemed that flood risk consisted of demographic economic ecological and infrastructural risks demographic risk refers to the flood risk caused by the interaction of flood hazards and the vulnerability of exposed populations pathak et al 2020 economic risk refers to the probable financial losses caused by floods pathak et al 2020 scheuer et al 2011 ecological risk is considered the associated impacts of contamination on the surroundings through floods or possible damage to ecological environment caused by floods kubal et al 2009 infrastructural risk corresponds to the interruptions of public infrastructural services and their associated impacts on society or the economy chakraborty et al 2021 flood risk assessment followed the hazard exposure vulnerability h e v framework where the definition of risk can be expressed by eq 1 1 r f h e v i 1 n 1 k ω i h i j 1 m 1 k ω j e j t 1 l 1 k ω t v t where h i e j and v t represent the ith hazard index the jth exposure index and the tth vulnerability index respectively ω i ω j and ω t are the weights of the ith hazard index the jth exposure index and the tth vulnerability index respectively the value of k is 1 when the index h i e j or v t shows negative contributions to the flood risk while when the index h i e j or v t positively correlates with the flood risk the value of k is 2 2 4 comprehensive index system in this study the flood risk assessment index system table 2 consisted of eight hazard indexes four exposure indexes and eight vulnerability indexes in demographic economic ecological and infrastructural categories detailed information is given in table 2 to eliminate the impacts of units dimensions and magnitudes of the indexes all assessment indexes were normalized in the range between 0 and 1 more details in chen 2022 and wu et al 2015 specifically indexes included annual maximum discharge md and annual maximum 1 d precipitation mp these two indexes directly reflect the magnitude and harm of flood and precipitation areal md and mp were calculated using the inverse distance weight idw method meng et al 2019 antecedent precipitation index api this index reflects antecedent wetness conditions and shows a positive relationship with flood hazard areal api was also calculated using the idw method elevation el and slope sl these two indexes reflect the topographical condition and topographic change respectively distance to river dr this index reflects the distance between the area and the river areas near the river may be prone to flooding while areas far away from rivers are safe reservoir regulation and storage capacity rsc and urban drainage capacity dc these two indexes are reservoir regulation and storage capacity and urban drainage capacity and they can decrease the degree of flood hazard the spatial distribution of rsc referred to the method of wu et al 2015 pipe length was used to represent urban drainage capacity population density pop gdp density gdp ecological level ec and infrastructural density id these four indexes reflect the people properties ecology and infrastructure located in areas with the potential to be affected by floods the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was used to represent the ecological level the night light dataset was used to represent the infrastructural density demographic vulnerability indexes included age structure as and education level edu economic vulnerability indexes included production structure ps and crop structure cs ecological vulnerability indexes included potential pollution pp and vegetation type vt infrastructural vulnerability indexes included road density rd and infrastructural service is wherein as ps pp and is were obtained from dependency ratio gdp structure sewage discharge and transport volume data respectively among these vulnerability indexes as ps pp rd and is showed a positive relationship with vulnerability while edu cs and vt showed a negative relationship with vulnerability 2 5 integrated weight method the sahp method was an integrated weight method for determining the weights of each flood risk assessment index which integrated the ahp method based on the researchers experience and knowledge and the shapley value based on the contributions of assessment indexes to reported flood losses the weights calculated by the sahp method are as follows 2 ω α ω a β ω s where ω is the weights calculated by the sahp method ω a is the weights calculated by the ahp method ω s is the weights calculated by the shapley value method α and β denote the corresponding weight of the two sub weights and were used to maximize the balance between subjective intention and objective impartiality the application of the ahp method to getting weights ω a can refer to existing studies bunmi mudashiru et al 2022 jenifer and jha 2017 the shapley value more details in appendix a originating from the n person game theory was used to partition the contributions of the assessment indexes to flood losses it depicts the average change in the rewards across all possible coalitions of existing participants when a new player joins them yang et al 2020 in this study the shapley value of one index is its average marginal contribution to a flood loss across all possible coalitions of other indexes its mathematical description is shown as follows 3 ω s i s n i p n p 1 n v s i v s where n is the number of indexes v is the gain function s is a coalition of indexes indexes 1 p ω s i is the contributions added by the new index i based on the coalition s 2 6 determining flood risk levels the unsupervised possibilistic fuzzy c means algorithm was used to divide flood risk into different risk levels askari 2021 the key to applying this clustering algorithm is to set the c value and the c value was set as 2 10 to determine flood risk levels in this study davies bouldin index dbi and calinski harabasz score chc were employed to evaluate the effectiveness of resulting clusters this operation was repeated 1000 times to determine the optimal flood risk level number namely the c value in each operation dbi and chc were calculated to detect the best clustering results the dbi and chc are calculated as follows 4 d b i 1 k i 1 k max j i σ i σ j d c i c j 5 c h c s s b k 1 s s w n k where c i is the cluster center of the ith cluster σ i is the average distance between each point in cluster i and its center d is the distance between the cluster center c i and c j k is the number of clusters n is the number of all data ss b is the interclass variance ss w is the intraclass variance 2 7 frequency analysis frequency analysis was used to quantify flood risk assessment indexes such as mp and md arnaud et al 2017 han et al 2022 according to the commonly used distribution of precipitation or runoff in china z chen et al 2021 x chen et al 2021 hao et al 2019 xu and huang 2011 four candidate distributions were selected to choose the best fitted distribution of precipitation and runoff including the pearson type iii distribution p ⅲ the lognormal distribution with three parameters ln3 the gumbel distribution gumbel and the generalized extreme value distribution gev the probability density functions of these four candidate distributions are described in table 3 rmse akaike information criteria aic kim et al 2017 and bayesian information criteria bic li et al 2021 were used to select the best fitted distribution and are also described in table 3 according to the current flood control demand in the han river basin zhou and mei 2011 we selected precipitation and runoff with a return period of 100 years as extreme precipitation and runoff 3 results 3 1 quantification and spatial distribution of indexes the results of fitting for md at 17 hydrological stations and mp at 24 sample meteorological stations are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively it was found that the fitting lines of the p iii distribution the gumbel distribution and the gev distribution were close to the empirical probability points while the fitting lines of the ln3 distribution deviated from the empirical points especially in the hydrological stations baih hanz shiq and xiant and the meteorological stations hanz taib and zuos the fitting effects i e average aic bic and rmse values of different distributions for md and mp are shown in table 4 combining the fitting lines and the fitting effects the gev distribution was chosen to calculate the md value with a 100 year return period while the p iii distribution was chosen to calculate the mp value with a 100 year return period the spatial distributions of mp md and the other six flood hazard indexes are shown in fig s1 the spatial distributions of four exposure indexes and eight vulnerability indexes in four dimensions are shown in fig s2 the values of md mp api and rsc were small in the northwest but large in the southeast while the distribution characteristics of el sl and dc were the opposite the values of rsc were larger in the central han river basin adjacent to the danjiangkou reservoir than in other areas dc showed an increasing trend from the upper to the lower han river basin and the regions with large values marked by red were located in the large cities chongqing and wuhan pop gdp id and rd were small in the west but large in the east some scattered points with large values of these indexes were located in the downtowns of multiple cities there were some regions with large as edu cs and is values in the northeast of the han river basin other regions with large values of as and cs were located in the upstream of the basin while edu and is were located in the downstream the spatial distribution of pp was similar to dc while the spatial distribution of vt was similar to el and sl 3 2 integrated index weights table 5 shows the weights of flood risk assessment indexes calculated by the shapley value and the ahp method both two methods demonstrated that mp el rsc pop and as had large contributions to the demographical risk of which the weights were larger than 0 06 the two methods also demonstrated that md rsc and gdp had large contributions to the economic risk and el rsc and dc contributed to the infrastructural risk while edu ps cs and is had minor contributions to flood risk however the weights of md dr and rsc for the demographical risk mp dr rsc and gdp for the economic risk and md and rsc for the infrastructural risk were quite different between the two methods their differences in the weights were larger than 0 08 in special the weights of rsc had considerable differences between the ahp method and the shapley value which demonstrated the great differences between the actual contributions of assessment indexes to flood loss and the subjective understanding of flood risk in addition flood discharge was referred to as the main driver of flood risk while the weights of md determined by the shapley value were small in the demographical risk and the infrastructural risk the weights determined by the sahp method were also shown in table 5 this method still assigned large weights to the assessment indexes which were supposed to contribute a lot to flood risk by the ahp method and the shapley value such as md mp el and rsc but it also balanced the significant differences of some indexes between the two methods such as md and rsc 3 3 distribution characteristics of flood risk fig 5 shows demographical economic ecological and infrastructural risks in the han river basin it demonstrates that the demographical economic and infrastructural risks decreased from the northwest to the center of the han river basin and then increased from the center to the southeast the regions with small risk values were adjacent to the danjiangkou reservoir the regions with large risk values were mainly located in the source area and the northeast of the han river basin additionally some high risk regions were distributed along the river and the risk values gradually decreased far away from the river the ecological risk increased from the northwest to the southeast the regions with high ecological risk were mainly located in the midstream and the downstream of the han river basin while the regions with low risk were mainly located in the upstream except for the source area fig 6 shows the dbi and chc values for different class numbers the dbi results showed that six clusters could well represent flood risk levels in the han river basin the chc results showed that the ten flood risk levels had the largest chc value however there were still significant similarities between different flood risk levels when flood risk was divided into ten levels while the differences were conspicuous when flood risk was divided into six levels hence based on the clustering results dbi and chc the flood risk was clustered into six levels fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of flood risk class 1 6 accounted for 5 12 34 51 4 52 19 13 23 35 and 13 37 of the area of the han river basin fig 8 shows statistical boxplots of multi dimensional flood risk values of different flood risk level classes class 1 was referred to as the low risk it was characterized by small demographical risk small economic risk and small infrastructural risk but medium ecological risk it was mainly adjacent to the danjiangkou reservoir class 2 was referred to as the high risk its four sub risk values were the largest among the six flood risk levels the average values of the demographical risk the economic risk the ecological risk and the infrastructural risk were 0 47 0 49 0 76 and 0 46 respectively class 2 was mainly located in the middle and lower reaches of the han river basin and the regions along the han river in the upstream the four sub risk of class 3 were the smallest and the average values were 0 29 0 35 0 16 and 0 28 respectively therefore we referred to class 3 as the very low risk it was scattered in the regions same as class 1 class 4 was characterized by the second largest demographical economic and infrastructural risks and the second smallest ecological risk class 5 was similar to class 4 but was characterized by the third largest ecological risk hence class 4 and class 5 were referred to as the middle risk and the middle high risk respectively both of them were mainly distributed in the upstream but class 4 was mainly located in the source area both statistical and distribution characteristics of class 6 were similar to class 1 although the ecological risk of class 6 was larger here we referred to class 6 as middle low risk fig 9 shows statistical boxplots of flood risk assessment index values of different flood risk levels for hazard indexes the high risk regions were characterized by large md mp dc and small el sl and dr while the very low low and middle low risk regions were characterized by large el sl and rsc but small md and mp for exposure and vulnerability the high risk regions were characterized by large pop as gdp id and is but small ec and vt while these assessment indexes in the very low low and middle low risk regions showed the opposite characteristics fig 10 shows the proportion of different flood risk levels and multi dimensional flood risk values in municipal districts high development levels urban areas and counties low development levels rural areas the proportions of high risk and middle low risk in municipal districts were larger than in counties and the average proportions of the han river basin especially the proportion of high risk was 53 41 and was more than twice the proportions of counties the proportions of middle high risk and middle risk in counties were larger than the average proportions of the whole basin specifically although the average values of the economic risk and the infrastructural risk in municipal districts and counties were similar these two risks in municipal districts were more concentrated than in counties which meant that municipal districts faced greater risks ecological risk in municipal districts was significantly larger than in counties while the demographical risk was slightly greater in counties than in municipal districts fig 11 shows statistical boxplots of flood risk assessment index values in the municipal district and the county for hazard indexes municipal districts showed larger md mp and rsc while counties were characterized by larger api el and sl the ranges of dc and dr were similar in municipal districts and counties but the average dc of municipal districts was larger than counties for exposure and vulnerability indexes pop gdp ps pp id and rd were larger in the municipal districts than in counties while as ec vt and is were larger in counties the ranges and averages of edu in municipal districts were larger than in counties while both the ranges and averages of cs were larger in counties 4 discussion 4 1 multi dimensional flood risk assessment flood risk assessment is an effective study that provides information support for flood management lai et al 2016 lyu et al 2019 wang et al 2015 xu et al 2018 yang et al 2021 however ignorance of the differences between economic demographical ecological and infrastructural sub systems in existing studies might result in inaccurate flood risk assessment results kubal et al 2009 an improvement of our study lies in the constructed flood risk assessment index system from demographic economic ecological and infrastructural categories the constructed index system ensures that the mdfra framework comprehensively and reasonably assesses flood risk from the four aspects wherein as and edu were used to describe demographical vulnerability and some studies have proven that people with high education levels can better cope with floods martins and nunes 2020 while the children the elderly and the weak are the most vulnerable ma et al 2021 ps and cs were used to describe economic vulnerability which reflected the resilience of different crops and production to flood haraguchi and lall 2015 klaus et al 2016 in addition pp and vt which reflected the potential pollution and the resistance of the local ecological environment were used to reflect ecological vulnerability kubal et al 2009 scheuer et al 2011 while rd and is were used to describe infrastructural vulnerability most studies used meteorological indexes hydrological indexes and geographical indexes to assess flood risk tayyab et al 2021 wang et al 2021 which suggests that meteorological hydrological and geographical indexes have been deemed the most important impact factors of flood hazard in advance however few studies incorporated flood control capacity into the flood risk assessment index system although the great impacts of dams and reservoirs on flood hazards have been proven tang et al 2019 wan et al 2018 to bridge this gap the indexes rsc and dc which represented the reservoir regulation and storage capacity and the drainage capacity of cities lin et al 2020 xu et al 2018 were applied to assess flood hazard the flood risk assessment result ties well with previous studies and historical records song 2017 wang 2020 for example nanyang city located in the northeast of the han river basin was flooded in 2020 and the flood had damaged 118 dikes or revetments 196 ponds 122 rural power supplies and 143 rural irrigation facilities xiangyang city located in the midstream of the han river basin suffered severely from the 2016 flood disaster and the flood affected 58800 people and 123900 mu of crops with a direct economic loss of 218 17 million rmb both two cities were identified as high risk regions in the present study furthermore the assessment result shows that multi dimensional flood risk assessment provides more detailed risk information although class 1 and class 6 were referred to as low risk and middle low risk respectively ecological risk in both two flood risk levels was high which means that it is still necessary to implement protection in these regions to reduce pollution and ecological damage on the other hand even if class 4 was referred to as middle risk its ecological risk was low which indicates that we can reduce the investment in ecological protection here and pay more attention to demographical economic and infrastructural risks the mdfra framework presents flood risk more realistically and more comprehensively and shows high flexibility which can be easily extended to multiple scenarios single risk e g only economic risk or risks of any combinations e g a combination of economic and ecologic risk 4 2 spatial heterogeneity of flood risk flood risk is a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors and is also the product of combined actions of hazard exposure and vulnerability elshorbagy et al 2017 winsemius et al 2013 zou et al 2013 as pop gdp and id were positive factors for the flood risk and there is highly positive inter dependency among demography economy and infrastructure liu et al 2023 qiu et al 2022 the spatial distributions of demographical economic and infrastructural risks were similar as social economic development encroaches on the natural environment wang et al 2018 yu et al 2011 the more developed regions faced greater ecological risk however these regular patterns were not always true across the han river basin urban development strategies such as returning farmland to forests ensuring urban green areas and building sponge cities fu et al 2022 sun and li 2021 reduce ecological risk in high development level regions in addition the similarity of spatial distribution between the very low low and low middle risks or between the middle and middle high risks is related to the spatial continuity of flood hazard factors and social economic development levels however there were several risk levels in the same region reflecting the imbalances within the region such as the uneven development between center and rural areas of the same city in line with previous studies elshorbagy et al 2017 lin et al 2020 xu et al 2018 high risk regions were characterized by large md mp pop gdp and is but small el sl and dr there is no doubt about the positive contributions of discharge precipitation population density and economy to flood risk supported by multitudinous achievements ji et al 2013 morita 2014 shi et al 2019 however here a noticeable difference is that very low or low risk regions were not fully characterized by the opposite features which increases the difficulty of flood risk mitigation this reflects the complexity of flood risk and is likely linked to uneven social development and other human interventions for example jingshan city located in the downstream of the han river basin was mainly a middle risk region while it was surrounded by high risk regions it was characterized by similar hazard indexes to surrounding high risk regions but lower development levels including small pop gdp and other vulnerability indexes danjiangkou city was mainly a very low risk region due to the operation of the danjiangkou reservoir the distribution characteristics of flood risk in municipal districts and counties indicate that urban regions are still the key object for flood management due to the great proportion of high risk areas however flood risk in rural areas also deserves attention as the proportion of middle high risk areas in counties was significantly higher than the basin average although the population density and gdp density in counties were low the low education level and the high proportion of the old and the weak might make the counties suffer great losses from floods in addition the weak regulation storage and drainage capacities in counties are also the reasons for the high proportion of middle high risk areas 4 3 flood risk mitigation constructing the complete basin wide flood control engineering system is currently one of the important strategies for flood risk mitigation in the han river basin hu et al 2022 hu 2021 the han river basin has basically formed a flood control engineering system based on embankments reservoirs flood storage detention areas and river training projects and the danjiangkou reservoir is the core of this engineering system chen et al 2022 zhang et al 2023 our study has also revealed the great effects of the reservoir regulation and storage capacity on mitigating flood risk and demonstrates the effectiveness of this basin wide engineering system however the high risk regions were mainly located in the middle lower reaches and the regions along the upstream stream way the goal of the engineering system which focuses on ensuring downstream safety poses a high risk of loss to the regions along the upstream stream way massive studies have emphasized the necessity of changing from flood control to flood management which requires the establishment of a flood management system with equal emphasis on engineering measures and non engineering measures abdrabo et al 2020 cheng 2010 meyer et al 2012 however there are still some gaps between the current flood control engineering system in the han river basin and the flood management system although the engineering measures are sufficient urban areas still face great ecological risk due to the concentration of the population and property and the poor ecological environment rural areas face greater demographic risk due to low education level and the high proportion of the elder and the weak these factors leading to high risk are hard to be changed or alleviated through engineering measures and indicate that implementing engineering measures alone cannot meet the current flood risk mitigation requirement despite the current implementation of returning farmland to forests ensuring urban green areas and building sponge cities fu et al 2022 sun and li 2021 more non engineering measures are required including evacuating urban functions improving the education level and taking more actions to protect the elderly and the weak additionally flood warning systems an efficient non engineering measure for flood prevention and mitigation lin et al 2020 have been used by the government in the han river basin it is necessary to improve its audience scope accuracy and foresight period in the future 4 4 limitation and uncertainty flood risk at the basin scale is a complex phenomenon arising from the co evolution of climate underlying surface conditions social economic level and human interventions winsemius et al 2013 zhou et al 2012 although we employed the mdfra framework to comprehensively assess flood risk from demographical economic ecological and infrastructural dimensions there are still some limitations 1 the sahp method is characterized by the advantages of low requirement in data while its accuracy depends on the flood loss records missing and incorrect records might bring uncertainty to the risk assessment result 2 current inadequate risk understanding limits the further expansion of the mdfra framework applying the mdfra framework in other regions and scales requires to re identify local hazard exposure and vulnerability factors 3 compared with regional applications a critical gap is the great uneven regional development in the large scale study the difficulty to assess flood risk on a large scale is how to overcome the uneven development to accurately determine the index weights given the limitations highlighted future studies into flood risk assessment should start with obtaining more detailed monitoring data particularly flood loss records through more measures e g satellite data social media etc baranowski et al 2020 de bruijn et al 2019 tellman et al 2021 some studies have employed satellite data to assess flood loss li et al 2022 qamer et al 2023 schumann et al 2018 and thus the requirement for more detailed flood loss data may shift toward improving satellite business during flood disasters and accurate flood loss assessment based on satellite data in the future further research on the mechanisms of natural or anthropogenic factors on flood risk should be implemented to expand present achievements of distribution characteristics of flood risk 5 conclusion this study was conducted to construct the mdfra framework to improve flood risk assessment for this purpose a comprehensive flood risk assessment index system consisting of eight hazard indexes four exposure indexes and eight vulnerability indexes in demographic economic ecological and infrastructural categories was constructed to assess flood risk the integrated sahp method was used to determine index weights subsequently the possibilistic fuzzy c means algorithm was employed to identify flood risk levels finally the distribution characteristics of flood risk in the han river basin were revealed using the mdfra framework the major findings are listed as follows 1 the mdfra framework constructs a more reasonable flood risk assessment index system and exhibits good suitability for practical application the framework assessing flood risk from four aspects presents flood risk more realistically and more comprehensively and reveals the flood risk composition which provides more detailed risk information for flood management additionally the mdfra framework shows high flexibility and can be easily extended to multiple scenarios and other river basins under similar potential flood threats 2 flood risk in the han river basin was clustered into six levels i e the very low low middle low middle middle high and high risk accounting for 4 52 5 12 13 37 19 13 23 35 and 34 51 of the whole han river basin the very low low and middle low risks were mainly adjacent to the danjiangkou reservoir the middle and middle high risks were mainly distributed in the upstream the high risk was mainly located in the middle and lower reaches of the han river basin and the regions along the han river in the upstream 3 concentrated precipitation great discharge thin vegetation cover flat terrain dense population and developed economy were the cause of high risk in the han river basin the reservoir regulation and storage capacity had significantly alleviated flood risk but the ecological risk in the low risk and middle low risk regions cannot be ignored rural areas still faced relatively high risk due to low education level the high proportion of the old and the weak and the weak regulation storage and drainage capacities credit authorship

impacts national water resource allocation this study constructed a multi dimensional flood risk assessment mdfra framework combining a comprehensive index system an integrated weight method and a clustering algorithm to assess flood risk in the han river basin we first constructed a comprehensive index system including eight hazard indexes four exposure indexes and eight vulnerability indexes in demographic economic ecological and infrastructural categories to assess flood risk the index weights were determined by the integrated weight method which integrated the shapley value and the analytic hierarchy process method sahp finally the possibilistic fuzzy c means algorithm was employed to identify flood risk levels new hydrological insights for the region the mdfra framework presents flood risk in the han river basin realistically and comprehensively revealing flood risk composition and providing more detailed risk information results show that high risk regions accounted for 34 51 of the basin area and were mainly concentrated in the mid lower reaches while middle risk 19 13 and middle high risk 23 35 regions were mainly distributed in the upstream 4 52 5 12 and 13 37 of the basin area were assigned as very low low and middle low risk regions respectively and were mainly adjacent to the danjiangkou reservoir flood prone natural conditions and dense population and assets were the causes of high flood risk while reservoir regulation and storage capacity had significantly alleviated flood risk graphical abstract ga1 keywords flood risk assessment multi dimensional flood risk integrated weight method possibilistic fuzzy c means algorithm han river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floods are one of the most frequent disasters in the world which could threaten the safety of human lives hinder social development and cause substantial economic losses throughout the world deroliya et al 2022 dong et al 2022 meng et al 2019 xu et al 2018 yang et al 2021 yu et al 2023 climate change and the intensification of human activities have changed the frequency duration and intensity of precipitation and thus influence incidences of floods bui et al 2019 pham et al 2021 additionally the rapid development of society and economy may result in greater flood losses due to increasing population density and ongoing accumulation of value assets z chen et al 2021 x chen et al 2021 kubal et al 2009 floods accounted for 44 of all disasters during 2000 2019 and have affected 1 6 billion people undrr 2020 the no 5 flood peak of the 2020 yangtze river flood affected 0 26 million people and caused a direct economic loss of 2 45 billion yuan xia and chen 2021 the 2012 flood in hanzhong city located in the han river basin resulted in 0 19 million people affected and caused a direct economic loss of 500 million yuan zhang et al 2016 flood risk assessment is a measure and a component of disaster risk management which identifies the risk distributions and provides essential information for disaster reduction contributing to strengthening resilience against and reducing flood losses kreibich et al 2022 although the current definition of risk is diverse a commonly used definition is that risk is the interactions of hazard exposure and vulnerability ipcc 2020 merz et al 2021 thus flood risk assessment is a synthetic assessment that includes three components hazard exposure and vulnerability ipcc 2020 lai et al 2015 merz et al 2021 many methods have been employed to assess flood risk and these methods are divided into three classes lyu et al 2019 xu et al 2018 the historical disaster statistical method black and burns 2002 the multi criteria analysis method de brito et al 2018 pham et al 2021 and the scenario simulation analysis method jang et al 2021 the high requirements of data quantity and quality limit the wider application of the historical disaster statistical method and the scenario simulation analysis method xiao et al 2017 yildirim and demir 2022 the multi criteria analysis method is characterized by the advantages of low requirement in data and high accuracy in results and thus has been widely used to assess flood risk lai et al 2016 wang et al 2015 yang et al 2021 the key concern in the multi criteria analysis method is to construct an entire flood risk assessment index system wu et al 2022 existing studies follow the risk concept and the constructed index system includes three components of hazard exposure and vulnerability pham et al 2021 wu et al 2022 santos et al 2020 employed twelve hazard factors three exposure variables and twenty two vulnerability factors to assess flood risk in portugal lai et al 2015 selected three hazard indexes four exposure indexes and three vulnerability indexes to construct the flood risk assessment index system in the dongjiang river basin these hazard indexes commonly reflect the magnitude and harm of floods and their triggering factors such as maximum flow velocity maximum three day precipitation average elevation and distance to the river lai et al 2015 lai et al 2016 zou et al 2013 the exposure indexes reflect the people properties and infrastructure located in areas with the potential to be affected by floods and usually include population and gross national product amadio et al 2019 chakraborty et al 2021 santos et al 2020 vulnerability is the potential to suffer harm or loss lin et al 2020 zou et al 2013 common indexes include traffic network density urbanization ratio availability and local infrastructure services lin et al 2020 ma et al 2021 pathak et al 2020 however present research regarded the flood risk as the response of the whole human system to floods without considering the differences between various sub systems such as economic demographical ecological and infrastructural systems which lead to a lack of differences in sub system index and could bring great uncertainty to flood assessment results kubal et al 2009 pathak et al 2020 in addition although the great impacts of water conservancy projects on floods have been proven tang et al 2019 wan et al 2018 few studies incorporate the regulation and storage capacity of dams and reservoirs into the flood risk assessment index system hence it is of great importance to construct a more comprehensive index system to assess flood risk from economic demographical ecological and infrastructural dimensions considering the regulation and storage capacity of water conservancy projects another crucial issue to assess flood risk is accurately calculating multiple index weights chen et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 these indexes exhibit different contributions to flood risk due to different disaster causing and response mechanisms a number of methods such as the analytic hierarchy process ahp lin et al 2020 wu et al 2015 the gray fuzzy evaluation ma et al 2022 and the entropy weight method khosravi et al 2016 have been used to determine index weights and can be divided into objective methods and subjective methods preliminarily the analytic hierarchy process ahp method has been widely applied to determine index weights due to its acceptable accuracy and simple usability lin et al 2020 wu et al 2015 however a limitation of the ahp method is its high subjectivity in determining the relative importance of each index depending on the researchers experience and knowledge lin et al 2020 an integrated weight method combining the subjective ahp method and the objective method is a feasible way to get rid of this limitation and accurately determine the index weights flood loss records which contain a large amount of information related to flood risk can help to determine index weights objectively the shapley value which can equitably partition the rewards according to factors contributions has been used to quantify driver contributions to flood peaks yang et al 2020 and allocate the share of each distributed generator in loss and emission reduction veeramsetty 2021 thus the shapley value can make use of the flood loss records to objectively determine index weights and be used to combine with the ahp method furthermore determining flood risk levels is a significant step in flood risk assessment but suffers from the absence of suitable classification standards or common methods ji et al 2013 the clustering algorithm driven by data is a data mining technology and does not need classification thresholds to identify flood risk levels this method has been used to assess aquifer vulnerability javadi et al 2017 establish hydrological regionalization agarwal et al 2016 and evaluate water pollution risk li et al 2016 and thus can be used in flood risk assessment to overcome above difficulty and then provide more accurate results the han river basin is an important grain production base and densely inhabited basin in china hu et al 2021 xu et al 2011 flood risk has increased across the whole basin with climate change increasing population density and ongoing accumulation of valuable assets and varies greatly in spatial distribution due to uneven social development and the great natural condition changes gao et al 2019 wang et al 2020 xiong et al 2021 this study aims to construct a multi dimensional framework for improving flood risk assessment mdfra to assess flood risk in the han river basin more reasonably and comprehensively this framework combined a comprehensive index system an integrated weight method and the possibilistic fuzzy c means algorithm the comprehensive index system including eight hazard indexes four exposure indexes and eight vulnerability indexes in demographic economic ecological and infrastructural categories was constructed to assess flood risk the sahp method of integrating the shapley value and the ahp method was used to determine the weights of indexes subsequently the possibilistic fuzzy c means algorithm was employed to identify flood risk levels finally the mdfra framework was applied in the han river basin to reveal the distribution characteristics of flood risk the specifical objectives are to 1 construct a comprehensive flood risk assessment index system based on the mdfra framework 2 calculate weights of each index using the sahp method 3 determine flood risk levels according to clustering results of the possibilistic fuzzy c means algorithm 4 reveal the distribution characteristics of flood risk across the han river basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the han river fig 1 30 17 34 33 n 106 25 114 33 e area of approximately 1 59 105 km² is the largest tributary of the yangtze river originating from the qin mountain in the shanxi province and flowing through the shanxi province and the hubei province jiang et al 2019 xie et al 2019 as the water source of the middle route project of the south to north water transfer project zhang et al 2022 zhao et al 2020 water security in the han river basin deeply impacts the allocation of national water resources and coordinated regional development the whole han river basin is geographically divided into the upstream the midstream and the downstream by danjiangkou station and zhongxiang station zhang et al 2022 zhu et al 2008 the han river basin is located in the subtropical monsoon climate with annual average precipitation varying from 700 to 1000 mm and annual average temperature ranging from 12 to 16 c zhou et al 2017 the topography of the han river basin changes from the western medium low mountains to the eastern hilly plain and the shape of an inverted trumpet of the water system results in poor flood capacity xie et al 2019 in addition the han river basin is an important grain producing area a densely inhabited area and an important part of the yangtze river economic belt strong precipitation concentration large topographic changes relatively developed economy and dense population have led to great flood risk in the han river basin which brings great challenges to flood management zhang et al 2022 zhao et al 2021 2 2 data the collected data for this study included runoff data precipitation data geographical data social economic data hydraulic engineering information data and reported loss data detailed information was shown in table 1 daily runoff series were obtained from 17 hydrological stations evenly distributed in the han river basin while daily precipitation series were obtained from 53 meteorological stations geographical data included digital elevation model dem normalized difference vegetation index ndvi vegetation type night light data river vector data and road information data social economic data included population density gross national product gdp density crop structure transport volume population gdp dependency ratio education level pipe length data and sewage discharge hydraulic engineering information data included the longitude latitude and storage capacity of the dams and reservoirs 2 3 framework for flood risk assessment flood risk assessment aims to accurately grasp the distribution characteristics of flood risk by comprehensively evaluating natural and social attributes of floods xu et al 2018 involving multiple disciplines of engineering social economic and environmental sciences pathak et al 2020 uneven emphasis on demographical economic ecological and infrastructural risks in existing studies might lead to great uncertainty in flood risk assessment based on this this study proposed a multi dimensional flood risk assessment mdfra framework fig 2 shows the flowchart of the application of the mdfra framework the mdfra framework consisted of four steps firstly we constructed the comprehensive flood risk assessment index system to assess flood risk the spatial distributions of these indexes were quantified by frequency analysis and gis technique or obtained from remote sensing open street map and survey records subsequently the shapley value and the ahp method sahp were integrated to determine the weights of each index finally the possibilistic fuzzy c means algorithm was employed to identify flood risk levels the specific methods and the flood risk assessment index system are presented in the following sections the mdfra framework deemed that flood risk consisted of demographic economic ecological and infrastructural risks demographic risk refers to the flood risk caused by the interaction of flood hazards and the vulnerability of exposed populations pathak et al 2020 economic risk refers to the probable financial losses caused by floods pathak et al 2020 scheuer et al 2011 ecological risk is considered the associated impacts of contamination on the surroundings through floods or possible damage to ecological environment caused by floods kubal et al 2009 infrastructural risk corresponds to the interruptions of public infrastructural services and their associated impacts on society or the economy chakraborty et al 2021 flood risk assessment followed the hazard exposure vulnerability h e v framework where the definition of risk can be expressed by eq 1 1 r f h e v i 1 n 1 k ω i h i j 1 m 1 k ω j e j t 1 l 1 k ω t v t where h i e j and v t represent the ith hazard index the jth exposure index and the tth vulnerability index respectively ω i ω j and ω t are the weights of the ith hazard index the jth exposure index and the tth vulnerability index respectively the value of k is 1 when the index h i e j or v t shows negative contributions to the flood risk while when the index h i e j or v t positively correlates with the flood risk the value of k is 2 2 4 comprehensive index system in this study the flood risk assessment index system table 2 consisted of eight hazard indexes four exposure indexes and eight vulnerability indexes in demographic economic ecological and infrastructural categories detailed information is given in table 2 to eliminate the impacts of units dimensions and magnitudes of the indexes all assessment indexes were normalized in the range between 0 and 1 more details in chen 2022 and wu et al 2015 specifically indexes included annual maximum discharge md and annual maximum 1 d precipitation mp these two indexes directly reflect the magnitude and harm of flood and precipitation areal md and mp were calculated using the inverse distance weight idw method meng et al 2019 antecedent precipitation index api this index reflects antecedent wetness conditions and shows a positive relationship with flood hazard areal api was also calculated using the idw method elevation el and slope sl these two indexes reflect the topographical condition and topographic change respectively distance to river dr this index reflects the distance between the area and the river areas near the river may be prone to flooding while areas far away from rivers are safe reservoir regulation and storage capacity rsc and urban drainage capacity dc these two indexes are reservoir regulation and storage capacity and urban drainage capacity and they can decrease the degree of flood hazard the spatial distribution of rsc referred to the method of wu et al 2015 pipe length was used to represent urban drainage capacity population density pop gdp density gdp ecological level ec and infrastructural density id these four indexes reflect the people properties ecology and infrastructure located in areas with the potential to be affected by floods the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was used to represent the ecological level the night light dataset was used to represent the infrastructural density demographic vulnerability indexes included age structure as and education level edu economic vulnerability indexes included production structure ps and crop structure cs ecological vulnerability indexes included potential pollution pp and vegetation type vt infrastructural vulnerability indexes included road density rd and infrastructural service is wherein as ps pp and is were obtained from dependency ratio gdp structure sewage discharge and transport volume data respectively among these vulnerability indexes as ps pp rd and is showed a positive relationship with vulnerability while edu cs and vt showed a negative relationship with vulnerability 2 5 integrated weight method the sahp method was an integrated weight method for determining the weights of each flood risk assessment index which integrated the ahp method based on the researchers experience and knowledge and the shapley value based on the contributions of assessment indexes to reported flood losses the weights calculated by the sahp method are as follows 2 ω α ω a β ω s where ω is the weights calculated by the sahp method ω a is the weights calculated by the ahp method ω s is the weights calculated by the shapley value method α and β denote the corresponding weight of the two sub weights and were used to maximize the balance between subjective intention and objective impartiality the application of the ahp method to getting weights ω a can refer to existing studies bunmi mudashiru et al 2022 jenifer and jha 2017 the shapley value more details in appendix a originating from the n person game theory was used to partition the contributions of the assessment indexes to flood losses it depicts the average change in the rewards across all possible coalitions of existing participants when a new player joins them yang et al 2020 in this study the shapley value of one index is its average marginal contribution to a flood loss across all possible coalitions of other indexes its mathematical description is shown as follows 3 ω s i s n i p n p 1 n v s i v s where n is the number of indexes v is the gain function s is a coalition of indexes indexes 1 p ω s i is the contributions added by the new index i based on the coalition s 2 6 determining flood risk levels the unsupervised possibilistic fuzzy c means algorithm was used to divide flood risk into different risk levels askari 2021 the key to applying this clustering algorithm is to set the c value and the c value was set as 2 10 to determine flood risk levels in this study davies bouldin index dbi and calinski harabasz score chc were employed to evaluate the effectiveness of resulting clusters this operation was repeated 1000 times to determine the optimal flood risk level number namely the c value in each operation dbi and chc were calculated to detect the best clustering results the dbi and chc are calculated as follows 4 d b i 1 k i 1 k max j i σ i σ j d c i c j 5 c h c s s b k 1 s s w n k where c i is the cluster center of the ith cluster σ i is the average distance between each point in cluster i and its center d is the distance between the cluster center c i and c j k is the number of clusters n is the number of all data ss b is the interclass variance ss w is the intraclass variance 2 7 frequency analysis frequency analysis was used to quantify flood risk assessment indexes such as mp and md arnaud et al 2017 han et al 2022 according to the commonly used distribution of precipitation or runoff in china z chen et al 2021 x chen et al 2021 hao et al 2019 xu and huang 2011 four candidate distributions were selected to choose the best fitted distribution of precipitation and runoff including the pearson type iii distribution p ⅲ the lognormal distribution with three parameters ln3 the gumbel distribution gumbel and the generalized extreme value distribution gev the probability density functions of these four candidate distributions are described in table 3 rmse akaike information criteria aic kim et al 2017 and bayesian information criteria bic li et al 2021 were used to select the best fitted distribution and are also described in table 3 according to the current flood control demand in the han river basin zhou and mei 2011 we selected precipitation and runoff with a return period of 100 years as extreme precipitation and runoff 3 results 3 1 quantification and spatial distribution of indexes the results of fitting for md at 17 hydrological stations and mp at 24 sample meteorological stations are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively it was found that the fitting lines of the p iii distribution the gumbel distribution and the gev distribution were close to the empirical probability points while the fitting lines of the ln3 distribution deviated from the empirical points especially in the hydrological stations baih hanz shiq and xiant and the meteorological stations hanz taib and zuos the fitting effects i e average aic bic and rmse values of different distributions for md and mp are shown in table 4 combining the fitting lines and the fitting effects the gev distribution was chosen to calculate the md value with a 100 year return period while the p iii distribution was chosen to calculate the mp value with a 100 year return period the spatial distributions of mp md and the other six flood hazard indexes are shown in fig s1 the spatial distributions of four exposure indexes and eight vulnerability indexes in four dimensions are shown in fig s2 the values of md mp api and rsc were small in the northwest but large in the southeast while the distribution characteristics of el sl and dc were the opposite the values of rsc were larger in the central han river basin adjacent to the danjiangkou reservoir than in other areas dc showed an increasing trend from the upper to the lower han river basin and the regions with large values marked by red were located in the large cities chongqing and wuhan pop gdp id and rd were small in the west but large in the east some scattered points with large values of these indexes were located in the downtowns of multiple cities there were some regions with large as edu cs and is values in the northeast of the han river basin other regions with large values of as and cs were located in the upstream of the basin while edu and is were located in the downstream the spatial distribution of pp was similar to dc while the spatial distribution of vt was similar to el and sl 3 2 integrated index weights table 5 shows the weights of flood risk assessment indexes calculated by the shapley value and the ahp method both two methods demonstrated that mp el rsc pop and as had large contributions to the demographical risk of which the weights were larger than 0 06 the two methods also demonstrated that md rsc and gdp had large contributions to the economic risk and el rsc and dc contributed to the infrastructural risk while edu ps cs and is had minor contributions to flood risk however the weights of md dr and rsc for the demographical risk mp dr rsc and gdp for the economic risk and md and rsc for the infrastructural risk were quite different between the two methods their differences in the weights were larger than 0 08 in special the weights of rsc had considerable differences between the ahp method and the shapley value which demonstrated the great differences between the actual contributions of assessment indexes to flood loss and the subjective understanding of flood risk in addition flood discharge was referred to as the main driver of flood risk while the weights of md determined by the shapley value were small in the demographical risk and the infrastructural risk the weights determined by the sahp method were also shown in table 5 this method still assigned large weights to the assessment indexes which were supposed to contribute a lot to flood risk by the ahp method and the shapley value such as md mp el and rsc but it also balanced the significant differences of some indexes between the two methods such as md and rsc 3 3 distribution characteristics of flood risk fig 5 shows demographical economic ecological and infrastructural risks in the han river basin it demonstrates that the demographical economic and infrastructural risks decreased from the northwest to the center of the han river basin and then increased from the center to the southeast the regions with small risk values were adjacent to the danjiangkou reservoir the regions with large risk values were mainly located in the source area and the northeast of the han river basin additionally some high risk regions were distributed along the river and the risk values gradually decreased far away from the river the ecological risk increased from the northwest to the southeast the regions with high ecological risk were mainly located in the midstream and the downstream of the han river basin while the regions with low risk were mainly located in the upstream except for the source area fig 6 shows the dbi and chc values for different class numbers the dbi results showed that six clusters could well represent flood risk levels in the han river basin the chc results showed that the ten flood risk levels had the largest chc value however there were still significant similarities between different flood risk levels when flood risk was divided into ten levels while the differences were conspicuous when flood risk was divided into six levels hence based on the clustering results dbi and chc the flood risk was clustered into six levels fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of flood risk class 1 6 accounted for 5 12 34 51 4 52 19 13 23 35 and 13 37 of the area of the han river basin fig 8 shows statistical boxplots of multi dimensional flood risk values of different flood risk level classes class 1 was referred to as the low risk it was characterized by small demographical risk small economic risk and small infrastructural risk but medium ecological risk it was mainly adjacent to the danjiangkou reservoir class 2 was referred to as the high risk its four sub risk values were the largest among the six flood risk levels the average values of the demographical risk the economic risk the ecological risk and the infrastructural risk were 0 47 0 49 0 76 and 0 46 respectively class 2 was mainly located in the middle and lower reaches of the han river basin and the regions along the han river in the upstream the four sub risk of class 3 were the smallest and the average values were 0 29 0 35 0 16 and 0 28 respectively therefore we referred to class 3 as the very low risk it was scattered in the regions same as class 1 class 4 was characterized by the second largest demographical economic and infrastructural risks and the second smallest ecological risk class 5 was similar to class 4 but was characterized by the third largest ecological risk hence class 4 and class 5 were referred to as the middle risk and the middle high risk respectively both of them were mainly distributed in the upstream but class 4 was mainly located in the source area both statistical and distribution characteristics of class 6 were similar to class 1 although the ecological risk of class 6 was larger here we referred to class 6 as middle low risk fig 9 shows statistical boxplots of flood risk assessment index values of different flood risk levels for hazard indexes the high risk regions were characterized by large md mp dc and small el sl and dr while the very low low and middle low risk regions were characterized by large el sl and rsc but small md and mp for exposure and vulnerability the high risk regions were characterized by large pop as gdp id and is but small ec and vt while these assessment indexes in the very low low and middle low risk regions showed the opposite characteristics fig 10 shows the proportion of different flood risk levels and multi dimensional flood risk values in municipal districts high development levels urban areas and counties low development levels rural areas the proportions of high risk and middle low risk in municipal districts were larger than in counties and the average proportions of the han river basin especially the proportion of high risk was 53 41 and was more than twice the proportions of counties the proportions of middle high risk and middle risk in counties were larger than the average proportions of the whole basin specifically although the average values of the economic risk and the infrastructural risk in municipal districts and counties were similar these two risks in municipal districts were more concentrated than in counties which meant that municipal districts faced greater risks ecological risk in municipal districts was significantly larger than in counties while the demographical risk was slightly greater in counties than in municipal districts fig 11 shows statistical boxplots of flood risk assessment index values in the municipal district and the county for hazard indexes municipal districts showed larger md mp and rsc while counties were characterized by larger api el and sl the ranges of dc and dr were similar in municipal districts and counties but the average dc of municipal districts was larger than counties for exposure and vulnerability indexes pop gdp ps pp id and rd were larger in the municipal districts than in counties while as ec vt and is were larger in counties the ranges and averages of edu in municipal districts were larger than in counties while both the ranges and averages of cs were larger in counties 4 discussion 4 1 multi dimensional flood risk assessment flood risk assessment is an effective study that provides information support for flood management lai et al 2016 lyu et al 2019 wang et al 2015 xu et al 2018 yang et al 2021 however ignorance of the differences between economic demographical ecological and infrastructural sub systems in existing studies might result in inaccurate flood risk assessment results kubal et al 2009 an improvement of our study lies in the constructed flood risk assessment index system from demographic economic ecological and infrastructural categories the constructed index system ensures that the mdfra framework comprehensively and reasonably assesses flood risk from the four aspects wherein as and edu were used to describe demographical vulnerability and some studies have proven that people with high education levels can better cope with floods martins and nunes 2020 while the children the elderly and the weak are the most vulnerable ma et al 2021 ps and cs were used to describe economic vulnerability which reflected the resilience of different crops and production to flood haraguchi and lall 2015 klaus et al 2016 in addition pp and vt which reflected the potential pollution and the resistance of the local ecological environment were used to reflect ecological vulnerability kubal et al 2009 scheuer et al 2011 while rd and is were used to describe infrastructural vulnerability most studies used meteorological indexes hydrological indexes and geographical indexes to assess flood risk tayyab et al 2021 wang et al 2021 which suggests that meteorological hydrological and geographical indexes have been deemed the most important impact factors of flood hazard in advance however few studies incorporated flood control capacity into the flood risk assessment index system although the great impacts of dams and reservoirs on flood hazards have been proven tang et al 2019 wan et al 2018 to bridge this gap the indexes rsc and dc which represented the reservoir regulation and storage capacity and the drainage capacity of cities lin et al 2020 xu et al 2018 were applied to assess flood hazard the flood risk assessment result ties well with previous studies and historical records song 2017 wang 2020 for example nanyang city located in the northeast of the han river basin was flooded in 2020 and the flood had damaged 118 dikes or revetments 196 ponds 122 rural power supplies and 143 rural irrigation facilities xiangyang city located in the midstream of the han river basin suffered severely from the 2016 flood disaster and the flood affected 58800 people and 123900 mu of crops with a direct economic loss of 218 17 million rmb both two cities were identified as high risk regions in the present study furthermore the assessment result shows that multi dimensional flood risk assessment provides more detailed risk information although class 1 and class 6 were referred to as low risk and middle low risk respectively ecological risk in both two flood risk levels was high which means that it is still necessary to implement protection in these regions to reduce pollution and ecological damage on the other hand even if class 4 was referred to as middle risk its ecological risk was low which indicates that we can reduce the investment in ecological protection here and pay more attention to demographical economic and infrastructural risks the mdfra framework presents flood risk more realistically and more comprehensively and shows high flexibility which can be easily extended to multiple scenarios single risk e g only economic risk or risks of any combinations e g a combination of economic and ecologic risk 4 2 spatial heterogeneity of flood risk flood risk is a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors and is also the product of combined actions of hazard exposure and vulnerability elshorbagy et al 2017 winsemius et al 2013 zou et al 2013 as pop gdp and id were positive factors for the flood risk and there is highly positive inter dependency among demography economy and infrastructure liu et al 2023 qiu et al 2022 the spatial distributions of demographical economic and infrastructural risks were similar as social economic development encroaches on the natural environment wang et al 2018 yu et al 2011 the more developed regions faced greater ecological risk however these regular patterns were not always true across the han river basin urban development strategies such as returning farmland to forests ensuring urban green areas and building sponge cities fu et al 2022 sun and li 2021 reduce ecological risk in high development level regions in addition the similarity of spatial distribution between the very low low and low middle risks or between the middle and middle high risks is related to the spatial continuity of flood hazard factors and social economic development levels however there were several risk levels in the same region reflecting the imbalances within the region such as the uneven development between center and rural areas of the same city in line with previous studies elshorbagy et al 2017 lin et al 2020 xu et al 2018 high risk regions were characterized by large md mp pop gdp and is but small el sl and dr there is no doubt about the positive contributions of discharge precipitation population density and economy to flood risk supported by multitudinous achievements ji et al 2013 morita 2014 shi et al 2019 however here a noticeable difference is that very low or low risk regions were not fully characterized by the opposite features which increases the difficulty of flood risk mitigation this reflects the complexity of flood risk and is likely linked to uneven social development and other human interventions for example jingshan city located in the downstream of the han river basin was mainly a middle risk region while it was surrounded by high risk regions it was characterized by similar hazard indexes to surrounding high risk regions but lower development levels including small pop gdp and other vulnerability indexes danjiangkou city was mainly a very low risk region due to the operation of the danjiangkou reservoir the distribution characteristics of flood risk in municipal districts and counties indicate that urban regions are still the key object for flood management due to the great proportion of high risk areas however flood risk in rural areas also deserves attention as the proportion of middle high risk areas in counties was significantly higher than the basin average although the population density and gdp density in counties were low the low education level and the high proportion of the old and the weak might make the counties suffer great losses from floods in addition the weak regulation storage and drainage capacities in counties are also the reasons for the high proportion of middle high risk areas 4 3 flood risk mitigation constructing the complete basin wide flood control engineering system is currently one of the important strategies for flood risk mitigation in the han river basin hu et al 2022 hu 2021 the han river basin has basically formed a flood control engineering system based on embankments reservoirs flood storage detention areas and river training projects and the danjiangkou reservoir is the core of this engineering system chen et al 2022 zhang et al 2023 our study has also revealed the great effects of the reservoir regulation and storage capacity on mitigating flood risk and demonstrates the effectiveness of this basin wide engineering system however the high risk regions were mainly located in the middle lower reaches and the regions along the upstream stream way the goal of the engineering system which focuses on ensuring downstream safety poses a high risk of loss to the regions along the upstream stream way massive studies have emphasized the necessity of changing from flood control to flood management which requires the establishment of a flood management system with equal emphasis on engineering measures and non engineering measures abdrabo et al 2020 cheng 2010 meyer et al 2012 however there are still some gaps between the current flood control engineering system in the han river basin and the flood management system although the engineering measures are sufficient urban areas still face great ecological risk due to the concentration of the population and property and the poor ecological environment rural areas face greater demographic risk due to low education level and the high proportion of the elder and the weak these factors leading to high risk are hard to be changed or alleviated through engineering measures and indicate that implementing engineering measures alone cannot meet the current flood risk mitigation requirement despite the current implementation of returning farmland to forests ensuring urban green areas and building sponge cities fu et al 2022 sun and li 2021 more non engineering measures are required including evacuating urban functions improving the education level and taking more actions to protect the elderly and the weak additionally flood warning systems an efficient non engineering measure for flood prevention and mitigation lin et al 2020 have been used by the government in the han river basin it is necessary to improve its audience scope accuracy and foresight period in the future 4 4 limitation and uncertainty flood risk at the basin scale is a complex phenomenon arising from the co evolution of climate underlying surface conditions social economic level and human interventions winsemius et al 2013 zhou et al 2012 although we employed the mdfra framework to comprehensively assess flood risk from demographical economic ecological and infrastructural dimensions there are still some limitations 1 the sahp method is characterized by the advantages of low requirement in data while its accuracy depends on the flood loss records missing and incorrect records might bring uncertainty to the risk assessment result 2 current inadequate risk understanding limits the further expansion of the mdfra framework applying the mdfra framework in other regions and scales requires to re identify local hazard exposure and vulnerability factors 3 compared with regional applications a critical gap is the great uneven regional development in the large scale study the difficulty to assess flood risk on a large scale is how to overcome the uneven development to accurately determine the index weights given the limitations highlighted future studies into flood risk assessment should start with obtaining more detailed monitoring data particularly flood loss records through more measures e g satellite data social media etc baranowski et al 2020 de bruijn et al 2019 tellman et al 2021 some studies have employed satellite data to assess flood loss li et al 2022 qamer et al 2023 schumann et al 2018 and thus the requirement for more detailed flood loss data may shift toward improving satellite business during flood disasters and accurate flood loss assessment based on satellite data in the future further research on the mechanisms of natural or anthropogenic factors on flood risk should be implemented to expand present achievements of distribution characteristics of flood risk 5 conclusion this study was conducted to construct the mdfra framework to improve flood risk assessment for this purpose a comprehensive flood risk assessment index system consisting of eight hazard indexes four exposure indexes and eight vulnerability indexes in demographic economic ecological and infrastructural categories was constructed to assess flood risk the integrated sahp method was used to determine index weights subsequently the possibilistic fuzzy c means algorithm was employed to identify flood risk levels finally the distribution characteristics of flood risk in the han river basin were revealed using the mdfra framework the major findings are listed as follows 1 the mdfra framework constructs a more reasonable flood risk assessment index system and exhibits good suitability for practical application the framework assessing flood risk from four aspects presents flood risk more realistically and more comprehensively and reveals the flood risk composition which provides more detailed risk information for flood management additionally the mdfra framework shows high flexibility and can be easily extended to multiple scenarios and other river basins under similar potential flood threats 2 flood risk in the han river basin was clustered into six levels i e the very low low middle low middle middle high and high risk accounting for 4 52 5 12 13 37 19 13 23 35 and 34 51 of the whole han river basin the very low low and middle low risks were mainly adjacent to the danjiangkou reservoir the middle and middle high risks were mainly distributed in the upstream the high risk was mainly located in the middle and lower reaches of the han river basin and the regions along the han river in the upstream 3 concentrated precipitation great discharge thin vegetation cover flat terrain dense population and developed economy were the cause of high risk in the han river basin the reservoir regulation and storage capacity had significantly alleviated flood risk but the ecological risk in the low risk and middle low risk regions cannot be ignored rural areas still faced relatively high risk due to low education level the high proportion of the old and the weak and the weak regulation storage and drainage capacities credit authorship

86p998chhx 1 all other necessary data needed to evaluate the conclusions in this study are available in the main text or supplementary material 1 introduction the rapidly growing population of sub saharan africa expected to double by 2050 is increasing the demand for water resources and threatening the limited water supply united nations 2020 the availability of surface water in sub saharan climates is minimal and requires increased exploitation of groundwater to meet the increasing demand groundwater resources in sub saharan africa predominantly lie in weathered and fractured crystalline basement aquifers which occupy 40 of the land area and provide water resources to 220 million people fig 1 acworth 1987 wright 1992 macdonald and davies 2000 however basement aquifers have a limited supply and additional strains by global climate change limit potential recharge dai 2013 wu et al 2020 due to these constraints basement aquifers are difficult targets for successful detection using conventional drilling or wildcatting acworth 1987 additionally basement groundwater sources are complex which presents challenges in the characterization of the aquifers wright 1992 generally in areas of shallow weathered crystalline basement like much of sub saharan africa where tropical to inter tropical climatic conditions dominate five zones of the weathering profile can be observed fig 2a acworth 1987 wright 1992 in order of increasing depth the profile includes a residual soil or collapsed zone derived from prolonged dissolution and leaching of weathered bedrock it is generally a lateritic red sandy soil with high porosity which is well drained and leached lateritic soil layer e g fig 2b in some areas this zone may be overlain by an organic layer organic soil layer fig 2b the upper saprolite is a clay rich layer of generally low permeability and high porosity with a large number of secondary clay minerals the upper saprolite grades into the lower saprolite which contains more primary minerals and early forms of secondary clays and has relatively intermediate permeability and porosity the collapsed zone and the saprolite layers form the regolith or weathered overburden saprock is a fractured and fissured rock derived from extensive fracturing and slight in situ weathering of bedrock this zone is usually characterized by vertical sub vertical and sub horizontal fractures the saprock often displays low porosity due to the nature of the basement lithology but the permeability can be high if there is good connectivity and high density of fractures saprock layer fig 2b at the base of the weathering profile is fresh bedrock with little or no fractures chilton and smith carington 1984 acworth 1987 wright 1992 chilton and foster 1995 basement aquifers in sub saharan africa are commonly found within the regolith specifically the lower saprolite and within fractured zones in the bedrock wright 1992 acworth 1987 in sub saharan africa remote sensing mapping of surface lineaments are routinely used to identify potentially productive zones for siting boreholes in the basement aquifers e g gelnett and gardner 1979 anifowose and kolawole 2012 this remote sensing approach is significantly unreliable in areas of dense vegetation cover provides no insight into sub satellite scale fracture networks and lacks information on subsurface fracture permeability however more recently geophysical techniques such as electrical resistivity e g abudulawal et al 2015 aizebeokhai and oyeyemi 2018 leborgne et al 2021 larson et al 2022 oyeyemi et al 2022 and seismic methods e g rey et al 2020 sunkpal et al 2022 ahokangas et al 2020 patterson et al 2021 are commonly utilized to site boreholes as well as to identify productive zones within basement aquifer systems electrical resistivity methods are generally sensitive to variations in lithology and moisture content and are widely used to identify fractures regolith thickness and potential water bearing regions edet and okereke 2005 chandra et al 2010 hasan et al 2018 chandra et al 2019 leborgne et al 2021 pradhan et al 2022 oyeyemi et al 2022 seismic methods rely on velocity contrasts in subsurface and are useful to identify horizons in subsurface layers as well as the location and geometry of basement faults and fractures which can affect the flow and storage of groundwater e g rey et al 2020 ahokangas et al 2020 patterson et al 2021 however the complexities of basement aquifers such as their discontinuous nature within fracture systems or limitations of the low permeability regolith wright 1992 create ambiguities in successfully resolving the aquifers using geophysical surveys in many cases the weathered basement profile if it has a minor moisture content often exhibits geophysical anomalies that can be misinterpreted as aquifers drilling into such geophysical anomalies does not guarantee a sustainable well thus an approach to determine the aquifer potential in crystalline basements is critical to regions like sub saharan africa with a threatened water supply the integration of seismic and electrical resistivity methods is an effective approach for characterizing basement aquifer systems by providing a more detailed understanding of their subsurface structure and properties e g rey et al 2020 here we employed both electrical resistivity and seismic methods at the remote local community of mkonga in central malawi to characterize the basement aquifer system our study involved the acquisition and integration of seismic reflection and electrical resistivity imaging eri interpretations of the geophysical data relied on both datasets but preferentially used the seismic reflection data to identify the basement structure and the eri data to interpret saturated zones the available information from existing wells was limited and included well depths static water levels recharge rates and a drilling report along with three borehole logs our results provide insights into the structure of the regolith and saprock layers above the fractured basement that could be targets for potential groundwater resources 2 study site and methods 2 1 study site the study area mkonga village malawi is roughly 35 km west of the capital city of lilongwe in the central malawi plains and is home to a small community of local farmers as well as the non governmental organization child legacy international cli fig 3 malawi lies within an inter tropical zone and the rural water demand in mkonga village is driven by the community population and cli s hospital domestic and agricultural initiatives recently a new maternity ward and agricultural expansion of cli as well as population growth in mkonga village have exacerbated the need for sustainable groundwater sources beyond the capability of cli s existing water wells while most wells can support a hand pump cli s water needs call for on demand water that can be readily accessible with a motorized pump the necessary water volumes and yields are not specified by cli but they are clear in their need to access the most productive groundwater sources possible high groundwater demand is challenging to meet in the central malawi plains where low to moderate productivity basement aquifers fig 1 have wide ranging yields of 10 100 m3 per day acworth 1987 2 2 geological setting central malawi is located within the ne sw trending mesoproterozoic domain of the southern irumide mobile belt separated from the irumide belt by the mesozoic luangwa rift basin supplementary material fig s1 de waele et al 2009 fritz et al 2013 karmakar and schenk 2016 the southern irumide mobile belt is a complex structural and metamorphic region of multiple igneous and metamorphic terrains consisting of precambrian or lower paleozoic gneisses granulites and granites british geological survey 2004 rivett et al 2018 evidence of intrusives into the basement complex is found from outcrops of plutons and dikes such as the nyika and dzanalama granites syenites and dolerite dikes united nations 1989 upton et al 2018 central malawi lies outboard of the cenozoic malawi rift valley and is west of the rift flank this region is dominated by the african surface an extensive erosional surface caused by regional uplift due to thermal doming in the cenozoic mcfarlane et al 1992 the african surface is represented by the regionally exposed and highly weathered precambrian lower paleozoic basement mcfarlane et al 1992 chilton and foster 1995 today the plains of central malawi are dominated by poorly vegetated plateaus which are cut by low lying highly vegetated marshy areas referred to as dambos groundwater flows to the dambos which act as local drainage systems in the basement terrain these dambos form as a result of localized weathering leading to leaching collapse and the lowering of the surface elevation mcfarlane 1989 von der heyden 2004 during rainfall the surface and groundwater at the dambos flow to local stream channels draining the water wright 1992 the study area is covered by reddish lateritic soil and the subsurface geology is best represented by the basement weathering profile fig 2a the site lies in a mesoproterozoic basement complex supplementary materials fig s1 and the bedrock comprises medium to high grade felsic gneiss and granulite metamorphic lithologies leborgne et al 2021 locally our study site lies at the top of a hill bounded by grassy dambos fig 3 dambos are common throughout the study area and serve as shallow groundwater sources which sustain farming from mkonga village 2 3 data and methodology 2 3 1 2 d electrical resistivity imaging we acquired 2 dimensional 2 d electrical resistivity data using a 10 channel iris syscal pro resistivity meter and seventy two electrodes with 5 10 m electrode spacing along nine profiles of various lengths in the study area totaling about 5 6 km fig 4 the profile lengths line spacing and orientation varied for each profile fig 4a supplementary material table s1 the locations of profile lines were influenced by areas marked for water well development and several profiles traversed borehole locations to ground truth the resistivity measurements we collected both wenner schlumberger and dipole dipole arrays as well as reciprocal lines to maximize data confidence and integrity supplementary material table s1 an exception to this is profile 7 which only has a dipole dipole array additionally electrodes were wetted with salt water to reduce the high contact resistance of the lateritic soils we combined the recorded datasets to obtain a dense dataset for each profile line and then inverted the data with res2dinv software using the finite element and standard gauss newton method loke and barker 1996 prior to the resistivity data inversion we manually removed bad data points by identifying points with erroneously high or low resistivities along each data level see supplementary material table s2 for the details of the inversion parameters used in res2dinv 2 3 2 2 d seismic reflection imaging we acquired 2 d seismic reflection data using a p wave land streamer system ismail et al 2017 the deployed land streamer consisted of twenty four 40 hz vertically polarized geophones mounted on metal sleds that are gravity coupled to the ground surface fig 4b the sleds are connected by a cable and towed by a common land vehicle the survey utilized the common midpoint method a 15 kg sledgehammer source and 2 m geophone and shot spacings data acquisition and recording parameters are summarized in supplementary material table s3 we acquired seven compressional p wave seismic reflection profiles with five being co located with the electrical resistivity profiles totaling 4 km fig 4a supplementary material table s1 the acquired p wave data were converted from seg 2 into seg y format and imported into the landmark s promax software for processing seismic reflection data preprocessing consisted of converting the seg y data format into promax internal format followed by merging of the field geometry data editing elimination of guided waves refraction static correction trace scaling frequency filtering time varying spectral analysis elevation static correction velocity analysis normal move out correction and stacking the processed seismic stacks showed an estimated vertical seismic resolution of 3 5 m based on a dominant frequency of 50 70 hz the processed data was imported into the kingdom suite software for plotting and interpretation interpretation of the acquired seismic profiles was constrained by the information from the boreholes along the profiles 2 3 3 borehole data cli drilled fifteen boreholes bh in the study area fig 4a fourteen were air rotary drilled bh 1 8 and 10 14 and one was hand dug bh 9 limited information about the subsurface is available from the site and include the logs for three boreholes and single a drilling report for bh 10 supplementary material table s4 boreholes 11 and 12 were logged for this study as were well depths and static water levels across the site the log for bh 5 and the drilling report for bh 10 were provided by cli since no aquifer hydrologic data such as the borehole yield conductivity or transmissivity are available for the site status descriptions for the wells and boreholes are described with respect to the recharge rate and frequency of silting of the well screens the recharge rate here refers to the time taken for water to flow into the well after being pumped dry with a motorized pump boreholes that display 2 hour recharge rate and with rare or no occurrence of silting of the well screens are referred to as high producing wells boreholes with 2 hour recharge rate or that experience frequent silting of the well screen are considered low producing non water producing boreholes are termed dry seven of the fifteen boreholes are high producing bh 2a 2b 4 5 7 13 and 14 three are low producing bh 1 8 and 12 and five are dry bh 3 6 9 10 and 11 the seismic and eri profiles intersect 20 m from ten boreholes bh 2a 2b 4 5 7 9 10 11 12 and 14 however bh 2a 2b and 7 are at the margins of the geophysical profiles 3 results 3 1 subsurface electrical structure along the 2 d electrical resistivity imaging profiles the electrical resistivity profiles figs 5 9 supplementary material figs s2 s5 reveal four geoelectrical stratified layers the topmost layer layer 1 is generally a thin 1 to 20 m laterally continuous high resistivity zone 1000 ohm m the second geoelectric layer layer 2 is a moderately resistive continuous layer 100 to 1000 ohm m with thicknesses ranging from 10 to 40 m the third geoelectric layer layer 3 is an electrically heterogeneous layer 0 5 to 500 ohm m which is discontinuous and ranges in thickness from 10 to 60 m the fourth and bottom layer layer 4 is generally resistive 500 ohm m but ranges from 0 5 to 1000 ohm m due to the presence of conductive zones within the layer while the profiles generally have four geoelectric layers layer 4 is absent from profiles 2 3 5 and 6 possibly related to the depth of investigation being too shallow or due to poor model sensitivity at the bottom of the inversion models along profile 1 fig 5b layer 1 stretches across the profile ranging from the surface 1204 m to an elevation as low as 1186 m layer 2 with resistivities of 200 ohm m underlies the resistive surface layer and extends to elevations as low as 1166 m layer 3 extends for the remainder of the profile but is truncated by resistive bodies between 1156 to 1146 m elevation at a lateral distance of 200 to 260 m along the profile and at an elevation of 1126 m at a distance of 440 to 540 m these resistive anomalies are potential pinnacles of the underlying layer 4 this geoelectric layering of profile 1 is similar to profile 2 however along profile 2 layer 1 is generally thinner 10 m thick and layer 2 extends to an elevation of 1174 m fig 6a layer 3 extends to the bottom of the profile with discrete low resistivity bodies 5 to 20 ohm m between 1164 to 1134 m elevation on profile 3 fig 7a layer 1 stretches across the profile with elevations spanning the surface to 1188 m layer 2 extends to an elevation of roughly 1168 m layer 3 extends to the bottom of the profile at 1078 m depth there are three low resistivity bodies 1 20 ohm m observed in layer 3 ranging between profile distances of 200 to 400 m and elevation between 1168 to 1078 m layers 1 and 2 along profile 4 fig 8a are both relatively thin 10 m thick with the layers greatly thinning to the northeast ne at 300 m along the profile layer 3 is also relatively thin with the maximum thickness of 40 m elevation between 1183 to 1143 m occurring from 0 to 280 m along the profile at distances of 280 to 700 m layer 3 maintains a constant thickness of 20 m layer 4 extends from 1143 m elevation to the bottom of the profile between profile distances of 0 to 280 m and 1183 m elevation to the bottom of the profile at distances of 280 to 700 m a highly conductive anomaly 0 5 to 10 ohm m is observed between 1183 to 1133 m elevation and between lateral distances of 240 to 280 m along the profile along profile 5 fig 9a layer 1 is generally laterally continuous with a thickness of 10 m layer 2 has variable thickness 10 to 20 m and is the thinnest in the center of the profile from 60 to 290 m along the profile the underlying layer 3 contains several discrete conductive anomalies 10 to 20 ohm m localizing at 1168 to 1158 m elevation and centered at profile distances of 90 160 210 and 270 m layers 1 and 2 along profile 6 supplementary material fig s2 are generally thin extending to respective minimum elevations of 1191 and 1171 m layer 3 extends the remainder of the profile and has three distinct conductive 0 5 20 ohm m zones two of the conductive zones lie on the edges of the inversion model one between 60 and 120 m lateral distance and 1181 to 1151 m elevation and another between 300 and 340 m along profile and spans 1171 to 1151 m elevation the third conductive anomaly is centered at a profile distance of 210 m and spans an elevation of 1171 to 1121 m on profile 7 supplementary material fig s3 layers 1 and 2 reach maximum respective thicknesses of 5 and 15 m and similarly thin out to both the southwest and northeast ends of the profile layer 3 has a maximum thickness of 40 m and has small conductive zones between elevations of 1194 and 1174 m centered at 60 m 400 m 500 m and 625 m along profile the resistive layer 4 spans 1164 to 1104 m elevations across the profile but is truncated by a large conductive 1 18 ohm m anomaly from 250 to 320 m along profile 8 supplementary material fig s4 layer 1 is thickest 10 m in the northwest portion of the profile and thins to the southeast to 5 m layer 2 has a maximum thickness of 10 m and also progressively thins out towards the se layer 3 extends to 1159 m elevation and the underlying resistive layer 4 spans 1159 to 1069 m elevation shallow conductive anomalies 5 20 ohm m occur between 1169 to 1109 m elevation at profile distances of 475 m and 550 m a deep conductive anomaly 0 5 to 10 ohm m is also identified in layer 4 from 250 to 450 m along profile that spans from 1099 m elevation to the base of the model layers 1 and 2 along profile 9 supplementary material fig s5 thin out to both the south and north while reaching respective maximum thicknesses of 5 m and 10 m between 150 and 450 m lateral distance layer 3 has variable thickness and attains its maximum thickness of 80 m at a profile distance of 500 m layer 4 extends to the bottom of the profile and shallows to the north and south to an elevation of 1162 m our inversion model results display root mean square rms errors ranging between 14 1 and 16 3 although rms errors 5 in eri inversions can be considered to be moderately high the highly resistive lateritic soils at the surface create poor conditions for electrode surface coupling and likely contributed to the high rms error estimate however to account for the rms errors the inversion results are evaluated with relative model sensitivities to identify low confidence regions of the model results additionally the correlation between electrical signatures seismic data section 3 2 and borehole logs validate the eri inversion results despite the observed rms error estimates it should be noted that the presence of certain resistive lithologies in the subsurface could also produce high rms errors as high as 39 3 sirieix et al 2014 3 2 2 d seismic reflection profiles seismic profiles 1 5 10 and 11 are shown in figs 5 9 and supplementary material fig s6 bh 10 was used to estimate the two way travel time to subsurface depth this borehole was drilled to 82 m when a very hard layer was encountered that could not be penetrated the layer was interpreted as fresh basement based on the drilling report supplementary material table s4 using the depth information obtained from bh 10 we correlate a strong reflector to the very hard drilling encountered at an elevation of 1121 m 82 m depth for profile 1 fig 5b the resulting time depth conversion of the seismic data correlates well with the electrical resistivity inversion models as well as the interpreted top of saprock from bh 12 and the top of sub horizontal reflectors on profile 4 fig 8c the seismic sections for the profiles show varying reflector packages of the subsurface stratigraphy and generally identify two horizons the first horizon is generally shallow 10 to 40 m depths and separates an overlying shallow packet of strong high frequency coherent reflectors from an intermediate section that is dominantly incoherent with zones of sub horizontal discontinuous reflectors the second horizon separates this incoherent section from a deeper packet of strong coherent and continuous low frequency reflectors the depth to this second horizon ranges between 20 and 120 m e g profiles 1 and 4 but generally lies between 80 and 100 m depths across the study site 3 3 borehole logs the three borehole logs bh 5 11 and 12 from the site fig 10 show the general structure of a basement weathering profile fig 2 and are composed of 4 units unit 1 located at the surface consists of red silty clays that extend to a depth of 1 8 m unit 2 consists of reddish brown silty sandy clays with a thickness ranging between 6 and 15 m a thin moist basal layer consisting of pebbles and clay nods is observed in this unit unit 3 composed of silty clays with some pebbles and ranges in color from brown to gray to green this unit is generally moist across all boreholes and ranges in thickness between 11 and 33 m unit 4 is noticeably harder than the overlying units and is composed of highly weathered lithologies as well as quartzite and schist for bh 5 unit 1 is 1 m thick and is underlain by unit 2 which extends to a depth of 11 m unit 3is brown in color and dry from 12 to 25 m then changes to a gray color that is noticeably moist for the remainder of the unit down to 45 m hard drilling was encountered in unit 4 and drilling was halted at a depth of 48 m unit 4 consisted of moist clay rich and highly weathered gray finely ground cuttings for bh 11 units 1 and 2 are both 6 m thick with the base of unit 2 lying at a depth of 12 m unit 3 is composed of brown to green silts and clays to 22 m where it transitions to light gray clay rich and highly weathered finely ground material with few pebbles this unit is moist from 12 to 37 m then transitions to a gray green clay rich and highly weathered finely ground material with pebbles to a depth of 39 m the borehole extends 15 m from 39 to 54 m which consisting of light gray to white finely ground material with fresh cuttings of schist clays and micaceous minerals as the drilling progressed the number of schist pebbles and clay content decreased until a depth of 49 m for bh 12 unit 1 has a thickness of 8 m and unit 2 has a thickness of 15 m the base of unit 2 consists of a 2 m thick layer of gravel sized pebbles and clay nodules which extends to a depth of 23 m unit 3 extends to 34 m and is characterized by moist yellowish green clays and silts drilling in unit 4 proved to be challenging due to the collapse of clays due to the moisture encountered from higher intervals which resulted in poor recovery of cuttings the cuttings consisted of wet clays mixed with fragments of quartzite and drilling was terminated at a depth of 39 m 3 4 integration of geophysical and borehole data the integration of electrical resistivity seismic and borehole data allows for better constraint of the subsurface features figs 5d 6c 7c 8c and 9c first we summarize the primary features observed across the data sets from the seismic data we identify two main horizons separating three reflector packages 1 a shallow high frequency package 2 the largely incoherent and or discontinuous reflectors of the intermediate package and 3 coherent and continuous low frequency reflectors of the basal package using eri we identify four geoelectric layers a very resistive shallow layer 1 an underlying moderately resistive layer 2 the electrically heterogeneous layer 3 and a basal resistive layer 4 the borehole data shows four general layers 1 a surficial layer of red silty clays 2 an underlying layer of red brown silty to sandy clays with a thin basal layer of pebbles and clay nods 3 a generally thick layer of moist brown green silty clays 4 a relatively hard layer that is highly weathered and clay rich which at depth consists of largely unweathered metamorphic lithologies across the study area there are notable correlations between the electrical resistivity seismic and borehole data five of the eleven geophysical profiles 1 5 contain both seismic and electrical resistivity data but only profile 4 includes a log from a borehole drilled along a profile bh 12 the other two borehole logs bh 5 and 11 lie along eri profiles with no associated seismic data the base of the highly resistive and surficial geoelectric layer 1 in profiles 4 6 and 7 fig 8 supplementary materials fig s2 and s3 correlates with the base of the shallow red silty clays of bh 12 5 and 11 fig 10 similarly the base of moderately resistive geoelectric layer 2 correlates strongly with the base of the near surface coherent seismic reflector package and the base of the reddish brown silty to sandy clay layer from the borehole logs we find that wherever the intermediate seismic package consists of incoherent signals there are generally high conductive bodies 1 18 ohm m in the geoelectric layer 3 e g profile 3 in fig 7 this incoherency and generally higher conductivities in the profiles correlate with the brown to green silty clay units in the borehole logs similarly the coherent but discontinuous reflectors of the intermediate package correlate with the relatively higher resistivities 100 500 ohm m of geoelectric layer 3 and the highly weathered and relatively hard unit 4 in the borehole logs the resistive 500 ohm m geoelectric layer 4 correlates with the coherent low frequency deeper reflectors of the basal package generally the deeper resistive anomalies depths 20 m appear to correlate with seismic reflectors while the conductive anomalies correlate with incoherent seismic signals notable exceptions to this are the weak discontinuous seismic reflectors and co located conductive anomalies at elevations between 1166 and 1126 m from 900 to 1050 m along profile 1 fig 5d at 1138 to 1078 m elevation from 220 to 260 m along profile 3 fig 7c and at elevations between 1203 and 1183 m from 450 to 550 m along profile 4 fig 8c the drilling report for bh 10 supplementary material table s4 also generally validates the interpreted layers from the combined eri and seismic results the report notes that easy drilling was encountered from the surface at 1203 m elevation to 1171 m elevation depths of 0 to 32 m which correlates with geoelectric layers 1 and 2 harder drilling encountered from 1171 to 1121 m elevation 32 82 m depth correlates with geoelectric layer 3 and the coherent but discontinuous intermediate seismic reflectors notably the very hard drilling encountered at 1121 m elevation depth of 82 m caused drilling to stop and correlates strongly with the top of the deep strong seismic reflector package additionally the top of the saturated intervals or static water levels in wells across the site also correlate strongly with the boundary between geoelectric layers 2 and 3 figs 5d 8c 9c supplementary material figs s2 and s5 in both the seismic sections and eri profiles the lateral continuity of seismic reflectors and electrical layers is commonly truncated and offset by several sub vertical and dipping discontinuities these discontinuities extend up from the low frequency basal stratigraphic package layer 4 basal resistive layer into the overlying intermediate package layer 3 electrically heterogeneous layer and commonly terminate at the shallower high frequency package layer 2 moderately resistive layer the discontinuities dip 50 70 with a normal fault offset and a minimum and maximum dip displacement of 1 m and 20 m respectively 4 discussion 4 1 basement weathering profile from the integrated geophysical and borehole data we interpret a four layered geologic model of regolith laterite and saprolite weathered bedrock saprock and fresh basement which is consistent with weathering profiles of basement dominated aquifer systems wright 1992 the integrated geophysical signatures of the basement weathering layers identified in this study are summarized in table 1 and discussed below the shallow resistive geoelectric layer 1 1000 ohm m that is correlated with the red silty clay of borehole log unit 1 is interpreted to represent lateritic soils or the laterite the underlying geoelectric layer 2 100 to 1000 ohm m is correlated with the red brown silty sandy clays of borehole log unit 2 the base of which is collocated with the base of the near surface seismic coherent reflectors thus we interpret this layer as a sub laterite soil horizon figs 5 9 together these layers represent the residual soil layers of the regolith acworth 1987 wright 1992 this observation of a near surface resistive laterite layer is consistent with interpretations of electrical resistivity results from other studies in areas dominated by crystalline basement in sub saharan africa e g aizebeokhai and oyeyemi 2018 leborgne et al 2021 we find that the lateritic soil is thicker at higher elevations and generally thins at lower elevations towards the dambos profiles 4 7 8 and 9 fig 8 supplementary material figs s3 s4 s5 and s7 this is significant considering groundwater storage in off rift basement aquifers as in central malawi is controlled by the thickness of the basement weathering profile which in turn is driven by the basement topography and weathering processes mcfarlane et al 1992 the heterogenous geoelectric layer 3 0 5 500 ohm m is correlated with the moist brown green silty clays and highly weathered relatively hard material of borehole log units 3 and 4 fig 10 this geoelectric layer also correlates with the incoherent and discontinuous reflectors of the intermediate seismic package geoelectric layer 3 is interpreted to consist of both the saprolite and the saprock generally the incoherent seismic reflectors are interpreted as the saprolite while the discontinuous reflectors of the intermediate package are interpreted as the highly weathered saprock figs 5 9 in eri the saprolite and saprock layers are often differentiated by differences in their relative resistivity with the saprock layer exhibiting a higher resistivity than the saprolite e g leborgne et al 2021 however the integration of seismic data and borehole logs with the eri results provides more constraints than the geoelectric signatures alone and thus more confident interpretations the generally resistive geoelectric 500 ohm m layer 4 coincides with the top of the deep reflectors which likely consists of unweathered metamorphic rock e g quartzite and gneiss fragments were identified in the log for bh 11 this interpretation is consistent with resistivity ranges aizebeokhai et al 2021 leborgne et al 2021 oyeyemi et al 2022 as well as seismic interpretations of bedrock contacts from other basement dominated terrains ahokangas et al 2020 in profiles where the maximum depth of penetration of the resistivity section does not show geoelectric layer 4 the top of the fresh basement was interpreted from the seismic section alone e g profiles 2 3 and 5 figs 6 7 and 9 however we recognize that the interpretation of the depth to basement is a general estimate since the contact of the saprock and the fresh basement may be gradational acworth 1987 chilton and foster 1995 fractures in the basement are identified from correlating incoherency in the strong seismic reflectors as well as resistivity contrasts fig 11 demonstrates the consistency of the interpreted geophysical horizons across profiles in the study area the base of the shallow lateritic layer generally occurs at 10 m depths across the site red lines in figs 5d 6c 7c 8c and 9c shallow depth slices from the eri profiles at 5 and 10 m depths fig 11a and b show that this resistive layer is laterally continuous across the site and thins towards the dambo the elevations of the top of the saprolite orange lines in figs 5d 6c 7c 8c and 9c and the top of the basement yellow lines in figs 5d 6c 7c 8c and 9c vary along the profiles fig 11c and d these variations may be attributed to differential weathering of the basement due to changes in lithological composition or the pervasiveness of faulting or fracturing in the bedrock forming preferential pathways for groundwater and thus increased weathering lachassagne et al 2021 4 2 interpreted structure of the weathered basement aquifer system basement aquifers in sub saharan africa are largely thought to consist of four water bearing zones a shallow horizon at the base of the residual soil the saprolite the saprock and fractures in the basement e g mcfarlane et al 1992 muchingami et al 2019 aoulou et al 2021 zarate et al 2021 table 2 summarizes the geophysical signatures of the interpreted water bearing zones in basement aquifers from this study the shallowest water bearing zone is at the base of the sublaterite and the top of the saprolite this zone connects infiltrating water from the surface into the saprolite water flows along this interface from high to low elevations and discharges into the dambos chilton and foster 1995 leborgne et al 2021 we identify this shallow water bearing zone in the logs from bh 5 bh 11 and bh 12 as the thin 1 to 3 m moist clay layer with pebbles and clay nods which separates the sub laterite and saprolite fig 10 additionally the well data bh 1 2a 2b 4 7 8 10 14 supplementary material table s4 show shallow static water levels or saturated intervals correlate strongly with the base of the interpreted sub lateritic layer and top of the saprolite layer profiles 1 2 5 6 9 and 11 figs 5 6 9 supplementary material figs s2 s5 and s6e the saprolite saprock and basement water bearing zones are interpreted from the electrical resistivity results as low resistivities 100 ohm m in the regolith which identify zones where the weathering is significant and the potential for groundwater is high wright 1992 we observe laterally and vertically discontinuous low resistivity 30 ohm m anomalies along profiles 2 3 and 5 in the saprolite figs 6 7 and 9 these anomalies also correspond to incoherent and weak seismic reflectors while the clay rich nature of the saprolite will generally display lower resistivities we interpret these low discontinuous signatures to represent discrete potential water bearing zones within the saprolite similarly low resistivities 30 ohm m which correlate with strong but discontinuous seismic reflections on profiles 1 3 and 4 figs 5 7 and 8 are interpreted as water bearing zones within the saprock discrete low resistivity anomalies that correlate with strong continuous seismic reflectors profiles 1 and 3 figs 5 and 7 are interpreted as water bearing fractures in the relatively unweathered crystalline basement of the fourteen wells and boreholes at the site only six are collocated with 20 m from and do not lie along the margin of the eri profiles i e bh 4 5 10 11 12 and 14 here we evaluate the geophysical signatures associated with these boreholes both the high producing and low producing boreholes bh 4 5 12 and 14 penetrate low resistivity anomalies in section 4 3 we discuss the distinctive features that differentiate high producing from low producing boreholes the dry boreholes generally penetrate high resistivity anomalies bh 10 which is termed dry terminates in a high resistivity zone interpreted to be the top of the basement from the anecdotal drilling report supplementary materials table s4 although the dry bh 11 penetrated and terminated at a low resistivity anomaly the surrounding areas in the resistivity section exhibit high resistivity 500 ohm m which suggests the presence of fresh basement additionally the borehole log indicates the presence of schist and biotite minerals at this depth fig 10 with hard drilling supplementary materials fig s3 these findings indicate that the low resistivity anomaly encountered by bh 11 may be a localized zone of fracture within the basement further the observation of less weatherable high resistivity basement lithologies e g quartzite from the bh logs as well as more weatherable low resistivity basement lithologies e g schist from the bh logs suggest that the basement aquifer system may be controlled by differential weathering lachassagne et al 2021 this differential weathering influences the development of distinct aquifer zones and controls the permeable pathways within the aquifer system enhancing its potential for groundwater storage additionally we highlight the pervasiveness of bedrock rooted normal faults that deform the weathering profile the shallow terminations of these faults commonly occur within or just beneath the sub lateritic layer the deformation style is consistent with the multiple phases of post precambrian tectonic extension recorded in the region delvaux 1991 castaing 1991 kolawole et al 2022 of which the currently active phase is the east african rift system demonstrated by active faulting in southern malawi e g ojo et al 2022 kolawole et al 2022 since the weathering profile is most likely associated with the widely known cenozoic age exhumed weathering surface burke and gunnell 2008 we attribute the normal faulting to the far field stresses from the east african rift system accommodating distributed crustal deformation between the luangwa rift and the southern malawi rift wedmore et al 2021 4 3 groundwater potential of the weathered basement aquifer zones the groundwater potential of weathered basement aquifers depends on several factors including storage potential porosity hydraulic conductivity permeability and the longevity of the groundwater source wright 1992 the shallowest zone at the base of the residual soil offers the most readily available water source with minimal drilling necessary supra basement shallow depths at our site at 40 m and a high permeability due to the silty sands of the laterite zone 1 fig 12 bh 7 and 9 profiles 9 and 10 target this shallow zone supplementary materials figs s5 and s6 the eri results show that the high producing bh 7 depth 19 m on the edge of profile 9 penetrates the base of the thin resistive lateritic horizons at 1172 m elevation in contrast bh 9 which was hand dug to 25 m depths and dry barely penetrated the base of the near surface reflector package interpreted as the base of lateritic soil horizons and thus missed the sub lateritic aquifer zone however this shallow zone does not offer the filtration of the deeper layers which calls into question the groundwater quality of shallow wells like bh 7 mapoma and xie 2014 additionally the sustainability of this zone is questionable as its capacity may be greatly reduced during long periods of droughts within the weathered regolith the saprolite zone zone 2 fig 12 has the greatest storage potential and the highest porosity but low permeability holbrook et al 2014 rempe and dietrich 2018 in general groundwater storage in a weathered basement aquifer system is controlled by the thickness of the regolith primarily due to the high clay content of the weathering products mcfarlane et al 1992 chilton and foster 1995 although capable of supporting a hand pump well for a rural population foster et al 2000 the saprolite is not a sustainable or reliable groundwater resource in a region like mkonga village where the demand for water is increasing morgan 2018 lachassagne et al 2021 this limitation is most pronounced during periods of droughts in which the static water level in wells within the saprolite may dry up due to the halt in recharge chilton and smith carington 1984 water bearing zones within the saprock layer have less storage potential than the saprolite zone 3 fig 12 however where densely fractured the saprock offers greater potential for high producing wells due to large porosity and permeability associated with the densely interconnected fracture networks and direct connectivity to the underlying fractured bedrock wright 1992 leborgne et al 2021 the geophysical results of our study show that bh 4 high producing which supports a water storage reservoir for the child legacy international hospital penetrates a low resistivity anomaly 10 ohm m at 1181 to 1158 m elevation that correlates with strong but discontinuous seismic reflectors fig 5 similarly the high producing bh 5 penetrates a conductive anomaly 30 ohm m at an elevation between 1171 to 1153 m supplementary materials fig s2 thus we interpret the high producing bh 4 and 5 as penetrating through a water saturated zone in the saprolite layer and into the fractured zone of the saprock layer this interpretation is supported by the log of bh 5 fig 10 these boreholes likely benefit from the storage potential of the saprolite seasonal recharge of infiltrating groundwater from the base of the sub lateritic layer and the more favorable permeability of the fractured saprock we interpret these characteristics to be representative of the optimum weathered basement aquifer potential in the region capable of supporting high producing boreholes based on these criteria we identified four potential targets for drilling the first target is the low resistivity anomaly on profile 1 at 800 m fig 5 this anomaly was drilled for bh 14 and currently supports a high producing well the second and third targets are the low resistivity anomalies below the interpreted sub lateritic layer located on profile 3 centered at distances of 200 and 260 m fig 7c and d the fourth target is the conductive zone on profile 4 at an elevation of 1178 to 1143 m centered at profile distance of 110 m fig 8c and d the anomaly along profile 4 was selected as the focus of bh 12 however the drilling missed the intended target and only penetrated the shallow aquifer zone 1 resulting in a low producing bh thus ideal targets for shallow to medium depth boreholes must possess the defined characteristics of an optimum weathered basement aquifer drilling to the top of the saprolite or into isolated low resistivity anomalies in the saprolite may result in low producing or dry boreholes water bearing fractures and fault zones in the basement offer decent storage potential and permeability so long as the fracture system is large enough or that there is good connectivity between the fractures zone 4 fig 12 acworth 1987 leborgne et al 2021 the water bearing potential of this zone is linked to the development of secondary porosity related to the connectivity of the fractures chilton and foster 1995 aizebeokhai and oyeyemi 2018 tectonic basement fractures i e non exfoliation weathering related are typically deep reaching e g kolawole et al 2019 however successful exploration in such systems results in expensive borehole campaigns because they generally constitute narrow targets to drill and as such their successful geophysical detection drill targeting and production constitute a challenging exploration process e g bh 11 chandra et al 2019 we emphasize that the presence of a connected fracture network does not necessarily imply high permeability because the permeability of fractures is dependent on if they are open or occluded 5 conclusion here by integrating multiple geophysical methods such as electrical resistivity and 2 d seismic reflection with borehole data we are able to provide a robust interpretation of weathered basement aquifers and potential target zones for groundwater exploration relevant to tropical and inter tropical environments we find strong correlations between the independent datasets allowing us to identify the four commonly known layers of the basement weathering profile the lateritic soils the saprolite the saprock and the fractured fresh basement within this basement weathering profile we identified four potential water bearing zones of interest a shallow zone occurring at the base of the lateritic soils a zone within the saprolite a zone within the saprock and a deeper zone in the fractured basement all of which are cut by through going normal faults possibly associated with east african rift regional stresses we also identify three characteristics defining an optimal target for a productive borehole siting these include the ability of the aquifer unit to take advantage of 1 seasonal recharge of infiltrating groundwater from the base of the lateritic layer 2 storage potential of the saprolite and 3 the permeability of the saprock thus for shallow groundwater exploration in thick weathered basement aquifer systems such as the study area we propose low resistivity anomalies 30 ohm m that span both the saprolite and the fractured saprock zones may produce considerable success for shallow depth groundwater resources overall we conclude that the identified targets represent water bearing zones that connect the saprolite and saprock to recharge pathways at the base of the sub laterite credit authorship contribution statement leonard ohenhen conceptualization methodology writing original draft preparation writing reviewing

basement study focus groundwater aquifer systems in the shallow buried crystalline basement are geologically complex reservoir targets with historically low drilling success rates understanding the basement weathering profiles and their implications for aquifer architecture is crucial for drilling productive wells this is particularly critical in developing countries where water demands are

saharan africa expected to double by 2050 is increasing the demand for water resources and threatening the limited water supply united nations 2020 the availability of surface water in sub saharan climates is minimal and requires increased exploitation of groundwater to meet the increasing demand groundwater resources in sub saharan africa predominantly lie in weathered and fractured crystalline basement aquifers which occupy 40 of the land area and provide water resources to 220 million people fig 1 acworth 1987 wright 1992 macdonald and davies 2000 however basement aquifers have a limited supply and additional strains by global climate change limit potential recharge dai 2013 wu et al 2020 due to these constraints basement aquifers are difficult targets for successful detection using conventional drilling or wildcatting acworth 1987 additionally basement groundwater sources are complex which presents challenges in the characterization of the aquifers wright 1992 generally in areas of shallow weathered crystalline basement like much of sub saharan africa where tropical to inter tropical climatic conditions dominate five zones of the weathering profile can be observed fig 2a acworth 1987 wright 1992 in order of increasing depth the profile includes a residual soil or collapsed zone derived from prolonged dissolution and leaching of weathered bedrock it is generally a lateritic red sandy soil with high porosity which is well drained and leached lateritic soil layer e g fig 2b in some areas this zone may be overlain by an organic layer organic soil layer fig 2b the upper saprolite is a clay rich layer of generally low permeability and high porosity with a large number of secondary clay minerals the upper saprolite grades into the lower saprolite which contains more primary minerals and early forms of secondary clays and has relatively intermediate permeability and porosity the collapsed zone and the saprolite layers form the regolith or weathered overburden saprock is a fractured and fissured rock derived from extensive fracturing and slight in situ weathering of bedrock this zone is usually characterized by vertical sub vertical and sub horizontal fractures the saprock often displays low porosity due to the nature of the basement lithology but the permeability can be high if there is good connectivity and high density of fractures saprock layer fig 2b at the base of the weathering profile is fresh bedrock with little or no fractures chilton and smith carington 1984 acworth 1987 wright 1992 chilton and foster 1995 basement aquifers in sub saharan africa are commonly found within the regolith specifically the lower saprolite and within fractured zones in the bedrock wright 1992 acworth 1987 in sub saharan africa remote sensing mapping of surface lineaments are routinely used to identify potentially productive zones for siting boreholes in the basement aquifers e g gelnett and gardner 1979 anifowose and kolawole 2012 this remote sensing approach is significantly unreliable in areas of dense vegetation cover provides no insight into sub satellite scale fracture networks and lacks information on subsurface fracture permeability however more recently geophysical techniques such as electrical resistivity e g abudulawal et al 2015 aizebeokhai and oyeyemi 2018 leborgne et al 2021 larson et al 2022 oyeyemi et al 2022 and seismic methods e g rey et al 2020 sunkpal et al 2022 ahokangas et al 2020 patterson et al 2021 are commonly utilized to site boreholes as well as to identify productive zones within basement aquifer systems electrical resistivity methods are generally sensitive to variations in lithology and moisture content and are widely used to identify fractures regolith thickness and potential water bearing regions edet and okereke 2005 chandra et al 2010 hasan et al 2018 chandra et al 2019 leborgne et al 2021 pradhan et al 2022 oyeyemi et al 2022 seismic methods rely on velocity contrasts in subsurface and are useful to identify horizons in subsurface layers as well as the location and geometry of basement faults and fractures which can affect the flow and storage of groundwater e g rey et al 2020 ahokangas et al 2020 patterson et al 2021 however the complexities of basement aquifers such as their discontinuous nature within fracture systems or limitations of the low permeability regolith wright 1992 create ambiguities in successfully resolving the aquifers using geophysical surveys in many cases the weathered basement profile if it has a minor moisture content often exhibits geophysical anomalies that can be misinterpreted as aquifers drilling into such geophysical anomalies does not guarantee a sustainable well thus an approach to determine the aquifer potential in crystalline basements is critical to regions like sub saharan africa with a threatened water supply the integration of seismic and electrical resistivity methods is an effective approach for characterizing basement aquifer systems by providing a more detailed understanding of their subsurface structure and properties e g rey et al 2020 here we employed both electrical resistivity and seismic methods at the remote local community of mkonga in central malawi to characterize the basement aquifer system our study involved the acquisition and integration of seismic reflection and electrical resistivity imaging eri interpretations of the geophysical data relied on both datasets but preferentially used the seismic reflection data to identify the basement structure and the eri data to interpret saturated zones the available information from existing wells was limited and included well depths static water levels recharge rates and a drilling report along with three borehole logs our results provide insights into the structure of the regolith and saprock layers above the fractured basement that could be targets for potential groundwater resources 2 study site and methods 2 1 study site the study area mkonga village malawi is roughly 35 km west of the capital city of lilongwe in the central malawi plains and is home to a small community of local farmers as well as the non governmental organization child legacy international cli fig 3 malawi lies within an inter tropical zone and the rural water demand in mkonga village is driven by the community population and cli s hospital domestic and agricultural initiatives recently a new maternity ward and agricultural expansion of cli as well as population growth in mkonga village have exacerbated the need for sustainable groundwater sources beyond the capability of cli s existing water wells while most wells can support a hand pump cli s water needs call for on demand water that can be readily accessible with a motorized pump the necessary water volumes and yields are not specified by cli but they are clear in their need to access the most productive groundwater sources possible high groundwater demand is challenging to meet in the central malawi plains where low to moderate productivity basement aquifers fig 1 have wide ranging yields of 10 100 m3 per day acworth 1987 2 2 geological setting central malawi is located within the ne sw trending mesoproterozoic domain of the southern irumide mobile belt separated from the irumide belt by the mesozoic luangwa rift basin supplementary material fig s1 de waele et al 2009 fritz et al 2013 karmakar and schenk 2016 the southern irumide mobile belt is a complex structural and metamorphic region of multiple igneous and metamorphic terrains consisting of precambrian or lower paleozoic gneisses granulites and granites british geological survey 2004 rivett et al 2018 evidence of intrusives into the basement complex is found from outcrops of plutons and dikes such as the nyika and dzanalama granites syenites and dolerite dikes united nations 1989 upton et al 2018 central malawi lies outboard of the cenozoic malawi rift valley and is west of the rift flank this region is dominated by the african surface an extensive erosional surface caused by regional uplift due to thermal doming in the cenozoic mcfarlane et al 1992 the african surface is represented by the regionally exposed and highly weathered precambrian lower paleozoic basement mcfarlane et al 1992 chilton and foster 1995 today the plains of central malawi are dominated by poorly vegetated plateaus which are cut by low lying highly vegetated marshy areas referred to as dambos groundwater flows to the dambos which act as local drainage systems in the basement terrain these dambos form as a result of localized weathering leading to leaching collapse and the lowering of the surface elevation mcfarlane 1989 von der heyden 2004 during rainfall the surface and groundwater at the dambos flow to local stream channels draining the water wright 1992 the study area is covered by reddish lateritic soil and the subsurface geology is best represented by the basement weathering profile fig 2a the site lies in a mesoproterozoic basement complex supplementary materials fig s1 and the bedrock comprises medium to high grade felsic gneiss and granulite metamorphic lithologies leborgne et al 2021 locally our study site lies at the top of a hill bounded by grassy dambos fig 3 dambos are common throughout the study area and serve as shallow groundwater sources which sustain farming from mkonga village 2 3 data and methodology 2 3 1 2 d electrical resistivity imaging we acquired 2 dimensional 2 d electrical resistivity data using a 10 channel iris syscal pro resistivity meter and seventy two electrodes with 5 10 m electrode spacing along nine profiles of various lengths in the study area totaling about 5 6 km fig 4 the profile lengths line spacing and orientation varied for each profile fig 4a supplementary material table s1 the locations of profile lines were influenced by areas marked for water well development and several profiles traversed borehole locations to ground truth the resistivity measurements we collected both wenner schlumberger and dipole dipole arrays as well as reciprocal lines to maximize data confidence and integrity supplementary material table s1 an exception to this is profile 7 which only has a dipole dipole array additionally electrodes were wetted with salt water to reduce the high contact resistance of the lateritic soils we combined the recorded datasets to obtain a dense dataset for each profile line and then inverted the data with res2dinv software using the finite element and standard gauss newton method loke and barker 1996 prior to the resistivity data inversion we manually removed bad data points by identifying points with erroneously high or low resistivities along each data level see supplementary material table s2 for the details of the inversion parameters used in res2dinv 2 3 2 2 d seismic reflection imaging we acquired 2 d seismic reflection data using a p wave land streamer system ismail et al 2017 the deployed land streamer consisted of twenty four 40 hz vertically polarized geophones mounted on metal sleds that are gravity coupled to the ground surface fig 4b the sleds are connected by a cable and towed by a common land vehicle the survey utilized the common midpoint method a 15 kg sledgehammer source and 2 m geophone and shot spacings data acquisition and recording parameters are summarized in supplementary material table s3 we acquired seven compressional p wave seismic reflection profiles with five being co located with the electrical resistivity profiles totaling 4 km fig 4a supplementary material table s1 the acquired p wave data were converted from seg 2 into seg y format and imported into the landmark s promax software for processing seismic reflection data preprocessing consisted of converting the seg y data format into promax internal format followed by merging of the field geometry data editing elimination of guided waves refraction static correction trace scaling frequency filtering time varying spectral analysis elevation static correction velocity analysis normal move out correction and stacking the processed seismic stacks showed an estimated vertical seismic resolution of 3 5 m based on a dominant frequency of 50 70 hz the processed data was imported into the kingdom suite software for plotting and interpretation interpretation of the acquired seismic profiles was constrained by the information from the boreholes along the profiles 2 3 3 borehole data cli drilled fifteen boreholes bh in the study area fig 4a fourteen were air rotary drilled bh 1 8 and 10 14 and one was hand dug bh 9 limited information about the subsurface is available from the site and include the logs for three boreholes and single a drilling report for bh 10 supplementary material table s4 boreholes 11 and 12 were logged for this study as were well depths and static water levels across the site the log for bh 5 and the drilling report for bh 10 were provided by cli since no aquifer hydrologic data such as the borehole yield conductivity or transmissivity are available for the site status descriptions for the wells and boreholes are described with respect to the recharge rate and frequency of silting of the well screens the recharge rate here refers to the time taken for water to flow into the well after being pumped dry with a motorized pump boreholes that display 2 hour recharge rate and with rare or no occurrence of silting of the well screens are referred to as high producing wells boreholes with 2 hour recharge rate or that experience frequent silting of the well screen are considered low producing non water producing boreholes are termed dry seven of the fifteen boreholes are high

resistivity profiles figs 5 9 supplementary material figs s2 s5 reveal four geoelectrical stratified layers the topmost layer layer 1 is generally a thin 1 to 20 m laterally continuous high resistivity zone 1000 ohm m the second geoelectric layer layer 2 is a moderately resistive continuous layer 100 to 1000 ohm m with thicknesses ranging from 10 to 40 m the third geoelectric layer layer 3 is an electrically heterogeneous layer 0 5 to 500 ohm m which is discontinuous and ranges in thickness from 10 to 60 m the fourth and bottom layer layer 4 is generally resistive 500 ohm m but ranges from 0 5 to 1000 ohm m due to the presence of conductive zones within the layer while the profiles generally have four geoelectric layers layer 4 is absent from profiles 2 3 5 and 6 possibly related to the depth of investigation being too shallow or due to poor model sensitivity at the bottom of the inversion models along profile 1 fig 5b layer 1 stretches across the profile ranging from the surface 1204 m to an elevation as low as 1186 m layer 2 with resistivities of 200 ohm m underlies the resistive surface layer and extends to elevations as low as 1166 m layer 3 extends for the remainder of the profile but is truncated by resistive bodies between 1156 to 1146 m elevation at a lateral distance of 200 to 260 m along the profile and at an elevation of 1126 m at a distance of 440 to 540 m these resistive anomalies are potential pinnacles of the underlying layer 4 this geoelectric layering of profile 1 is similar to profile 2 however along profile 2 layer 1 is generally thinner 10 m thick and layer 2 extends to an elevation of 1174 m fig 6a layer 3 extends to the bottom of the profile with discrete low resistivity bodies 5 to 20 ohm m between 1164 to 1134 m elevation on profile 3 fig 7a layer 1 stretches across the profile with elevations spanning the surface to 1188 m layer 2 extends to an elevation of roughly 1168 m layer 3 extends to the bottom of the profile at 1078 m depth there are three low resistivity bodies 1 20 ohm m observed in layer 3 ranging between profile distances of 200 to 400 m and elevation between 1168 to 1078 m layers 1 and 2 along profile 4 fig 8a are both relatively thin 10 m thick with the layers greatly thinning to the northeast ne at 300 m along the profile layer 3 is also relatively thin with the maximum thickness of 40 m elevation between 1183 to 1143 m occurring from 0 to 280 m along the profile at distances of 280 to 700 m layer 3 maintains a constant thickness of 20 m layer 4 extends from 1143 m elevation to the bottom of the profile between profile distances of 0 to 280 m and 1183 m elevation to the bottom of the profile at distances of 280 to 700 m a highly conductive anomaly 0 5 to 10 ohm m is observed between 1183 to 1133 m elevation and between lateral distances of 240 to 280 m along the profile along profile 5 fig 9a layer 1 is generally laterally continuous with a thickness of 10 m layer 2 has variable thickness 10 to 20 m and is the thinnest in the center of the profile from 60 to 290 m along the profile the underlying layer 3 contains several discrete conductive anomalies 10 to 20 ohm m localizing at 1168 to 1158 m elevation and centered at profile distances of 90 160 210 and 270 m layers 1 and 2 along profile 6 supplementary material fig s2 are generally thin extending to respective minimum elevations of 1191 and 1171 m layer 3 extends the remainder of the profile and has three distinct conductive 0 5 20 ohm m zones two of the conductive zones lie on the edges of the inversion model one between 60 and 120 m lateral distance and 1181 to 1151 m elevation and another between 300 and 340 m along profile and spans 1171 to 1151 m elevation the third conductive anomaly is centered at a profile distance of 210 m and spans an elevation of 1171 to 1121 m on profile 7 supplementary material fig s3 layers 1 and 2 reach maximum respective thicknesses of 5 and 15 m and similarly thin out to both the southwest and northeast ends of the profile layer 3 has a maximum thickness of 40 m and has small conductive zones between elevations of 1194 and 1174 m centered at 60 m 400 m 500 m and 625 m along profile the resistive layer 4 spans 1164 to 1104 m elevations across the profile but is truncated by a large conductive 1 18 ohm m anomaly from 250 to 320 m along profile 8 supplementary material fig s4 layer 1 is thickest 10 m in the northwest portion of the profile and thins to the southeast to 5 m layer 2 has a maximum thickness of 10 m and also progressively thins out towards the se layer 3 extends to 1159 m elevation and the underlying resistive layer 4 spans 1159 to 1069 m elevation shallow conductive anomalies 5 20 ohm m occur between 1169 to 1109 m elevation at profile distances of 475 m and 550 m a deep conductive anomaly 0 5 to 10 ohm m is also identified in layer 4 from 250 to 450 m along profile that spans from 1099 m elevation to the base of the model layers 1 and 2 along profile 9 supplementary material fig s5 thin out to both the south and north while reaching respective maximum thicknesses of 5 m and 10 m between 150 and 450 m lateral distance layer 3 has variable thickness and attains its maximum thickness of 80 m at a profile distance of 500 m layer 4 extends to the bottom of the profile and shallows to the north and south to an elevation of 1162 m our inversion model results display root mean square rms errors ranging between 14 1 and 16 3 although rms errors 5 in eri inversions can be considered to be moderately high the highly resistive lateritic soils at the surface create poor conditions for electrode surface coupling and likely contributed to the high rms error estimate however to account for the rms errors the inversion results are evaluated with relative model sensitivities to identify low confidence regions of the model results additionally the correlation between electrical signatures seismic data section 3 2 and borehole logs validate the eri inversion results despite the observed rms error estimates it should be noted that the presence of certain resistive lithologies in the subsurface could also produce high rms errors as high as 39 3 sirieix et al 2014 3 2 2 d seismic reflection profiles seismic profiles 1 5 10 and 11 are shown in figs 5 9 and supplementary material fig s6 bh 10 was used to estimate the two way travel time to subsurface depth this borehole was drilled to 82 m when a very hard layer was encountered that could not be penetrated the layer was interpreted as fresh basement based on the drilling report supplementary material table s4 using the depth information obtained from bh 10 we correlate a strong reflector to the very hard drilling encountered at an elevation of 1121 m 82 m depth for profile 1 fig 5b the resulting time depth conversion of the seismic data correlates well with the electrical resistivity inversion models as well as the interpreted top of saprock from bh 12 and the top of sub horizontal reflectors on profile 4 fig 8c the seismic sections for the profiles show varying reflector packages of the subsurface stratigraphy and generally identify two horizons the first horizon is generally shallow 10 to 40 m depths and separates an overlying shallow packet of strong high frequency coherent reflectors from an intermediate section that is dominantly incoherent with zones of sub horizontal discontinuous reflectors the second horizon separates this incoherent section from a deeper packet of strong coherent and continuous low frequency reflectors the depth to this second horizon ranges between 20 and 120 m e g profiles 1 and 4 but generally lies between 80 and 100 m depths across the study site 3 3 borehole logs the three borehole logs bh 5 11 and 12 from the site fig 10 show the general structure of a basement weathering profile fig 2 and are composed of 4 units unit 1 located at the surface consists of red silty clays that extend to a depth of 1 8 m unit 2 consists of reddish brown silty sandy clays with a thickness ranging between 6 and 15 m a thin moist basal layer consisting of pebbles and clay nods is observed in this unit unit 3 composed of silty clays with some pebbles and ranges in color from brown to gray to green this unit is generally moist across all boreholes and ranges in thickness between 11 and 33 m unit 4 is noticeably harder than the overlying units and is composed of highly weathered lithologies as well as quartzite and schist for bh 5 unit 1 is 1 m thick and is underlain by unit 2 which extends to a depth of 11 m unit 3is brown in color and dry from 12 to 25 m then changes to a gray color that is noticeably moist for the remainder of the unit down to 45 m hard drilling was encountered in unit 4 and drilling was halted at a depth of 48 m unit 4 consisted of moist clay rich and highly weathered gray finely ground cuttings for bh 11 units 1 and 2 are both 6 m thick with the base of unit 2 lying at a depth of 12 m unit 3 is composed of brown to green silts and clays to 22 m where it transitions to light gray clay rich and highly weathered finely ground material with few pebbles this unit is moist from 12 to 37 m then transitions to a gray green clay rich and highly weathered finely ground material with pebbles to a depth of 39 m the borehole extends 15 m from 39 to 54 m which consisting of light gray to white finely ground material with fresh cuttings of schist clays and micaceous minerals as the drilling progressed the number of schist pebbles and clay content decreased until a depth of 49 m for bh 12 unit 1 has a thickness of 8 m and unit 2 has a thickness of 15 m the base of unit 2 consists of a 2 m thick layer of gravel sized pebbles and clay nodules which extends to a depth of 23 m unit 3 extends to 34 m and is characterized by moist yellowish green clays and silts drilling in unit 4 proved to be challenging due to the collapse of clays due to the moisture encountered from higher intervals which resulted in poor recovery of cuttings the cuttings consisted of wet clays mixed with fragments of quartzite and drilling was terminated at a depth of 39 m 3 4 integration of geophysical and borehole data the integration of electrical resistivity seismic and borehole data allows for better constraint of the subsurface features figs 5d 6c 7c 8c and 9c first we summarize the primary features observed across the data sets from the seismic data we identify two main horizons separating three reflector packages 1 a shallow high frequency package 2 the largely incoherent and or discontinuous reflectors of the intermediate package and 3 coherent and continuous low frequency reflectors of the basal package using eri we identify four geoelectric layers a very resistive shallow layer 1 an underlying moderately resistive layer 2 the electrically heterogeneous layer 3 and a basal resistive layer 4 the borehole data shows four general layers 1 a surficial layer of red silty clays 2 an underlying layer of red brown silty to sandy clays with a thin basal layer of pebbles and clay nods 3 a generally thick layer of moist brown green silty clays 4 a relatively hard layer that is highly weathered and clay rich which at depth consists of largely unweathered metamorphic lithologies across the study area there are notable correlations between the electrical resistivity seismic and borehole data five of the eleven geophysical profiles 1 5 contain both seismic and electrical resistivity data but only profile 4 includes a log from a borehole drilled along a profile bh 12 the other two borehole logs bh 5 and 11 lie along eri profiles with no associated seismic data the base of the highly resistive and surficial geoelectric layer 1 in profiles 4 6 and 7 fig 8 supplementary materials fig s2 and s3 correlates with the base of the shallow red silty clays of bh 12 5 and 11 fig 10 similarly the base of moderately resistive geoelectric layer 2 correlates strongly with the base of the near surface coherent seismic reflector package and the base of the reddish brown silty to sandy clay layer from the borehole logs we find that wherever the intermediate seismic package consists of incoherent signals there are generally high conductive bodies 1 18 ohm m in the geoelectric layer 3 e g profile 3 in fig 7 this incoherency and generally higher conductivities in the profiles correlate with the brown to green silty clay units in the borehole logs similarly the coherent but discontinuous reflectors of the intermediate package correlate with the relatively higher resistivities 100 500 ohm m of geoelectric layer 3 and the highly weathered and relatively hard unit 4 in the borehole logs the resistive 500 ohm m geoelectric layer 4 correlates with the coherent low frequency deeper reflectors of the basal package generally the deeper resistive anomalies depths 20 m appear to correlate with seismic reflectors while the conductive anomalies correlate with incoherent seismic signals notable exceptions to this are the weak discontinuous seismic reflectors and co located conductive anomalies at elevations between 1166 and 1126 m from 900 to 1050 m along profile 1 fig 5d at 1138 to 1078 m elevation from 220 to 260 m along profile 3 fig 7c and at elevations between 1203 and 1183 m from 450 to 550 m along profile 4 fig 8c the drilling report for bh 10 supplementary material table s4 also generally validates the interpreted layers from the combined eri and seismic results the report notes that easy drilling was encountered from the surface at 1203 m elevation to 1171 m elevation depths of 0 to 32 m which correlates with geoelectric layers 1 and 2 harder drilling encountered from 1171 to 1121 m elevation 32 82 m depth correlates with geoelectric layer 3 and the coherent but discontinuous intermediate seismic reflectors notably the very hard drilling encountered at 1121 m elevation depth of 82 m caused drilling to stop and correlates strongly with the top of the deep strong seismic reflector package additionally the top of the saturated intervals or static water levels in wells across the site also correlate strongly with the boundary between geoelectric layers 2 and 3 figs 5d 8c 9c supplementary material figs s2 and s5 in both the seismic sections and eri profiles the lateral continuity of seismic reflectors and electrical layers is commonly truncated and offset by several sub vertical and dipping discontinuities these discontinuities extend up from the low frequency basal stratigraphic package layer 4 basal resistive layer into the overlying intermediate package layer 3 electrically heterogeneous layer and commonly terminate at the shallower high frequency package layer 2 moderately resistive layer the discontinuities dip 50 70 with a normal fault offset and a minimum and maximum dip displacement of 1 m and 20 m respectively 4 discussion 4 1 basement weathering profile from the integrated geophysical and borehole data we interpret a four layered geologic model of regolith laterite and saprolite weathered bedrock saprock and fresh basement which is consistent with weathering profiles of basement dominated aquifer systems wright 1992 the integrated geophysical signatures of the basement weathering layers identified in this study are summarized in table 1 and discussed below the shallow resistive geoelectric layer 1 1000 ohm m that is correlated with the red silty clay of borehole log unit 1 is interpreted to represent lateritic soils or the laterite the underlying geoelectric layer 2 100 to 1000 ohm m is correlated with the red brown silty sandy clays of borehole log unit 2 the base of which is collocated with the base of the near surface seismic coherent reflectors thus we interpret this layer as a sub laterite soil horizon figs 5 9 together these layers represent the residual soil layers of the regolith acworth 1987 wright 1992 this observation of a near surface resistive laterite layer is consistent with interpretations of electrical resistivity results from other studies in areas dominated by crystalline basement in sub saharan africa e g aizebeokhai and oyeyemi 2018 leborgne et al 2021 we find that the lateritic soil is thicker at higher elevations and generally thins at lower elevations towards the dambos profiles 4 7 8 and 9 fig 8 supplementary material figs s3 s4 s5 and s7 this is significant considering groundwater storage in off rift basement aquifers as in central malawi is controlled by the thickness of the basement weathering profile which in turn is driven by the basement topography and weathering processes mcfarlane et al 1992 the heterogenous geoelectric layer 3 0 5 500 ohm m is correlated with the moist brown green silty clays and highly weathered relatively hard material of borehole log units 3 and 4 fig 10 this geoelectric layer also correlates with the incoherent and discontinuous reflectors of the intermediate seismic package geoelectric layer 3 is interpreted to consist of both the saprolite and the saprock generally the incoherent seismic reflectors are interpreted as the saprolite while the discontinuous reflectors of the intermediate package are interpreted as the highly weathered saprock figs 5 9 in eri the saprolite and saprock layers are often differentiated by differences in their relative resistivity with the saprock layer exhibiting a higher resistivity than the saprolite e g leborgne et al 2021 however the integration of seismic data and borehole logs with the eri results provides more constraints than the geoelectric signatures alone and thus more confident interpretations the generally resistive geoelectric 500 ohm m layer 4 coincides with the top of the deep reflectors which likely consists of unweathered metamorphic rock e g quartzite and gneiss fragments were identified in the log for bh 11 this interpretation is consistent with resistivity ranges aizebeokhai et al 2021 leborgne et al 2021 oyeyemi et al 2022 as well as seismic interpretations of bedrock contacts from other basement dominated terrains ahokangas et al 2020 in profiles where the maximum depth of penetration of the resistivity section does not show geoelectric layer 4 the top of the fresh basement was interpreted from the seismic section alone e g profiles 2 3 and 5 figs 6 7 and 9 however we recognize that the interpretation of the depth to basement is a general estimate since the contact of the saprock and the fresh basement may be gradational acworth 1987 chilton and foster 1995 fractures in the basement are identified from correlating incoherency in the strong seismic reflectors as well as resistivity contrasts fig 11 demonstrates the consistency of the interpreted geophysical horizons across profiles in the study area the base of the shallow lateritic layer generally occurs at 10 m depths across the site red lines in figs 5d 6c 7c 8c and 9c shallow depth slices from the eri profiles at 5 and 10 m depths fig 11a and b show that this resistive layer is laterally continuous across the site and thins towards the dambo the elevations of the top of the saprolite orange lines in figs 5d 6c 7c 8c and 9c and the top of the basement yellow lines in figs 5d 6c 7c 8c and 9c vary along the profiles fig 11c and d these variations may be attributed to differential weathering of the basement due to changes in lithological composition or the pervasiveness of faulting or fracturing in the bedrock forming preferential pathways for groundwater and thus increased weathering lachassagne et al 2021 4 2 interpreted structure of the weathered basement aquifer system basement aquifers in sub saharan africa are largely thought to consist of four water bearing zones a shallow horizon at the base of the residual soil the saprolite the saprock and fractures in the basement e g mcfarlane et al 1992 muchingami et al 2019 aoulou et al 2021 zarate et al 2021 table 2 summarizes the geophysical signatures of the interpreted water bearing zones in basement aquifers from this study the shallowest water bearing zone is at the base of the sublaterite and the top of the saprolite this zone connects infiltrating water from the surface into the saprolite water flows along this interface from high to low elevations and discharges into the dambos chilton and foster 1995 leborgne et al 2021 we identify this shallow water bearing zone in the logs from bh 5 bh 11 and bh 12 as the thin 1 to 3 m moist clay layer with pebbles and clay nods which separates the sub laterite and saprolite fig 10 additionally the well data bh 1 2a 2b 4 7 8 10 14 supplementary material table s4 show shallow static water levels or saturated intervals correlate strongly with the base of the interpreted sub lateritic layer and top of the saprolite layer profiles 1 2 5 6 9 and 11 figs 5 6 9 supplementary material figs s2 s5 and s6e the saprolite saprock and basement water bearing zones are interpreted from the electrical resistivity results as low resistivities 100 ohm m in the regolith which identify zones where the weathering is significant and the potential for groundwater is high wright 1992 we observe laterally and vertically discontinuous low resistivity 30 ohm m anomalies along profiles 2 3 and 5 in the saprolite figs 6 7 and 9 these anomalies also correspond to incoherent and weak seismic reflectors while the clay rich nature of the saprolite will generally display lower resistivities we interpret these low discontinuous signatures to represent discrete potential water bearing zones within the saprolite similarly low resistivities 30 ohm m which correlate with strong but discontinuous seismic reflections on profiles 1 3 and 4 figs 5 7 and 8 are interpreted as water bearing zones within the saprock discrete low resistivity anomalies that correlate with strong continuous seismic reflectors profiles 1 and 3 figs 5 and 7 are interpreted as water bearing fractures in the relatively unweathered crystalline basement of the fourteen wells and boreholes at the site only six are collocated with 20 m from and do not lie along the margin of the eri profiles i e bh 4 5 10 11 12 and 14 here we evaluate the geophysical signatures associated with these boreholes both the high producing and low producing boreholes bh 4 5 12 and 14 penetrate low resistivity anomalies in section 4 3 we discuss the distinctive features that differentiate high producing from low producing boreholes the dry boreholes generally penetrate high resistivity anomalies bh 10 which is termed dry terminates in a high resistivity zone interpreted to be the top of the basement from the anecdotal drilling report supplementary materials table s4 although the dry bh 11 penetrated and terminated at a low resistivity anomaly the surrounding areas in the resistivity section exhibit high resistivity 500 ohm m which suggests the presence of fresh basement additionally the borehole log indicates the presence of schist and biotite minerals at this depth fig 10 with hard drilling supplementary materials fig s3 these findings indicate that the low resistivity anomaly encountered by bh 11 may be a localized zone of fracture within the basement further the observation of less weatherable high resistivity basement lithologies e g quartzite from the bh logs as well as more weatherable low resistivity basement lithologies e g schist from the bh logs suggest that the basement aquifer system may be controlled by differential weathering lachassagne et al 2021 this differential weathering influences the development of distinct aquifer zones and controls the permeable pathways within the aquifer system enhancing its potential for groundwater storage additionally we highlight the pervasiveness of bedrock rooted normal faults that deform the weathering profile the shallow terminations of these faults commonly occur within or just beneath the sub lateritic layer the deformation style is consistent with the multiple phases of post precambrian tectonic extension recorded in the region delvaux 1991 castaing 1991 kolawole et al 2022 of which the currently active phase is the east african rift system demonstrated by active faulting in southern malawi e g ojo et al 2022 kolawole et al 2022 since the weathering profile is most likely associated with the widely known cenozoic age exhumed weathering surface burke and gunnell 2008 we attribute the normal faulting to the far field stresses from the east african rift system accommodating distributed crustal deformation between the luangwa rift and the southern malawi rift wedmore et al 2021 4 3 groundwater potential of the weathered basement aquifer zones the groundwater potential of weathered basement aquifers depends on several factors including storage potential porosity hydraulic conductivity permeability and the longevity of the groundwater source wright 1992 the shallowest zone at the base of the residual soil offers the most readily available water source with minimal drilling necessary supra basement shallow depths at our site at 40 m and a high permeability due to the silty sands of the laterite zone 1 fig 12 bh 7 and 9 profiles 9 and 10 target this shallow zone supplementary materials figs s5 and s6 the eri results show that the high producing bh 7 depth 19 m on the edge of profile 9 penetrates the base of the thin resistive lateritic horizons at 1172 m elevation in contrast bh 9 which was hand dug to 25 m depths and dry barely penetrated the base of the near surface reflector package interpreted as the base of lateritic soil horizons and thus missed the sub lateritic aquifer zone however this shallow zone does not offer the filtration of the deeper layers which calls into question the groundwater quality of shallow wells like bh 7 mapoma and xie 2014 additionally the sustainability of this zone is questionable as its capacity may be greatly reduced during long periods of droughts within the weathered regolith the saprolite zone zone 2 fig 12 has the greatest storage potential and the highest porosity but low permeability holbrook et al 2014 rempe and dietrich 2018 in general groundwater storage in a weathered basement aquifer system is controlled by the thickness of the regolith primarily due to the high clay content of the weathering products mcfarlane et al 1992 chilton and foster 1995 although capable of supporting a hand pump well for a rural population foster et al 2000 the saprolite is not a sustainable or reliable groundwater resource in a region like mkonga village where the demand for water is increasing morgan 2018 lachassagne et al 2021 this limitation is most pronounced during periods of droughts in which the static water level in wells within the saprolite may dry up due to the halt in recharge chilton and smith carington 1984 water bearing zones within the saprock layer have less storage potential than the saprolite zone 3 fig 12 however where densely fractured the saprock offers greater potential for high producing wells due to large porosity and permeability associated with the densely interconnected fracture networks and direct connectivity to the underlying fractured bedrock wright 1992 leborgne et al 2021 the geophysical results of our study show that bh 4 high producing which supports a water storage reservoir for the child legacy international hospital penetrates a low resistivity anomaly 10 ohm m at 1181 to 1158 m elevation that correlates with strong but discontinuous seismic reflectors fig 5 similarly the high producing bh 5 penetrates a conductive anomaly 30 ohm m at an elevation between 1171 to 1153 m supplementary materials fig s2 thus we interpret the high producing bh 4 and 5 as penetrating through a water saturated zone in the saprolite layer and into the fractured zone of the saprock layer this interpretation is supported by the log of bh 5 fig 10 these boreholes likely benefit from the storage potential of the saprolite seasonal recharge of infiltrating groundwater from the base of the sub lateritic layer and the more favorable permeability of the fractured saprock we interpret these characteristics to be representative of the optimum weathered basement aquifer potential in the region capable of supporting high producing boreholes based on these criteria we identified four potential targets for drilling the first target is the low resistivity anomaly on profile 1 at 800 m fig 5 this anomaly was drilled for bh 14 and currently supports a high producing well the second and third targets are the low resistivity anomalies below the interpreted sub lateritic layer located on profile 3 centered at distances of 200 and 260 m fig 7c and d the fourth target is the conductive zone on profile 4 at an elevation of 1178 to 1143 m centered at profile distance of 110 m fig 8c and d the anomaly along profile 4 was selected as the focus of bh 12 however the drilling missed the intended target and only penetrated the shallow aquifer zone 1 resulting in a low producing bh thus ideal targets for shallow to medium depth boreholes must possess the defined characteristics of an optimum weathered basement aquifer drilling to the top of the saprolite or into isolated low resistivity anomalies in the saprolite may result in low producing or dry boreholes water bearing fractures and fault zones in the basement offer decent storage potential and permeability so long as the fracture system is large enough or that there is good connectivity between the fractures zone 4 fig 12 acworth 1987 leborgne et al 2021 the water bearing potential of this zone is linked to the development of secondary porosity related to the connectivity of the fractures chilton and foster 1995 aizebeokhai and oyeyemi 2018 tectonic basement fractures i e non exfoliation weathering related are typically deep reaching e g kolawole et al 2019 however successful exploration in such systems results in expensive borehole campaigns because they generally constitute narrow targets to drill and as such their successful geophysical detection drill targeting and production constitute a challenging exploration process e g bh 11 chandra et al 2019 we emphasize that the presence of a connected fracture network does not necessarily imply high permeability because the permeability of fractures is dependent on if they are open or occluded 5 conclusion here by integrating multiple geophysical methods such as electrical resistivity and 2 d seismic reflection with borehole data we are able to provide a robust interpretation of weathered basement aquifers and potential target zones for groundwater exploration relevant to tropical and inter tropical environments we find strong correlations between the independent datasets allowing us to identify the four commonly known layers of the basement weathering profile the lateritic soils the saprolite the saprock and the fractured fresh basement within this basement weathering profile we identified four potential water bearing zones of interest a shallow zone occurring at the base of the lateritic soils a zone within the saprolite a zone within the saprock and a deeper zone in the fractured basement all of which are cut by through going normal faults possibly associated with east african rift regional stresses we also identify three characteristics defining an optimal target for a productive borehole siting these include the ability of the aquifer unit to take advantage of 1 seasonal recharge of infiltrating groundwater from the base of the lateritic layer 2 storage potential of the saprolite and 3 the permeability of the saprock thus for shallow groundwater exploration in thick weathered basement aquifer systems such as the study area we propose low resistivity anomalies 30 ohm m that span both the saprolite and the fractured saprock zones may produce considerable success for shallow depth groundwater resources overall we conclude that the identified targets represent water bearing zones that connect the saprolite and saprock to recharge pathways at the base of the sub laterite credit authorship contribution statement leonard ohenhen conceptualization methodology writing original draft preparation writing reviewing

arid climate with annual average rainfall ranging from 40 mm red sea coast to 80 mm upstream water divide hilly areas the average annual air temperature varies from 24 c to 43 c summer and from 10 25 c winter the study region receives precipitation from november to january and sometimes till april niyazi et al 2022 geomorphologically the al madinah al munawarah province inclines from the east upstream to the west downstream and it is characterized by numerous topographic features of lowlands highlands piedmont plains hilly areas and tributaries with various elevations the geomorphological features of the study area can be described as the following 1 lowland areas are positioned between the redsea coastline and the sabkhas generally the lowland parts experience flash floods by the main channels of catchments which are overpassed to the red sea this portion is formed by wadi deposits and is appropriate for groundwater recharge forming the shallow unconsolidated groundwater aquifer abu alainine 1979 2 hilly areas are extended from the red sea coastline to the mountainous series with width ranges from 50 km to 160 km this part is moderately inclined and is composed of gravel boulders and alluvial deposits most of the tributaries of the drainage basins are initiated in the hijaz mountainous series al sarawat mountains 3 highland areas of the hijaz mountainous extend eastward of the hilly areas and are characterized by a steep slope 3000 mamsl the geology of the study area is considered as a main significant controlling factor that has a direct influence on groundwater and surface water by governing the hydrological behaviour of the catchment such as catchment shape orders of the stream network flood flow course and groundwater recharge the study region is a part of the arabian shield eastern periphery of the red sea rift it originated in the oligocene and continued into the holocene era the precambrian rocks are outcropping through the northeastern part of the red sea this study province is characterized by the occurrence of numerous volcanic interruptions and dikes which are formed during the evolution of the red sea rift fig 1 and it ranges from pre cambrian basement to quaternary deposits in the total area the basement rocks occupied about 59 and the volcanic rocks harrats occupy about 20 and are scattered in numerous places as shown in fig 1 the harrats are dark coloured basaltic rocks which were formed as a product of the eruption of magma during the tertiary and quaternary times the quaternary deposits occupy about 14 which is considered the essential water bearing formation of al madinah al munawarah these deposits are composed of sand gravel and boulders with shale intercalations 3 materials and methods 3 1 water sampling

of the analysis the precision and measurement repeatability of each analysis was less than 2 the ion balance error is computed which is less than 5 total dissolved solids tds mg l ec 0 64 and total hardness th th mg l 2 495 ca2 mg l 4 115 mg2 mg l were calculated from water quality data 3 2 data analysis spatial distribution and well s location maps were prepared using the arcgis v10 5 software the inverse distance weighted idw method was applied to prepare spatial maps further gibbs and piper s plots were employed to explain the major geochemical processes controlling groundwater quality and to identify the hydrochemical facies in this aquifer moreover multivariate statistical analysis geochemical bivariate diagrams and ionic ratios were applied to explore the water chemistry in detail in this basin 3 3 statistical analysis ibm spss v 16 0 was applied for descriptive statistics analysis of water quality data further the pearson correlation coefficient was also estimated in this study multivariate statistical analysis msa namely hierarchical cluster analysis hca and principal component analysis pca were employed before doing pca and hca analysis the data were subjected to standardization through log transformation a standard score for each variable was employed for pca and hca güler et al 2002 ren et al 2021 ward method was used with the squared euclidean distance in hca analysis ward 1963 varimax rotation and kaiser normalization were applied in pca analysis and pcs with an eigenvalue greater than one were extracted and used for discussion 4 results and discussion 4 1 general groundwater chemistry the groundwater chemistry shows wide variation and it is noticed in ec table 1 around 54 of samples are unsuitable for drinking due to high salinity tds 1500 mg l likewise 28 of samples are inappropriate for irrigation application due to high salinity tds 3000 mg l davis and de weist 1966 rajmohan et al 2019 in ksa previous studies also documented high salinity in groundwater in various basins masoud et al 2018 rajmohan et al 2019 rajmohan et al 2021a masoud et al 2022 the total hardness th 82 4398 mg l average 878 mg l suggests that groundwater is moderately hard 5 hard 17 and very hard 78 sawyer 1959 further 62 of groundwater samples surpassed the recommended limit of who 2017 th 500 for drinking the groundwater in this aquifer is neutral to alkaline except for a few samples ph 7 13 table 1 the concentration of na and k ranges from 42 mg l to 1755 mg l and from 1 mg l to 76 mg l with a mean value of 471 mg l and 12 mg l respectively likewise the concentration of ca2 and mg2 varies from 16 mg l to 854 mg l and from 2 mg l to 551 mg l with an average value of 228 mg l and 75 mg l respectively hco3 and co3 2 concentrations are from 31 mg l to 1257 mg l and from bdl to 51 mg l with a mean value of 180 mg l and 11 mg l respectively dissolved silica concentration is between 6 1 mg l and 130 mg l with an average value of 25 9 mg l weathering of silicate and carbonate minerals and evaporation are predominant sources for most of the major ions in the groundwater refer to section 4 7 no3 and po4 3 are good indicators to identify the anthropogenic influences on water chemistry rao and prasad 1997 kim et al 2021 panda et al 2022 zendehbad et al 2022 in the study area the concentration of no3 and po4 3 ranges from 0 02 mg l to 359 mg l and from bdl to 5 2 mg l with an average value of 59 mg l and 0 3 mg l respectively in this basin 91 of samples depict less than 1 mg l of po4 3 in the groundwater earlier studies reported that po4 3 is mostly retained in the aquifer materials by adsorption mabilde et al 2017 patience et al 2021 like po4 3 the concentration of f is also low in the study region f is less than 1 mg l in 82 of samples and it varies from bdl to 3 9 mg l with a mean value of 0 6 mg l besides br and i are good indicators to explore the marine impact on groundwater chemistry mandilaras et al 2008 the concentration of br and i are between 0 06 mg l and 5 8 mg l and from 0 01 mg l to 1 3 mg l with an avarage value of 0 8 mg l and 0 1 mg l respectively the concentration of these ions is generally low in the study area except few wells refer to section 4 3 4 2 relationship between groundwater flow geology and hydrochemistry fig 1b indicates the depth to groundwater level gwl in the study site the gwl varied from 3 m bgl to 200 m bgl with an average value of 39 m bgl table 1 the high standard deviation implies that there is a large variation in gwl as well as the depths of the wells in this aquifer fig 1b displays that deep gwl occurred in the southern region followed by the northern and north eastern regions shallow gwl 20 m bgl is noticed in the western and coastal regions besides a few wells situated in the southeastern region also have shallow water levels 10 and 20 mbgl fig 2a explains the groundwater flow direction in this study site in this aquifer groundwater flows from east to west but fig 2a exposes the disturbed flow in the central part rectangle zone of the study area geologically this zone is covered by the harat precambrian and quaternary formations gwl is deep in harat formations which may be attributed to low fractures and joints in the basement rocks and consequently reduces recharge from rainfall as well as preventing the horizontal and vertical flow from surrounding aquifers further groundwater ec in the rectangle zone is high 5000 µs cm compared to other places in the study site fig 2b a similar trend is also noticed in most of the major ions figure sf1 the enrichment of chemical ions in this zone suggests that either geology or restricted groundwater flow enhances solute load in the groundwater there is no lithological or borewell drilling data to discuss deeply the impact of geology on water chemistry however restricted groundwater flow most likely enhances evaporation due to long storage consequently increasing salinity in the water bartarya 1993 rafique et al 2015 alfarrah et al 2017 elumalai et al 2019 further in the harrat area the weathered rocks are silty clay and clay which may reduce the infiltration of standing water on the soil surface and enhances evaporation also the capillary fringe in such soils is thicker making the evaporation process even faster elumalai et al 2019 also reported that fluoride enrichment is linked to evaporation processes in northern kwazulu natal and jozini aquifers in south africa 4 3 demarcation of contamination zones using groundwater chemistry the supplementary figure sf1 illustrates the major and minor ions spatial distribution in this aquifer the spatial distribution of major ions ca2 mg2 na k cl and so4 2 follow a similar trend to ec and the high concentration exists in the central part rectangle zone of the study site fig 2b further the northwestern region also expresses the elevated concentration of these elements which seems to be due to saline water invasion as the water table in wells 28 and 19 are below the mean sea level msl 9 mamsl 6 m amsl in addition high concentration is also observed in the southeastern region where gwl is between 10 and 15 m bgl fig 1b na concentration is 500 mg l in most of the study sites except the central part and the lowest concentrations are recorded in the northeast and western side wells likewise the k concentration is 12 mg l except in the central region a similar trend is also noticed in the ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 in this aquifer in the case of minor ions br and i also behave like major ions and ec and the central part of the study site has a high concentration in addition br shows enrichment in the northwestern region due to seawater intrusion in contrast to these observations f and hco3 behave differently the spatial distribution pattern of f displays two major zones with a concentration of 0 6 mg l and 0 6 1 5 mg l respectively which covered most of the study site groundwater with high f on the southeastern side suggests the possibility for surface contamination sources owing to shallow water level gwl 15 mbgl the spatial pattern of hco3 and sio2 depict that wells with deep gwl located on the southern side have high concentrations which justified the lithogenic input on water chemistry no3 expresses different patterns and high concentration is observed in the southwest as well as southeastern side wells which are mostly shallow shallow wells are frequently vulnerable to sub surface and surface contamination sources which cause high no3 in the groundwater rajmohan and amarasinghe 2016 rajmohan 2020 4 4 classification of groundwater wells using hierarchical cluster analysis in multivariate statistical analysis hierarchical cluster analysis hca is an important tool to classify the variables or cases wells in hydrochemistry elumalai et al 2019 rajmohan et al 2021b hca was employed to classify the water samples wells with similarities in chemical characteristics hca resulted in three clusters and 61 25 and 14 of samples are clustered in c1 c2 and c3 respectively fig 3 and table 1 illustrate the chemical characteristics of each cluster the salinity in the groundwater increases from c1 to c3 wells and most of the major ions follow the same trend in the c1 wells 61 n 68 the ph ranged from 6 5 to 8 3 with a mean value of 7 4 table 1 the ec 582 µs cm 4650 µs cm average 1869 µs cm indicates that the groundwater in this cluster is less mineralised compared to c2 and c3 wells further gwl 3 195 m bgl average 40 m bgl table 1 the standard deviation 39 m bgl suggests the heterogeneity in well depth in this cluster fig 3a depicts that the average concentration of most of the ions in c1 is comparatively low moreover wells in c1 are distributed all over the study site fig 3b in the c2 wells 25 n 28 groundwater salinity ec 2300 µs cm 8600 µs cm average 4921 µs cm is in between the c1 and c2 wells and most of the variables follow a similar trend fig 3 table 1 however the mean concentration of hco3 sio2 and f is slightly greater than in the c1 and c3 wells likewise the mean no3 concentration is greater than in c1 and c3 wells like c1 wells in this cluster also spread in the study site fig 3b the groundwater chemistry in c3 wells 14 n 16 is different from other clusters fig 3 and table 1 these wells are mostly shallow and gwl ranged from 3 5 to 65 mbgl with an average of 19 m bgl table 1 the gwl is less than 26 m bgl except for two wells well nos 75 106 fig 3a illustrates that groundwater in this cluster is highly mineralized and enriched with most of the variables the ec is between 6540 µs cm and 14050 µs cm with an average of 9461 µs cm besides br i and po4 3 are also accumulated more in these wells the spatial distribution pattern depicts that these are mostly spread in the central part followed by the coastal belt in the coastal region well numbers 1 and 7 are located far from the coast and the water table is 33 m amsl and 94 m amsl respectively which rule out the impact of seawater invasion however well numbers 28 and 19 are likely impaired by the seawater intrusion attributed to the depletion of groundwater level wt 9 m amsl and 6 m amsl caused by the pumping these inferences suggest that the groundwater chemistry in c3 wells is largely affected by evaporation evaporite dissolution and long storage owing to restricted flow the average of hco3 co3 2 and sio2 in the groundwater in c1 c2 and c3 wells are not significantly varied fig 3a table 1 which reveals that rock water interaction mineral weathering is not the sole source for the variation in water chemistry in these clusters other factors evaporation and anthropogenic input are most likely to modify the water quality in this aquifer 4 5 vertical distribution of hydrochemistry fig 4 illustrates the vertical distribution of ionic constituents in the cluster groups in the study area well depth details are not available for all the wells hence gwl is employed here to understand the relationship between groundwater level and hydrochemistry shallow wells have high concentrations for most of the variables fig 4 wells in c3 have shallow gwl 26 m bgl except for two wells but in the c1 and c2 wells both shallow and deep gwls are noticed vertical distribution of ph reveals that it increases with depth and high salinity water is acidic ph 7 especially c3 wells the ec th major cations cl and so4 2 behave mostly similar and wells with shallow gwl are highly enriched with these variables further these concentrations are decreasing with increasing depth however hco3 and sio2 have different trends and high concentrations are noticed in deep wells the vertical distribution of br and i behave like ec and enrichments are observed in the shallow depth vertical distribution of po4 3 is not showing any trend and is mostly constant with depth except for two wells f behaves like major ions and high concentrations occurred in the shallow depth similarly no3 distribution also follows the ec and major ions but elevated values are also recorded in some deep wells which indicates the recharge of contaminant through the fractures and joints in the study site these inferences imply that water chemistry is influenced by both geogenic as well as man made interventions 4 6 hydrochemical facies in cluster groups piper trilinear diagram is generally employed to explain the hydrochemical facies and to identify the dominant cation anion in the aquifer piper 1944 groundwater samples from all three clusters c1 c2 and c3 were plotted in this diagram fig 5 in the cation triangle the majority of the samples are plotted on two major zones namely mixed cations as well as na k water types irrespective of clusters in addition a few samples from c1 fall in the ca2 zone in the case of anions triangle water samples are plotted on three major zones such as mixed anions cl and so4 2 dominated facies samples from c1 wells are mostly plotted on mixed as well as cl dominated facies except for four samples which belong to hco3 co3 2 facies but in the c2 and c3 wells water samples are plotted on two major zones namely cl and so4 2 followed by the mixed one further water samples from c1 wells are clustered largely in the nacl and camgcl hydrochemical facies except for a few samples in the c2 and c3 wells the predominate hydrochemical facies are nacl followed by the cacl except for a few samples which are plotted on camgcl facies nacl facies indicates the role of evaporation which eliminates the ca mg as carbonates from the system by precipitation alvarez et al 2015 li et al 2019 rajmohan et al 2021b camgcl facies depict the influences of ion exchange and anthropogenic impact in this aquifer 4 7 geochemical processes and source of ions in the cluster groups 4 7 1 impact of evaporation mineral weathering and ion exchange processes on water chemistry bivariate plots and ionic ratios are generally employed to identify the geochemical processes and the ion sources in the aquifer abdalla 2015 alfaifi 2019 elumalai et al 2022 in the groundwater chemical constituents are derived from various sources and processes and largely from rock mineral water interaction and anthropogenic input rajmohan and elango 2004 2006 elumalai et al 2019 nethononda et al 2019 further evaporation enriched these chemical constituents in the aquifer rajmohan et al 2021b the contribution of mineral weathering rainfall input and evaporation sources in the groundwater are identified and differentiated using gibbs plots gibbs 1970 in these plots ionic ratios and salinity tds were employed water samples were plotted on gibbs plots to explore the influences of each source and process in this aquifer fig 5 fig 5 illustrates that c1 samples are presented in mineral weathering 44 and evaporation 56 zones in c2 and c3 samples are clustered in the evaporation zone only further in the anion plot cl cl hco3 ratio expresses a positive trend with salinity thus water chemistry is primarily regulated by evaporation and mineral weathering in this aquifer the na k na k ca ratio in the cation plot increases without affecting salinity which indicates the enrichment of na by cation exchange as ion exchange won t affect the salinity the mca mg ratio is frequently applied to identify the influence of dolomite calcite and silicate weathering on water chemistry mayo and loucks 1995 rajmohan and prathapar 2016 rajmohan et al 2017 elumalai et al 2022 dolomite dissolution maintains mca mg ratio unity but higher ratios show the influences of calcite 2 mca mg 1 as well as silicate weathering mca mg 2 in this aquifer groundwater in c1 wells is mainly affected by silicate weathering 69 calcite 19 and dolomite 12 dissolution in the case of c2 wells both silicate and calcite are equally contributed 40 in the groundwater followed by the dolomite 20 groundwater in the c3 is primarily governed by calcite 50 silicates 30 and dolomite dissolution precipitation and dissolution of carbonate minerals are strongly linked to evaporation rajmohan et al 2021b the role of silicate carbonate and evaporite influences on water chemistry is explored using the molar ratio of hco3 na ca na and mg na fig 6a and b gaillardet et al 1999 rajmohan et al 2021b elumalai et al 2022 fig 6a illustrates that c1 samples are plotted between the evaporites and silicates zone as well as on the evaporite zone but samples from c2 and c3 wells are clustered on evaporite and below the evaporite zone fig 6b displays that c1 c2 and c3 samples are mostly plotted in the silicates zone and between silicates and evaporite zones these inferences reveal that groundwater in c1 wells is predominantly influenced by the weathering silicate rocks which enriches major ions in the groundwater but groundwater in c2 and c3 wells is mostly affected by evaporation and evaporite dissolution evaporation enhances the precipitation of carbonates in the aquifer which leads to the depletion of the mhco3 na ratio hence the water chemistry in this aquifer is strongly affected by silicate weathering evaporation and evaporite dissolution gibbs plots fig 5 also implied this inference as evaporation is a leading process in this aquifer the bivariate plot of ca2 mg2 vs alkalinity so4 2 is a good tool to differentiate the mineral weathering ca mg silicates carbonates sulphates and ion exchange reactions fig 6c rajmohan and elango 2004 rajmohan et al 2017 ca2 and mg2 obtained from the dissolution of ca mg silicates sulphate and carbonates minerals are generally balanced by the alkalinity hco3 co3 2 and so4 2 in the aquifer fig 6c hence these parameters maintain a 1 1 equivalent ratio between them fig 6c illustrates that c1 samples are mostly plotted on a 1 1 line and justified the influences of ca mg silicates carbonate and sulphate minerals dissolution in this aquifer however few samples are deviated and show high concentrations of alkalinity and so4 2 over ca2 mg2 similarly groundwater from c2 and c3 wells also indicates a similar trend this observation suggests that the na k silicate minerals weathering produces excess alkalinity or removal of ca2 mg2 by cation exchange reactions in the system further few samples in c3 wells have excess ca2 mg2 over alkalinity so4 2 because of reverse ion exchange as it often occurs in high salinity water zaidi et al 2015 rajmohan et al 2021b the na cl ratio is quite useful to explore the role of weathering evaporation and ion exchange in groundwater chemistry the evaporation process maintains na cl 1 while increasing the salinity rajmohan et al 2017 fig 6d here some samples are plotted near to evaporation trend especially c3 wells but the majority of them have a higher na cl ratio in the study region the na cl ratio is not varying much concerning clusters c1 0 41 2 51 1 18 mean c2 0 60 2 73 1 32 mean c3 0 69 2 60 1 3 mean high na over cl may be explained by the two major processes namely weathering of na silicates and cation exchange na released from weathering of silicates is balanced by alkalinity the average percentage of alkalinity in c1 c2 and c3 wells are 19 6 8 6 and 3 8 respectively which implies that excess na over cl is not mainly derived from weathering processes it is noticed in c3 wells hence ion exchange processes are also governing the water chemistry in this aquifer the equations explain the cation exchange eq 1 as well as the reverse ion exchange eq 2 reaction in the aquifer 1 na k soil ca 2 mg 2 gw 2 na k gw ca mg soil 2 na k gw ca mg soil na k soil ca 2 mg 2 gw in the cation exchange reactions na k is released to groundwater while reverse ion exchange accumulates ca mg in the groundwater fisher and mullican 1997 applied ca2 mg2 alkalinity so4 2 and na k cl plots to interpret ion exchange in the aquifer according to them if the ion exchange processes are governing the major cations in the groundwater this plot results in a linear relationship with a negative slope in the study site fig 6e depicts that groundwater from all three clusters expresses a strong linear relationship with negative slopes 0 99 c1 0 91 c2 1 04 c3 the r 2 values of c1 c2 and c3 are 0 95 0 96 and 0 96 respectively this observation justifies the impact of ion exchange reactions in water chemistry further schoeller 1977 produced chloro alkaline indices cai1 cai2 to explain reverse and cation ion exchange processes in the aquifer eqs 3 and 4 3 cai 1 cl na k cl 4 cai 2 cl na k cl hco 3 so 4 no 3 cation exchange results in negative values of cai1 and cai2 whereas reverse ion exchange provides positive value fig 6f depicts that around 63 of samples are plotted on the cation exchange zone further cation exchange is dominating in 62 64 and 63 of samples in c1 c2 and c3 wells respectively these inferences justify that na k from aquifer materials replaced the ca mg in the groundwater overall the ion exchange reactions chiefly affected the water chemistry in this aquifer the interrelationship between the variables can be identified using the pearson correlation matrix the significant and strong correlation is generally identified using p value p 0 01 and r 2 value r 2 0 5 the r 2 values should be greater than 0 5 then only the interrelationship can be meaningful in this study variables namely hco3 co3 2 no3 sio2 f po4 3 and i are not correlating with other variables as well as each other table 2 likewise ph expresses a negative relationship with ca2 but it is not significant r 2 0 49 ec expresses strong positive correlation with th r 2 0 91 na r 2 0 94 k r 2 0 78 ca2 r 2 0 86 mg2 r 2 0 86 cl r 2 0 92 so4 2 r 2 0 93 and br r 2 0 87 table 2 the major cations cl so4 2 and br also show similar behaviour like ec and have a strong relationship between each other and other variables this observation justifies that the water chemistry is mostly governed by evaporation evaporites and long storage attributed to restricted flow these processes are most likely masking the rock water interaction in this aquifer 4 7 2 exploring the source of ions and geochemical processes by principal component analysis principal component analysis pca was carried out in this study as it is an important tool to explore the source of chemical constituents in the aquifer and associated geochemical processes in this study pca resulted in five components with eigenvalue 1 and explains 78 of the total variance pc1 44 was highly loaded by the th tds ec na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and br the strong loading of br cl and so4 2 demonstrate that pc1 represents the role of evaporation and evaporite dissolution in this aquifer pc2 12 3 indicates the strong positive loading of no3 po4 3 i and f the vertical distribution of these variables displays a similar trend and shows elevated concentrations in the shallow water tables fig 4 further high positive loading of no3 and po4 3 ensures the anthropogenic input namely irrigation return flow domestic wastewater leakage accumulation and septic tank leakage pc3 8 2 shows strong loading of silica and co3 which justifies the influences of silicate weathering on water chemistry the negative loading of ph and positive loading of hco3 in the pc4 7 4 explains the carbonate dissolution in this aquifer as the acidic conditions facilitate mineral weathering in any aquifer pc5 7 of total variance shows strong loading gwl fig 4 depicts that wells with shallow gwl are highly mineralized compared to deep wells hence this pc explains the importance of gwl table 3 5 conclusions in the al madinah al munawarah province high salinity and hardness restrict groundwater use for drinking irrigation and other applications in the study site groundwater flow is disturbed in the central region due to geology harat formations long storage caused by the restricted groundwater flow and evaporation have enriched the salinity and major and minor ions in the groundwater high f and no3 with shallow gwl in the southeast and southwestern regions indicate the impact of anthropogenic input high hco3 and sio2 in the deep gwl wells located on the southern side justified the role of rock water interaction in this aquifer groundwater classification using hierarchical cluster analysis hca resulted in three clusters c1 61 c2 25 and c3 14 of samples the average concentration of hco3 co3 2 and sio2 in the groundwater in c1 c2 and c3 wells do not vary significantly which ensures that rock water interaction mineral weathering is not the sole source for the variation in water chemistry the molar ratios ca na mg na and hco3 na illustrate that groundwater in c1 wells is governed by the weathering of silicate rocks but groundwater in c2 and c3 wells is chiefly regulated by evaporation and evaporite dissolution in addition ion exchange especially cation exchange reactions 63 also affected water chemistry in this aquifer pearson correlation matrix also justifies that the water chemistry is principally affected by evaporation evaporites and long storage owing to restricted flow principal component analysis pca resulted in five components 78 of the total variance and pc1 43 6 indicates the role of evaporation and evaporite dissolution in this aquifer pc2 12 3 ensures anthropogenic interventions like septic tank leakage irrigation return flow and domestic wastewater leakage accumulation on groundwater pc3 8 2 pc4 7 4 and pc5 explain the role of silicate weathering carbonate dissolution and gwl respectively on water chemistry this study recommended that policymakers and local municipalities should implement a regular monitoring plan to protect this aquifer in addition proper treatment techniques should be employed to provide safe water for local inhabitants detailed lithological data is not available on the study site hence this study recommended lithological data collection through test drilling this study also implies that integrating geochemical tools with statistical analysis is a good option to explore the hydrochemistry of any aquifer in the globe funding this

the data that have been used are confidential 1 introduction groundwater is a key freshwater source and millions of people in the world depend on groundwater for daily water needs unesco 2012 wwap 2015 freshwater availability and accessibility are reduced globally mainly in semi arid arid regions because of climate change and other factors khater 2010 denicola et al 2015 cuthbert et al 2019 in the middle east region constant growth in population and other sectors namely agriculture urban tourism and industries enhance freshwater requirements the kingdom of saudi arabia ksa is also facing similar challenges climate change mainly the variability in rainfall which causes flash floods followed by high runoff and low recharge is another factor that increases the challenge to freshwater availability in ksa masoud 2015 basahi et al 2017 in the ksa the groundwater aquifers can be classified into deep non renewable aquifers confined aquifers and shallow renewable aquifers water table aquifers which are contributing 80 of the freshwater need in this country ouda et al 2014 niyazi et al 2018 besides surface water 10 desalinated water 5 and other water resources 5 are also involved

reactions processes and dissolution precipitation of minerals in the aquifer rajmohan and elango 2004 2006 rajmohan and prathapar 2016 el yousfi et al 2022 elumalai et al 2022 natesan et al 2022 in addition anthropogenic interventions namely discharge of wastewater dumping sites landfills application of fertilizers and manures irrigation return flow industries waste disposal and excessive pumping affect groundwater quality nriagu and pacyna 1988 kadam et al 2019 ziadi et al 2019 manikandan et al 2020 rajmohan 2020 batsaikhan et al 2021 more et al 2021 oh et al 2021 el mountassir et al 2022 fida et al 2022 mukherjee and singh 2022 once the aquifer is contaminated the resilience time of the aquifer is too high and treatment of the water also causes financial and environmental stress to the water planners suppliers thus detailed knowledge of groundwater chemistry sources of contamination and other geochemical processes is essential for sustainable groundwater management in any region geochemical tools namely ionic ratios bivariate plots piper and chadha diagrams and gibbs plots are commonly employed to explain the hydrochemistry and geochemical processes in the aquifer masoud et al 2018 nethononda et al 2019 manikandan et al 2020 rajmohan et al 2021b yang et al 2022 besides multivariate statistical analysis is also employed broadly to identify the elements association and their origins elumalai et al 2019 malik et al 2021 rajmohan 2021 elumalai et al 2023 employed both geochemical tools and multivariate statisitical analysis to evaluate geochemical processes governing groundwater chemistry in south africa this study jusitified that integration of both geochemical tools and multivariate statistical analysis are reliable approach to explore geochemical processes in the semi arid aquifer besides gong et al 2022 applied a chemical and isotopic tracers to identify the source and origin of solutes in groundwater in central qinghai tibet plateau china and justified the role of tracers on groundwater sources and chemistry assessment the interrelationship between groundwater flow and water chemistry is studied by some researchers aiuppa et al 2000 simmons et al 2002 salameh and hammouri 2008 basahi et al 2018 masoud et al 2018 gong et al 2022 salameh and hammouri 2008 studied the relationship between groundwater salinity and flow path in jordan and highlighted the interrelationship between water salinity and various rock types namely permo triassic jurassic rocks basaltic dykes sills and evaporites residual basahi et al 2018 reported that flashflood recharge and groundwater flow accumulated the metals in the downstream wells and also highlighted that there is a strong relationship between metals mobility and groundwater flow in the wadi baysh basin saudi arabia masoud et al 2018 documented that flash flood recharge in upstream enhances groundwater flow and improve water quality in the downstream wells both basahi et

2022 however detailed hydrochemical studies in this country are limited hence the primary objective of this work is to assess the hydrochemistry geochemical processes source of ions and their relationship with groundwater flow and geology in the al madinah al munawarah province using an integrated approach the detailed objectives are a to explore the relationship between hydrochemistry groundwater flow and geology b to identify the contamination zones using spatial distribution maps of water chemistry using the gis tool c to identify the vertical variation in hydrochemistry e to explore the hydrochemical facies in this aquifer and d to investigate the geochemical processes and source of ions by geochemical tools pearson correlation matrix and multivariate statistical analysis 2 study area al madinah al munawarah province is situated within the western region of ksa 37 23 5 42 10 e 22 28 27 27 n and covers 176710 km2 fig 1 the study area is characterized by a hyper arid to arid climate with annual average rainfall ranging from 40 mm red sea coast to 80 mm upstream water divide hilly areas the average annual air temperature varies from 24 c to 43 c summer and from 10 25 c winter the study region receives precipitation from november to january and sometimes till april niyazi et al 2022 geomorphologically the al madinah al munawarah province inclines from the east upstream to the west downstream and it is characterized by numerous topographic features of lowlands highlands piedmont plains hilly areas and tributaries with various elevations the geomorphological features of the study area can be described as the following 1 lowland areas are positioned between the redsea coastline and the sabkhas generally the lowland parts experience flash floods by the main channels of catchments which are overpassed to the red sea this portion is formed by wadi deposits and is appropriate for groundwater recharge forming the shallow unconsolidated groundwater aquifer abu alainine 1979 2 hilly areas are extended from the red sea coastline to the mountainous series with width ranges from 50 km to 160 km this part is moderately inclined and is composed of gravel boulders and alluvial deposits most of the tributaries of the drainage basins are initiated in the hijaz mountainous series al sarawat mountains 3 highland areas of the hijaz mountainous extend eastward of the hilly areas and are characterized by a steep slope 3000 mamsl the geology of the study area is considered as a main significant controlling factor that has a direct influence on groundwater and surface water by governing the hydrological behaviour of the catchment such as catchment shape orders of the stream network flood flow course and groundwater recharge the study region is a part of the arabian shield eastern periphery of the red sea rift it originated in the oligocene and continued into the holocene era the precambrian rocks are outcropping through the northeastern part of the red sea this study province is characterized by the occurrence of numerous volcanic interruptions and dikes which are formed during the evolution of the red sea rift fig 1 and it ranges from pre cambrian basement to quaternary deposits in the total area the basement rocks occupied about 59 and the volcanic rocks harrats occupy about 20 and are scattered in numerous places as shown in fig 1 the harrats are dark coloured basaltic rocks which were formed as a product of the eruption of magma during the tertiary and quaternary times the quaternary deposits occupy about 14 which is considered the essential water bearing formation of al madinah al munawarah these deposits are composed of sand gravel and boulders with shale intercalations 3 materials and methods 3 1 water sampling and laboratory analysis fieldwork was carried out in and around al madinah al munawarah province to collect the groundwater samples n 112 as well as to measure the groundwater level in the existing wells static groundwater level was estimated in the available wells by a water level sounder wells were pumped purging before sampling and then the samples were obtained electrical conductivity ec ph and temperature were estimated in the field using a handheld meter water samples were collected in hdpe containers 500 ml samples were sealed and stored in an ice box 4 c international standard guidelines apha 2017 were applied during the fieldwork as well as laboratory analysis a global position system gps was employed to record sampled wells locations in this study 16 parameters were analysed and two parameters were calculated carbonate and bicarbonate were analysed through volumetric titration apha 2017 dissolved silica was analysed using the molybdo silicate method epa 366 by uv vis uv 1700 shimadzu the remaining major ions na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and minor ions no3 br f po4 3 i in the water samples were analysed by ion chromatography thermo scientific ics 5000 before the analysis the ion chromatography was calibrated with international calibration standards accutrace reference standard usa further standards and blanks were employed to ensure the accuracy and precision of the analysis the precision and measurement repeatability of each analysis was less than 2 the ion balance error is computed which is less than 5 total dissolved solids tds mg l ec 0 64 and total hardness th th mg l 2 495 ca2 mg l 4 115 mg2 mg l were calculated from water quality data 3 2 data analysis spatial distribution and well s location maps were prepared using the arcgis v10 5 software the inverse distance weighted idw method was applied to prepare spatial maps further gibbs and piper s plots were employed to explain the major geochemical processes controlling groundwater quality and to identify the hydrochemical facies in this aquifer moreover multivariate statistical analysis geochemical bivariate diagrams and ionic ratios were applied to explore the water chemistry in detail in this basin 3 3 statistical analysis ibm spss v 16 0 was applied for descriptive statistics analysis of water quality data further the pearson correlation coefficient was also estimated in this study multivariate statistical analysis msa namely hierarchical cluster analysis hca and principal component analysis pca were employed before doing pca and hca analysis the data were subjected to standardization through log transformation a standard score for each variable was employed for pca and hca güler et al 2002 ren et al 2021 ward method was used with the squared euclidean distance in hca analysis ward 1963 varimax rotation and kaiser normalization were applied in pca analysis and pcs with an eigenvalue greater than one were extracted and used for discussion 4 results and discussion 4 1 general groundwater chemistry the groundwater chemistry shows wide variation and it is noticed in ec table 1 around 54 of samples are unsuitable for drinking due to high salinity tds 1500 mg l likewise 28 of samples are inappropriate for irrigation application due to high salinity tds 3000 mg l davis and de weist 1966 rajmohan et al 2019 in ksa previous studies also documented high salinity in groundwater in various basins masoud et al 2018 rajmohan et al 2019 rajmohan et al 2021a masoud et al 2022 the total hardness th 82 4398 mg l average 878 mg l suggests that groundwater is moderately hard 5 hard 17 and very hard 78 sawyer 1959 further 62 of groundwater samples surpassed the recommended limit of who 2017 th 500 for drinking the groundwater in this aquifer is neutral to alkaline except for a few samples ph 7 13 table 1 the concentration of na and k ranges from 42 mg l to 1755 mg l and from 1 mg l to 76 mg l with a mean value of 471 mg l and 12 mg l respectively likewise the concentration of ca2 and mg2 varies from 16 mg l to 854 mg l and from 2 mg l to 551 mg l with an average value of 228 mg l and 75 mg l respectively hco3 and co3 2 concentrations are from 31 mg l to 1257 mg l and from bdl to 51 mg l with a mean value of 180 mg l and 11 mg l respectively dissolved silica concentration is between 6 1 mg l and 130 mg l with an average value of 25 9 mg l weathering of silicate and carbonate minerals and evaporation are predominant sources for most of the major ions in the groundwater refer to section 4 7 no3 and po4 3 are good indicators to identify the anthropogenic influences on water chemistry rao and prasad 1997 kim et al 2021 panda et al 2022 zendehbad et al 2022 in the study area the concentration of no3 and po4 3 ranges from 0 02 mg l to 359 mg l and from bdl to 5 2 mg l with an average value of 59 mg l and 0 3 mg l respectively in this basin 91 of samples depict less than 1 mg l of po4 3 in the groundwater earlier studies reported that po4 3 is mostly retained in the aquifer materials by adsorption mabilde et al 2017 patience et al 2021 like po4 3 the concentration of f is also low in the study region f is less than 1 mg l in 82 of samples and it varies from bdl to 3 9 mg l with a mean value of 0 6 mg l besides br and i are good indicators to explore the marine impact on groundwater chemistry mandilaras et al 2008 the concentration of br and i are between 0 06 mg l and 5 8 mg l and from 0 01 mg l to 1 3 mg l with an avarage value of 0 8 mg l and 0 1 mg l respectively the concentration of these ions is generally low in the study area except few wells refer to section 4 3 4 2 relationship between groundwater flow geology and hydrochemistry fig 1b indicates the depth to groundwater level gwl in the study site the gwl varied from 3 m bgl to 200 m bgl with an average value of 39 m bgl table 1 the high standard deviation implies that there is a large variation in gwl as well as the depths of the wells in this aquifer fig 1b displays that deep gwl occurred in the southern region followed by the northern and north eastern regions shallow gwl 20 m bgl is noticed in the western and coastal regions besides a few wells situated in the southeastern region also have shallow water levels 10 and 20 mbgl fig 2a explains the groundwater flow direction in this study site in this aquifer groundwater flows from east to west but fig 2a exposes the disturbed flow in the central part rectangle zone of the study area geologically this zone is covered by the harat precambrian and quaternary formations gwl is deep in harat formations which may be attributed to low fractures and joints in the basement rocks and consequently reduces recharge from rainfall as well as preventing the horizontal and vertical flow from surrounding aquifers further groundwater ec in the rectangle zone is high 5000 µs cm compared to other places in the study site fig 2b a similar trend is also noticed in most of the major ions figure sf1 the enrichment of chemical ions in this zone suggests that either geology or restricted groundwater flow enhances solute load in the groundwater there is no lithological or borewell drilling data to discuss deeply the impact of geology on water chemistry however restricted groundwater flow most likely enhances evaporation due to long storage consequently increasing salinity in the water bartarya 1993 rafique et al 2015 alfarrah et al 2017 elumalai et al 2019 further in the harrat area the weathered rocks are silty clay and clay which may reduce the infiltration of standing water on the soil surface and enhances evaporation also the capillary fringe in such soils is thicker making the evaporation process even faster elumalai et al 2019 also reported that fluoride enrichment is linked to evaporation processes in northern kwazulu natal and jozini aquifers in south africa 4 3 demarcation of contamination zones using groundwater chemistry the supplementary figure sf1 illustrates the major and minor ions spatial distribution in this aquifer the spatial distribution of major ions ca2 mg2 na k cl and so4 2 follow a similar trend to ec and the high concentration exists in the central part rectangle zone of the study site fig 2b further the northwestern region also expresses the elevated concentration of these elements which seems to be due to saline water invasion as the water table in wells 28 and 19 are below the mean sea level msl 9 mamsl 6 m amsl in addition high concentration is also observed in the southeastern region where gwl is between 10 and 15 m bgl fig 1b na concentration is 500 mg l in most of the study sites except the central part and the lowest concentrations are recorded in the northeast and western side wells likewise the k concentration is 12 mg l except in the central region a similar trend is also noticed in the ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 in this aquifer in the case of minor ions br and i also behave like major ions and ec and the central part of the study site has a high concentration in addition br shows enrichment in the northwestern region due to seawater intrusion in contrast to these observations f and hco3 behave differently the spatial distribution pattern of f displays two major zones with a concentration of 0 6 mg l and 0 6 1 5 mg l respectively which covered most of the study site groundwater with high f on the southeastern side suggests the possibility for surface contamination sources owing to shallow water level gwl 15 mbgl the spatial pattern of hco3 and sio2 depict that wells with deep gwl located on the southern side have high concentrations which justified the lithogenic input on water chemistry no3 expresses different patterns and high concentration is observed in the southwest as well as southeastern side wells which are mostly shallow shallow wells are frequently vulnerable to sub surface and surface contamination sources which cause high no3 in the groundwater rajmohan and amarasinghe 2016 rajmohan 2020 4 4 classification of groundwater wells using hierarchical cluster analysis in multivariate statistical analysis hierarchical cluster analysis hca is an important tool to classify the variables or cases wells in hydrochemistry elumalai et al 2019 rajmohan et al 2021b hca was employed to classify the water samples wells with similarities in chemical characteristics hca resulted in three clusters and 61 25 and 14 of samples are clustered in c1 c2 and c3 respectively fig 3 and table 1 illustrate the chemical characteristics of each cluster the salinity in the groundwater increases from c1 to c3 wells and most of the major ions follow the same trend in the c1 wells 61 n 68 the ph ranged from 6 5 to 8 3 with a mean value of 7 4 table 1 the ec 582 µs cm 4650 µs cm average 1869 µs cm indicates that the groundwater in this cluster is less mineralised compared to c2 and c3 wells further gwl 3 195 m bgl average 40 m bgl table 1 the standard deviation 39 m bgl suggests the heterogeneity in well depth in this cluster fig 3a depicts that the average concentration of most of the ions in c1 is comparatively low moreover wells in c1 are distributed all over the study site fig 3b in the c2 wells 25 n 28 groundwater salinity ec 2300 µs cm 8600 µs cm average 4921 µs cm is in between the c1 and c2 wells and most of the variables follow a similar trend fig 3 table 1 however the mean concentration of hco3 sio2 and f is slightly greater than in the c1 and c3 wells likewise the mean no3 concentration is greater than in c1 and c3 wells like c1 wells in this cluster also spread in the study site fig 3b the groundwater chemistry in c3 wells 14 n 16 is different from other clusters fig 3 and table 1 these wells are mostly shallow and gwl ranged from 3 5 to 65 mbgl with an average of 19 m bgl table 1 the gwl is less than 26 m bgl except for two wells well nos 75 106 fig 3a illustrates that groundwater in this cluster is highly mineralized and enriched with most of the variables the ec is between 6540 µs cm and 14050 µs cm with an average of 9461 µs cm besides br i and po4 3 are also accumulated more in these wells the spatial distribution pattern depicts that these are mostly spread in the central part followed by the coastal belt in the coastal region well numbers 1 and 7 are located far from the coast and the water table is 33 m amsl and 94 m amsl respectively which rule out the impact of seawater invasion however well numbers 28 and 19 are likely impaired by the seawater intrusion attributed to the depletion of groundwater level wt 9 m amsl and 6 m amsl caused by the pumping these inferences suggest that the groundwater chemistry in c3 wells is largely affected by evaporation evaporite dissolution and long storage owing to restricted flow the average of hco3 co3 2 and sio2 in the groundwater in c1 c2 and c3 wells are not significantly varied fig 3a table 1 which reveals that rock water interaction mineral weathering is not the sole source for the variation in water chemistry in these clusters other factors evaporation and anthropogenic input are most likely to modify the water quality in this aquifer 4 5 vertical distribution of hydrochemistry fig 4 illustrates the vertical distribution of ionic constituents in the cluster groups in the study area well depth details are not available for all the wells hence gwl is employed here to understand the relationship between groundwater level and hydrochemistry shallow wells have high concentrations for most of the variables fig 4 wells in c3 have shallow gwl 26 m bgl except for two wells but in the c1 and c2 wells both shallow and deep gwls are noticed vertical distribution of ph reveals that it increases with depth and high salinity water is acidic ph 7 especially c3 wells the ec th major cations cl and so4 2 behave mostly similar and wells with shallow gwl are highly enriched with these variables further these concentrations are decreasing with increasing depth however hco3 and sio2 have different trends and high concentrations are noticed in deep wells the vertical distribution of br and i behave like ec and enrichments are observed in the shallow depth vertical distribution of po4 3 is not showing any trend and is mostly constant with depth except for two wells f behaves like major ions and high concentrations occurred in the shallow depth similarly no3 distribution also follows the ec and major ions but elevated values are also recorded in some deep wells which indicates the recharge of contaminant through the fractures and joints in the study site these inferences imply that water chemistry is influenced by both geogenic as well as man made interventions 4 6 hydrochemical facies in cluster groups piper trilinear diagram is generally employed to explain the hydrochemical facies and to identify the dominant cation anion in the aquifer piper 1944 groundwater samples from all three clusters c1 c2 and c3 were plotted in this diagram fig 5 in the cation triangle the majority of the samples are plotted on two major zones namely mixed cations as well as na k water types irrespective of clusters in addition a few samples from c1 fall in the ca2 zone in the case of anions triangle water samples are plotted on three major zones such as mixed anions cl and so4 2 dominated facies samples from c1 wells are mostly plotted on mixed as well as cl dominated facies except for four samples which belong to hco3 co3 2 facies but in the c2 and c3 wells water samples are plotted on two major zones namely cl and so4 2 followed by the mixed one further water samples from c1 wells are clustered largely in the nacl and camgcl hydrochemical facies except for a few samples in the c2 and c3 wells the predominate hydrochemical facies are nacl followed by the cacl except for a few samples which are plotted on camgcl facies nacl facies indicates the role of evaporation which eliminates the ca mg as carbonates from the system by precipitation alvarez et al 2015 li et al 2019 rajmohan et al 2021b camgcl facies depict the influences of ion exchange and anthropogenic impact in this aquifer 4 7 geochemical processes and source of ions in the cluster groups 4 7 1 impact of evaporation mineral weathering and ion exchange processes on water chemistry bivariate plots and ionic ratios are generally employed to identify the geochemical processes and the ion sources in the aquifer abdalla 2015 alfaifi 2019 elumalai et al 2022 in the groundwater chemical constituents are derived from various sources and processes and largely from rock mineral water interaction and anthropogenic input rajmohan and elango 2004 2006 elumalai et al 2019 nethononda et al 2019 further evaporation enriched these chemical constituents in the aquifer rajmohan et al 2021b the contribution of mineral weathering rainfall input and evaporation sources in the groundwater are identified and differentiated using gibbs plots gibbs 1970 in these plots ionic ratios and salinity tds were employed water samples were plotted on gibbs plots to explore the influences of each source and process in this aquifer fig 5 fig 5 illustrates that c1 samples are presented in mineral weathering 44 and evaporation 56 zones in c2 and c3 samples are clustered in the evaporation zone only further in the anion plot cl cl hco3 ratio expresses a positive trend with salinity thus water chemistry is primarily regulated by evaporation and mineral weathering in this aquifer the na k na k ca ratio in the cation plot increases without affecting salinity which indicates the enrichment of na by cation exchange as ion exchange won t affect the salinity the mca mg ratio is frequently applied to identify the influence of dolomite calcite and silicate weathering on water chemistry mayo and loucks 1995 rajmohan and prathapar 2016 rajmohan et al 2017 elumalai et al 2022 dolomite dissolution maintains mca mg ratio unity but higher ratios show the influences of calcite 2 mca mg 1 as well as silicate weathering mca mg 2 in this aquifer groundwater in c1 wells is mainly affected by silicate weathering 69 calcite 19 and dolomite 12 dissolution in the case of c2 wells both silicate and calcite are equally contributed 40 in the groundwater followed by the dolomite 20 groundwater in the c3 is primarily governed by calcite 50 silicates 30 and dolomite dissolution precipitation and dissolution of carbonate minerals are strongly linked to evaporation rajmohan et al 2021b the role of silicate carbonate and evaporite influences on water chemistry is explored using the molar ratio of hco3 na ca na and mg na fig 6a and b gaillardet et al 1999 rajmohan et al 2021b elumalai et al 2022 fig 6a illustrates that c1 samples are plotted between the evaporites and silicates zone as well as on the evaporite zone but samples from c2 and c3 wells are clustered on evaporite and below the evaporite zone fig 6b displays that c1 c2 and c3 samples are mostly plotted in the silicates zone and between silicates and evaporite zones these inferences reveal that groundwater in c1 wells is predominantly influenced by the weathering silicate rocks which enriches major ions in the groundwater but groundwater in c2 and c3 wells is mostly affected by evaporation and evaporite dissolution evaporation enhances the precipitation of carbonates in the aquifer which leads to the depletion of the mhco3 na ratio hence the water chemistry in this aquifer is strongly affected by silicate weathering evaporation and evaporite dissolution gibbs plots fig 5 also implied this inference as evaporation is a leading process in this aquifer the bivariate plot of ca2 mg2 vs alkalinity so4 2 is a good tool to differentiate the mineral weathering ca mg silicates carbonates sulphates and ion exchange reactions fig 6c rajmohan and elango 2004 rajmohan et al 2017 ca2 and mg2 obtained from the dissolution of ca mg silicates sulphate and carbonates minerals are generally balanced by the alkalinity hco3 co3 2 and so4 2 in the aquifer fig 6c hence these parameters maintain a 1 1 equivalent ratio between them fig 6c illustrates that c1 samples are mostly plotted on a 1 1 line and justified the influences of ca mg silicates carbonate and sulphate minerals dissolution in this aquifer however few samples are deviated and show high concentrations of alkalinity and so4 2 over ca2 mg2 similarly groundwater from c2 and c3 wells also indicates a similar trend this observation suggests that the na k silicate minerals weathering produces excess alkalinity or removal of ca2 mg2 by cation exchange reactions in the system further few samples in c3 wells have excess ca2 mg2 over alkalinity so4 2 because of reverse ion exchange as it often occurs in high salinity water zaidi et al 2015 rajmohan et al 2021b the na cl ratio is quite useful to explore the role of weathering evaporation and ion exchange in groundwater chemistry the evaporation process maintains na cl 1 while increasing the salinity rajmohan et al 2017 fig 6d here some samples are plotted near to evaporation trend especially c3 wells but the majority of them have a higher na cl ratio in the study region the na cl ratio is not varying much concerning clusters c1 0 41 2 51 1 18 mean c2 0 60 2 73 1 32 mean c3 0 69 2 60 1 3 mean high na over cl may be explained by the two major processes namely weathering of na silicates and cation exchange na released from weathering of silicates is balanced by alkalinity the average percentage of alkalinity in c1 c2 and c3 wells are 19 6 8 6 and 3 8 respectively which implies that excess na over cl is not mainly derived from weathering processes it is noticed in c3 wells hence ion exchange processes are also governing the water chemistry in this aquifer the equations explain the cation exchange eq 1 as well as the reverse ion exchange eq 2 reaction in the aquifer 1 na k soil ca 2 mg 2 gw 2 na k gw ca mg soil 2 na k gw ca mg soil na k soil ca 2 mg 2 gw in the cation exchange reactions na k is released to groundwater while reverse ion exchange accumulates ca mg in the groundwater fisher and mullican 1997 applied ca2 mg2 alkalinity so4 2 and na k cl plots to interpret ion exchange in the aquifer according to them if the ion exchange processes are governing the major cations in the groundwater this plot results in a linear relationship with a negative slope in the study site fig 6e depicts that groundwater from all three clusters expresses a strong linear relationship with negative slopes 0 99 c1 0 91 c2 1 04 c3 the r 2 values of c1 c2 and c3 are 0 95 0 96 and 0 96 respectively this observation justifies the impact of ion exchange reactions in water chemistry further schoeller 1977 produced chloro alkaline indices cai1 cai2 to explain reverse and cation ion exchange processes in the aquifer eqs 3 and 4 3 cai 1 cl na k cl 4 cai 2 cl na k cl hco 3 so 4 no 3 cation exchange results in negative values of cai1 and cai2 whereas reverse ion exchange provides positive value fig 6f depicts that around 63 of samples are plotted on the cation exchange zone further cation exchange is dominating in 62 64 and 63 of samples in c1 c2 and c3 wells respectively these inferences justify that na k from aquifer materials replaced the ca mg in the groundwater overall the ion exchange reactions chiefly affected the water chemistry in this aquifer the interrelationship between the variables can be identified using the pearson correlation matrix the significant and strong correlation is generally identified using p value p 0 01 and r 2 value r 2 0 5 the r 2 values should be greater than 0 5 then only the interrelationship can be meaningful in this study variables namely hco3 co3 2 no3 sio2 f po4 3 and i are not correlating with other variables as well as each other table 2 likewise ph expresses a negative relationship with ca2 but it is not significant r 2 0 49 ec expresses strong positive correlation with th r 2 0 91 na r 2 0 94 k r 2 0 78 ca2 r 2 0 86 mg2 r 2 0 86 cl r 2 0 92 so4 2 r 2 0 93 and br r 2 0 87 table 2 the major cations cl so4 2 and br also show similar behaviour like ec and have a strong relationship between each other and other variables this observation justifies that the water chemistry is mostly governed by evaporation evaporites and long storage attributed to restricted flow these processes are most likely masking the rock water interaction in this aquifer 4 7 2 exploring the source of ions and geochemical processes by principal component analysis principal component analysis pca was carried out in this study as it is an important tool to explore the source of chemical constituents in the aquifer and associated geochemical processes in this study pca resulted in five components with eigenvalue 1 and explains 78 of the total variance pc1 44 was highly loaded by the th tds ec na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and br the strong loading of br cl and so4 2 demonstrate that pc1 represents the role of evaporation and evaporite dissolution in this aquifer pc2 12 3 indicates the strong positive loading of no3 po4 3 i and f the vertical distribution of these variables displays a similar trend and shows elevated concentrations in the shallow water tables fig 4 further high positive loading of no3 and po4 3 ensures the anthropogenic input namely irrigation return flow domestic wastewater leakage accumulation and septic tank leakage pc3 8 2 shows strong loading of silica and co3 which justifies the influences of silicate weathering on water chemistry the negative loading of ph and positive loading of hco3 in the pc4 7 4 explains the carbonate dissolution in this aquifer as the acidic conditions facilitate mineral weathering in any aquifer pc5 7 of total variance shows strong loading gwl fig 4 depicts that wells with shallow gwl are highly mineralized compared to deep wells hence this pc explains the importance of gwl table 3 5 conclusions in the al madinah al munawarah province high salinity and hardness restrict groundwater use for drinking irrigation and other applications in the study site groundwater flow is disturbed in the central region due to geology harat formations long storage caused by the restricted groundwater flow and evaporation have enriched the salinity and major and minor ions in the groundwater high f and no3 with shallow gwl in the southeast and southwestern regions indicate the impact of anthropogenic input high hco3 and sio2 in the deep gwl wells located on the southern side justified the role of rock water interaction in this aquifer groundwater classification using hierarchical cluster analysis hca resulted in three clusters c1 61 c2 25 and c3 14 of samples the average concentration of hco3 co3 2 and sio2 in the groundwater in c1 c2 and c3 wells do not vary significantly which ensures that rock water interaction mineral weathering is not the sole source for the variation in water chemistry the molar ratios ca na mg na and hco3 na illustrate that groundwater in c1 wells is governed by the weathering of silicate rocks but groundwater in c2 and c3 wells is chiefly regulated by evaporation and evaporite dissolution in addition ion exchange especially cation exchange reactions 63 also affected water chemistry in this aquifer pearson correlation matrix also justifies that the water chemistry is principally affected by evaporation evaporites and long storage owing to restricted flow principal component analysis pca resulted in five components 78 of the total variance and pc1 43 6 indicates the role of evaporation and evaporite dissolution in this aquifer pc2 12 3 ensures anthropogenic interventions like septic tank leakage irrigation return flow and domestic wastewater leakage accumulation on groundwater pc3 8 2 pc4 7 4 and pc5 explain the role of silicate weathering carbonate dissolution and gwl respectively on water chemistry this study recommended that policymakers and local municipalities should implement a regular monitoring plan to protect this aquifer in addition proper treatment techniques should be employed to provide safe water for local inhabitants detailed lithological data is not available on the study site hence this study recommended lithological data collection through test drilling this study also implies that integrating geochemical tools with statistical analysis is a good option to explore the hydrochemistry of any aquifer in the globe funding this
