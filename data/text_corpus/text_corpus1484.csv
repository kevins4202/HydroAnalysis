7420,evapotranspiration et is considered as a key factor in hydrological and climatological studies agricultural water management irrigation scheduling etc it can be directly measured using lysimeters moreover other methods such as empirical equations and artificial intelligence methods can be used to model et in the recent years artificial intelligence methods have been widely utilized to estimate reference evapotranspiration eto in the present study local and external performances of multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and gene expression programming gep were assessed for estimating daily eto for this aim daily weather data of six stations with different climates in iran namely urmia and tabriz semi arid isfahan and shiraz arid yazd and zahedan hyper arid were employed during 2000 2014 two types of input patterns consisting of weather data based and lagged eto data based scenarios were considered to develop the models four statistical indicators including root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae coefficient of determination r2 and mean absolute percentage error mape were used to check the accuracy of models the local performance of models revealed that the mars and gep approaches have the capability to estimate daily eto using the meteorological parameters and the lagged eto data as inputs nevertheless the mars had the best performance in the weather data based scenarios on the other hand considerable differences were not observed in the models accuracy for the lagged eto data based scenarios in the innovation of this study novel hybrid models were proposed in the lagged eto data based scenarios through combination of mars and gep models with autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity arch time series model it was concluded that the proposed novel models named mars arch and gep arch improved the performance of eto modeling compared to the single mars and gep in addition the external analysis of the performance of models at stations with similar climatic conditions denoted the applicability of nearby station data for estimation of the daily eto at target station keywords estimation fao penman monteith gene expression programming multivariate adaptive regression splines reference evapotranspiration 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is one of the main components of hydrologic cycle moreover accurate estimation of et has a crucial role in many fields such as water balance studies irrigation scheduling design and determining the capacity of irrigation systems water resources management etc on the other hand et as an indicator in the plant growth process is considered equivalent to crop water requirement since it is difficult to determine et for each crop in practice firstly reference evapotranspiration eto is calculated then crop evapotranspiration is estimated using eto various climatic factors such as air temperature relative humidity wind speed solar radiation etc are effective factors on et the atmospheric factors besides crop physiology cause to complex the et process hence several methods have been presented to estimate et the use of lysimeter is the only direct method to measure et nevertheless high costs of its installation and maintenance make some difficulties many empirical equations have been developed to calculate eto based on the meteorological data in this context fao 56 penman monteith fao 56 pm equation has been presented as a reference method allen et al 1998 this equation has been widely used to calibrate validate and evaluate other methods for estimation of eto

artificial intelligence methods have been commonly used to simulate estimate diverse engineering problems azamathulla et al 2013 kim and singh 2014 mohammadi et al 2015a emamgolizadeh et al 2015 shoaib et al 2015 kisi and parmar 2016 wang et al 2016a 2017a d behmanesh and mehdizadeh 2017 mehdizadeh et al 2016 2017b f 2018 mehdizadeh 2018 rezaie balf et al 2017 given that the evapotranspiration is a non linear process using the artificial intelligence methods can be considered as an appropriate tool for prediction of evapotranspiration these approaches have some advantages such as simpler solutions for multi variable problems no required knowledge about internal system variables and factual calculations zadeh 1992 chaturvedi 2008 huang et al 2010 gocic et al 2015 as mentioned artificial intelligence methods have the capability to estimate parameters related to the natural phenomena such as evapotranspiration the reason of this fact is the adaptation of intelligent models with their non linear nature this study investigates the local and external performances of multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and gene expression programming gep for estimating daily eto at six regions with different climates in iran in this process weather data and lagged eto data were employed as input parameters the most important reason for choosing the mars and gep models is their ability to present relationships between the input and output parameters which can be used in the next modeling purposes furthermore this study is an attempt to improve the accuracy of lagged eto data based scenarios for estimation of daily eto by the combination of mars and gep with autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity arch time series model it is necessary to mention that in fact time series of hydrological variables consist of deterministic and stochastic components literature review in this field shows that the stochastic term of eto has not been considered in the lagged eto data based models for estimation of eto considering the stochastic part of eto time series in the modeling process is the innovation of this research 2 literature review recently artificial intelligence methods have been extensively utilized to estimate eto in this section some of these studies are briefly reviewed landeras et al 2008 estimated daily eto at four stations in the basque country northern spain eto values estimated by empirical and semi empirical equations and artificial neural networks ann were compared to the eto data of fao 56 pm equation for the ann seven various scenarios were developed using minimum maximum and mean air temperatures relative humidity wind speed extraterrestrial radiation and solar radiation the ann models were found to be better than the calibrated equations dogan 2009 evaluated the applicability of adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis for estimating daily eto at morgan hill weather station in san francisco usa he developed four anfis models using air temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed the results revealed that the anfis model can be successfully used for estimation of daily eto also scenario with full inputs had the best performance tabari et al 2012 employed support vector machine svm anfis regression analysis and empirical equations for predicting monthly eto in nozheh western iran they considered six different scenarios using minimum maximum and mean air temperatures solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed it was concluded that the svm and anfis models were superior to the regression and empirical methods moreover the svm and anfis models with inputs of mean air temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation presented the best accuracy traore and guven 2012 evaluated the accuracy of the gep for modeling of decadal eto at six different locations in burkina faso minimum maximum and mean air temperatures extraterrestrial radiation relative humidity wind speed and sunshine duration were used as input variables and decadal eto values were estimated by six developed gep models the results demonstrated that the gep can be as a reliable tool for estimating eto because of presenting the numerical models cobaner 2013 assessed the potential of wavelet regression technique for estimating eto using the only class a pan evaporation data data of fresno and bakersfield weather stations located in california were used in this study the results showed that eto can accurately be estimated as a function of class a pan evaporation values pour ali baba et al 2013 evaluated the ability of ann and anfis models to estimate daily eto at gwangju and haenam south korea they considered different ann and anfis scenarios using air temperature sunshine hours wind speed and relative humidity the results indicated that the ann and anfis models have good capability to estimate eto in addition these models showed better accuracy than empirical equation used in this study traore and guven 2013 applied the gep to estimate decadal eto of four weather stations in burkina faso they developed 16 different gep models using minimum maximum and mean air temperatures relative humidity wind speed sunshine hours and extraterrestrial radiation it was reported that the gep model is a promising method citakoglu et al 2014 estimated monthly mean eto by the ann and anfis models at 275 stations turkey eight scenarios were considered using air temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed as input parameters the obtained results demonstrated that the scenario with full inputs had the best accuracy also the performance of anfis and ann was compared to two empirical equations they reported that the anfis and ann models had higher precision than empirical equations nevertheless the anfis slightly yielded better performance in comparison to the ann petkovic et al 2015 assessed the potential of anfis to estimate monthly eto of twelve stations serbia 35 different patterns were defined using minimum and maximum air temperatures minimum and maximum relative humidity sunshine hours wind speed and actual vapor pressure the results showed that the monthly eto can be estimated by the anfis and meteorological data as input variables furthermore sunshine hours parameter was the most effective parameter on accurate estimation of eto wen et al 2015 employed the svm ann and three empirical equations for modeling of daily eto at the ejina basin northwestern china they developed four scenarios under limited meteorological data using minimum and maximum air temperatures solar radiation and wind speed it was concluded that the svm was superior to the ann and empirical equations kisi 2016 modeled monthly eto using least square support vector regression lssvr m5 model tree and mars at antalya and isparta stations turkey the superiority of the lssvr to the other models was reported moreover the monthly eto at each station was estimated using the data of nearby station wang et al 2016b used the ann and gep models for modeling of daily eto at four stations located in the karst region of china s southwestern guangxi province fifteen ann and gep models were developed using minimum and maximum air temperatures extraterrestrial radiation relative humidity wind speed and sunshine duration they stated that the ann models generally presented better performance than the corresponding gep scenarios also scenarios with full inputs in the gep and ann models were found to be the most accurate models in the studied regions mehdizadeh et al 2017d estimated monthly mean eto of 44 stations in iran by the mars svm gep and empirical equations input parameters of artificial intelligence approaches were selected based on the used parameters in the empirical equations they developed 16 various scenarios the obtained results indicated that artificial intelligence methods generally had better performance than empirical equations however the mars outperformed the svm and gep models 3 materials and methods 3 1 case study and data in the present study six stations with different climates in iran namely urmia and tabriz semi arid isfahan and shiraz arid yazd and zahedan hyper arid were selected as study area fig 1 shows the locations of studied stations table 1 presents the geographical information of the studied regions it is better to note that the aridity index defined by united nations environment program unep 1992 has been used for climate classification of the considered stations ashraf et al 2014 to accomplish this study daily meteorological data of the studied areas were compiled from the islamic republic of iran meteorological organization irimo during the period of 2000 2014 it should be mentioned that measured solar radiation data may be incorrect incorrect and outlier data were identified based on jiang 2009 sabziparvar et al 2013 and mohammadi et al 2015a 2015b then missing and outlier data were substituted using the calibrated angstrom prescott equation presented by sabziparvar et al 2013 for the studied stations some of the statistical characteristics of the climatic data i e mean air temperature t solar radiation rs relative humidity rh wind speed at 2 m height u2 and the eto values calculated by the standard fao 56 pm equation during the studied period are given in table 2 the whole dataset of each station was divided into three subsets namely training 2000 2008 i e 60 of the whole data testing 2009 2011 i e 20 of the whole data and validation 2012 2014 i e 20 of the whole data 3 1 1 data normalization and standardization as noted one of the objectives of this research is to develop novel models in the lagged eto data based scenarios using the combination of mars and gep models with arch time series model in time series models normalization and standardization of data are essential so whole data were first normalized and then standardized using eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 n t ln x t a 2 z t n t n t σ n t where nt is the normalized data xt is the actual data a is a constant zt is the normalized and standardized data n t is the mean of normalized data and σ n t is the standard deviation of the normalized data it is worth mentioning that the a constant in eq 1 was obtained using trial and error to result the low values for the skewness coefficient 3 2 fao 56 penman monteith equation fao 56 pm as mentioned earlier the fao 56 pm equation is commonly used as a reference method to investigate the performance of other approaches such as artificial intelligence methods the values of eto in fao 56 pm is estimated using the following equation allen et al 1998 3 et o 0 408 r n g 900 γ u 2 t 273 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 rn is the net radiation mj m 2 day 1 g is the soil heat flux mj m 2 day 1 γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 u2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 t is the mean air temperature c es and ea are saturation and actual vapor pressures respectively kpa es ea is the saturation vapor pressure deficit kpa and δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 mean daily eto calculated by the fao 56 pm equation for the studied stations during the considered period 2000 2014 is depicted in fig 2 3 3 multivariate adaptive regression splines multivariate adaptive regression splines mars was introduced by friedman 1991 mars is a spline regression model that employs a specific class of basis functions instead of the original data abraham and steinberg 2001 mars does not have any assumption about the underlying functional relationship between dependent and independent variables friedman 1991 samui 2013 kisi 2016 one of the main advantages of mars is its ability to estimate the contributions of basis functions so that the additive and inter active effects of predictors are allowed to determine the response variable cheng and cao 2014 mars model estimates response variable y from the predictor variable x using the basis functions as below 4 h 1 x max 0 x c 5 h 2 x max 0 c x where c is the knot or threshold value also h1 x and h2 x functions are a reflected pair at c knot the general structure of the mars to predict response variable y is as follows 6 y β 0 i 1 m β i h i x where β 0 is an initial constant βi is the coefficient of ith basis function and hi x is the ith basis function mars consists of two steps namely forward and backward stages in the forward stage a model with over fitting bias and the large number of knots is created then in the backward stage the developed model in the previous stage is corrected by pruning the superfluous knots finally the optimum mars model is obtained it should be mentioned that in the forward and backward stages different models are fitted on the data based upon the basis functions the final mars model is selected on the basis of lowest value for generalized cross validation gcv criteria statistica program was used in this study for developing the mars models in order to estimate daily eto 3 4 gene expression programming gene expression programming gep was first presented by ferreira 2001 it has been obtained by combining and developing of genetic programming gp and genetic algorithm ga methods in the gp tree structures are used but the ga is based upon the binary system which is the main difference in the structure of two methods gep uses the elite selection process and keeps the best individuals of one generation for the next generation gep unlike the ga and gp methods has several genetic operators to reproduce the main difference between ga gp and gep is the nature of their individuals in the ga the individuals are as linear strings with fixed length chromosomes while the individuals in the gp are non linear entities with different sizes and shapes parse trees however in the gep the individuals are encoded as fixed length linear strings similar to the ga then they are expressed in the form of non linear entities with different sizes and shapes similar to the gp ferreira 2001 in the present study genexpro tools program was used to develop the different gep models in the gep five steps must be carried out as below choosing the fitness function here the root mean square error was used as fitness function selecting the terminals and functions sets to produce the chromosomes terminals set consists of different combinations of weather data and lagged eto data which were considered as inputs to estimate eto also the functions set and operators consisting of x x 3 x 2 x 3 ln x e x sin x cos x arctg x were used specifying the structure architecture of the chromosomes here head size the number of genes and chromosomes were selected equal to 8 3 and 30 respectively determining the linking function in this study an addition function was selected and finally choosing the genetic operators and the corresponding rates the values of parameters and genetic operators used in each run of the gep are summarized below number of chromosomes 30 head size 8 number of genes 3 mutation rate 0 044 inversion rate 0 1 one point recombination rate 0 3 two point recombination rate 0 3 gene recombination rate 0 1 gene transposition rate 0 1 insertion sequence transposition rate 0 1 root insertion sequence transposition rate 0 1 3 5 autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity arch as one of the time series models was first introduced by engle 1982 in the time series models it is assumed that each event at the moment is related to events at previous times in most studies related to modeling and forecasting of hydrological processes the main focus is on the average of the data but less attention has been paid to variance changes over time the time series of hydrological data could have low fluctuations in some times and vice versa in other times might have high fluctuations in such circumstances it is expected that the variance of time series is not a fixed term an arch time series model for modeling of variance changes is expressed as 7 σ t 2 α 0 i 1 q α i ε t i 2 ε t σ t z t where σ t 2 is the conditional variance ε t is the error phrase or model residual α 0 and α i are the model parameters q is the order of arch model and z t 0 1 is the normalized and standardized dataset in fact the arch model assumes that the conditional variance varies over time and is a function of past errors 3 6 combination of mars and gep with arch time series model as mentioned considering the stochastic component of eto time series in the lagged eto data based scenarios is the innovation of present study following steps were done to combine the mars and gep approaches with arch time series model in order to increase the estimation accuracy of the daily eto autoregressive moving average arma time series model i e arma p q was fitted on the normalized and standardized daily eto data arma 1 1 was fitted in this study on eto dataset in the studied regions during 2000 2014 the errors or residuals ε t were obtained from the previous stage the attained residuals were optimized considering a correction factor c to use in arch model as ε t c the optimized first order arch model was fitted on ε t c 2 values as σ t 2 α 0 α 1 ε t 1 c 2 the deterministic part d obtained from the mars and gep models was combined with the stochastic part s obtained from the optimized arch time series model as d s and finally scaling up the data including destandardization and denormalization was carried out 3 7 input combinations considered to develop the models this study considers two types of scenarios namely weather data based and lagged eto data based patterns table 3 presents the different inputs considered in estimating daily eto in the weather data based scenarios seven different combinations of weather data such as t rs rh u2 were used in the local analysis of lagged eto data based scenarios the eto values from one to three past days were employed to estimate eto of each particular day additionally the daily eto data of nearby station on the same day eto t and one to two past days eto t 1 eto t 2 were used in the external analysis of lagged eto data based scenarios for estimating the daily eto at target station 3 8 performance comparison criteria this study uses four statistical indicators including root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae coefficient of determination r2 and mean absolute percentage error mape to evaluate the performance of mars and gep models in the weather data and lagged eto data based scenarios as well as the proposed hybrid models namely mars arch and gep arch in the lagged eto data based scenarios for estimation of the daily eto these indicators were computed using the following relationships 8 rmse i 1 n et o i c et o i e 2 n 9 mae 1 n i 1 n et o i c et o i e 10 r 2 i 1 n et o i c et o c et o i e et o e i 1 n et o i c et o c 2 i 1 n et o i e et o e 2 2 11 mape 1 n i 1 n et o i c et o i e et o i c 100 where eto i c eto i e et o c et o e and n are the ith daily eto calculated by the fao 56 pm equation ith daily eto estimated by the single and hybrid artificial intelligence methods the average of the daily eto values calculated by the fao 56 pm equation the average of the daily eto values estimated by the used approaches and the number of dataset respectively it should be noted that the lower values for the rmse mae and mape indicators as well as the higher values for the r2 denote the higher accuracy of the model 4 results and discussion 4 1 local performance of the models 4 1 1 results of weather data based scenarios statistical indicators obtained for local analysis of the mars and gep models at the studied stations with various climates are presented in tables 4 9 results of weather data based scenarios indicate that mars1 and gep1 with input of mean air temperature present the best accuracy among the scenarios with sole input i e mars1 to mars4 and gep1 to gep4 also the estimation accuracy of solar radiation as predictor in mars2 and gep2 models is better than the relative humidity parameter in mars3 and gep3 models on the other hand mars4 and gep4 scenarios with wind speed input had the lowest performance for estimation of the daily eto in the studied areas with different climates similar to the obtained results citakoglu et al 2014 and mehdizadeh et al 2017d reported that wind speed was the worst input parameter to estimate monthly mean eto in turkey and iran respectively the highest and lowest performance of mean temperature and wind speed parameters respectively can be due to the highest and lowest correlations of these parameters with eto see table 2 in order to develop the weather data based scenarios with further inputs mean temperature t as the best predictor was considered as a fixed parameter and solar radiation rs relative humidity rh and wind speed u2 were added into t parameter as clear in the tables 4 9 the performance of mars1 models at the studied stations improves by increasing the number of inputs however the performance of mars5 t rs and mars6 t rs rh is generally similar nevertheless mars6 had slightly better statistics compared to mars5 moreover mars7 t rs rh u2 models developed at the studied stations performed the best this means that although wind speed presented the lowest performance nevertheless adding wind speed into other parameters i e t rs rh in mars6 causes to significantly improve the performance of mars6 models the reason for this fact can be attributed to the advection effects of wind speed on eto similar results were reported by citakoglu et al 2014 and mehdizadeh et al 2017d the error statistics obtained for the mars7 models in validation stage are rmse 0 23 mm day 1 mae 0 16 mm day 1 r2 0 990 and mape 7 15 at urmia rmse 0 28 mm day 1 mae 0 20 mm day 1 r2 0 992 and mape 8 03 at tabriz rmse 0 16 mm day 1 mae 0 12 mm day 1 r2 0 995 and mape 4 23 at isfahan rmse 0 17 mm day 1 mae 0 12 mm day 1 r2 0 993 and mape 3 76 at shiraz rmse 0 16 mm day 1 mae 0 11 mm day 1 r2 0 996 and mape 3 28 at yazd rmse 0 19 mm day 1 mae 0 14 mm day 1 r2 0 993 and mape 3 40 at zahedan in addition by comparing the accuracy of gep models with further inputs i e gep5 to gep7 it is evident that increasing the number of inputs does not necessarily improve the performance of gep models this is in contradiction with the results obtained for the mars models performance comparison of the mars and gep models in the weather data based scenarios demonstrates that the mars models outperformed the gep models at all studied stations and considered scenarios better performance of the mars in comparison to the gep was also reported by mehdizadeh et al 2017d fig 3 illustrates the scatter and comparative plots between fao 56 pm and estimated daily eto values for the superior weather data based scenarios of the studied regions i e mars7 during the validation stage the error statistics of these models have been bolded in tables 4 9 as clearly seen good agreements are observed between fao 56 pm and eto values estimated by the mars7 models the performance of models can be evaluated by fitting a linear regression as y ax b where y is the dependent parameter obtained by the mars and gep x is the independent parameter obtained by the fao 56 pm equation a is the slope and b is the intercept the lowest values of the intercept closer to 0 as well as the highest values of the slope closer to 1 denote the reasonable ability of mars7 models developed in the studied areas for estimating daily eto in addition comparative plots confirm the high potential of mars7 models to estimate daily eto as previously mentioned the mars and gep models have capability to present mathematical relationships between the input and output parameters however these equations in the mars are in the forms of non parametric regressions whereas in the gep are as algebraic equations these equations in the mars consist of different combinations of the basis functions it is better to mention that the number of basis functions is increased by increasing the number of inputs for example the best mars models i e mars7 with four inputs contain 187 198 232 264 193 and 284 basis functions at urmia tabriz isfahan shiraz yazd and zahedan respectively as a result it was not possible to present these equations in the paper and so only the equations of the lagged eto data based scenarios were presented these relationships can be used in the next modeling purposes 4 1 2 results of lagged eto data based scenarios statistical indicators of the single mars and gep models as well as the proposed novel models namely mars arch and gep arch in the lagged eto data based scenarios are given in second part of the tables 4 9 as seen the single mars and gep models present slightly similar statistics therefore it can be said that the eto value of each day can be estimated by these methods and the previous daily eto data as predictors as mentioned earlier the time series of hydrological variables such as et and eto consist of two major parts namely deterministic and stochastic components this study considers both components in modeling process of the daily eto in the lagged eto data based scenarios for this aim the results of mars and gep models were combined with the results of optimized arch time series model optimized arch time series models developed at the studied stations are represented below 12 σ t 2 0 4640278 2 26 10 7 ε t 1 1 4 2 ε t σ t z t at urmia station 13 σ t 2 0 4717395 3 89 10 8 ε t 1 1 3 2 ε t σ t z t at tabriz station 14 σ t 2 0 5446947 1 18 10 7 ε t 1 1 3 2 ε t σ t z t at isfahan station 15 σ t 2 0 7589184 2 09 10 7 ε t 1 1 8 2 ε t σ t z t at shiraz station 16 σ t 2 0 7625999 1

reveals that the accuracy of single models is increased in the proposed novel models considering the stochastic component of the daily eto data for example at urmia station statistical indicators of the best hybrid model i e mars2 arch during the validation stage are rmse 0 23 mm day 1 mae 0 17 mm day 1 r2 0 988 and mape 6 89 while the mentioned statistics for the corresponding single model i e mars2 were rmse 0 57 mm day 1 mae 0 39 mm day 1 r2 0 932 and mape 16 40 similarly improvements in the performance of lagged eto data based modeling were observed in the other proposed models in comparison to the single models at the other stations with various climates furthermore mehdizadeh et al 2017f 2018 introduced novel models by integrating the soft computing methods with the original arch and generalized arch time series model namely garch for rainfall modeling at different locations in iran similar to the obtained outcomes their results confirmed that the proposed hybrid models had much better accuracies compared to the single models scatter plots of the daily eto data estimated by the superior proposed models with bolded statistical indicators in tables 4 9 and the corresponding single models against the eto values of fao 56 pm equation in the lagged eto data based scenarios are depicted in fig 4 it is clearly seen that the estimated eto values using the superior hybrid models are in good agreement with fao 56 pm equation than those obtained by the single models the closer values to 1 and 0 in slopes and intercepts respectively for the lines fitted to points in the proposed models than the single models confirm this issue the equations presented by the corresponding mars and gep models of the best proposed mars arch and gep arch models in the lagged eto data based scenarios are represented in table 10 4 2 external performance of the models 4 2 1 results of weather data based scenarios in addition to the local evaluation of the performance of models an external analysis was used for generalizability of the conclusions obtained in the local analysis on the other side external evaluation of the performance of models can be of great importance in cases where the local data is not available to train the artificial intelligence methods in such circumstances the data of nearby station is used for estimating the studied phenomenon such as the daily eto in this study at target station as mentioned before six stations were selected as the case study urmia and tabriz isfahan and shiraz yazd and zahedan belong to the semi arid arid and hyper arid climatic conditions respectively moreover stations with the same climatic conditions have almost the same climatic data see table 2 additionally cross correlations for the daily eto of urmia and tabriz isfahan and shiraz yazd and zahedan are 0 960 0 903 and 0 866 respectively as a result it seems that the external analysis of the performance of models is reasonable investigating the external performance of the mars and gep models in the weather data based scenarios of the studied stations tables 11 16 reveals that the weather data of nearby station can be utilized to estimate the daily eto of target station although it is obvious that the external performance of models is generally lower than the local performance of models the overall results obtained from the local analysis of the models performances were also observed in the external analysis as follows mars1 and gep1 with mean air temperature input and mars4 and gep4 with wind speed input are the best and worst single input models for estimation of the daily eto at the studied stations the performance of mars models is generally improved by increasing the number of inputs that is while this issue was not necessarily observed in the gep models weather data based scenarios of the mars model have superiority over the corresponding scenarios of the gep mars7 model with inputs of t rs rh u2 with bolded statistics in tables 11 16 is the best input combination at the studied stations with different climates 4 2 2 results of lagged eto data based scenarios the external performance of lagged eto data based scenarios in the single mars and gep as well as the proposed mars arch and gep arch hybrid models tables 11 16 confirms that the single and particularly hybrid models are able to estimate daily eto of target station using the daily eto data of nearby station on the same day and lagged daily eto values even in some cases the external performance of single and hybrid models is slightly better than the local performance of the corresponding models such as single mars and gep models at urmia and tabriz and hybrid mars arch and gep arch models at isfahan yazd and zahedan the reason can be justified by the appropriate selections of the neighboring stations due to having the same climatic conditions and data as a general conclusion it can be said that the external analysis of the performance of models in the weather data based and lagged eto data based scenarios confirmed the results obtained by the local analysis of the performance of models the equations obtained from the corresponding single mars and gep models of the best proposed mars arch and gep arch models with bolded statistics in tables 11 16 for the lagged eto data based scenarios are represented in table 17 5 conclusions an accurate estimation of evapotranspiration plays a crucial role for optimal water resources management and other related applications in the current research the local and external performances of mars and gep models were evaluated for estimating daily eto at six stations iran with different climates under the weather data based and lagged eto data based scenarios investigating the local performance of models indicated that the mars had better performance than the gep in the weather data based scenarios at the studied stations mean air temperature and wind speed were the best and worst predictors for precise estimation of the daily eto moreover mars models with full inputs performed the best among the weather data based scenarios in the lagged eto data based scenarios novel models were introduced by the combination of mars and gep models with arch time series model so mars arch and gep arch hybrid models were developed performance comparison of the proposed and single models demonstrated that the proposed novel models presented better estimates of the daily eto compared to the single models at all studied stations besides the local analysis the external analysis of the performance of models was performed for generalizability of the results obtained in the local analysis in this case stations with similar climates were considered as the neighboring stations and the daily eto of each station was estimated using the data of nearby station overall external performance of models confirmed the results obtained from the local analysis of the models this means that the weather data and lagged eto data of nearby station with the same climate can be employed to estimate daily eto at target station in this study the accuracy of proposed hybrid models was assessed to estimate eto under the lagged eto data based scenarios it is recommended that the performance of proposed models to be evaluated in future studies for the weather data based

moreover other methods such as empirical equations and artificial intelligence methods can be used to model et in the recent years artificial intelligence methods have been widely utilized to estimate reference evapotranspiration eto in the present study local and external performances of multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and gene expression programming gep were assessed for estimating daily eto for this aim daily weather data of six stations with different climates in iran namely urmia and tabriz semi arid isfahan and shiraz arid yazd and zahedan hyper arid were employed during 2000 2014 two types of input patterns consisting of weather data based and lagged eto data based scenarios were considered to develop the models four statistical indicators including root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae coefficient of determination r2 and mean absolute percentage error mape were used to check the accuracy of models the local performance of models revealed that the mars and gep approaches have the capability to estimate daily eto using the meteorological parameters and the lagged eto data as inputs nevertheless the mars had the best performance in the weather data based scenarios on the other hand considerable differences were not observed in the models accuracy for the lagged eto data based scenarios in the innovation of this study novel hybrid models were proposed in the lagged eto data based scenarios through combination of mars and gep models with autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity arch time series model it was concluded that the proposed novel models named mars arch and gep arch improved the performance of eto modeling compared to the single mars and gep in addition the external analysis of the performance of models at stations with similar climatic conditions denoted the applicability of nearby station data for estimation of the daily eto at target station keywords estimation fao penman monteith gene expression programming multivariate adaptive regression splines reference evapotranspiration 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is one of the main components of hydrologic cycle moreover accurate estimation of et has a crucial role in many fields such as water balance studies irrigation scheduling design and determining the capacity of irrigation systems water resources management etc on the other hand et as an indicator in the plant growth process is considered equivalent to crop water requirement since it is difficult to determine et for each crop in practice firstly reference evapotranspiration eto is calculated then crop evapotranspiration is estimated using eto various climatic factors such as air temperature relative humidity wind speed solar radiation etc are effective factors on et the atmospheric factors besides crop physiology cause to complex the et process hence several methods have been presented to estimate et the use of lysimeter is the only direct method to measure et nevertheless high costs of its installation and maintenance make some difficulties many empirical equations have been developed to calculate eto based on the meteorological data in this context fao 56 penman monteith fao 56 pm equation has been presented as a reference method allen et al 1998 this equation has been widely used to calibrate validate and evaluate other methods for estimation of eto kumar et al 2002 ravazzani et al 2012 tabari et al 2013 valiantzas 2013 berti et al 2014 valipour 2015 gocic et al 2016 mehdizadeh et al 2017a antonopoulos and antonopoulos 2017 in the recent years artificial intelligence methods have been commonly used to simulate estimate diverse engineering problems azamathulla et al 2013 kim and singh 2014 mohammadi et al 2015a emamgolizadeh et al 2015 shoaib et al 2015 kisi and parmar 2016 wang et al 2016a 2017a d behmanesh and mehdizadeh 2017 mehdizadeh et al 2016 2017b f 2018 mehdizadeh 2018 rezaie balf et al 2017 given that the evapotranspiration is a non linear process using the artificial intelligence methods can be considered as an appropriate tool for prediction of evapotranspiration these approaches have some advantages such as simpler solutions for multi variable problems no required knowledge about internal system variables and factual calculations zadeh 1992 chaturvedi 2008 huang et al 2010 gocic et al 2015 as mentioned artificial intelligence methods have the capability to estimate parameters related to the natural phenomena such as evapotranspiration the reason of this fact is the adaptation of intelligent models with their non linear nature this study investigates the local and external performances of multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and gene expression programming gep for estimating daily eto at six regions with different climates in iran in this process weather data and lagged eto data were employed as input parameters the most important reason for choosing the mars and gep models is their ability to present relationships between the input and output parameters which can be used in the next modeling purposes furthermore this study is an attempt to improve the accuracy of lagged eto data based scenarios for estimation of daily eto by the combination of mars and gep with autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity arch time series model it is necessary to mention that in fact time series of hydrological variables consist of deterministic and stochastic components literature review in this field shows that the stochastic term of eto has not been considered in the lagged eto data based models for estimation of eto considering the stochastic part of eto time series in the modeling process is the innovation of this research 2 literature review recently artificial intelligence methods have been extensively utilized to estimate eto in this section some of these studies are briefly reviewed landeras et al 2008 estimated daily eto at four stations in the basque country northern spain eto values estimated by empirical and semi empirical equations and artificial neural networks ann were compared to the eto data of fao 56 pm equation for the ann seven various scenarios were developed using minimum maximum and mean air temperatures relative humidity wind speed extraterrestrial radiation and solar radiation the ann models were found to be better than the calibrated equations dogan 2009 evaluated the applicability of adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis for estimating daily eto at morgan hill weather station in san francisco usa he developed four anfis models using air temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed the results revealed that the anfis model can be successfully used for estimation of daily eto also scenario with full inputs had the best performance tabari et al 2012 employed support vector machine svm anfis regression analysis and empirical equations for predicting monthly eto in nozheh western iran they considered six different scenarios using minimum maximum and mean air temperatures solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed it was concluded that the svm and anfis models were superior to the regression and empirical methods moreover the svm and anfis models with inputs of mean air temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation presented the best accuracy traore and guven 2012 evaluated the accuracy of the gep for modeling of decadal eto at six different locations in burkina faso minimum maximum and mean air temperatures extraterrestrial radiation relative humidity wind speed and sunshine duration were used as input variables and decadal eto values were estimated by six developed gep models the results demonstrated that the gep can be as a reliable tool for estimating eto because of presenting the numerical models cobaner 2013 assessed the potential of wavelet regression technique for estimating eto using the only class a pan evaporation data data of fresno and bakersfield weather stations located in california were used in this study the results showed that eto can accurately be estimated as a function of class a pan evaporation values pour ali baba et al 2013 evaluated the ability of ann and anfis models to estimate daily eto at gwangju and haenam south korea they considered different ann and anfis scenarios using air temperature sunshine hours wind speed and relative humidity the results indicated that the ann and anfis models have good capability to estimate eto in addition these models showed better accuracy than empirical equation used in this study traore and guven 2013 applied the gep to estimate decadal eto of four weather stations in burkina faso they developed 16 different gep models using minimum maximum and mean air temperatures relative humidity wind speed sunshine hours and extraterrestrial radiation it was reported that the gep model is a promising method citakoglu et al 2014 estimated monthly mean eto by the ann and anfis models at 275 stations turkey eight scenarios were considered using air temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed as input parameters the obtained results demonstrated that the scenario with full inputs had the best accuracy also the performance of anfis and ann was compared to two empirical equations they reported that the anfis and ann models had higher precision than empirical equations nevertheless the anfis slightly yielded better performance in comparison to the ann petkovic et al 2015 assessed the potential of anfis to estimate monthly eto of twelve stations serbia 35 different patterns were defined using minimum and maximum air temperatures minimum and maximum relative humidity sunshine hours wind speed and actual vapor pressure the results showed that the monthly eto can be estimated by the anfis and meteorological data as input variables furthermore sunshine hours parameter was the most effective parameter on accurate estimation of eto wen et al 2015 employed the svm ann and three empirical equations for modeling of daily eto at the ejina basin northwestern china they developed four scenarios under limited meteorological data using minimum and maximum air temperatures solar radiation and wind speed it was concluded that the svm was superior to the ann and empirical equations kisi 2016 modeled monthly eto using least square support vector regression lssvr m5 model tree and mars at antalya and isparta stations turkey the superiority of the lssvr to the other models was reported moreover the monthly eto at each station was estimated using the data of nearby station wang et al 2016b used the ann and gep models for modeling of daily eto at four stations located in the karst region of china s southwestern guangxi province fifteen ann and gep models were developed using minimum and maximum air temperatures extraterrestrial radiation relative humidity wind speed and sunshine duration they stated that the ann models generally presented better performance than the corresponding gep scenarios also scenarios with full inputs in the gep and ann models were found to be the most accurate models in the studied regions mehdizadeh et al 2017d estimated monthly mean eto of 44 stations in iran by the mars svm gep and empirical equations input parameters of artificial intelligence approaches were selected based on the used parameters in the empirical equations they developed 16 various scenarios the obtained results indicated that artificial intelligence methods generally had better performance than empirical equations however the mars outperformed the svm and gep models 3 materials and methods 3 1 case study and data in the present study six stations with different climates in iran namely urmia and tabriz semi arid isfahan and shiraz arid yazd and zahedan hyper arid were selected as study area fig 1 shows the locations of studied stations table 1 presents the geographical information of the studied regions it is better to note that the aridity index defined by united nations environment program unep 1992 has been used for climate classification of the considered stations ashraf et al 2014 to accomplish this study daily meteorological data of the studied areas were compiled from the islamic republic of iran meteorological organization irimo during the period of 2000 2014 it should be mentioned that measured solar radiation data may be incorrect incorrect and outlier data were identified based on jiang 2009 sabziparvar et al 2013 and mohammadi et al 2015a 2015b then missing and outlier data were substituted using the calibrated angstrom prescott equation presented by sabziparvar et al 2013 for the studied stations some of the statistical characteristics of the climatic data i e mean air temperature t solar radiation rs relative humidity rh wind speed at 2 m height u2 and the eto values calculated by the standard fao 56 pm equation during the studied period are given in table 2 the whole dataset of each station was divided into three subsets namely training 2000 2008 i e 60 of the whole data testing 2009 2011 i e 20 of the whole data and validation 2012 2014 i e 20 of the whole data 3 1 1 data normalization and standardization as noted one of the objectives of this research is to develop novel models in the lagged eto data based scenarios using the combination of mars and gep models with arch time series model in time series models normalization and standardization of data are essential so whole data were first normalized and then standardized using eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 n t ln x t a 2 z t n t n t σ n t where nt is the normalized data xt is the actual data a is a constant zt is the normalized and standardized data n t is the mean of normalized data and σ n t is the standard deviation of the normalized data it is worth mentioning that the a constant in eq 1 was obtained using trial and error to result the low values for the skewness coefficient 3 2 fao 56 penman monteith equation fao 56 pm as mentioned earlier the fao 56 pm equation is commonly used as a reference method to investigate the performance of other approaches such as artificial intelligence methods the values of eto in fao 56 pm is estimated using the following equation allen et al 1998 3 et o 0 408 r n g 900 γ u 2 t 273 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 rn is the net radiation mj m 2 day 1 g is the soil heat flux mj m 2 day 1 γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 u2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 t is the mean air temperature c es and ea are saturation and actual vapor pressures respectively kpa es ea is the saturation vapor pressure deficit kpa and δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 mean daily eto calculated by the fao 56 pm equation for the studied stations during the considered period 2000 2014 is depicted in fig 2 3 3 multivariate adaptive regression splines multivariate adaptive regression splines mars was introduced by friedman 1991 mars is a spline regression model that employs a specific class of basis functions instead of the original data abraham and steinberg 2001 mars does not have any assumption about the underlying functional relationship between dependent and independent variables friedman 1991 samui 2013 kisi 2016 one of the main advantages of mars is its ability to estimate the contributions of basis functions so that the additive and inter active effects of predictors are allowed to determine the response variable cheng and cao 2014 mars model estimates response variable y from the predictor variable x using the basis functions as below 4 h 1 x max 0 x c 5 h 2 x max 0 c x where c is the knot or threshold value also h1 x and h2 x functions are a reflected pair at c knot the general structure of the mars to predict response variable y is as follows 6 y β 0 i 1 m β i h i x where β 0 is an initial constant βi is the coefficient of ith basis function and hi x is the ith basis function mars consists of two steps namely forward and backward stages in the forward stage a model with over fitting bias and the large number of knots is created then in the backward stage the developed model in the previous stage is corrected by pruning the superfluous knots finally the optimum mars model is obtained it should be mentioned that in the forward and backward stages different models are fitted on the data based upon the basis functions the final mars model is selected on the basis of lowest value for generalized cross validation gcv criteria statistica program was used in this study for developing the mars models in order to estimate daily eto 3 4 gene expression programming gene expression programming gep was first presented by ferreira 2001 it has been obtained by combining and developing of genetic programming gp and genetic algorithm ga methods in the gp tree structures are used but the ga is based upon the binary system which is the main difference in the structure of two methods gep uses the elite selection process and keeps the best individuals of one generation for the next generation gep unlike the ga and gp methods has several genetic operators to reproduce the main difference between ga gp and gep is the nature of their individuals in the ga the individuals are as linear strings with fixed length chromosomes while the individuals in the gp are non linear entities with different sizes and shapes parse trees however in the gep the individuals are encoded as fixed length linear strings similar to the ga then they are expressed in the form of non linear entities with different sizes and shapes similar to the gp ferreira 2001 in the present study genexpro tools program was used to develop the different gep models in the gep five steps must be carried out as below choosing the fitness function here the root mean square error was used as fitness function selecting the terminals and functions sets to produce the chromosomes terminals set consists of different combinations of weather data and lagged eto data which were considered as inputs to estimate eto also the functions set and operators consisting of x x 3 x 2 x 3 ln x e x sin x cos x arctg x were used specifying the structure architecture of the chromosomes here head size the number of genes and chromosomes were selected equal to 8 3 and 30 respectively determining the linking function in this study an addition function was selected and finally choosing the genetic operators and the corresponding rates the values of parameters and genetic operators used in each run of the gep are summarized below number of chromosomes 30 head size 8 number of genes 3 mutation rate 0 044 inversion rate 0 1 one point recombination rate 0 3 two point recombination rate 0 3 gene recombination rate 0 1 gene transposition rate 0 1 insertion sequence transposition rate 0 1 root insertion sequence transposition rate 0 1 3 5 autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity arch as one of the time series models was first introduced by engle 1982 in the time series models it is assumed that each event at the moment is related to events at previous times in most studies related to modeling and forecasting of hydrological processes the main focus is on the average of the data but less attention has been paid to variance changes over time the time series of hydrological data could have low fluctuations in some times and vice versa in other times might have high fluctuations in such circumstances it is expected that the variance of time series is not a fixed term an arch time series model for modeling of variance changes is expressed as 7 σ t 2 α 0 i 1 q α i ε t i 2 ε t σ t z t where σ t 2 is the conditional variance ε t is the error phrase or model residual α 0 and α i are the model parameters q is the order of arch model and z t 0 1 is the normalized and standardized dataset in fact the arch model assumes that the conditional variance varies over time and is a function of past errors 3 6 combination of mars and gep with arch time series model as mentioned considering the stochastic component of eto time series in the lagged eto data based scenarios is the innovation of present study following steps were done to combine the mars and gep approaches with arch time series model in order to increase the estimation accuracy of the daily eto autoregressive moving average arma time series model i e arma p q was fitted on the normalized and standardized daily eto data arma 1 1 was fitted in this study on eto dataset in the studied regions during 2000 2014 the errors or residuals ε t were obtained from the previous stage the attained residuals were optimized considering a correction factor c to use in arch model as ε t c the optimized first order arch model was fitted on ε t c 2 values as σ t 2 α 0 α 1 ε t 1 c 2 the deterministic part d obtained from the mars and gep models was combined with the stochastic part s obtained from the optimized arch time series model as d s and finally scaling up the data including destandardization and denormalization was carried out 3 7 input combinations considered to develop the models this study considers two types of scenarios namely weather data based and lagged eto data based patterns table 3 presents the different inputs considered in estimating daily eto in the weather data based scenarios seven different combinations of weather data such as t rs rh u2 were used in the local analysis of lagged eto data based scenarios the eto values from one to three past days were employed to estimate eto of each particular day additionally the daily eto data of nearby station on the same day eto t and one to two past days eto t 1 eto t 2 were used in the external analysis of lagged eto data based scenarios for estimating the daily eto at target station 3 8 performance comparison criteria this study uses four statistical indicators including root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae coefficient of determination r2 and mean absolute percentage error mape to evaluate the performance of mars and gep models in the weather data and lagged eto data based scenarios as well as the proposed hybrid models namely mars arch and gep arch in the lagged eto data based scenarios for estimation of the daily eto these indicators were computed using the following relationships 8 rmse i 1 n et o i c et o i e 2 n 9 mae 1 n i 1 n et o i c et o i e 10 r 2 i 1 n et o i c et o c et o i e et o e i 1 n et o i c et o c 2 i 1 n et o i e et o e 2 2 11 mape 1 n i 1 n et o i c et o i e et o i c 100 where eto i c eto i e et o c et o e and n are the ith daily eto calculated by the fao 56 pm equation ith daily eto estimated by the single and hybrid artificial intelligence methods the average of the daily eto values calculated by the fao 56 pm equation the average of the daily eto values estimated by the used approaches and the number of dataset respectively it should be noted that the lower values for the rmse mae and mape indicators as well as the higher values for the r2 denote the higher accuracy of the model 4 results and discussion 4 1 local performance of the models 4 1 1 results of weather data based scenarios statistical indicators obtained for local analysis of the mars and gep models at the studied stations with various climates are presented in tables 4 9 results of weather data based scenarios indicate that mars1 and gep1 with input of mean air temperature present the best accuracy among the scenarios with sole input i e mars1 to mars4 and gep1 to gep4 also the estimation accuracy of solar radiation as predictor in mars2 and gep2 models is better than the relative humidity parameter in mars3 and gep3 models on the other hand mars4 and gep4 scenarios with wind speed input had the lowest performance for estimation of the daily eto in the studied areas with different climates similar to the obtained results citakoglu et al 2014 and mehdizadeh et al 2017d reported that wind speed was the worst input parameter to estimate monthly mean eto in turkey and iran respectively the highest and lowest performance of mean temperature and wind speed parameters respectively can be due to the highest and lowest correlations of these parameters with eto see table 2 in order to develop the weather data based scenarios with further inputs mean temperature t as the best predictor was considered as a fixed parameter and solar radiation rs relative humidity rh and wind speed u2 were added into t parameter as clear in the tables 4 9 the performance of mars1 models at the studied stations improves by increasing the number of inputs however the performance of mars5 t rs and mars6 t rs rh is generally similar nevertheless mars6 had slightly better statistics compared to mars5 moreover mars7 t rs rh u2 models developed at the studied stations performed the best this means that although wind speed presented the lowest performance nevertheless adding wind speed into other parameters i e t rs rh in mars6 causes to significantly improve the performance of mars6 models the reason for this fact can be attributed to the advection effects of wind speed on eto similar results were reported by citakoglu et al 2014 and mehdizadeh et al 2017d the error statistics obtained for the mars7 models in validation stage are rmse 0 23 mm day 1 mae 0 16 mm day 1 r2 0 990 and mape 7 15 at urmia rmse 0 28 mm day 1 mae 0 20 mm day 1 r2 0 992 and mape 8 03 at tabriz rmse 0 16 mm day 1 mae 0 12 mm day 1 r2 0 995 and mape 4 23 at isfahan rmse 0 17 mm day 1 mae 0 12 mm day 1 r2 0 993 and mape 3 76 at shiraz rmse 0 16 mm day 1 mae 0 11 mm day 1 r2 0 996 and mape 3 28 at yazd rmse 0 19 mm day 1 mae 0 14 mm day 1 r2 0 993 and mape 3 40 at zahedan in addition by comparing the accuracy of gep models with further inputs i e gep5 to gep7 it is evident that increasing the number of inputs does not necessarily improve the performance of gep models this is in contradiction with the results obtained for the mars models performance comparison of the mars and gep models in the weather data based scenarios demonstrates that the mars models outperformed the gep models at all studied stations and considered scenarios better performance of the mars in comparison to the gep was also reported by mehdizadeh et al 2017d fig 3 illustrates the scatter and comparative plots between fao 56 pm and estimated daily eto values for the superior weather data based scenarios of the studied regions i e mars7 during the validation stage the error statistics of these models have been bolded in tables 4 9 as clearly seen good agreements are observed between fao 56 pm and eto values estimated by the mars7 models the performance of models can be evaluated by fitting a linear regression as y ax b where y is the dependent parameter obtained by the mars and gep x is the independent parameter obtained by the fao 56 pm equation a is the slope and b is the intercept the lowest values of the intercept closer to 0 as well as the highest values of the slope closer to 1 denote the reasonable ability of mars7 models developed in the studied areas for estimating daily eto in addition comparative plots confirm the high potential of mars7 models to estimate daily eto as previously mentioned the mars and gep models have capability to present mathematical relationships between the input and output parameters however these equations in the mars are in the forms of non parametric regressions whereas in the gep are as algebraic equations these equations in the mars consist of different combinations of the basis functions it is better to mention that the number of basis functions is increased by increasing the number of inputs for example the best mars models i e mars7 with four inputs contain 187 198 232 264 193 and 284 basis functions at urmia tabriz isfahan shiraz yazd and zahedan respectively as a result it was not possible to present these equations in the paper and so only the equations of the lagged eto data based scenarios were presented these relationships can be used in the next modeling purposes 4 1 2 results of lagged eto data based scenarios statistical indicators of the single mars and gep models as well as the proposed novel models namely mars arch and gep arch in the lagged eto data based scenarios are given in second part of the tables 4 9 as seen the single mars and gep models present slightly similar statistics therefore it can be said that the eto value of each day can be estimated by these methods and the previous daily eto data as predictors as mentioned earlier the time series of hydrological variables such as et and eto consist of two major parts namely deterministic and stochastic components this study considers both components in modeling process of the daily eto in the lagged eto data based scenarios for this aim the results of mars and gep models were combined with the results of optimized arch time series model optimized arch time series models developed at the studied stations are represented below 12 σ t 2 0 4640278 2 26 10 7 ε t 1 1 4 2 ε t σ t z t at urmia station 13 σ t 2 0 4717395 3 89 10 8 ε t 1

reveals that the accuracy of single models is increased in the proposed novel models considering the stochastic component of the daily eto data for example at urmia station statistical indicators of the best hybrid model i e mars2 arch during the validation stage are rmse 0 23 mm day 1 mae 0 17 mm day 1 r2 0 988 and mape 6 89 while the mentioned statistics for the corresponding single model i e mars2 were rmse 0 57 mm day 1 mae 0 39 mm day 1 r2 0 932 and mape 16 40 similarly improvements in the performance of lagged eto data based modeling were observed in the other proposed models in comparison to the single models at the other stations with various climates furthermore mehdizadeh et al 2017f 2018 introduced novel models by integrating the soft computing methods with the original arch and generalized arch time series model namely garch for rainfall modeling at different locations in iran similar to the obtained outcomes their results confirmed that the proposed hybrid models had much better accuracies compared to the single models scatter plots of the daily eto data estimated by the superior proposed models with bolded statistical indicators in tables 4 9 and the corresponding single models against the eto values of fao 56 pm equation in the lagged eto data based scenarios are depicted in fig 4 it is clearly seen that the estimated eto values using the superior hybrid models are in good agreement with fao 56 pm equation than those obtained by the single models the closer values to 1 and 0 in slopes and intercepts respectively for the lines fitted to points in the proposed models than the single models confirm this issue the equations presented by the corresponding mars and gep models of the best proposed mars arch and gep arch models in the lagged eto data based scenarios are represented in table 10 4 2 external performance of the models 4 2 1 results of weather data based scenarios in addition to the local evaluation of the performance of models an external analysis was used for generalizability of the conclusions obtained in the local analysis on the other side external evaluation of the performance of models can be of great importance in cases where the local data is not available to train the artificial intelligence methods in such circumstances the data of nearby station is used for estimating the studied phenomenon such as the daily eto in this study at target station as mentioned before six stations were selected as the case study urmia and tabriz isfahan and shiraz yazd and zahedan belong to the semi arid arid and hyper arid climatic conditions respectively moreover stations with the same climatic conditions have almost the same climatic data see table 2 additionally cross correlations for the daily eto of urmia and tabriz isfahan and shiraz yazd and zahedan are 0 960 0 903 and 0 866 respectively as a result it seems that the external analysis of the performance of models is reasonable investigating the external performance of the mars and gep models in the weather data based scenarios of the studied stations tables 11 16 reveals that the weather data of nearby station can be utilized to estimate the daily eto of target station although it is obvious that the external performance of models is generally lower than the local performance of models the overall results obtained from the local analysis of the models performances were also observed in the external analysis as follows mars1 and gep1 with mean air temperature input and mars4 and gep4 with wind speed input are the best and worst single input models for estimation of the daily eto at the studied stations the performance of mars models is generally improved by increasing the number of inputs that is while this issue was not necessarily observed in the gep models weather data based scenarios of the mars model have superiority over the corresponding scenarios of the gep mars7 model with inputs of t rs rh u2 with bolded statistics in tables 11 16 is the best input combination at the studied stations with different climates 4 2 2 results of lagged eto data based scenarios the external performance of lagged eto data based scenarios in the single mars and gep as well as the proposed mars arch and gep arch hybrid models tables 11 16 confirms that the single and particularly hybrid models are able to estimate daily eto of target station using the daily eto data of nearby station on the same day and lagged daily eto values even in some cases the external performance of single and hybrid models is slightly better than the local performance of the corresponding models such as single mars and gep models at urmia and tabriz and hybrid mars arch and gep arch models at isfahan yazd and zahedan the reason can be justified by the appropriate selections of the neighboring stations due to having the same climatic conditions and data as a general conclusion it can be said that the external analysis of the performance of models in the weather data based and lagged eto data based scenarios confirmed the results obtained by the local analysis of the performance of models the equations obtained from the corresponding single mars and gep models of the best proposed mars arch and gep arch models with bolded statistics in tables 11 16 for the lagged eto data based scenarios are represented in table 17 5 conclusions an accurate estimation of evapotranspiration plays a crucial role for optimal water resources management and other related applications in the current research the local and external performances of mars and gep models were evaluated for estimating daily eto at six stations iran with different climates under the weather data based and lagged eto data based scenarios investigating the local performance of models indicated that the mars had better performance than the gep in the weather data based scenarios at the studied stations mean air temperature and wind speed were the best and worst predictors for precise estimation of the daily eto moreover mars models with full inputs performed the best among the weather data based scenarios in the lagged eto data based scenarios novel models were introduced by the combination of mars and gep models with arch time series model so mars arch and gep arch hybrid models were developed performance comparison of the proposed and single models demonstrated that the proposed novel models presented better estimates of the daily eto compared to the single models at all studied stations besides the local analysis the external analysis of the performance of models was performed for generalizability of the results obtained in the local analysis in this case stations with similar climates were considered as the neighboring stations and the daily eto of each station was estimated using the data of nearby station overall external performance of models confirmed the results obtained from the local analysis of the models this means that the weather data and lagged eto data of nearby station with the same climate can be employed to estimate daily eto at target station in this study the accuracy of proposed hybrid models was assessed to estimate eto under the lagged eto data based scenarios it is recommended that the performance of proposed models to be evaluated in future studies for the weather data based

are sophisticated with high nonlinearity and great uncertainty which give rise to extreme complexity for ssy change assessment in newtonian approach consequently few approaches can be simply but widely applied to decompose impacts of climatic variability and human activities on ssy change thus it is an urgent need to develop advanced methods that are simple and robust since that the newtonian approach is hardly achievable due to limitation of either observations or knowledge of mechanisms there have been repeated calls to capture the hydrologic system in darwinian approach for hydrological change prediction or explanation as streamflow is the carrier of suspended sediment ssy change are thus documented in changes of sediment concentrated flow and suspended sediment concentration water discharge c q relationships by deduced corollaries a differential equation of sediment discharge change was derived to explicitly decompose impacts of climate variability and human activities in darwinian hydrology besides a new form of sediment rating curves was proposed and curved as c q relationships and probability distribution of sediment concentrated flow river sediment flux can be revealed by this representation which simply elucidates mechanism of ssy generation covering a range of time scales from finer than rainfall event to long term by the new sediment rating curves the differential equation was partly solved using a segmentation algorithm proposed and validated in this paper and then was submitted to water balance framework expressed by budyko type equation thus for catchment management hydrologists can obtain explicit explanation of how climate variation and human activities propagate through landscape and result in sediment discharge change the differential equation is simple and robust for widely application in sediment discharge change assessment as only discrete data of precipitation potential evaporation and c q observed at gauging stations are required keywords differential equation sediment discharge change sediment rating curve human activities climate variability attribution analysis 1 introduction river suspended sediment yield ssy plays an essential role in structuring the landscape creating ecological habitats and transporting nutrients as an indispensable part of the river system ssy has been intensively influenced by human activities and climatic variability especially in the context of a changing climate in recent decades giosan et al 2014 montgomery 2007 thus it has long been a question of great interest to partition the net human and climate impacts on ssy change however sediment generation processes are sophisticated with high nonlinearity and great uncertainty the nonlinearity in sediment discharge is generally known to be arisen from several sources of which transient storage effects bennett et al 2014 lisle and church 2002 geomorphic thresholds bennett et al 2014 schumm 1979 and hydrological connectivity bracken et al 2015 fryirs 2013 are thought to be the most important the stochasticity in climate in the processes of sediment production the mobilization of grains and pathways they follow in the landscape all lead to an inherent variability and uncertainty in sediment transport bennett et al 2014 fuller et al 2003 vercruysse et al 2017 these give rise to extreme complexity for ssy change assessment and it is therefore an urgent need to develop a simple and robust explanatory theory in methodology researches partitioning effects of climate variability and human activities on ssy change can be divided into two groups i regression analyses simply utilize empirical expression regressed by least square method using long term data observed at gauging stations wu et al 2012 yang et al 2015 ii specific researches simulate sediment discharge on watershed or sub watershed scale using distributed hydrological models such as swat hovenga et al 2016 serpa et al 2015 as noted by harman and troch 2014 that those hydrological models can be categorized as being either newtonian or darwinian in nature those regression methods can be generally categorized as the darwinian approach since they seeks to explain the behavior of a hydrologic system as a whole in contrast the newtonian approach builds a mechanistic model of hydrologic processes and their coupled components including initial conditions boundary conditions and model parameters harman and troch 2014 wang and tang 2014 those distributed hydrological models can be termed as a synthesis of the darwinian and newtonian approaches since that sediment simulation embedded in them are also those expressions empirically regressed currently it is too complex to accurately simulate ssy over multiple timescales in the newtonian hydrology due to lacking of comprehensive understanding of how different drivers of sediment transport interact over space and time gao 2008 vercruysse et al 2017 in addition these distributed hydrological models can also not be widely applied due to the limitation of observations and their very time and cost consuming therefore laws or patterns based on the darwinian approach might better try to explain hydrologic variability viewed with a broader perspective in terms of hydrologic regimes and functional patterns gao 2008 gao et al 2007 nevertheless those empirical expressions used are generally regressed using annual or monthly precipitation and ssy data whereas a large proportion of total precipitation has little effect on total ssy for instance researches of sediment erosion and transportation in the loess plateau noted that about 80 90 of total annual sediment yield is transported by the top 5 daily sediment yield rustomji et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 as noted by harman and troch 2014 that both the newtonian and darwinian approaches must elucidate a mechanism that has created those variations and generate corollary statements about the landscape including but not exclusive to its hydrologic behavior that can be tested against evidence this indicate that these empirical expressions regressed between total precipitation and sediment yield are weak in elucidating mechanism of ssy generation these disadvantages invoke the appearance of an explanatory theory to supersede existing ones and to explain facts more rational with easily obtained observations since that the newtonian approach are hardly achievable due to limitation of either observations or knowledge of mechanisms there have been repeated calls to capture the hydrologic system in the darwinian approach for hydrological change predictions or explanation harman and troch 2014 wang and tang 2014 in recent decades a couple of budyko type expressions linking hydrological response to aridity and underlying surface have been developed since budyko hypothesis was proposed in 1960s budyko 1961 these butyko type expressions provide explicit darwinian approaches to investigate how climate variability and human activities propagate through the landscape and result in changes of spatiotemporal patterns of streamflow over a range of time scales gao et al 2016 wang and hejazi 2011 zhou et al 2015a zhou et al 2016 currently limited by observations and knowledge of mechanisms catchmental sediment balance cannot be established analogous to mass conservation such as water balance by budyko hypothesis nevertheless for a given watershed hydrological behaviors such as streamflow ssy and suspended sediment concentration ssc water discharge c q relationships co evolve with climate variability and human impacts sivapalan et al 2011 linkage can be established among sediment concentrated flow c q relationships and ssy since that streamflow is the carrier of suspended sediment therefore it is an interesting field for hydrologist to refer to the darwinian approach and hence to propose simple and robust methods that can be widely applied for ssy change assessment therefore the purpose of this paper is to 1 derive a differential equation decomposing impacts of climate variability and human activities on river sediment discharge 2 present solution to the differential equation and then 3 validate the efficiency of these methods in solving the equation to solve the derived differential equation a new form of sediment rating curves was proposed to establish relationships between the long term ssy and that at finer time scale such as rainfall event driven ssy a segmentation algorithm which was proposed in this paper together with budyko type equations were utilized to efficiently solve the differential equation 2 formula derivation 2 1 corollaries derived from darwinian hydrology presently researches of climate change in terms of precipitation changes are generally investigated in the form of probability distribution of rainfall events observed at a fixed time interval beguería et al 2009 min et al 2011 zheng et al 2015 this motivated us to solve the question of how to decompose sediment discharge change obviously by long term observation the probability of a rainfall event type in a given basin with fixed land cover v is fixed written as pi it can be inferred that the probability of streamflow qi driven by a specific rainfall event type raini and the corresponding average c q relationship ci are fixed too these can be simply expressed as 1 rain i rain pr rain i p i subject to q rain i v q i c q i v c i f q i v p i where rain is the set of precipitation events f q v and c q v are the functions of probability frequency and c q relationship of q at the given basin respectively climate variability reflected by precipitation in a later period is exhibited by the changed probability pi of each rainfall event type raini thus climate variation will change the frequency of rainfall event streamflow but not the relationships of rainfall streamflow and c q generated by a given rainfall type these can be expressed as 2 rain i rain pr rain i p i subject to q rain i v q i c q i v c i f q i v i p i however changed land cover establishes new rainfall runoff and c q relationships generation processes written as 3 rain i rain pr rain i p i subject to q rain i v q i c q i v c i f q i v p i consequently from eqs 1 3 it can be concluded that 1 ssy change attributed to change in streamflow is moderated by climate variability and human activities which propagate through land use cover change 2 ssy change attributed to c q relationship change is alone modulated by human activities 2 2 derivation of the differential equation according to the two inferences above sediment discharge change can be therefore firstly decomposed into two parts changes in streamflow and c q relationships the differential form can be written as 4 d q s q s q d q q s c d c where qs q and c represent ssy streamflow and the average ssc respectively the relative change form of eq 4 can be expressed as 5 d q s q s q s q s q q d q q q s q s c c d c c as shown in eqs 2 and 3 ssy change attributed to change in streamflow the first item of eq 5 is influenced by both climate variability and human activities whereas that attributed to change in c q relationships the second item of eq 5 is exclusively influenced by human activities generally streamflow in a given basin can be modeled as a function of climatic variables precipitation p potential evapotranspiration e 0 and catchment characteristics v fu 1981 zhang et al 2001 expressed as 6 q f p e 0 v the differential form of change in streamflow due to changing climate and catchment characteristics can be approximated as 7 d q q p dp q e 0 de 0 q v dv the relative change in q is expressed as follows 8 dq q q q p p dp p q q e 0 e 0 de 0 e 0 q q v v dv v according to eqs 5 and 8 we obtain a differential equation for sediment discharge change to decompose impacts of those variables on ssy written as 9 dq s q s q s q s q q q q p p dp p q q e 0 e 0 de 0 e 0 q q v v dv v q s q s c c dc c the differential equation for sediment discharge change can be simplified as an elastic equation the elastic form of the differential eqs 5 and 9 can be respectively written as 10 d q s q s η q d q q η vc d c c 11 dq s q s η p dp p η e 0 de 0 e 0 η vq dv v η vc dc c where 12 η q q s q s q q η vc q s q s c c ε p q q p p ε e 0 q q e 0 e 0 ε v q q v v and η p η q ε p η e 0 η q ε e 0 η vq η q ε v the indices ηq and ηvc represent the elasticity of qs to streamflow and c q relationships respectively the indices ηp and η e 0 are the elasticity of ssy to streamflow caused by variability of p and e 0 ηvq is the elasticity of ssy to steamflow caused by land use cover change in contrast ηvc is the elasticity of ssy to c q relationships caused by land use cover change the indices εp ε e 0 and εv are elasticity of streamflow to p e 0 and land use cover respectively these elastic indices represent the change of ssy or streamflow in percentage with respect to a 1 percent change in each variable p e 0 or v etc thus total ssy change δqs attributed to changes in precipitation δqs p potential evapotranspiration δqs e 0 and human activities by changing streamflow δqs vq and by changing c q relationships δqs vc can be respectively expressed as 13 δ q s p η p δ p p q s δ q s e 0 η e 0 de 0 e 0 q s δ q s vq η vq dv v q s δ q s vc η vc dc c q s where δ q s δ q s p δ q s e 0 δ q s vq δ q s vc δqs p and δqs e 0 represent the impact of climate variability on ssy change δqs clim δ q s clim δ q s p δ q s e 0 δqs vq and δqs vc represent the effects of land use cover change on ssy change by moderating streamflow and regulating c q relationships respectively the impact of human activities or land use cover change on ssy δqs lucc can be calculated by δ q s lucc δ q s vq δ q s vc the flow chart for derivation of the differential equation and the corresponding solution is shown in fig 1 3 solution to the differential equation 3 1 partial solution referring to the budyko type equation it is known that the implicit function for streamflow is expressed by budyko type equation consequently the differential eq 11 can be partly solved based on the water balance framework using budyko hypothesis budyko 1974 budyko 1961 budyko hypothesis denotes that the long term average ratio of mean annual evaporation e to mean annual precipitation p was primarily controlled by the water energy balance of a basin the function f can be written as 14 q p e p 1 f ϕ where ϕ is the aridity index ϕ e 0 p e 0 is the potential evapotranspiration e p f ϕ using budyko type equations the elasticity of streamflow with respect to precipitation potential evapotranspiration and underlying surface were widely applied gao et al 2016 wang and hejazi 2011 zheng et al 2009 zhou et al 2015a zhou et al 2015b and the partial solution to eq 11 can be obtained by 15 ε p 1 ϕ f ϕ 1 f ϕ ε e 0 ϕ f ϕ 1 f ϕ ε v vf v 1 f ϕ in recent decades several budyko type functions involving land cover parameter were developed as shown in table 1 each of these functions and the corresponding derivatives shown in table 1 can be adopted to solve eq 15 and hence partly solve the differential eqs 9 and 11 3 2 sediment flux representation and solution to the differential equation 3 2 1 a new form of sediment rating curves and the route for solution derivation as ssy change attributed to change in streamflow is solved by the implicit function expressed by budyko type equation the differential equation can thus be figured out if we prudently decompose ssy change into changes in streamflow and c q relationships as shown in eq 3 therefore it is virtually important to represent sediment flux in sediment concentrated flow and the corresponding c q relationships thereby to simply elucidate mechanism of ssy generation covering a range of time scales from finer than rainfall event to long term generally the signature of suspended sediment at present is characterized by four main empirical approaches i sediment rating curves asselman 2000 ii hysteresis models williams 1989 iii multivariate data mining techniques cobaner et al 2009 and iv sediment fingerprinting carter et al 2003 the response of ssy to a single flood event does little to reveal the hydrologic regime of a watershed zhang et al 2017 indicating that those hysteresis models at present are inefficient to present sediment flux the very time and cost consuming for multivariate data mining techniques and sediment fingerprinting limits their widely application sediment rating curve is most commonly used to present suspended sediment regime covering from long term to finer time scales however this representation is limited to c q relationships whereas the representation of sediment flux is more important in reflecting sediment regime using discrete data observed at gauging station rustomji et al 2008 vercruysse et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 to clearly exhibit sediment flux and hence to develop a darwinian approach decomposing ssy change a new form of sediment rating curves was curved as probability frequency distribution of sediment concentrated flow f q and the mean c q relationships c q versus water discharge class q as shown in fig 2 hence relationships between ssy at long term time scale and that observed at time scale finer than rainfall event were establish thereby to elucidate the mechanism of sediment generation processes covering a range of time scales by such sediment flux representation ssy can be mathematically calculated if so by expressions of long term c q relationships and the probability distribution of streamflow mathematically sediment flux qs can be evaluated by an integral equation 16 q s f q q c q d q and streamflow q can be evaluated by 17 q f q q d q where f q and c q are the corresponding probability frequency and the ssc of sediment concentrated flow according to eq 16 impacted by climatic variation change and human activities ssy change between two periods can be mathematically expressed as 18 δ q s q s 2 q s 1 q f 2 q c 2 q f 1 q c 1 q d q where the subscript 1 and 2 indicate the former and later periods eq 18 can be transformed into 19 δ q s q f 2 q c 2 q f 1 q c 1 q c 1 q f 2 q c 1 q f 2 q d q q f 2 q f 1 q c 1 q d q q c 2 q c 1 q f 2 q d q since that streamflow is the carrier of sediment ssy change attributed to change in c q relationships is taken effect by changing ssc of the remaining streamflow thus from eq 19 we can simply obtain ssy change attributed to change in c q relationships δqs vc written as 20a δ q s vc q c 2 q c 1 q f 2 q dq and that attributed to change in streamflow δqs q expressed as 20b δ q s q q f 2 q f 1 q c 1 q d q the indices of ssy elasticity ηq and ηvc can be obtained by 21 η q δ q s q q s δ q q η vc δ q s vc q s δ c c where qs q and c denote sediment discharge streamflow and mean suspended sediment concentration in baseline period respectively δq and δc denote changes in streamflow and mean ssc between two periods respectively all these variables can be obtained from observed data 3 2 2 approximate estimation using a segmentation algorithm presently lack of accurate probability distribution functions of streamflow and expressions of c q relationship finally limits the decomposition of impacts of those variables on ssy change using the differential eq 9 or 11 however owing to great uncertainty and high nonlinearity in ssy generation and transportation processes vrugt et al 2003 any attempt to obtain those expressions over all orders of magnitude will bring large error and derive imprecise results nevertheless the high nonlinearity and uncertainties can be eliminated as we calculated quantitative c q relationships at a fine but rational spaced streamflow interval using data series with large sample size i e long term data as shown in fig 2 furthermore scaling regimes by fractal theories have widely emphasized that hydrological regime at a temporal or spatial scale are exactly documented in data collect at finer scale lovejoy and schertzer 2013 pandey et al 1998 tessier et al 1993 in other words hydrological regimes of those rainfall event driven streamflow and ssy are documented in data observed at finer time scale such as daily hourly etc hence a segmentation algorithm was proposed to solve eqs 10 and 11 using discrete data rather than empirical regressed expressions there are three steps for the segmentation algorithm to obtain the approximate value using discrete data firstly as shown in fig 2 we divide the discrete c q data over a long period n years with data series length l into n nonoverlapping discharge classes of equal length λ d n where d is range of streamflow variation as ssc is widely known to be positively related to log discharge fig 2 both d and λ are defined on the log discharge scale the mean annual ssy for each period be calculated by the equation 22 q s 1 n i 1 n j 1 m q j c j 1 n l i 1 2 n j 1 2 m where qj is one of daily streamflow and cj is the corresponding c q relationship in discharge class i of which data series length is m j 1 m q j c j is the total ssy and j is the number of data in discharge class i respectively in the second step we calculate the mean annual frequency of streamflow fi and the corresponding mean c q relationships c i at each discharge class i qi for each data series from two periods mean annual sediment discharge for each period can be thereby written as 23 q s i 1 n q i c i f i change in mean annual ssy between two periods can be calculated by 24 δ q s n i 1 n q i c i 2 f i 2 c i 1 f i 1 i 1 n q i c i 2 f i 2 c i 1 f i 1 c i 1 f i 2 c i 1 f i 2 i 1 n q i c i 1 f i 2 f i 1 i 1 n q i f i 2 c i 2 c i 1 similarly to eq 20 we obtain a calculated ssy change attributed to changes in streamflow and c q relationships respectively written as 25a δ q s q n i 1 n q i c i 1 f i 2 f i 1 25b δ q s vc n i 1 n q i f i 2 c i 2 c i 1 the elastic indices ηq and ηvc at discharge classes n can be expressed as 26 η q n δ q s q n q s δ q q η vc n δ q s vc n q s δ c c in the third step we repeat the steps 1 and 2 with the spaced discharge classes n increasing from 1 to l then we can obtain data series of δqs q n and δqs vc n or elastic indices ηq n and ηvc n respectively the scaling property can be observed as these variables vary with increasing n there are three scaling intervals for each series of these variables and in the middle scaling interval each variable is independent on n and approaches a constant which is the theoretical value thus the approximate value of each variable can be derived 4 model validation and discussion the water balance framework has been validated and widely applied to assess impacts of climate change and human activities on streamflow change gao et al 2016 wang and hejazi 2011 zheng et al 2009 zhou et al 2015a therefore for method validation we just need to validate the efficiency of the segmentation algorithm in decomposing ssy change attributed to changes in streamflow and c q relationships as shown in fig 3 we simulated data using expressions to demonstrate that the calculate value using the segmentation algorithm approximates to theoretical value it can be seen from the sediment rating curves in fig 2 that the curve of c q relationships in log log space is s shaped in details ssc approaches 0 with streamflow approaching 0 ssc sharply increases as streamflow increases at moderate values and ssc approaches a constant when streamflow approaches in log log space streamflow at equally spaced discharge classes similarly follows the norm distribution hence we generated random streamflow data in log log space using the expression q 1 2 π σ exp q μ 2 σ 2 where μ and σ are constants the general c q relationships follow the s shaped curve expressed by c q k 1 exp log q a where a and k are constants besides discrete ssc data for each water discharge was randomly generated by expression c rnd 1 2 π δ exp c c q 2 δ 2 where δ 0 4c q as shown in fig 3a two data series were simulated to represent c q data in two periods named as period i and period ii respectively the segmentation algorithm was performed with the discharge classes increasing from 1 to l so as to obtain the approximate value against the theoretical value of those indices take the procedure obtaining the theoretical proportion of δqs vc as an example fig 3b there are three scaling intervals of proportional δqs vc n series the scaling property of proportional δqs vc n series is similar to scaling regime of fractal theory kantelhardt et al 2001 lovejoy and schertzer 2013 tessier et al 1994 when n 1 apart from total streamflow change all ssy reductions are categorized as change in ssc δ q s vc n 1 q 2 q 1 when n approaches they are all categorized as change in streamflow δ q s vc n 0 similar to mono fractals bogachev et al 2007 kantelhardt et al 2006 the middle interval where m n n is of significant importance to obtain approximate value of δqs vc because the proportional δqs vc n is independent of n and can be considered as a constant as shown in fig 3c we performed the simulation as the sample size varying from 103 to more than 104 the δqs vc calculated at a spaced class n 200 always equals to theoretical value since that hydrological changes are always investigated by long term observation indicating that the efficiency of the segmentation algorithm is not limited by sample size at last we evaluated the stationary of the segmentation algorithm we performed the simulation for 2000 times each of which has different parameters of k a μ and σ results showed that all the calculated values are good fit to theoretical values as shown in fig 4 the two findings indicate that the segmentation algorithm is efficient and stable to partly solve the differential equation by decomposing ssy change into changes in streamflow and c q relationships using discrete data thus the attribution analysis of impacts of climate variability and human activities can be carried out by the differential equation proposed in the paper in comparison with those very time and cost consuming distributed hydrological models the differential equation is also robust as it elucidates the mechanism of sediment generation processes among a range of time scales however it is simple for widely application as only data observed at gauging stations are required in spite of the different roles of flow events in sediment discharge generation zhang et al 2016 researches have noted that ecological projects play different roles in moderating flow event c q relationship among orders of magnitude of flow rustomji et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 taken the highly nonlinear c q relationships together the differential equation is superior to those regression methods which treat c q relationships by a unique expression moreover for sediment generation in a given scenario the self regulation property noted by williams 1989 and zhang et al 2016 indicates that 1 c q relationship increases with flow increasing 2 mean c q relationship for a given flow is generally stable this provides strong evidence to our corollaries in derivation of the differential equation and demonstrated that the proposed segmentation algorithm is advantage to derive solution to the equation it should be note that the differential equation and the corresponding solutions are a first approximation to attribute ssy change the interaction between climate variability and vegetation and the further vegetation cover change induced ssy change is not involved in our method the differential equation proposed in this paper can be widely applied to quantify impacts of climate variability and human activities on river sediment discharge change nevertheless the application of the differential equation is by no means limited to the budyko s steady state conditions being a result of assuming negligible storage change in the water balance as studied by wang and zhou 2016 and greve et al 2016 impacts of climate variability and human activities in water imbalance condition can also be decomposed by submitting the differential equation to modified budyko type equation further work will be carried out on assessment of ssy change under specific impacts of spatial and temporal variability of climate the different land use patterns regulation activities of water reservoirs etc referring to these modified budyko type equation the differential equation can be extended to a variety of climatic conditions under which significant water storage changes or additional water besides precipitation is available to evaporation 5 conclusions river sediment discharge as an indispensable part of the river system has been intensively influenced by human activities and climatic variability in recent decades thus it has long been a question of great interest to partition the net human and climate impacts on ssy change however high nonlinearity and great uncertainty give rise to extreme complexity in assessment of ssy change in the newtonian approach currently few approach can be simply and robustly used to decompose impacts of the two aspects on ssy thus this paper is to derive a differential equation to capture the hydrologic system of climatic variability and human activities on ssy change in the darwinian hydrology since that streamflow is the carrier of suspended sediment ssy changes are documented in changes of sediment concentrated flow and c q relationships by deduced corollaries a differential equation of sediment discharge change was derived to explicitly decompose impacts of climate variability and human activities in the darwinian hydrology to solve the differential equation a new form of sediment rating curves was proposed and curved as c q relationships and probability distribution of streamflow river sediment flux can therefore be revealed by such representation of sediment rating curves using long term observed discrete data to solve the differential equation a segmentation algorithm was introduced to decompose ssy changes attributed to changes in c q relationships and streamflow using discrete data the scaling property of the calculated values obtained by the segmentation algorithm was utilized to find value approximating to the theoretical value the differential equation was further submitted to water balance framework expressed by budyko type equation and the expression for the contributions of changes in climatic variability and direct human impacts on river sediment discharge is provided by data simulation the segmentation algorithm was validated to be efficient in obtaining numerical solution to the differential equation contributions of changes in streamflow and c q relationships to ssy change were obtained besides elasticity of ssy to precipitation pet and land use cover change were theoretically derived the analytic equation provides a superior darwinian approach partitioning climatic and human impacts on ssy change as only data series of precipitation potential

7421,the assessment for impacts of climate variability and human activities on suspended sediment yield ssy change has long been a question of great interest however the sediment generation processes

required keywords differential equation sediment discharge change sediment rating curve human activities climate variability attribution analysis 1 introduction river suspended sediment yield ssy plays an essential role in structuring the landscape creating ecological habitats and transporting nutrients as an indispensable part of the river system ssy has been intensively influenced by human activities and climatic variability especially in the context of a changing climate in recent decades giosan et al 2014 montgomery 2007 thus it has long been a question of great interest to partition the net human and climate impacts on ssy change however sediment generation processes are sophisticated with high nonlinearity and great uncertainty the nonlinearity in sediment discharge is generally known to be arisen from several sources of which transient storage effects bennett et al 2014 lisle and church 2002 geomorphic thresholds bennett et al 2014 schumm 1979 and hydrological connectivity bracken et al 2015 fryirs 2013 are thought to be the most important the stochasticity in climate in the processes of sediment production the mobilization of grains and pathways they follow in the landscape all lead to an inherent variability and uncertainty in sediment transport bennett et al 2014 fuller et al 2003 vercruysse et al 2017 these give rise to extreme complexity for ssy change assessment and it is therefore an urgent need to develop a simple and robust explanatory theory in methodology researches partitioning effects of climate variability and human activities on ssy change can be divided into two groups i regression analyses simply utilize empirical expression regressed by least square method using long term data observed at gauging stations wu et al 2012 yang et al 2015 ii specific researches simulate sediment discharge on watershed or sub watershed scale using distributed hydrological models such as swat hovenga et al 2016 serpa et al 2015 as noted by harman and troch 2014 that those hydrological models can be categorized as being either newtonian or darwinian in nature those regression methods can be generally categorized as the darwinian approach since they seeks to explain the behavior of a hydrologic system as a whole in contrast the newtonian approach builds a mechanistic model of hydrologic processes and their coupled components including initial conditions boundary conditions and model parameters harman and troch 2014 wang and tang 2014 those distributed hydrological models can be termed as a synthesis of the darwinian and newtonian approaches since that sediment simulation embedded in them are also those expressions empirically regressed currently it is too complex to accurately simulate ssy over multiple timescales in the newtonian hydrology due to lacking of comprehensive understanding of how different drivers of sediment transport interact over space and time gao 2008 vercruysse et al 2017 in addition these distributed hydrological models can also not be widely applied due to the limitation of observations and their very time and cost consuming therefore laws or patterns based on the darwinian approach might better try to explain hydrologic variability viewed with a broader perspective in terms of hydrologic regimes and functional patterns gao 2008 gao et al 2007 nevertheless those empirical expressions used are generally regressed using annual or monthly precipitation and ssy data whereas a large proportion of total precipitation has little effect on total ssy for instance researches of sediment erosion and transportation in the loess plateau noted that about 80 90 of total annual sediment yield is transported by the top 5 daily sediment yield rustomji et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 as noted by harman and troch 2014 that both the newtonian and darwinian approaches must elucidate a mechanism that has created those variations and generate corollary statements about the landscape including but not exclusive to its hydrologic behavior that can be tested against evidence this indicate that these empirical expressions regressed between total precipitation and sediment yield are weak in elucidating mechanism of ssy generation these disadvantages invoke the appearance of an explanatory theory to supersede existing ones and to explain facts more rational with easily obtained observations since that the newtonian approach are hardly achievable due to limitation of either observations or knowledge of mechanisms there have been repeated calls to capture the hydrologic system in the darwinian approach for hydrological change predictions or explanation harman and troch 2014 wang and tang 2014 in recent decades a couple of budyko type expressions linking hydrological response to aridity and underlying surface have been developed since budyko hypothesis was proposed in 1960s budyko 1961 these butyko type expressions provide explicit darwinian approaches to investigate how climate variability and human activities propagate through the landscape and result in changes of spatiotemporal patterns of streamflow over a range of time scales gao et al 2016 wang and hejazi 2011 zhou et al 2015a zhou et al 2016 currently limited by observations and knowledge of mechanisms catchmental sediment balance cannot be established analogous to mass conservation such as water balance by budyko hypothesis nevertheless for a given watershed hydrological behaviors such as streamflow ssy and suspended sediment concentration ssc water discharge c q relationships co evolve with climate variability and human impacts sivapalan et al 2011 linkage can be established among sediment concentrated flow c q relationships and ssy since that streamflow is the carrier of suspended sediment therefore it is an interesting field for hydrologist to refer to the darwinian approach and hence to propose simple and robust methods that can be widely applied for ssy change assessment therefore the purpose of this paper is to 1 derive a differential equation decomposing impacts of climate variability and human activities on river sediment discharge 2 present solution to the differential equation and then 3 validate the efficiency of these methods in solving the equation to solve the derived differential equation a new form of sediment rating curves was proposed to establish relationships between the long term ssy and that at finer time scale such as rainfall event driven ssy a segmentation algorithm which was proposed in this paper together with budyko type equations were utilized to efficiently solve the differential equation 2 formula derivation 2 1 corollaries derived from darwinian hydrology presently researches of climate change in terms of precipitation changes are generally investigated in the form of probability distribution of rainfall events observed at a fixed time interval beguería et al 2009 min et al 2011 zheng et al 2015 this motivated us to solve the question of how to decompose sediment discharge change obviously by long term observation the probability of a rainfall event type in a given basin with fixed land cover v is fixed written as pi it can be inferred that the probability of streamflow qi driven by a specific rainfall event type raini and the corresponding average c q relationship ci are fixed too these can be simply expressed as 1 rain i rain pr rain i p i subject to q rain i v q i c q i v c i f q i v p i where rain is the set of precipitation events f q v and c q v are the functions of probability frequency and c q relationship of q at the given basin respectively climate variability reflected by precipitation in a later period is exhibited by the changed probability pi of each rainfall event type raini thus climate variation will change the frequency of rainfall event streamflow but not the relationships of rainfall streamflow and c q generated by a given rainfall type these can be expressed as 2 rain i rain pr rain i p i subject to q rain i v q i c q i v c i f q i v i p i however changed land cover establishes new rainfall runoff and c q relationships generation processes written as 3 rain i rain pr rain i p i subject to q rain i v q i c q i v c i f q i v p i consequently from eqs 1 3 it can be concluded that 1 ssy change attributed to change in streamflow is moderated by climate variability and human activities which propagate through land use cover change 2 ssy change attributed to c q relationship change is alone modulated by human activities 2 2 derivation of the differential equation according to the two inferences above sediment discharge change can be therefore firstly decomposed into two parts changes in streamflow and c q relationships the differential form can be written as 4 d q s q s q d q q s c d c where qs q and c represent ssy streamflow and the average ssc respectively the relative change form of eq 4 can be expressed as 5 d q s q s q s q s q q d q q q s q s c c d c c as shown in eqs 2 and 3 ssy change attributed to change in streamflow the first item of eq 5 is influenced by both climate variability and human activities whereas that attributed to change in c q relationships the second item of eq 5 is exclusively influenced by human activities generally streamflow in a given basin can be modeled as a function of climatic variables precipitation p potential evapotranspiration e 0 and catchment characteristics v fu 1981 zhang et al 2001 expressed as 6 q f p e 0 v the differential form of change in streamflow due to changing climate and catchment characteristics can be approximated as 7 d q q p dp q e 0 de 0 q v dv the relative change in q is expressed as follows 8 dq q q q p p dp p q q e 0 e 0 de 0 e 0 q q v v dv v according to eqs 5 and 8 we obtain a differential equation for sediment discharge change to decompose impacts of those variables on ssy written as 9 dq s q s q s q s q q q q p p dp p q q e 0 e 0 de 0 e 0 q q v v dv v q s q s c c dc c the differential equation for sediment discharge change can be simplified as an elastic equation the elastic form of the differential eqs 5 and 9 can be respectively written as 10 d q s q s η q d q q η vc d c c 11 dq s q s η p dp p η e 0 de 0 e 0 η vq dv v η vc dc c where 12 η q q s q s q q η vc q s q s c c ε p q q p p ε e 0 q q e 0 e 0 ε v q q v v and η p η q ε p η e 0 η q ε e 0 η vq η q ε v the indices ηq and ηvc represent the elasticity of qs to streamflow and c q relationships respectively the indices ηp and η e 0 are the elasticity of ssy to streamflow caused by variability of p and e 0 ηvq is the elasticity of ssy to steamflow caused by land use cover change in contrast ηvc is the elasticity of ssy to c q relationships caused by land use cover change the indices εp ε e 0 and εv are elasticity of streamflow to p e 0 and land use cover respectively these elastic indices represent the change of ssy or streamflow in percentage with respect to a 1 percent change in each variable p e 0 or v etc thus total ssy change δqs attributed to changes in precipitation δqs p potential evapotranspiration δqs e 0 and human activities by changing streamflow δqs vq and by changing c q relationships δqs vc can be respectively expressed as 13 δ q s p η p δ p p q s δ q s e 0 η e 0 de 0 e 0 q s δ q s vq η vq dv v q s δ q s vc η vc dc c q s where δ q s δ q s p δ q s e 0 δ q s vq δ q s vc δqs p and δqs e 0 represent the impact of climate variability on ssy change δqs clim δ q s clim δ q s p δ q s e 0 δqs vq and δqs vc represent the effects of land use cover change on ssy change by moderating streamflow and regulating c q relationships respectively the impact of human activities or land use cover change on ssy δqs lucc can be calculated by δ q s lucc δ q s vq δ q s vc the flow chart for derivation of the differential equation and the corresponding solution is shown in fig 1 3 solution to the differential equation 3 1 partial solution referring to the budyko type equation it is known that the implicit function for streamflow is expressed by budyko type equation consequently the differential eq 11 can be partly solved based on the water balance framework using budyko hypothesis budyko 1974 budyko 1961 budyko hypothesis denotes that the long term average ratio of mean annual evaporation e to mean annual precipitation p was primarily controlled by the water energy balance of a basin the function f can be written as 14 q p e p 1 f ϕ where ϕ is the aridity index ϕ e 0 p e 0 is the potential evapotranspiration e p f ϕ using budyko type equations the elasticity of streamflow with respect to precipitation potential evapotranspiration and underlying surface were widely applied gao et al 2016 wang and hejazi 2011 zheng et al 2009 zhou et al 2015a zhou et al 2015b and the partial solution to eq 11 can be obtained by 15 ε p 1 ϕ f ϕ 1 f ϕ ε e 0 ϕ f ϕ 1 f ϕ ε v vf v 1 f ϕ in recent decades several budyko type functions involving land cover parameter were developed as shown in table 1 each of these functions and the corresponding derivatives shown in table 1 can be adopted to solve eq 15 and hence partly solve the differential eqs 9 and 11 3 2 sediment flux representation and solution to the differential equation 3 2 1 a new form of sediment rating curves and the route for solution derivation as ssy change attributed to change in streamflow is solved by the implicit function expressed by budyko type equation the differential equation can thus be figured out if we prudently decompose ssy change into changes in streamflow and c q relationships as shown in eq 3 therefore it is virtually important to represent sediment flux in sediment concentrated flow and the corresponding c q relationships thereby to simply elucidate mechanism of ssy generation covering a range of time scales from finer than rainfall event to long term generally the signature of suspended sediment at present is characterized by four main empirical approaches i sediment rating curves asselman 2000 ii hysteresis models williams 1989 iii multivariate data mining techniques cobaner et al 2009 and iv sediment fingerprinting carter et al 2003 the response of ssy to a single flood event does little to reveal the hydrologic regime of a watershed zhang et al 2017 indicating that those hysteresis models at present are inefficient to present sediment flux the very time and cost consuming for multivariate data mining techniques and sediment fingerprinting limits their widely application sediment rating curve is most commonly used to present suspended sediment regime covering from long term to finer time scales however this representation is limited to c q relationships whereas the representation of sediment flux is more important in reflecting sediment regime using discrete data observed at gauging station rustomji et al 2008 vercruysse et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 to clearly exhibit sediment flux and hence to develop a darwinian approach decomposing ssy change a new form of sediment rating curves was curved as probability frequency distribution of sediment concentrated flow f q and the mean c q relationships c q versus water discharge class q as shown in fig 2 hence relationships between ssy at long term time scale and that observed at time scale finer than rainfall event were establish thereby to elucidate the mechanism of sediment generation processes covering a range of time scales by such sediment flux representation ssy can be mathematically calculated if so by expressions of long term c q relationships and the probability distribution of streamflow mathematically sediment flux qs can be evaluated by an integral equation 16 q s f q q c q d q and streamflow q can be evaluated by 17 q f q q d q where f q and c q are the corresponding probability frequency and the ssc of sediment concentrated flow according to eq 16 impacted by climatic variation change and human activities ssy change between two periods can be mathematically expressed as 18 δ q s q s 2 q s 1 q f 2 q c 2 q f 1 q c 1 q d q where the subscript 1 and 2 indicate the former and later periods eq 18 can be transformed into 19 δ q s q f 2 q c 2 q f 1 q c 1 q c 1 q f 2 q c 1 q f 2 q d q q f 2 q f 1 q c 1 q d q q c 2 q c 1 q f 2 q d q since that streamflow is the carrier of sediment ssy change attributed to change in c q relationships is taken effect by changing ssc of the remaining streamflow thus from eq 19 we can simply obtain ssy change attributed to change in c q relationships δqs vc written as 20a δ q s vc q c 2 q c 1 q f 2 q dq and that attributed to change in streamflow δqs q expressed as 20b δ q s q q f 2 q f 1 q c 1 q d q the indices of ssy elasticity ηq and ηvc can be obtained by 21 η q δ q s q q s δ q q η vc δ q s vc q s δ c c where qs q and c denote sediment discharge streamflow and mean suspended sediment concentration in baseline period respectively δq and δc denote changes in streamflow and mean ssc between two periods respectively all these variables can be obtained from observed data 3 2 2 approximate estimation using a segmentation algorithm presently lack of accurate probability distribution functions of streamflow and expressions of c q relationship finally limits the decomposition of impacts of those variables on ssy change using the differential eq 9 or 11 however owing to great uncertainty and high nonlinearity in ssy generation and transportation processes vrugt et al 2003 any attempt to obtain those expressions over all orders of magnitude will bring large error and derive imprecise results nevertheless the high nonlinearity and uncertainties can be eliminated as we calculated quantitative c q relationships at a fine but rational spaced streamflow interval using data series with large sample size i e long term data as shown in fig 2 furthermore scaling regimes by fractal theories have widely emphasized that hydrological regime at a temporal or spatial scale are exactly documented in data collect at finer scale lovejoy and schertzer 2013 pandey et al 1998 tessier et al 1993 in other words hydrological regimes of those rainfall event driven streamflow and ssy are documented in data observed at finer time scale such as daily hourly etc hence a segmentation algorithm was proposed to solve eqs 10 and 11 using discrete data rather than empirical regressed expressions there are three steps for the segmentation algorithm to obtain the approximate value using discrete data firstly as shown in fig 2 we divide the discrete c q data over a long period n years with data series length l into n nonoverlapping discharge classes of equal length λ d n where d is range of streamflow variation as ssc is widely known to be positively related to log discharge fig 2 both d and λ are defined on the log discharge scale the mean annual ssy for each period be calculated by the equation 22 q s 1 n i 1 n j 1 m q j c j 1 n l i 1 2 n j 1 2 m where qj is one of daily streamflow and cj is the corresponding c q relationship in discharge class i of which data series length is m j 1 m q j c j is the total ssy and j is the number of data in discharge class i respectively in the second step we calculate the mean annual frequency of streamflow fi and the corresponding mean c q relationships c i at each discharge class i qi for each data series from two periods mean annual sediment discharge for each period can be thereby written as 23 q s i 1 n q i c i f i change in mean annual ssy between two periods can be calculated by 24 δ q s n i 1 n q i c i 2 f i 2 c i 1 f i 1 i 1 n q i c i 2 f i 2 c i 1 f i 1 c i 1 f i 2 c i 1 f i 2 i 1 n q i c i 1 f i 2 f i 1 i 1 n q i f i 2 c i 2 c i 1 similarly to eq 20 we obtain a calculated ssy change attributed to changes in streamflow and c q relationships respectively written as 25a δ q s q n i 1 n q i c i 1 f i 2 f i 1 25b δ q s vc n i 1 n q i f i 2 c i 2 c i 1 the elastic indices ηq and ηvc at discharge classes n can be expressed as 26 η q n δ q s q n q s δ q q η vc n δ q s vc n q s δ c c in the third step we repeat the steps 1 and 2 with the spaced discharge classes n increasing from 1 to l then we can obtain data series of δqs q n and δqs vc n or elastic indices ηq n and ηvc n respectively the scaling property can be observed as these variables vary with increasing n there are three scaling intervals for each series of these variables and in the middle scaling interval each variable is independent on n and approaches a constant which is the theoretical value thus the approximate value of each variable can be derived 4 model validation and discussion the water balance framework has been validated and widely applied to assess impacts of climate change and human activities on streamflow change gao et al 2016 wang and hejazi 2011 zheng et al 2009 zhou et al 2015a therefore for method validation we just need to validate the efficiency of the segmentation algorithm in decomposing ssy change attributed to changes in streamflow and c q relationships as shown in fig 3 we simulated data using expressions to demonstrate that the calculate value using the segmentation algorithm approximates to theoretical value it can be seen from the sediment rating curves in fig 2 that the curve of c q relationships in log log space is s shaped in details ssc approaches 0 with streamflow approaching 0 ssc sharply increases as streamflow increases at moderate values and ssc approaches a constant when streamflow approaches in log log space streamflow at equally spaced discharge classes similarly follows the norm distribution hence we generated random streamflow data in log log space using the expression q 1 2 π σ exp q μ 2 σ 2 where μ and σ are constants the general c q relationships follow the s shaped curve expressed by c q k 1 exp log q a where a and k are constants besides discrete ssc data for each water discharge was randomly generated by expression c rnd 1 2 π δ exp c c q 2 δ 2 where δ 0 4c q as shown in fig 3a two data series were simulated to represent c q data in two periods named as period i and period ii respectively the segmentation algorithm was performed with the discharge classes increasing from 1 to l so as to obtain the approximate value against the theoretical value of those indices take the procedure obtaining the theoretical proportion of δqs vc as an example fig 3b there are three scaling intervals of proportional δqs vc n series the scaling property of proportional δqs vc n series is similar to scaling regime of fractal theory kantelhardt et al 2001 lovejoy and schertzer 2013 tessier et al 1994 when n 1 apart from total streamflow change all ssy reductions are categorized as change in ssc δ q s vc n 1 q 2 q 1 when n approaches they are all categorized as change in streamflow δ q s vc n 0 similar to mono fractals bogachev et al 2007 kantelhardt et al 2006 the middle interval where m n n is of significant importance to obtain approximate value of δqs vc because the proportional δqs vc n is independent of n and can be considered as a constant as shown in fig 3c we performed the simulation as the sample size varying from 103 to more than 104 the δqs vc calculated at a spaced class n 200 always equals to theoretical value since that hydrological changes are always investigated by long term observation indicating that the efficiency of the segmentation algorithm is not limited by sample size at last we evaluated the stationary of the segmentation algorithm we performed the simulation for 2000 times each of which has different parameters of k a μ and σ results showed that all the calculated values are good fit to theoretical values as shown in fig 4 the two findings indicate that the segmentation algorithm is efficient and stable to partly solve the differential equation by decomposing ssy change into changes in streamflow and c q relationships using discrete data thus the attribution analysis of impacts of climate variability and human activities can be carried out by the differential equation proposed in the paper in comparison with those very time and cost consuming distributed hydrological models the differential equation is also robust as it elucidates the mechanism of sediment generation processes among a range of time scales however it is simple for widely application as only data observed at gauging stations are required in spite of the different roles of flow events in sediment discharge generation zhang et al 2016 researches have noted that ecological projects play different roles in moderating flow event c q relationship among orders of magnitude of flow rustomji et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 taken the highly nonlinear c q relationships together the differential equation is superior to those regression methods which treat c q relationships by a unique expression moreover for sediment generation in a given scenario the self regulation property noted by williams 1989 and zhang et al 2016 indicates that 1 c q relationship increases with flow increasing 2 mean c q relationship for a given flow is generally stable this provides strong evidence to our corollaries in derivation of the differential equation and demonstrated that the proposed segmentation algorithm is advantage to derive solution to the equation it should be note that the differential equation and the corresponding solutions are a first approximation to attribute ssy change the interaction between climate variability and vegetation and the further vegetation cover change induced ssy change is not involved in our method the differential equation proposed in this paper can be widely applied to quantify impacts of climate variability and human activities on river sediment discharge change nevertheless the application of the differential equation is by no means limited to the budyko s steady state conditions being a result of assuming negligible storage change in the water balance as studied by wang and zhou 2016 and greve et al 2016 impacts of climate variability and human activities in water imbalance condition can also be decomposed by submitting the differential equation to modified budyko type equation further work will be carried out on assessment of ssy change under specific impacts of spatial and temporal variability of climate the different land use patterns regulation activities of water reservoirs etc referring to these modified budyko type equation the differential equation can be extended to a variety of climatic conditions under which significant water storage changes or additional water besides precipitation is available to evaporation 5 conclusions river sediment discharge as an indispensable part of the river system has been intensively influenced by human activities and climatic variability in recent decades thus it has long been a question of great interest to partition the net human and climate impacts on ssy change however high nonlinearity and great uncertainty give rise to extreme complexity in assessment of ssy change in the newtonian approach currently few approach can be simply and robustly used to decompose impacts of the two aspects on ssy thus this paper is to derive a differential equation to capture the hydrologic system of climatic variability and human activities on ssy change in the darwinian hydrology since that streamflow is the carrier of suspended sediment ssy changes are documented in changes of sediment concentrated flow and c q relationships by deduced corollaries a differential equation of sediment discharge change was derived to explicitly decompose impacts of climate variability and human activities in the darwinian hydrology to solve the differential equation a new form of sediment rating curves was proposed and curved as c q relationships and probability distribution of streamflow river sediment flux can therefore be revealed by such representation of sediment rating curves using long term observed discrete data to solve the differential equation a segmentation algorithm was introduced to decompose ssy changes attributed to changes in c q relationships and streamflow using discrete data the scaling property of the calculated values obtained by the segmentation algorithm was utilized to find value approximating to the theoretical value the differential equation was further submitted to water balance framework expressed by budyko type equation and the expression for the contributions of changes in climatic variability and direct human impacts on river sediment discharge is provided by data simulation the segmentation algorithm was validated to be efficient in obtaining numerical solution to the differential equation contributions of changes in streamflow and c q relationships to ssy change were obtained besides elasticity of ssy to precipitation pet and land use cover change were theoretically derived the analytic equation provides a superior darwinian approach partitioning climatic and human impacts on ssy change as only data series of precipitation potential

7422,rapid groundwater depletion from the northwestern indian aquifer system in the western indo gangetic basin has raised serious concerns over the sustainability of groundwater and the livelihoods that depend on it sustainable management of this aquifer system requires that we understand the sources and rates of groundwater recharge however both these parameters are poorly constrained in this region here we analyse the isotopic δ18o δ2h and tritium compositions of groundwater precipitation river and canal water to identify the recharge sources zones of recharge and groundwater flow in the ghaggar river basin which lies between the himalayan fed yamuna and sutlej river systems in northwestern india our results reveal that local precipitation is the main source of groundwater recharge however depleted δ18o and δ2h signatures at some sites indicate recharge from canal seepage and irrigation return flow the spatial variability of δ18o δ2h d excess and tritium reflects limited lateral connectivity due to the heterogeneous and anisotropic nature of the aquifer system in the study area the variation of tritium concentration with depth suggests that groundwater above c 80 mbgl is generally modern water in contrast water from below c 80 mbgl is a mixture of modern and old waters and indicates longer residence time in comparison to groundwater above c 80 mbgl isotopic signatures of δ18o δ2h and tritium suggest significant vertical recharge down to a depth of 320 mbgl the spatial and vertical variations of isotopic signature of groundwater reveal two distinct flow patterns in the aquifer system i local flow above c 80 mbgl throughout the study area and ii intermediate and regional flow below c 80 mbgl where water recharges aquifers through large scale lateral flow as well as vertical infiltration the understanding of spatial and vertical recharge processes of groundwater in the study area provides important base line knowledge for developing a sustainable groundwater management plan for the northwestern indian aquifer system keywords water isotopes recharge sources recharge zones groundwater flow northwestern indian aquifer 1 introduction groundwater depletion from major alluvial aquifer systems is a global issue e g foster and chilton 2003 wada et al 2012 gleeson et al 2015 the global groundwater extraction rate is 1500 km3 per year doll et al 2012 which is more than the natural groundwater recharge rate increasing water demand for economic development power generation drinking water and agriculture has exacerbated groundwater exploitation leading to the decline of the water table in major alluvial aquifer systems across the world konikow and kendy 2005 aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 large scale groundwater depletion has resulted in land subsidence reduction in the base flow of springs and rivers during dry periods saltwater intrusion water quality degradation and damage to aquatic ecosystems in different parts of the world fishman et al 2011 this problem is becoming more challenging given the increasing demands by development and a growing population along with poorly understood effects of climate driven changes in the water cycle e g aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 these broad issues can be addressed only if we know the sources and areas of groundwater recharge along with the interconnectivity and dynamics of aquifer systems at appropriate regional scales this information however is poorly constrained for many of the world s major alluvial aquifer systems the northwestern indian aquifer system nwia underlies the states of punjab haryana and rajasthan and represents one of the major alluvial aquifer systems of the indo gangetic basin in northern india and pakistan macdonald et al 2016 the region is characterized by multiple semi confined sand rich aquifer bodies that are laterally discontinuous but may be highly interconnected van dijk et al 2016a macdonald et al 2016 this is one of the most agriculturally intensive regions in india where annual food grain production has increased four fold from 50 million tons in 1950 to 203 million tons in 1999 2000 kumar et al 2005 such intensive agricultural activities are mainly attributed to the so called green revolution in india aimed at achieving self reliance in food production this intensive food production has led however to greatly accelerated demand for irrigation water since india s surface water infrastructure was never adequate to meet this requirement the focus shifted to groundwater extraction using large numbers of tube wells the average tube well density in this region is 15 km 2 ambast et al 2006 as a consequence the groundwater level in the nwia is declining at a much higher rate than any other comparably sized aquifer on the earth rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 chen et al 2014 panda and wahr 2015 long et al 2016 satellite borne gravity measurements suggest that groundwater levels declined at 3 1 0 1 cm per year between 2005 and 2010 long et al 2016 and that water was lost at a rate of 54 9 km3 per year between 2002 and 2008 tiwari et al 2009 the average rate of groundwater depletion is 20 4 7 1 gigatonnes per year for 10 years from 2003 to 2012 chen et al 2014 sustainable management of the nw indian aquifer system needs a comprehensive understanding of the sources and rates of groundwater recharge in addition it is also important to know the degree of spatial variability of recharge rates that is imposed by the geological heterogeneity that is inherent within alluvial settings water isotopes are commonly used for determining the sources of groundwater and residence times the isotopes of hydrogen 2h and 3h and oxygen 18o have proved to be particularly useful tools in hydrogeological studies providing valuable insights into water dynamics in a given basin dincer et al 1970 fontes 1980 clark and fritz 1997 hoque and burgess 2012 a few local isotopic studies in punjab and haryana states have focused on the provenance of groundwater using isotopic tracers sources of groundwater salinity kulkarni et al 1996 lorenzen et al 2012 and estimation of recharge rate based on the tritium tagging technique datta et al 1996 rangarajan and athavale 2000 these studies provide a broad understanding of the mechanism of local recharge sources and zones but it is hard to extrapolate these local studies to understand basin scale recharge mechanisms given the heterogeneity of the alluvial aquifer system bowen 1985 sinha et al 2013 van dijk et al 2016a there has been no systematic study of recharge sources zones and groundwater flow e g isotopic fingerprinting or age at an appropriate scale in this important region with the important exception of the studies of lapworth et al 2015 2017 and rao et al 2017 who focused on a region between the beas and sutlej rivers in punjab comparable work across the rest of punjab and haryana has not yet been done to investigate the spatial pattern of groundwater recharge sources in the nwia we focus here on the ghaggar river basin that encompasses parts of the states of punjab haryana and rajasthan in northwestern india we investigate the sources of groundwater recharge using the stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in water coupled with measurements of tritium radioisotopes our specific objectives are 1 isotopic characterization of groundwater and surface waters for the ghaggar river basin 2 identification of the recharge sources and zones and 3 understanding recharge processes and groundwater flow dynamics in the aquifer system that underlies the ghaggar river basin to achieve our objectives we conducted systematic sampling of precipitation surface waters from both rivers and canals and groundwater across the study area fig 1 2 study area the study area for our investigation encompasses a major area of the nwia in the indo gangetic basin focusing on the ghaggar river basin which lies between 29 10 n and 30 54 n and 74 20 e and 77 26 e and covers an area of 22 235 km2 fig 1 the ghaggar river originates in the siwalik foothills of the himalayas at an altitude of 1927 m asl above sea level and flows for 330 km across the study area in the alluvial part of the basin the elevation varies from 350 to 150 m asl the ghaggar is a seasonal river that is set within a large slightly incised paleo valley that is more than 3 km wide bhadra et al 2009 sinha et al 2013 van dijk et al 2016a singh et al 2017 about 90 of the study area is used for intensive agriculture undp 1985 ambast et al 2006 and the main sources of irrigation water supply are precipitation groundwater and surface water from canals water from the sutlej river is diverted through a dense canal network for irrigation in the middle and downstream parts of the basin water demand in this region has greatly increased since 1970 kumar et al 2014 due to a progressive shift towards rice cultivation in the monsoon season july september as a result of this a net annual water deficit of 1 63 million hectare meters for punjab estimated for 2008 kumar et al 2014 has to be met through groundwater abstraction as a consequence there has been a rapid decline in the water table over much of the region over the last four decades rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 chen et al 2014 long et al 2016 macdonald et al 2016 the ghaggar river basin extends across four geomorphic units that coincide with distinct subsurface hydrogeological units the siwalik hills the sutlej and yamuna sediment fans the interfan area and spatially restricted aeolian deposits fig 1 the siwalik hills range in altitude from 400 to 2000 m asl and are made up of sandstone and conglomerate they are separated from sediments of the indo gangetic foreland basin by the himalayan frontal thrust hft the foreland basin fill is dominated by fluvial fans deposited by the sutlej and yamuna rivers and comprising spatially heterogeneous sand silt and clay deposits associated with abandoned avulsive river channel belts undp 1985 saini et al 2009 sinha et al 2013 van dijk et al 2016a singh et al 2017 these fans decrease in surface elevation from about 350 to 150 m asl over a distance of about 300 km van dijk et al 2016a used aquifer thickness logs from the central groundwater board cgwb to show that aquifer bodies within the fans are typically composed of stacked channel deposits of fine to medium sand interspersed both vertically and laterally with non aquifer silt and clay the aquifer bodies have a median thickness of about 6 7 m van dijk et al 2016a these sediments form a multi layer aquifer system lapworth et al 2017 in contrast the interfan area between the sutlej and yamuna fans east of patiala fig 1 is characterized by thinner and less abundant aquifer bodies even at locations that are adjacent to the hft van dijk et al 2016a this geomorphic framework contrasts with the traditional division of the indo gangetic basin into siwalik hills and distal alluvial deposits and reflects an important along strike stratigraphic heterogeneity in the aquifer system the bulk specific yield varies spatially with values of 10 26 in the interfan area near the himalayan foothills and 5 15 in the sutlej and yamuna fans undp 1985 cgwb 2009 2012 the climatic conditions in the ghaggar basin range from subtropical to semi arid with temperatures of 25 48 c in summer and 5 19 c in winter kumar et al 2014 precipitation shows marked spatial variation throughout the study area mean annual rainfall is ranges between 800 1200 mm in the siwalik hills 74 of which is received during july to september mean annual rainfall in the foreland basin is 400 800 mm but decreases to less than 400 mm in the southwestern part of the study area 3 sampling strategy and measurements we designed our sampling strategy to document spatial and vertical variation in the isotopic signature δ18o δ2h and 3h of both source water precipitation canal water and rivers and groundwater across the study area fig 1 water sampling was carried out throughout the study area during june and july 2013 for δ18o and δ2h analysis and october november 2012 june 2013 and april and june 2015 for 3h analysis we collected groundwater samples from 244 locations from monitoring wells of the cgwb and state groundwater departments public tube wells and hand pumps using a grid of about 10 10 km across the study area the wells were purged for 30 45 min depending on the depth of the well before sampling the screening depths in the sampled wells vary from 6 to 365 mbgl it is worth mentioning that screening depths are only recorded for government tube wells and piezometers while depths for public tube wells and hand pumps are based on local information tube wells and hand pumps owner as per the hand pump tube wells owner there is generally some displacement 1 to 3 m during the screen installation so we have assumed an uncertainty of 5 m in the screen depths of such wells the primary recharge sources of groundwater in the study area are meteoric water rivers and irrigation canals canal water is typically abstracted from the river network at or near the himalayan mountain front to establish the isotopic signatures of these different sources canal and river water samples were collected from random locations based on accessibility within the study area also three rain gauge stations were set up in chandigarh patiala and sirsa fig 1 to develop a local meteoric water line for the ghaggar river basin all water samples were collected in pre cleaned polypropylene bottles 20 ml for stable isotopic samples and 500 ml for tritium samples the bottles were rinsed at the site twice with the sample water to further avoid any diffusive and evaporative losses from the samples bottles they were tightly sealed and brought immediately to the laboratory for isotopic analysis samples for δ18o and δ2h were analysed during august october 2013 and those for 3h were analysed during march august september 2013 n 68 and during august september 2015 n 19 sample latitude longitude and altitude were measured using a handheld global positioning system receiver during the sampling additional parameters such as ph temperature and electrical conductivity ec were also measured in the field using handheld ph and ec meters stable isotopic δ2h δ18o and tritium 3h analyses were carried out at the nuclear hydrology laboratory at national institute of hydrology nih roorkee india measurements of δ18o and δ2h were made using continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry and dual inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometry following standard procedures epstein and mayeda 1953 brenninkmeijer and morrison 1987 the results are expressed in concentrations per mil relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow on the δ scale δ r sample r standard 1 1000 vsmow where rsample is the 18o 16o or 2h 1h ratio of the water samples and rstandard is the corresponding ratio for vsmow the overall precision based on ten repeated measurements of each sample was less than 1 0 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ18o we also analysed tritium 3h to place some initial constraints on the age of groundwater samples in the region tritium is ideal for the dating of young groundwater less than 60 years before present because it is incorporated into water molecules and its activity is not affected by chemical or microbial processes or by reactions between the groundwater and aquifer material stewart and morgenstern 2001 electrolytic reduction was used to concentrate tritium in 500 ml of a water sample using a 20 cell standard tritium enrichment unit the temperature of the sample was maintained at 0 to 5 c to achieve maximum tritium fractionation and enrichment after the electrolytic process the sample volume was reduced to 25 ml the tritium activity in enriched samples along with the standards was measured using an ultra low level liquid scintillation counter quantulus wallac model 1220 and results are reported in tritium units tu with 2 sigma errors table s2 4 results 4 1 oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of precipitation surface water and groundwater 4 1 1 precipitation measured δ18o and δ2h values of precipitation from three sampling locations chandigarh patiala and sirsa ranged between 14 8 and 5 8 for δ18o and between 116 3 and 51 5 for δ2h fig 2 s1 the amount weighted annual precipitation awap value of δ18o was 6 5 and of δ2h was 46 8 we checked the effect of altitude variation on isotopic values of precipitation from all three stations and this was found to be negligible remarkably enriched isotopic values were observed for rainfall events of less than 20 mm per day particularly from the rain gauge station at sirsa in the downstream part of the basin where the climate is semi arid a cross plot of δ18o and δ2h based on the monthly weighted isotopic composition of precipitation from all three sites was used to develop a local meteoric water line lmwl for the study area fig 2 this provides information on the preservation or alteration of the stable isotopic composition of groundwater and various other water sources the lmwl derived for our study area along with other lmwls for the delhi region and the global meteoric water line gmwl are as follows 1 δ 2 h 7 9 δ 18 o 5 56 r 2 0 98 study area 2 δ 2 h 7 15 δ 18 o 2 60 r 2 0 98 delhi lmwl 3 δ 2 h 8 14 0 02 δ 18 o 10 9 0 2 r 2 0 98 gourcy et al 2005 the slope of our lmwl eq 1 is close to that of the gmwl eq 3 defined by gourcy et al 2005 and the lmwl from delhi pang et al 2004 eq 2 4 1 2 river and canal waters the isotopic values of the ghaggar river samples n 10 varied from 7 5 to 6 7 for δ18o and 54 9 and 43 8 for δ2h the δ18o and δ2h values of river water samples fall on the lmwl and in close proximity to the awap indicating that modern local precipitation is the primary source of ghaggar river water fig 3 a in contrast sutlej river water ranges from 12 6 to 10 5 for δ18o and 87 8 to 70 9 for δ2h the δ18o of canal water n 20 varies from 12 0 to 10 6 while δ2h ranges from 81 3 to 70 3 fig 3a table s1 the relative isotopic depletion of canal water compared to the ghaggar river water and awap reflects the higher himalayan source of canal water that is derived from the sutlej river 4 1 3 groundwater the isotopic values of groundwater samples n 244 varied between 11 6 and 4 7 for δ18o and 81 4 and 34 5 for δ2h fig 3a b table s2 a cross plot of δ18o and δ2h of the groundwater samples is used to develop a groundwater regression line for the study area fig 3a table s2 4 δ 2 h 6 10 δ 18 o 7 00 r 2 0 95 the clustering of a large number of groundwater samples around the lmwl indicates that local modern meteoric water is a significant source of groundwater recharge in the study area however a cluster of groundwater samples also falls below the gmwl the slope and intercept of the groundwater regression line eq 4 are less than those of the lmwl eq 1 indicating the important effect of evaporative enrichment on groundwater wassenaar et al 2011 importantly we observe systematic variations in δ18o values of groundwater with relation to the depth from which the groundwater was sampled fig 4 groundwater samples taken from depths in general above 80 mbgl show a broad range of δ18o values between 11 6 and 4 7 and consistently lie very close to the awap and canal water samples fig 5 c these samples also show significant spatial variability in δ18o values fig 5a in contrast samples from depths in general below 80 mbgl show a narrower range of values and located closely to the awap varying between 8 2 and 4 8 for δ18o and between 58 2 and 35 0 for δ2h figs 4 5b d we define the regression lines for groundwater samples taken from both above and below 80 mbgl fig 3a b as follows 5 δ 2 h 6 10 δ 18 o 7 14 r 2 0 95 groundwater samples above 80 mbgl 6 δ 2 h 5 86 δ 18 o 8 4 r 2 0 97 groundwater samples below 80 mbgl both regression lines eqs 5 6 have a lower slope than the gmwl and a negative intercept suggesting evaporative enrichment of the groundwater 4 2 deuterium excess the deuterium excess d excess was defined as d δ2h 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 and quantifies the surplus deuterium about craig s line craig 1961 the deuterium excess depends on conditions prevalent during primary evaporation including variation in humidity ocean surface temperature and wind speed and thus gives information on the sources of water vapour gat 1983 clark and fritz 1997 while equilibrium processes do not change the d excess for any of the phases non equilibrium evaporation causes a decrease in the d excess which indicates an increase in the vapour phase most groundwater samples have d excess values close to that of precipitation and a few samples are similar to the d excess value of canal water fig 6 the d excess values of groundwater samples derived from depths in general above 80 mbgl are spatially variable and vary from 4 1 to 14 9 fig 8a which depends upon the mixture of canal recharge or precipitation and groundwater irrigation return flow in contrast samples below 80 mbgl have d excess values in the range of 0 8 to 11 3 and most samples have values very close to that of precipitation fig 6 the negative and very low d excess values of a few groundwater samples derived from below 80 m depth mainly correspond to the downstream part of the study area 4 3 tritium concentrations tritium concentration was measured for 91 samples of river canal and groundwater in the study area fig 7 a table s3 and 22 samples of precipitation for roorkee in north india table s4 the average tritium concentrations of precipitation and canal water samples were 8 2 0 3 and 9 0 0 3 tu respectively the tritium concentration in groundwater varies between 0 1 tu minimum and 12 9 0 5 tu maximum these values vary both vertically i e with depth and spatially i e with distance from the himalayan mountain front fig 7b c tritium concentration shows a clear decline with depth fig 7b although groundwater samples taken generally above 80 mbgl show a much broader range of values from 0 3 0 2 up to 12 9 0 5 tu than samples from below that depth fig 7b c spatially tritium concentrations vary from 1 3 0 2 to 8 4 0 4 tu particularly in the area within 80 km of the himalayan front fig 7c in the middle and downstream regions of the study area between 80 km and 320 km downstream of the himalayan front fig 7c tu values for samples from generally above 80 mbgl lie between 0 3 0 2 to 10 2 0 5 in contrast tube well samples from generally below 80 mbgl show lower tu values typically less than 4 4 0 2 we observe three downstream patterns of tu value variation for those deeper samples fig 7a c 1 in the area within 80 km of the himalayan front the majority of samples have tu values less than 1 2 0 1 tu 2 in the middle area between 80 to 200 km downstream tu values vary from 0 1 to 4 4 0 2 tu and 3 beyond 200 km downstream tu values are less than 1 9 0 2 tu except for 3 measurements thus the deeper samples generally show downstream tu variation compared to groundwater samples derived from in general above 80 mbgl 4 4 estimation of canal water contribution to groundwater recharge the stable isotopic composition of groundwater samples from generally above 80 mbgl in a number of tube wells especially in the middle and downstream parts of the basin indicate important recharge from highly depleted canal water we have quantified the proportion of this recharge using a two component separation approach clark and fritz 1979 rai et al 2009 engelhardt et al 2014 for this we assume that the isotopic composition of groundwater samples is derived by mixing of two end member components namely awap average δ18o value of 6 5 and canal water 11 6 the volumetric ratio of canal recharge to total recharge p is then given by 7 p δ 18 o gw δ 18 o precip δ 18 o canal δ 18 o precip where δ18ogw is the value of groundwater δ18oprecip is the value of precipitation awap and δ18ocanal is the average value of canal water the canal water contribution to groundwater recharge is spatially variable across the study area fig 8b most tube wells with depths of up to 80 mbgl in the downstream part of the basin have an estimated canal recharge component of more than 50 of total recharge whereas this value is quite variable 25 to 50 in the middle part of the basin 5 discussion 5 1 spatial variation in isotopic characteristics of groundwater our analysis of isotopic characteristic of groundwater in the ghaggar basin shows that δ18o and δ2h of groundwaters vary in space as well as depth to understand the relationship between isotopic and aquifer characteristics we have plotted aquifer thickness logs from the basin margin in himalayan front to the distal part of the basin along cross section a b along with d excess and isotopic composition δ18o and δ2h of groundwaters fig 9 a e the δ18o values of groundwater samples range from 5 2 to 7 7 and from 1 2 to 8 4 tu for tritium concentration generally above 80 mbgl in the upstream parts from the basin margin up to 80 km downstream fig 7c 9d these values clearly reflect that precipitation is the main recharge source however in the middle and downstream parts of the basin 80 to 320 km downstream of the basin margin the δ18o value and tritium concentration of groundwater samples generally above 80 mbgl are much more variable than those from the generally below 80 mbgl this could reflect multiple recharge sources such as irrigation return flow canal water leakage and precipitation in this part of the basin the cross plot of d excess vs δ18o for the groundwater samples shows an inverse correlation fig 6 the positive d excess 10 of the groundwater samples generally above 80 mbgl is consistent with source water derived from the higher himalayas pande et al 2000 rai et al 2014 and provides additional evidence of recharge from sutlej river water that has been redistributed through the canal network a few samples have lower d excess values which suggests evaporative enrichment of groundwater during the recharge process the d excess values of groundwater samples that lie between canal water and awap values suggest mixing of groundwater from different sources these d excess results are broadly consistent with our δ18o and δ2h measurements low d excess values in downstream part between 280 and 320 km from the northern basin margin suggest a significant evaporative enrichment of recharged groundwater fig 9c this is likely due to the prevailing semi arid climate in a southwest part of the study area and slow rate of recharge 56 mm yr for punjab and 70 mm yr for haryana rangarajan and athavale 2000 towards the distal part of the basin the thickness of non aquifer material in the subsurface increases van dijk et al 2016a the spatial variation of δ18o and δ2h with distance suggests that in situ vertical recharge at a variable rate takes place throughout the study area this is obvious on account of the variable water table supplementary fig s2 and heterogeneity in the subsurface in nwia system fig 9a the isotopic data is in conformity with the observed geological heterogeneity of the nwia system and the decrease in bulk aquifer body percentage from proximal to distal parts of the basin which results in limited lateral connectivity of aquifer bodies van dijk et al 2016a b 5 2 vertical variability of δ18o and tritium groundwater δ18o values fall within a narrow range near the awap for samples generally below 80 mbgl fig 4 this is likely due to the attenuation of δ18o and δ2h values with depth as water from different sources moves downward and attains the isotopic signature close to the awap generally below 80 mbgl fig 4 similarly a decrease in tritium concentration is observed with depth fig 7b the comparatively low tritium concentrations below 80 mbgl indicate relatively large travel time in the groundwater flow system resulting in loss of tritium by radioactive decay as mentioned earlier precipitation is the main recharge source and therefore we compare our results with tritium concentration of precipitation for the northwest india the eight precipitation samples measured here yielded values of 3 to 17 tu kumar et al 2010 reported tritium concentrations of 6 6 to 17 6 tu for northwestern india while tritium concentrations in precipitation measured during 2004 to 2010 at roorkee in north india varies between 2 6 and 15 5 tu table s4 we therefore consider tritium concentrations of groundwater of 2 to 12 9 0 5 tu as indicating recharge from modern water however tritium concentrations below 1 tu indicates groundwater that is likely older than 50 yrs liu et al 2014 the presence of a mixture of modern and old water below 80 mbgl indicates that significant recharge from modern sources reaches down to tube well depth i e 320 mbgl except in a few locations this in turn suggests that there is significant vertical leakage through the thick but discontinuous non aquifer layers within the sedimentary sequence van dijk et al 2016a and that these layers do not provide a barrier to vertical recharge of groundwater bowen 1985 toth 2009 sinha et al 2013 van dijk et al 2016a hoque et al 2017 fig 9b an attempt was also made to corroborate our results with hydraulic calculations using the velocity figures for sandy aquifers from soni et al 2014 and shekhar et al 2015 and our results are satisfactory even at such large scale of aquifer system similar results have been reported by lapworth et al 2015 from the beas sutlej region of punjab using anthropogenic tracers 5 3 spatial variability in groundwater recharge sources and zones the spatial variation of δ18o values tritium concentrations and d excess of groundwater samples generally above 80 mbgl and the canal contribution to groundwater recharge fig 5a b fig 7a fig 8a b reveal spatially variable recharge processes in the study area this leads us to identify four distinct groundwater recharge zones fig 8a zone i represents the upstream area of the basin where the d excess ranges from 6 to 11 fig 8a a cross plot of δ18o vs δ2h shows that all groundwater samples generally above 80 mbgl fall on the lmwl and are very close to awap fig 8c suggesting recharge predominantly through local precipitation tritium concentrations in groundwater samples generally above 80 mbgl in this zone are up to 12 9 0 5 tu this indicates that the groundwater is of modern age and derived from local meteoric precipitation previous work interpreted zone i as characterized by high permeability and high hydraulic conductivity van dijk et al 2016a our work however has shown that this zone is recharged by local precipitation based on the inferred groundwater recharge sources and flow paths therefore the implication of our work is that recharge rates in this zone would be high although we do not provide any quantification at this stage zone ii represents an area where the d excess ranges from 1 to 5 fig 8a and groundwater samples fall on or below lmwl in the cross plot of δ18o vs δ2h and very close to awap fig 8d the primary source of recharge is local precipitation however a number of samples fall between the isotopic values of canal water and awap indicating recharge through a mixture of canal water and local precipitation the enriched isotopic composition and low d excess of groundwater samples reflect fractionation during recharge through rainfall or irrigation return flow tritium concentrations of groundwater samples range from 2 to 10 tu indicate modern recharge at depths generally above 80 mbgl the canal contribution to groundwater in a number of locations estimated by using two component analysis ranges from 0 to 50 in zone ii fig 8b this zone is characterized by a high tube well density and rapid decline in groundwater levels due to overexploitation of groundwater resources therefore induced recharge to groundwater through irrigation return flow might be one explanation for evaporative enrichment of isotopic signatures of groundwater zone iii represents the area where the d excess ranges from 8 to 15 fig 8a and where δ18o and δ2h of the groundwater fall mostly above the lmwl and very close to the isotopic composition of canal water relatively more depleted values of δ18o are observed in this zone compared with zones i and ii which we interpret as evidence of active recharge by canal water tritium values are also higher than those in zone ii because of the significant contribution of the canal to groundwater the canal contribution to groundwater recharge ranges up to 100 fig 8b zone iv represents the distal end of the study area where d excess value ranges from 2 to 4 and δ18o and δ2h values fall below the lmwl but close to awap fig 8f the δ18o and δ2h values of groundwater samples more enriched than the awap are evidence of recharge by local precipitation modified by evaporative fractionation this zone is characterized by semi arid conditions here water gets fractionated during the recharge process and bears enriched values of δ18o and δ2h and low d excess the canal contribution to groundwater at a number of locations is less than 50 fig 8b this is consistent with slow recharge rates in this zone rangarajan and athavale 2000 5 4 conceptual model of the hydrological processes controlling isotopic signatures of groundwater it has already been established that the hydrological processes operating in the basin have subtle differences as we move downstream traced downstream the variability in the recharge processes including the source and rate of recharge appears to correlate with both the complex and spatially variable subsurface sedimentary architecture van dijk et al 2016a and with anthropogenic forcing such as the canal network we use this information to develop a conceptual model for the hydrological processes operating in the ghaggar basin fig 10 the boundary conditions for the conceptual model are a geomorphic setting b the spatial variability of δ18o and δ2h c the spatial variation of tritium concentration in groundwater d longitudinal cross sections based on aquifer thickness logs and e groundwater flow directions derived from water table the available aquifer thickness data indicate that the aquifer system is composed of stacked laterally discontinuous high permeability aquifer bodies separated both laterally and vertically by low permeability non aquifer material fig 9a this interleaved pattern of occurrence coupled with the basin surface topography imposes and maintains a hierarchy of groundwater flow systems from shallow to deep hoque et al 2017 the flow systems can be referred as local if recharge and discharge areas are contiguous intermediate if these regions are separated by one or more local systems and regional if they extend over the full extent of the basin toth 2009 our depth wise isotopic data suggest that local flow patterns in the ghaggar basin extend down to a depth of c 80 m and are dominated by local vertical recharge from meteoric and canal sources while intermediate and regional flow patterns extend to deeper depths and show evidence for sustained lateral flow fig 10 a similar flow pattern has been proposed for the bengal basin by ravenscroft et al 2005 and toth 2009 showed similar hierarchically nested groundwater flow systems within the exploited depth of the aquifer the observed vertical variations in isotopic signature of the groundwater are thus likely due to tortuous groundwater flow paths surface topography and subsurface lithological variations impose hydraulic heterogeneity and anisotropy which controls the flow patterns and depth of groundwater penetration zijl 1999 this conceptual model helps to explain the major lateral and vertical variations in groundwater δ18o δ2h and tritium concentrations which we interpret as due to the heterogeneous distribution of aquifer and non aquifer sediments in the subsurface for example the tritium results show comparatively higher residence time for groundwater from generally below 80 mbgl compared to the groundwater above 80 mbgl this indicates the existence of longer flow paths for groundwater below 80 mbgl which is likely controlled by the aquifer heterogeneity and anisotropy furthermore as illustrated in the schematic model in fig 10 water recharged in zones i and ii must travel deeper to account for the regional groundwater flow system the groundwater velocity through sand rich aquifer bodies like those in the ghaggar basin are typically 1 to 2 m day soni et al 2014 shekhar et al 2015 furthermore the model fig 10 suggests the hydrological process of mixing of this old groundwater in zone iii with vertically recharged groundwater from sources like rainfall and return flow of canal and groundwater irrigation 6 conclusions this study is the first systematic attempt to identify the recharge sources and zones and to characterise groundwater dynamics in the northwestern indian aquifer in punjab and haryana using water isotopes δ18o δ2h and 3h our results reveal that recharge sources for groundwater in the region are local meteoric water canal seepage and both canal and groundwater derived irrigation return flow these recharge sources vary spatially in their importance the influence of canal water to recharge is most apparent in the zone ii to iv in the study area the spatial variability in δ18o δ2h value and tritium concentration reflects limited lateral connectivity of the aquifer due to the heterogeneity of aquifer material however the variation of δ18o with depth shows the effect of averaging of the isotopic composition of different groundwater sources at various depths variability in tritium concentrations with depth reveals that groundwater generally above 80 mbgl is of modern age however groundwater generally below 80 mbgl is a mixture of modern and old water the spatial distribution of aquifer and non aquifer material in the subsurface likely forces some recharge water to follow longer deeper and more tortuous flow paths resulting in low tritium values two kinds of flow patterns are observed in the northwest indian aquifer system i a local flow pattern down to a general depth of c 80 mbgl and ii an intermediate and regional groundwater flow pattern in aquifer system generally below 80 mbgl recharged with water from lateral groundwater flow and vertical infiltration results

7422,rapid groundwater depletion from the northwestern indian aquifer system in the western indo gangetic basin has raised serious concerns over the sustainability of groundwater and the livelihoods that depend on it sustainable management of this aquifer system requires that we understand the sources and rates of groundwater recharge however both these parameters are poorly constrained in this region here we analyse the isotopic δ18o δ2h and tritium compositions of groundwater precipitation river and canal water to identify the recharge sources zones of recharge and groundwater flow in the ghaggar river basin which lies between the himalayan fed yamuna and sutlej river systems in northwestern india our results reveal that local precipitation is the main source of groundwater recharge however depleted δ18o and δ2h signatures at some sites indicate recharge from canal seepage and irrigation return flow the spatial variability of δ18o δ2h d excess and tritium reflects limited lateral connectivity due to the heterogeneous and anisotropic nature of the aquifer system in the study area the variation of tritium concentration with depth suggests that groundwater above c 80 mbgl is generally modern water in contrast water from below c 80 mbgl is a mixture of modern and old waters and indicates longer residence time in comparison to groundwater above c 80 mbgl isotopic signatures of δ18o δ2h and tritium suggest significant vertical recharge down to a depth of 320 mbgl the spatial and vertical variations of isotopic signature of groundwater reveal two distinct flow patterns in the aquifer system i local flow above c 80 mbgl throughout the study area and ii intermediate and regional flow below c 80 mbgl where water recharges aquifers through large scale lateral flow as well as vertical infiltration the understanding of spatial and vertical recharge processes of groundwater in the study area provides important base line knowledge for developing a sustainable groundwater management plan for the northwestern indian aquifer system keywords water isotopes recharge sources recharge zones groundwater flow northwestern indian aquifer 1 introduction groundwater depletion from major alluvial aquifer systems is a global issue e g foster and chilton 2003 wada et al 2012 gleeson et al 2015 the global groundwater extraction rate is 1500 km3 per year doll et al 2012 which is more than the natural groundwater recharge rate increasing water demand for economic development power generation drinking water and agriculture has exacerbated groundwater exploitation leading to the decline of the water table in major alluvial aquifer systems across the world konikow and kendy 2005 aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 large scale groundwater depletion has resulted in land subsidence reduction in the base flow of springs and rivers during dry periods saltwater intrusion water quality degradation and damage to aquatic ecosystems in different parts of the world fishman et al 2011 this problem is becoming more challenging given the increasing demands by development and a growing population along with poorly understood effects of climate driven changes in the water cycle e g aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 these broad issues can be addressed only if we know the sources and areas of groundwater recharge along with the interconnectivity and dynamics of aquifer systems at appropriate regional scales this information however is poorly constrained for many of the world s major alluvial aquifer systems the northwestern indian aquifer system nwia underlies the states of punjab haryana and rajasthan and represents one of the major alluvial aquifer systems of the indo gangetic basin in northern india and pakistan macdonald et al 2016 the region is characterized by multiple semi confined sand rich aquifer bodies that are laterally discontinuous but may be highly interconnected van dijk et al 2016a macdonald et al 2016 this is one of the most agriculturally intensive regions in india where annual food grain production has increased four fold from 50 million tons in 1950 to 203 million tons in 1999 2000 kumar et al 2005 such intensive agricultural activities are mainly attributed to the so called green revolution in india aimed at achieving self reliance in food production this intensive food production has led however to greatly accelerated demand for irrigation water since india s surface water infrastructure was never adequate to meet this requirement the focus shifted to groundwater extraction using large numbers of tube wells the average tube well density in this region is 15 km 2 ambast et al 2006 as a consequence the groundwater level in the nwia is declining at a much higher rate than any other comparably sized aquifer on the earth rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 chen et al 2014 panda and wahr 2015 long et al 2016 satellite borne gravity measurements suggest that groundwater levels declined at 3 1 0 1 cm per year between 2005 and 2010 long et al 2016 and that water was lost at a rate of 54 9 km3 per year between 2002 and 2008 tiwari et al 2009 the average rate of groundwater depletion is 20 4 7 1 gigatonnes per year for 10 years from 2003 to 2012 chen et al 2014 sustainable management of the nw indian aquifer system needs a comprehensive understanding of the sources and rates of groundwater recharge in addition it is also important to know the degree of spatial variability of recharge rates that is imposed by the geological heterogeneity that is inherent within alluvial settings water isotopes are commonly used for determining the sources of groundwater and residence times the isotopes of hydrogen 2h and 3h and oxygen 18o have proved to be particularly useful tools in hydrogeological studies providing valuable insights into water dynamics in a given basin dincer et al 1970 fontes 1980 clark and fritz 1997 hoque and burgess 2012 a few local isotopic studies in punjab and haryana states have focused on the provenance of groundwater using isotopic tracers sources of groundwater salinity kulkarni et al 1996 lorenzen et al 2012 and estimation of recharge rate based on the tritium tagging technique datta et al 1996 rangarajan and athavale 2000 these studies provide a broad understanding of the mechanism of local recharge sources and zones but it is hard to extrapolate these local studies to understand basin scale recharge mechanisms given the heterogeneity of the alluvial aquifer system bowen 1985 sinha et al 2013 van dijk et al 2016a there has been no systematic study of recharge sources zones and groundwater flow e g isotopic fingerprinting or age at an appropriate scale in this important region with the important exception of the studies of lapworth et al 2015 2017 and rao et al 2017 who focused on a region between the beas and sutlej rivers in punjab comparable work across the rest of punjab and haryana has not yet been done to investigate the spatial pattern of groundwater recharge sources in the nwia we focus here on the ghaggar river basin that encompasses parts of the states of punjab haryana and rajasthan in northwestern india we investigate the sources of groundwater recharge using the stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in water coupled with measurements of tritium radioisotopes our specific objectives are 1 isotopic characterization of groundwater and surface waters for the ghaggar river basin 2 identification of the recharge sources and zones and 3 understanding recharge processes and groundwater flow dynamics in the aquifer system that underlies the ghaggar river basin to achieve our objectives we conducted systematic sampling of precipitation surface waters from both rivers and canals and groundwater across the study area fig 1 2 study area the study area for our investigation encompasses a major area of the nwia in the indo gangetic basin focusing on the ghaggar river basin which lies between 29 10 n and 30 54 n and 74 20 e and 77 26 e and covers an area of 22 235 km2 fig 1 the ghaggar river originates in the siwalik foothills of the himalayas at an altitude of 1927 m asl above sea level and flows for 330 km across the study area in the alluvial part of the basin the elevation varies from 350 to 150 m asl the ghaggar is a seasonal river that is set within a large slightly incised paleo valley that is more than 3 km wide bhadra et al 2009 sinha et al 2013 van dijk et al 2016a singh et al 2017 about 90 of the study area is used for intensive agriculture undp 1985 ambast et al 2006 and the main sources of irrigation water supply are precipitation groundwater and surface water from canals water from the sutlej river is diverted through a dense canal network for irrigation in the middle and downstream parts of the basin water demand in this region has greatly increased since 1970 kumar et al 2014 due to a progressive shift towards rice cultivation in the monsoon season july september as a result of this a net annual water deficit of 1 63 million hectare meters for punjab estimated for 2008 kumar et al 2014 has to be met through groundwater abstraction as a consequence there has been a rapid decline in the water table over much of the region over the last four decades rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 chen et al 2014 long et al 2016 macdonald et al 2016 the ghaggar river basin extends across four geomorphic units that coincide with distinct subsurface hydrogeological units the siwalik hills the sutlej and yamuna sediment fans the interfan area and spatially restricted aeolian deposits fig 1 the siwalik hills range in altitude from 400 to 2000 m asl and are made up of sandstone and conglomerate they are separated from sediments of the indo gangetic foreland basin by the himalayan frontal thrust hft the foreland basin fill is dominated by fluvial fans deposited by the sutlej and yamuna rivers and comprising spatially heterogeneous sand silt and clay deposits associated with abandoned avulsive river channel belts undp 1985 saini et al 2009 sinha et al 2013 van dijk et al 2016a singh et al 2017 these fans decrease in surface elevation from about 350 to 150 m asl over a distance of about 300 km van dijk et al 2016a used aquifer thickness logs from the central groundwater board cgwb to show that aquifer bodies within the fans are typically composed of stacked channel deposits of fine to medium sand interspersed both vertically and laterally with non aquifer silt and clay the aquifer bodies have a median thickness of about 6 7 m van dijk et al 2016a these sediments form a multi layer aquifer system lapworth et al 2017 in contrast the interfan area between the sutlej and yamuna fans east of patiala fig 1 is characterized by thinner and less abundant aquifer bodies even at locations that are adjacent to the hft van dijk et al 2016a this geomorphic framework contrasts with the traditional division of the indo gangetic basin into siwalik hills and distal alluvial deposits and reflects an important along strike stratigraphic heterogeneity in the aquifer system the bulk specific yield varies spatially with values of 10 26 in the interfan area near the himalayan foothills and 5 15 in the sutlej and yamuna fans undp 1985 cgwb 2009 2012 the climatic conditions in the ghaggar basin range from subtropical to semi arid with temperatures of 25 48 c in summer and 5 19 c in winter kumar et al 2014 precipitation shows marked spatial variation throughout the study area mean annual rainfall is ranges between 800 1200 mm in the siwalik hills 74 of which is received during july to september mean annual rainfall in the foreland basin is 400 800 mm but decreases to less than 400 mm in the southwestern part of the study area 3 sampling strategy and measurements we designed our sampling strategy to document spatial and vertical variation in the isotopic signature δ18o δ2h and 3h of both source water precipitation canal water and rivers and groundwater across the study area fig 1 water sampling was carried out throughout the study area during june and july 2013 for δ18o and δ2h analysis and october november 2012 june 2013 and april and june 2015 for 3h analysis we collected groundwater samples from 244 locations from monitoring wells of the cgwb and state groundwater departments public tube wells and hand pumps using a grid of about 10 10 km across the study area the wells were purged for 30 45 min depending on the depth of the well before sampling the screening depths in the sampled wells vary from 6 to 365 mbgl it is worth mentioning that screening depths are only recorded for government tube wells and piezometers while depths for public tube wells and hand pumps are based on local information tube wells and hand pumps owner as per the hand pump tube wells owner there is generally some displacement 1 to 3 m during the screen installation so we have assumed an uncertainty of 5 m in the screen depths of such wells the primary recharge sources of groundwater in the study area are meteoric water rivers and irrigation canals canal water is typically abstracted from the river network at or near the himalayan mountain front to establish the isotopic signatures of these different sources canal and river water samples were collected from random locations based on accessibility within the study area also three rain gauge stations were set up in chandigarh patiala and sirsa fig 1 to develop a local meteoric water line for the ghaggar river basin all water samples were collected in pre cleaned polypropylene bottles 20 ml for stable isotopic samples and 500 ml for tritium samples the bottles were rinsed at the site twice with the sample water to further avoid any diffusive and evaporative losses from the samples bottles they were tightly sealed and brought immediately to the laboratory for isotopic analysis samples for δ18o and δ2h were analysed during august october 2013 and those for 3h were analysed during march august september 2013 n 68 and during august september 2015 n 19 sample latitude longitude and altitude were measured using a handheld global positioning system receiver during the sampling additional parameters such as ph temperature and electrical conductivity ec were also measured in the field using handheld ph and ec meters stable isotopic δ2h δ18o and tritium 3h analyses were carried out at the nuclear hydrology laboratory at national institute of hydrology nih roorkee india measurements of δ18o and δ2h were made using continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry and dual inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometry following standard procedures epstein and mayeda 1953 brenninkmeijer and morrison 1987 the results are expressed in concentrations per mil relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow on the δ scale δ r sample r standard 1 1000 vsmow where rsample is the 18o 16o or 2h 1h ratio of the water samples and rstandard is the corresponding ratio for vsmow the overall precision based on ten repeated measurements of each sample was less than 1 0 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ18o we also analysed tritium 3h to place some initial constraints on the age of groundwater samples in the region tritium is ideal for the dating of young groundwater less than 60 years before present because it is incorporated into water molecules and its activity is not affected by chemical or microbial processes or by reactions between the groundwater and aquifer material stewart and morgenstern 2001 electrolytic reduction was used to concentrate tritium in 500 ml of a water sample using a 20 cell standard tritium enrichment unit the temperature of the sample was maintained at 0 to 5 c to achieve maximum tritium fractionation and enrichment after the electrolytic process the sample volume was reduced to 25 ml the tritium activity in enriched samples along with the standards was measured using an ultra low level liquid scintillation counter quantulus wallac model 1220 and results are reported in tritium units tu with 2 sigma errors table s2 4 results 4 1 oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of precipitation surface water and groundwater 4 1 1 precipitation measured δ18o and δ2h values of precipitation from three sampling locations chandigarh patiala and sirsa ranged between 14 8 and 5 8 for δ18o and between 116 3 and 51 5 for δ2h fig 2 s1 the amount weighted annual precipitation awap value of δ18o was 6 5 and of δ2h was 46 8 we checked the effect of altitude variation on isotopic values of precipitation from all three stations and this was found to be negligible remarkably enriched isotopic values were observed for rainfall events of less than 20 mm per day particularly from the rain gauge station at sirsa in the downstream part of the basin where the climate is semi arid a cross plot of δ18o and δ2h based on the monthly weighted isotopic composition of precipitation from all three sites was used to develop a local meteoric water line lmwl for the study area fig 2 this provides information on the preservation or alteration of the stable isotopic composition of groundwater and various other water sources the lmwl derived for our study area along with other lmwls for the delhi region and the global meteoric water line gmwl are as follows 1 δ 2 h 7 9 δ 18 o 5 56 r 2 0 98 study area 2 δ 2 h 7 15 δ 18 o 2 60 r 2 0 98 delhi lmwl 3 δ 2 h 8 14 0 02 δ 18 o 10 9 0 2 r 2 0 98 gourcy et al 2005 the slope of our lmwl eq 1 is close to that of the gmwl eq 3 defined by gourcy et al 2005 and the lmwl from delhi pang et al 2004 eq 2 4 1 2 river and canal waters the isotopic values of the ghaggar river samples n 10 varied from 7 5 to 6 7 for δ18o and 54 9 and 43 8 for δ2h the δ18o and δ2h values of river water samples fall on the lmwl and in close proximity to the awap indicating that modern local precipitation is the primary source of ghaggar river water fig 3 a in contrast sutlej river water ranges from 12 6 to 10 5 for δ18o and 87 8 to 70 9 for δ2h the δ18o of canal water n 20 varies from 12 0 to 10 6 while δ2h ranges from 81 3 to 70 3 fig 3a table s1 the relative isotopic depletion of canal water compared to the ghaggar river water and awap reflects the higher himalayan source of canal water that is derived from the sutlej river 4 1 3 groundwater the isotopic values of groundwater samples n 244 varied between 11 6 and 4 7 for δ18o and 81 4 and 34 5 for δ2h fig 3a b table s2 a cross plot of δ18o and δ2h of the groundwater samples is used to develop a groundwater regression line for the study area fig 3a table s2 4 δ 2 h 6 10 δ 18 o 7 00 r 2 0 95 the clustering of a large number of groundwater samples around the lmwl indicates that local modern meteoric water is a significant source of groundwater recharge in the study area however a cluster of groundwater samples also falls below the gmwl the slope and intercept of the groundwater regression line eq 4 are less than those of the lmwl eq 1 indicating the important effect of evaporative enrichment on groundwater wassenaar et al 2011 importantly we observe systematic variations in δ18o values of groundwater with relation to the depth from which the groundwater was sampled fig 4 groundwater samples taken from depths in general above 80 mbgl show a broad range of δ18o values between 11 6 and 4 7 and consistently lie very close to the awap and canal water samples fig 5 c these samples also show significant spatial variability in δ18o values fig 5a in contrast samples from depths in general below 80 mbgl show a narrower range of values and located closely to the awap varying between 8 2 and 4 8 for δ18o and between 58 2 and 35 0 for δ2h figs 4 5b d we define the regression lines for groundwater samples taken from both above and below 80 mbgl fig 3a b as follows 5 δ 2 h 6 10 δ 18 o 7 14 r 2 0 95 groundwater samples above 80 mbgl 6 δ 2 h 5 86 δ 18 o 8 4 r 2 0 97 groundwater samples below 80 mbgl both regression lines eqs 5 6 have a lower slope than the gmwl and a negative intercept suggesting evaporative enrichment of the groundwater 4 2 deuterium excess the deuterium excess d excess was defined as d δ2h 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 and quantifies the surplus deuterium about craig s line craig 1961 the deuterium excess depends on conditions prevalent during primary evaporation including variation in humidity ocean surface temperature and wind speed and thus gives information on the sources of water vapour gat 1983 clark and fritz 1997 while equilibrium processes do not change the d excess for any of the phases non equilibrium evaporation causes a decrease in the d excess which indicates an increase in the vapour phase most groundwater samples have d excess values close to that of precipitation and a few samples are similar to the d excess value of canal water fig 6 the d excess values of groundwater samples derived from depths in general above 80 mbgl are spatially variable and vary from 4 1 to 14 9 fig 8a which depends upon the mixture of canal recharge or precipitation and groundwater irrigation return flow in contrast samples below 80 mbgl have d excess values in the range of 0 8 to 11 3 and most samples have values very close to that of precipitation fig 6 the negative and very low d excess values of a few groundwater samples derived from below 80 m depth mainly correspond to the downstream part of the study area 4 3 tritium concentrations tritium concentration was measured for 91 samples of river canal and groundwater in the study area fig 7 a table s3 and 22 samples of precipitation for roorkee in north india table s4 the average tritium concentrations of precipitation and canal water samples were 8 2 0 3 and 9 0 0 3 tu respectively the tritium concentration in groundwater varies between 0 1 tu minimum and 12 9 0 5 tu maximum these values vary both vertically i e with depth and spatially i e with distance from the himalayan mountain front fig 7b c tritium concentration shows a clear decline with depth fig 7b although groundwater samples taken generally above 80 mbgl show a much broader range of values from 0 3 0 2 up to 12 9 0 5 tu than samples from below that depth fig 7b c spatially tritium concentrations vary from 1 3 0 2 to 8 4 0 4 tu particularly in the area within 80 km of the himalayan front fig 7c in the middle and downstream regions of the study area between 80 km and 320 km downstream of the himalayan front fig 7c tu values for samples from generally above 80 mbgl lie between 0 3 0 2 to 10 2 0 5 in contrast tube well samples from generally below 80 mbgl show lower tu values typically less than 4 4 0 2 we observe three downstream patterns of tu value variation for those deeper samples fig 7a c 1 in the area within 80 km of the himalayan front the majority of samples have tu values less than 1 2 0 1 tu 2 in the middle area between 80 to 200 km downstream tu values vary from 0 1 to 4 4 0 2 tu and 3 beyond 200 km downstream tu values are less than 1 9 0 2 tu except for 3 measurements thus the deeper samples generally show downstream tu variation compared to groundwater samples derived from in general above 80 mbgl 4 4 estimation of canal water contribution to groundwater recharge the stable isotopic composition of groundwater samples from generally above 80 mbgl in a number of tube wells especially in the middle and downstream parts of the basin indicate important recharge from highly depleted canal water we have quantified the proportion of this recharge using a two component separation approach clark and fritz 1979 rai et al 2009 engelhardt et al 2014 for this we assume that the isotopic composition of groundwater samples is derived by mixing of two end member components namely awap average δ18o value of 6 5 and canal water 11 6 the volumetric ratio of canal recharge to total recharge p is then given by 7 p δ 18 o gw δ 18 o precip δ 18 o canal δ 18 o precip where δ18ogw is the value of groundwater δ18oprecip is the value of precipitation awap and δ18ocanal is the average value of canal water the canal water contribution to groundwater recharge is spatially variable across the study area fig 8b most tube wells with depths of up to 80 mbgl in the downstream part of the basin have an estimated canal recharge component of more than 50 of total recharge whereas this value is quite variable 25 to 50 in the middle part of the basin 5 discussion 5 1 spatial variation in isotopic characteristics of groundwater our analysis of isotopic characteristic of groundwater in the ghaggar basin shows that δ18o and δ2h of groundwaters vary in space as well as depth to understand the relationship between isotopic and aquifer characteristics we have plotted aquifer thickness logs from the basin margin in himalayan front to the distal part of the basin along cross section a b along with d excess and isotopic composition δ18o and δ2h of groundwaters fig 9 a e the δ18o values of groundwater samples range from 5 2 to 7 7 and from 1 2 to 8 4 tu for tritium concentration generally above 80 mbgl in the upstream parts from the basin margin up to 80 km downstream fig 7c 9d these values clearly reflect that precipitation is the main recharge source however in the middle and downstream parts of the basin 80 to 320 km downstream of the basin margin the δ18o value and tritium concentration of groundwater samples generally above 80 mbgl are much more variable than those from the generally below 80 mbgl this could reflect multiple recharge sources such as irrigation return flow canal water leakage and precipitation in this part of the basin the cross plot of d excess vs δ18o for the groundwater samples shows an inverse correlation fig 6 the positive d excess 10 of the groundwater samples generally above 80 mbgl is consistent with source water derived from the higher himalayas pande et al 2000 rai et al 2014 and provides additional evidence of recharge from sutlej river water that has been redistributed through the canal network a few samples have lower d excess values which suggests evaporative enrichment of groundwater during the recharge process the d excess values of groundwater samples that lie between canal water and awap values suggest mixing of groundwater from different sources these d excess results are broadly consistent with our δ18o and δ2h measurements low d excess values in downstream part between 280 and 320 km from the northern basin margin suggest a significant evaporative enrichment of recharged groundwater fig 9c this is likely due to the prevailing semi arid climate in a southwest part of the study area and slow rate of recharge 56 mm yr for punjab and 70 mm yr for haryana rangarajan and athavale 2000 towards the distal part of the basin the thickness of non aquifer material in the subsurface increases van dijk et al 2016a the spatial variation of δ18o and δ2h with distance suggests that in situ vertical recharge at a variable rate takes place throughout the study area this is obvious on account of the variable water table supplementary fig s2 and heterogeneity in the subsurface in nwia system fig 9a the isotopic data is in conformity with the observed geological heterogeneity of the nwia system and the decrease in bulk aquifer body percentage from proximal to distal parts of the basin which results in limited lateral connectivity of aquifer bodies van dijk et al 2016a b 5 2 vertical variability of δ18o and tritium groundwater δ18o values fall within a narrow range near the awap for samples generally below 80 mbgl fig 4 this is likely due to the attenuation of δ18o and δ2h values with depth as water from different sources moves downward and attains the isotopic signature close to the awap generally below 80 mbgl fig 4 similarly a decrease in tritium concentration is observed with depth fig 7b the comparatively low tritium concentrations below 80 mbgl indicate relatively large travel time in the groundwater flow system resulting in loss of tritium by radioactive decay as mentioned earlier precipitation is the main recharge source and therefore we compare our results with tritium concentration of precipitation for the northwest india the eight precipitation samples measured here yielded values of 3 to 17 tu kumar et al 2010 reported tritium concentrations of 6 6 to 17 6 tu for northwestern india while tritium concentrations in precipitation measured during 2004 to 2010 at roorkee in north india varies between 2 6 and 15 5 tu table s4 we therefore consider tritium concentrations of groundwater of 2 to 12 9 0 5 tu as indicating recharge from modern water however tritium concentrations below 1 tu indicates groundwater that is likely older than 50 yrs liu et al 2014 the presence of a mixture of modern and old water below 80 mbgl indicates that significant recharge from modern sources reaches down to tube well depth i e 320 mbgl except in a few locations this in turn suggests that there is significant vertical leakage through the thick but discontinuous non aquifer layers within the sedimentary sequence van dijk et al 2016a and that these layers do not provide a barrier to vertical recharge of groundwater bowen 1985 toth 2009 sinha et al 2013 van dijk et al 2016a hoque et al 2017 fig 9b an attempt was also made to corroborate our results with hydraulic calculations using the velocity figures for sandy aquifers from soni et al 2014 and shekhar et al 2015 and our results are satisfactory even at such large scale of aquifer system similar results have been reported by lapworth et al 2015 from the beas sutlej region of punjab using anthropogenic tracers 5 3 spatial variability in groundwater recharge sources and zones the spatial variation of δ18o values tritium concentrations and d excess of groundwater samples generally above 80 mbgl and the canal contribution to groundwater recharge fig 5a b fig 7a fig 8a b reveal spatially variable recharge processes in the study area this leads us to identify four distinct groundwater recharge zones fig 8a zone i represents the upstream area of the basin where the d excess ranges from 6 to 11 fig 8a a cross plot of δ18o vs δ2h shows that all groundwater samples generally above 80 mbgl fall on the lmwl and are very close to awap fig 8c suggesting recharge predominantly through local precipitation tritium concentrations in groundwater samples generally above 80 mbgl in this zone are up to 12 9 0 5 tu this indicates that the groundwater is of modern age and derived from local meteoric precipitation previous work interpreted zone i as characterized by high permeability and high hydraulic conductivity van dijk et al 2016a our work however has shown that this zone is recharged by local precipitation based on the inferred groundwater recharge sources and flow paths therefore the implication of our work is that recharge rates in this zone would be high although we do not provide any quantification at this stage zone ii represents an area where the d excess ranges from 1 to 5 fig 8a and groundwater samples fall on or below lmwl in the cross plot of δ18o vs δ2h and very close to awap fig 8d the primary source of recharge is local precipitation however a number of samples fall between the isotopic values of canal water and awap indicating recharge through a mixture of canal water and local precipitation the enriched isotopic composition and low d excess of groundwater samples reflect fractionation during recharge through rainfall or irrigation return flow tritium concentrations of groundwater samples range from 2 to 10 tu indicate modern recharge at depths generally above 80 mbgl the canal contribution to groundwater in a number of locations estimated by using two component analysis ranges from 0 to 50 in zone ii fig 8b this zone is characterized by a high tube well density and rapid decline in groundwater levels due to overexploitation of groundwater resources therefore induced recharge to groundwater through irrigation return flow might be one explanation for evaporative enrichment of isotopic signatures of groundwater zone iii represents the area where the d excess ranges from 8 to 15 fig 8a and where δ18o and δ2h of the groundwater fall mostly above the lmwl and very close to the isotopic composition of canal water relatively more depleted values of δ18o are observed in this zone compared with zones i and ii which we interpret as evidence of active recharge by canal water tritium values are also higher than those in zone ii because of the significant contribution of the canal to groundwater the canal contribution to groundwater recharge ranges up to 100 fig 8b zone iv represents the distal end of the study area where d excess value ranges from 2 to 4 and δ18o and δ2h values fall below the lmwl but close to awap fig 8f the δ18o and δ2h values of groundwater samples more enriched than the awap are evidence of recharge by local precipitation modified by evaporative fractionation this zone is characterized by semi arid conditions here water gets fractionated during the recharge process and bears enriched values of δ18o and δ2h and low d excess the canal contribution to groundwater at a number of locations is less than 50 fig 8b this is consistent with slow recharge rates in this zone rangarajan and athavale 2000 5 4 conceptual model of the hydrological processes controlling isotopic signatures of groundwater it has already been established that the hydrological processes operating in the basin have subtle differences as we move downstream traced downstream the variability in the recharge processes including the source and rate of recharge appears to correlate with both the complex and spatially variable subsurface sedimentary architecture van dijk et al 2016a and with anthropogenic forcing such as the canal network we use this information to develop a conceptual model for the hydrological processes operating in the ghaggar basin fig 10 the boundary conditions for the conceptual model are a geomorphic setting b the spatial variability of δ18o and δ2h c the spatial variation of tritium concentration in groundwater d longitudinal cross sections based on aquifer thickness logs and e groundwater flow directions derived from water table the available aquifer thickness data indicate that the aquifer system is composed of stacked laterally discontinuous high permeability aquifer bodies separated both laterally and vertically by low permeability non aquifer material fig 9a this interleaved pattern of occurrence coupled with the basin surface topography imposes and maintains a hierarchy of groundwater flow systems from shallow to deep hoque et al 2017 the flow systems can be referred as local if recharge and discharge areas are contiguous intermediate if these regions are separated by one or more local systems and regional if they extend over the full extent of the basin toth 2009 our depth wise isotopic data suggest that local flow patterns in the ghaggar basin extend down to a depth of c 80 m and are dominated by local vertical recharge from meteoric and canal sources while intermediate and regional flow patterns extend to deeper depths and show evidence for sustained lateral flow fig 10 a similar flow pattern has been proposed for the bengal basin by ravenscroft et al 2005 and toth 2009 showed similar hierarchically nested groundwater flow systems within the exploited depth of the aquifer the observed vertical variations in isotopic signature of the groundwater are thus likely due to tortuous groundwater flow paths surface topography and subsurface lithological variations impose hydraulic heterogeneity and anisotropy which controls the flow patterns and depth of groundwater penetration zijl 1999 this conceptual model helps to explain the major lateral and vertical variations in groundwater δ18o δ2h and tritium concentrations which we interpret as due to the heterogeneous distribution of aquifer and non aquifer sediments in the subsurface for example the tritium results show comparatively higher residence time for groundwater from generally below 80 mbgl compared to the groundwater above 80 mbgl this indicates the existence of longer flow paths for groundwater below 80 mbgl which is likely controlled by the aquifer heterogeneity and anisotropy furthermore as illustrated in the schematic model in fig 10 water recharged in zones i and ii must travel deeper to account for the regional groundwater flow system the groundwater velocity through sand rich aquifer bodies like those in the ghaggar basin are typically 1 to 2 m day soni et al 2014 shekhar et al 2015 furthermore the model fig 10 suggests the hydrological process of mixing of this old groundwater in zone iii with vertically recharged groundwater from sources like rainfall and return flow of canal and groundwater irrigation 6 conclusions this study is the first systematic attempt to identify the recharge sources and zones and to characterise groundwater dynamics in the northwestern indian aquifer in punjab and haryana using water isotopes δ18o δ2h and 3h our results reveal that recharge sources for groundwater in the region are local meteoric water canal seepage and both canal and groundwater derived irrigation return flow these recharge sources vary spatially in their importance the influence of canal water to recharge is most apparent in the zone ii to iv in the study area the spatial variability in δ18o δ2h value and tritium concentration reflects limited lateral connectivity of the aquifer due to the heterogeneity of aquifer material however the variation of δ18o with depth shows the effect of averaging of the isotopic composition of different groundwater sources at various depths variability in tritium concentrations with depth reveals that groundwater generally above 80 mbgl is of modern age however groundwater generally below 80 mbgl is a mixture of modern and old water the spatial distribution of aquifer and non aquifer material in the subsurface likely forces some recharge water to follow longer deeper and more tortuous flow paths resulting in low tritium values two kinds of flow patterns are observed in the northwest indian aquifer system i a local flow pattern down to a general depth of c 80 mbgl and ii an intermediate and regional groundwater flow pattern in aquifer system generally below 80 mbgl recharged with water from lateral groundwater flow and vertical infiltration results

7423,the recharge mechanism of groundwater in the badain jaran desert north china has been a focus of research and still disputable in the past two decades in this study the chemical and hydrogen h and oxygen o isotopic characteristics of shallow groundwater lake water and local precipitation in the badain jaran desert and neighboring areas were investigated to reveal the relationships between various water bodies and the recharge source of shallow groundwater isotopic and hydrogeochemical results show that 1 shallow groundwater was associated with local precipitation in the ayouqi and yabulai regions 2 lake water was mainly recharged by groundwater in the desert hinterland 3 shallow groundwater of the desert hinterland yabulai mountain and gurinai grassland had a common recharge source shallow groundwater of the desert hinterland had a mean recharge elevation of 1869 m a s l on the basis of the isotope altitude relationship and thus originated chiefly from lateral infiltration of precipitation in the yabulai mountain it is further concluded that shallow groundwater flowed towards the gurinai grassland according to the groundwater table contour map along the flow pathway the h o isotopic variations were primarily caused by the evaporation effect but chemical variations of shallow groundwater were affected by multiple factors e g evaporation effect dilution effect of occasional heavy precipitation and dissolution of aquifer evaporites our findings provide new insight into the groundwater cycle and benefit the management of the limited water resources in the arid desert area keywords h o isotopes precipitation lake water groundwater system recharge source badain jaran desert yabulai mountain 1 introduction the badain jaran desert lying in the western inner mongolia is a key component of the arid and semi arid areas of china zhu et al 1980 yang et al 2004 similar to other arid deserts of northwest china this desert is characterized by a large mobile dune area many high dune mountains sparse vegetation and frequent sandstorms zhu et al 1980 yang et al 2004 dong et al 2013 moreover there are strong evaporation rare precipitation little surface runoff and no rivers in this desert nevertheless this desert is also characterized by a lot of springs many lakes and abundant groundwater resources yang and williams 2003 chen et al 2004 ma and edmunds 2006 gates et al 2008 moreover it is widely humid below the 20 cm thick dry dune sand layers in this desert ma et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 in a word the hydrological feature of this desert is different from those of other chinese deserts and has a striking contrast with local climate zhu et al 1980 yang et al 2004 the striking contrast of hydrology with climate and the coexistence of high sand mountains with lakes in the badain jaran desert have attracted wide attention yang and williams 2003 chen et al 2004 ma and edmunds 2006 gates et al 2008 dong et al 2013 plenty of interesting hypotheses were proposed for instance where the groundwater came from how it did come and its link to the formation of dune mountains with regard to these hypotheses numerous studies were conducted in recent years yang and williams 2003 chen et al 2004 ma and edmunds 2006 gates et al 2008 jiao et al 2015 luo et al 2016 for example some authors thought that ancient water from the adjacent yabulai mountain was a main source of shallow groundwater in the badain jaran desert ma and edmunds 2006 gates et al 2008 some suggested that local precipitation recharged groundwater in this desert yang and williams 2003 others insisted that desert groundwater was recharged by snowmelt from the qilian mountains through deep faults chen et al 2004 the viewpoints are divergent and some are even contradictory due to the complexity of hydrogeological systems in the badain jaran desert the discrepancy of researchers viewpoints may be ascribed to individual objectives study areas and techniques since the end of the 20th century tourism and farming have become rapidly growing industries in this region sustainable use of groundwater resource is thus challenging on the one hand groundwater may be vital to maintain the dune landscape chen et al 2004 on the other hand groundwater utilization is essential for economic development of local communities in such a circumstance based on the consideration of various potential sources a detailed understanding of the groundwater recharge mechanism and hydraulic interaction with different waters using novel methods is required for completing the theory of the groundwater cycle and further guiding the sustainable utilization of groundwater resources in the badain jaran desert hydrogen h and oxygen o isotopes the intrinsic tracers of the water molecule are transported conservatively in aquifers and vary only in relation to climatic difference water mixing and surface evaporation thus they are usually regarded as effective tracing tools to determine the evaporation extent of recharge sources recharge conditions mixing proportion of groundwater clark and fritz 1997 nakaya et al 2007 edmunds 2009 currell et al 2010 peng et al 2012 barbieri et al 2017 the techniques have widely been used to study the hydrological cycle especially in the arid and semi arid areas clark and fritz 1997 cuthbert et al 2014 tan et al 2016 as potential sources recharging groundwater in the badain jaran desert waters of the qilian and yabulai mountains lie in different tectonic and climatic units and atmospheric moisture originates from outside for local precipitation of this desert so they should be isotopically different from one to another it is expected that the recharge source and flow pathway of desert groundwater could be determined through h o isotopic comparison with potential sources however the systematical h o isotope dataset of the precipitation lake water groundwater system is scarce for a detailed understanding of the groundwater recharge in the desert in particular the local meteoric water line used as an isotopic reference of groundwater recharge assessment was chiefly established on the basis of the iaea isotopic data from zhangye gnip monitoring station approximately 160 km away from the badain jaran desert or several precipitation samples of the desert hinterland without the precipitation isotope data of at least one hydrological year in previous studies chen et al 2004 ma and edmunds 2006 gates et al 2008 zhao et al 2012 thus previous conclusions on the groundwater recharge of the desert could deviate from the truth in this study we investigate the h o isotopic and hydrogeochemical composition of local precipitation lake water and groundwater in the badain jaran desert and surrounding areas in detail we aim to answer the two questions as follows 1 what are the relationships between various waters and 2 what are the recharge sources and pathways of shallow groundwater in the badain jaran desert 2 study area the badain jaran desert 39 04 42 12 n and 99 23 104 34 e is the third largest desert in china zhu et al 1980 covering an area of about 5 104 km2 with an elevation of 1150 1700 m a s l fig 1 a it is bordered by the beida mountain to the south and the zongnai mountain to the east the yabulai mountain to the southeast and the gurinai grassland and black river to the west and the guaizihu wetland to the north fig 1a in general the elevation decreases from the yabulai mountain to the gurinai grassland across the badain jaran desert fig 1b the badain jaran desert tectonically lies in the basin depression of the alxa tectonic block which formed during the late jurassic and early cretaceous vincent and allen 1999 jurassic and cretaceous rocks are distributed in the fringe while quaternary sediments occupy at the center of the basin depression ma and edmunds 2006 gates et al 2008 gray sandstones and sandy conglomerates are main rocks of shallow aquifers while deep aquifers consist of sandstones which are exposed at the fringe of the desert shang 2014 the aquifers are composed of sandstones granites and quaternary deposits in the ayouqi region while granites are main types of the aquifer rocks in the yabulai mountain fig 1b the badain jaran desert comprises 200 300 m high megadunes with the top height of 400 m dong et al 2013 the dunes are interspersed with lakes occurring in low lying areas throughout the desert there are about 144 lakes existing in the southeastern part of the desert including 119 perennial lakes of the 144 lakes only 5 lakes have the areas of 1 km2 and few lakes are fresh the badain jaran desert climatically lying in the middle of the westerly circulation and the northern margin of the southeast monsoon has a continental climate zhu et al 1980 yang et al 2004 the annual average temperature is 36 c in summer june to august and 10 c in winter december to february of next year the annual average evaporation potential is 2600 mm increasing from the southeast to northwest of the desert rao et al 2009 the annual precipitation amount is 30 120 mm most of the precipitation falls during july to september gradually decreasing from the southeast to northwest of the desert yang and williams 2003 yang et al 2004 small precipitation events are dominant and heavy precipitation occasionally happens in the desert hinterland wang et al 2013 the vegetation in the badain jaran desert consists largely of nitraria tangutorum zygophyllun xanthoxylum reaumuria soongorica and agriophyllum squarrosum wang et al 2015b 3 samples and methods to avoid the seasonal difference summer july august was determined to be the sampling period for groundwater and lake water each year the two sampling campaigns were conducted in the badain jaran desert and surrounding areas during july and august 2013 and 2014 respectively it was found that groundwater sampled in the study area was usually shallow with the depth of 200 m during the sampling campaigns table s1 each groundwater sample was taken 50 cm deep below water surface by a stainless steel sampler the groundwater level was on site measured by a water level meter seventy two shallow groundwater samples were totally from the desert hinterland gw 2 and peripheral areas including the gurinai guaizihu region gw 1 ayouqi ayq region including the bada mountain gw 3 and yabulai ybl region including the yabulai mountain gw 4 fig 1a and table s1 by the same sampler twenty one lake samples were taken 30 cm deep below water surface in the central part of desert lakes lw fig 1a and table s1 two weather stations near the badain jaran desert ayq rw 1 and ybl rw 2 which are away from about 100 km between each other were chosen to collect rainwater samples in two hydrological years july 2013 july 2015 fig 1a the rainwater sample was taken by a standard rainwater sampler for each daily precipitation event the sampler was not opened between precipitation events for preventing dust pollution in addition two rainwater samples were collected at the nuoertu lake of the badain jaran desert rw 3 during sampling campaigns one was taken at july 2013 and the other at july 2014 in total there are 131 rainwater samples of which 54 rainwater samples were collected between july 2013 and august 2014 all the samples were stored in polyethylene bottles which have been rinsed by deionized water three times and dried before sampling the ph and ec electrical conductivity values of water samples were measured by a multi parametric analyzer multi 3400i in the field the precisions of ph and ec were 0 03 and 1 μs cm respectively 10 ml of each unfiltered water sample was preserved in a brown glass vial for the h o isotopic measurement gates et al 2008 the residual sample was filtered through a 0 45 μm millipore membrane filter each filtrate was divided into two aliquots one was stored without further treatment for the anion measurement and the other was acidified with ultra pure nitric acid to a ph value around 2 for the measurement of cations the measurement of major cations ca2 mg2 na and k was performed by an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes thermo icp 6300 in the south engineering geological technology research co ltd of east china major anions cl so4 2 and no3 were measured by ionic chromatography ics 2100 in the college of environment hohai university analytical error was 5 for cations and 3 for anions based on the sample reproducibility hco3 was measured by the hcl titration with a precision of 3 within 24 h of sample collection stable isotopes of shallow groundwater lake water and rainwater samples were measured by using a liquid h o isotope spectrometer picarro l2130 i in the institute of tibetan plateau research chinese academy of sciences the precision was 1 for δd and 0 1 for δ18o normalized to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow standard in order to avoid large measurement uncertainties saline lake water samples were completely distilled to be fresh tds 1 g l before isotope measurement horita and gat 1989 gat 2010 yang et al 2010 for shallow groundwater and lake water samples the measured chemical and h o isotopic data are listed in supplementary material table s1 for precipitation samples the chemical data are cited from rao et al 2017 and the h o isotopic values are measured in this study all of the chemical and isotopic data are statistically displayed in table 1 the phreeqc geochemical code is used to compute the saturation indices of calcite dolomite and gypsum in groundwater and lake water parkhurst and appelo 1999 4 results the ph value of rainwater varies from 6 66 to 8 38 with the volume weighted mean value sd of 7 41 0 3 7 37 0 3 and 8 2 0 23 respectively in rw 1 rw 2 and rw 3 table 1 and fig 2 rainwater tends to be more alkaline in rw 3 than in rw 1 and rw 2 the ec value of rainwater changes between 35 μs cm and 1237 μs cm with the volume weighted mean value sd of 137 214 μs cm 181 228 μs cm and 248 11 3 μs cm respectively in rw 1 rw 2 and rw 3 table 1 and fig 2 the ec value of rainwater is greatly discrete in rw 1 and rw 2 the concentrations of major ions vary greatly with large cv coefficient of variation values of significantly 10 particularly in rw 1 and rw 2 table 1 and fig 2 the chemical type of rainwater is different to some degree from one place to another in detail rainwater is of ca2 na so4 2 hco3 type in rw 1 and rw 2 but is of na ca2 hco3 so4 2 type in rw 3 fig 3 a δ18o δd values of rainwater are also greatly variable from 13 8 to 22 3 77 to 168 with the volume weighted mean values of 4 5 5 6 24 43 3 2 5 1 19 35 and 1 1 1 8 12 2 respectively in rw 1 rw 2 and rw 3 table 1 and fig 2 based on the volume weighted isotope values of monthly precipitation calculated by the isotope values and amount of daily precipitation the local meteoric water line lmwl is established as follows δd 7 84δ18o 6 31 r2 0 96 n 35 this lmwl is different from those provided by obtained in previous studies ma et al 2007 gates et al 2008 zhao et al 2012 ma et al 2007 gave a lmwl using 17 precipitation data of this desert and gurinai areas gates et al 2008 took the lmwl of zhangye as that of this desert and zhao et al 2012 established a lmwl based on six precipitation samples from the ayq and desert hinterland in comparison the established lmwl in this study should be more reliable as a reference for investigating groundwater recharge because it is based on isotope data of two hydrological year precipitation in the badain jaran desert lake water has the ph value from 8 20 to 9 98 with the mean value sd of 9 36 0 54 and has the high ec value of 2 3 ms cm 184 ms cm with the mean value of 83 5 64 5 ms cm table 1 na and cl are the two dominant ions in lake water and are high in concentrations table 1 and fig 3b lake water is enriched in δ18o 2 4 11 8 and δd 48 23 with the mean values of 5 7 4 and 3 20 respectively table 1 as listed in table 1 and shown in fig 2 the ph values are from 7 68 to 9 85 for all groundwater samples and are averagely similar in the four groundwater subareas mean value sd gw 1 8 35 0 35 gw 2 8 57 0 42 gw 3 8 4 0 48 and gw 4 8 3 0 5 the ec value of groundwater has a great variability from 541μs cm to 8960 μs cm with the mean value of 1312 1398 μs cm 817 380 μs cm 3096 4300 μs cm 1874 2510 μs cm respectively for gw 1 gw 2 gw 3 and gw 4 table 1 the ec values are basically higher in gw 3 than in other groundwater subareas fig 2 chemical types of groundwater are different in the four subareas as observed in fig 3a nevertheless most of shallow groundwater samples are dominated by na cl reaching up to 90 of total ions table 1 from gw 1 to gw 2 to gw 3 and to gw 4 na cl and so4 2 have roughly identical trends as well as the ec value differing from other ions fig 2 the δ18o δd values of shallow groundwater vary from 11 8 to 4 8 87 to 1 and the mean values are 2 4 2 45 10 2 7 2 1 43 9 6 7 2 4 55 13 6 4 3 5 59 17 respectively for gw 1 gw 2 gw 3 and gw 4 table 1 except for the abnormal values the δ18o and δd values of shallow groundwater are depleted in gw 3 and gw 4 but enriched in gw 1 and gw 2 fig 2 as a whole without the abnormal values the ph ec values and concentrations of most ions na cl so4 2 k mg2 and hco3 are the lowest in rainwater the middle in shallow groundwater and the highest in lake water but ca2 and no3 are not the case fig 2 of the three water bodies lake water has the highest δ18o and δd values and rainwater tends to be more enriched in the stable isotope composition than shallow groundwater fig 2 5 discussion 5 1 the link of shallow groundwater with local precipitation in the ayouqi and yabulai regions 5 1 1 the ayouqi ayq region shallow groundwater of the ayq region has h o isotopic values falling below the local meteoric water line and being close to the isotope values of local precipitation suggesting that shallow groundwater was mainly recharged by local precipitation and suffered from evaporation to some extent fig 4 shallow groundwater has a higher proportion of na k to cl compared to local precipitation fig 5 a meanwhile the na k cl ratios are 1 and the na k so4 2 ratios are mostly between 1 1 and 2 1 for shallow groundwater samples fig 5a and b in addition the ca2 mg2 ratios are 1 1 for most groundwater samples fig 5d therefore the excess na k and ca2 of groundwater suggest that silicates could partly be hydrolyzed in addition to evaporite and carbonate dissolution in the aquifer rao et al 2015 the saturation indices are 0 69 and 1 19 for calcite and dolomite respectively showing that carbonate dissolution is significant in shallow groundwater of the ayq region the ca2 so4 2 ratios are between 1 1 and 1 5 in shallow groundwater fig 5c and the calculated saturation indice of gypsum is 1 14 implying that few gypsums were dissolved into shallow groundwater 5 1 2 the yabulai ybl region as shown in fig 4 the δd and δ18o values are different between shallow groundwater samples collected from the yabulai region and rainwater samples collected from the yabulai ybl weather station isotopic characteristics of rainwater samples collected from the ybl weather station with the elevation of 1250 m can not represent those of precipitation in the yabulai mountain with the maximum elevation of 1957 m because of the elevation effect gu et al 2011 for determining the link between shallow groundwater and local precipitation it is thus necessary to obtain the δd and δ18o values of local precipitation in the yabulai mountain by the precipitation isotope elevation relationship the precipitation isotope elevation relationship in northwest china is established by choosing fifteen representative areas which are under the control of the westerly on the basis of previous studies guo et al 2015 iaea mwo 2016 δ18o 0 0029h 4 83 and δd 0 018h 34 1 fig 6 the δ18o and δd values are calculated to be 10 5 and 69 respectively for precipitation in the top of the yabulai mountain using the above equations the isotope values of the initial source recharging shallow groundwater are 10 3 for δ18o and 74 for δd determined by the gwel lmwl intersection fig 4 and are close to the calculated isotope values of precipitation in the yabulai mountain therefore it is likely that shallow groundwater was recharged by precipitation in the yabulai mountain rather than precipitation at the ybl weather station yang 2006 the mean δ18o and δd values are 6 4 and 59 respectively for shallow groundwater in the ybl region table 1 greatly differing from the isotope values of the initial source obtained by the lmwl gwel intersection point fig 4 moreover the slope of 4 17 in the gwel is observed in the fig 4 négrel and lachassagne 2000 observed a slope of around 4 in a δ18o δd relationship for surface water during dry season flow a pan evaporation experiment of négrel et al 2011 resulted in a similar evaporation line δd 4 19δ18o 9 17 and revealed significant effect of evaporation on surface water the consistency of our result with the previous studies shows that evaporation effect was strong on groundwater in the ybl region cl concentration is a good indicator reflecting the evaporation extent of natural waters herczeg and edmunds 2000 as cl concentration increases δ18o value increases fig 7 further demonstrating significant evaporation of groundwater in the ybl region the molar ratios of na k cl are between 1 1 and 2 1 for most of shallow groundwater samples fig 5a the molar ratios of na k so4 2 are almost 2 1 fig 5b suggesting that some na silicates were dissolved in the aquifer the molar ratios of ca2 so4 2 are between 1 1 and 1 5 fig 5c implying that additional so4 2 came both from gypsum dissolution and from mirabilite dissolution or human contamination most of shallow groundwater samples lie above the dolomite dissolution line indicating calcite and dolomite dissolution as seen in fig 5d the mean saturation indices of calcite and dolomite are 0 56 and 1 03 respectively also supporting this inference the ca2 cl and mg2 cl ratios are mostly from 1 1 to 1 5 in shallow groundwater fig 5e and f showing that halite or sea salt dissolution is more significant than carbonate dissolution in the aquifer furthermore yang 2006 pointed out that the age of groundwater is not older than 100 years in terms of 3h analyses in addition field investigations showed that there are plenty of shallow groundwater and spring water with low ec values in the yabulai mountain completely different from groundwater with high ec values in the ayq region table s1 as a result shallow groundwater was probably recharged by precipitation infiltration through rock fractures in the yabulai mountain where aquifer weathering could be in the stage of evaporite and carbonate dissolution 5 2 the relationship between shallow groundwater and lake water in the desert hinterland most of lakes are perennial in the desert hinterland the amount of local precipitation was monitored to be too small to maintain the perennial lakes wang et al 2013 dong et al 2016 as shown in fig 4 the δ18o and δd values of lake water are plotted along the groundwater evaporation line although they are obviously more enriched than those of shallow groundwater suggesting a common origin lakes formed earlier but groundwater was young in the desert hinterland yang and williams 2003 chen et al 2004 wu 2014 field investigations showed that springs and travertines are well developed in and around the desert lakes moreover the water level of groundwater is higher than that of lake water fig 8 in addition the lower ion concentrations of shallow groundwater than those of lake water are hard to be interpreted if lake water recharged groundwater table 1 therefore lake water should be recharged by groundwater in the desert hinterland ma and edmunds 2006 liu et al 2016 luo et al 2016 lake water has more na k and cl with lower molar ratios of ca2 cl and mg2 cl 1 5 relative to shallow groundwater in the desert hinterland fig 5a e and f implying the dominance of evaporite dissolution the ca2 mg2 ratio is 1 5 in lake water while it is between the 1 5 line and dolomite dissolution line in shallow groundwater in the desert hinterland fig 5d furthermore the mean saturation indices of lake water and shallow groundwater are 0 91 and 0 51 respectively for calcite and are 3 34 and 1 0 respectively for dolomite these results would indicate that more calcite and dolomite were dissolved into lake water local precipitation should also be a source contributing ions to lake water although it is small and its ion concentrations are low table 1 therefore the higher ion concentrations of lake water compared to shallow groundwater can be ascribed to mineral dissolution and precipitation input in addition to surface evaporation table 1 5 3 the recharge source of shallow groundwater in the desert hinterland some authors proposed that groundwater was recharged by snowmelt of the qilian mountains through deep faults chen et al 2004 however the intersection point values of the gwel and lmwl are apparently different from the δ18o and δd values of snowmelt and river water from the qilian mountains and tibetan plateau fig 4 the ionic compositions are also different between shallow groundwater of the badain jaran desert and snowmelt river water of the qilian mountains and tibetan plateau as shown in figs 3 and 5 consequently from isotopic and hydrogeochemical perspectives it is concluded that shallow groundwater of the desert hinterland is not essentially associated with snowmelt of the qilian mountains and tibetan plateau in fact it is difficult for snowmelt of the qilian mountains to recharge the desert hinterland groundwater because multiple compressed fractures develop in the front zones of the qilian mountains zhang and ming 2006 several mountains such as beida and yabulai separating the badain jaran desert from the hexi corridor could also be barriers preventing groundwater movement from the qilian mountains to desert hinterland some authors emphasized that local precipitation was the main recharge source of groundwater in the desert hinterland yang and williams 2003 however as shown in figs 2 and 4 the δ18o and δd values of precipitation and shallow groundwater in the desert hinterland are different and do not plot on the same evaporation line furthermore major ion concentrations of the two water bodies are distinct in the region table 1 figs 3 and 5 thus the hydrogeochemical and isotopic results disagree with the viewpoint of yang and williams 2003 ma and edmunds 2006 determined a mean infiltration rate of modern precipitation of 0 95 mm y 1 33 mm y in the badain jaran desert using a chloride mass balance technique gates et al 2008 and dong et al 2016 also confirmed that direct infiltration of local precipitation had little contribution to shallow groundwater in this desert our results together with previous studies actually imply the insignificance of precipitation events to desert groundwater since 90 precipitation events were quite small with a mean amount of 5 mm d in 2010 2011 wang et al 2013 as shown in fig 4 the δ18o and δd values are plotted on the same evaporation line for shallow groundwater in the gurinai guaizihu region gw 1 desert hinterland gw 2 and ybl region gw 4 this indicates a common source of shallow groundwater in the three areas the gwel lmwl intersection point indicates the initial recharge source of groundwater in the desert hinterland fig 4 in terms of the δ18o altitude relationship fig 6 the mean recharge altitude of shallow groundwater in the desert hinterland is calculated to be 1869 m surrounding the badain jaran desert the yabulai mountain is 1957 m a s l the zongnai mountain is 1400 m a s l and the beida mountains are from 2000 to 2500 m a s l huang 2007 the qilian mountains 500 km away from this desert have higher altitudes of 4000 6000 m a s l the calculated recharge altitude of groundwater agrees well with the yabulai mountain rather than other mountains showing that shallow groundwater in the desert hinterland originated most likely from the yabulai mountain the terrain elevation decreases gradually from the yabulai mountain to desert hinterland and to gurinai guaizihu region ma and edmunds 2006 gates et al 2008 jiao et al 2015 the water level of groundwater also has a similar variation to the terrain elevation fig 9 thus shallow groundwater flowed from the yabulai mountain to desert hinterland and to gurinai guaizihu region since shallow groundwater of the yabulai mountain was recharged by local precipitation as discussed in section 5 1 2 lateral infiltration of the yabulai mountain precipitation should be a dominant source of shallow groundwater in the desert hinterland fig 1b in theory δ18o δd and ion concentrations of groundwater should increase from the yabulai mountain to desert hinterland and to gurinai guaizihu region due to evaporation if there are not additional sources including local precipitation in fact it is not the case for ion concentrations and h o isotope values in groundwater fig 10 from the yabulai mountain to desert hinterland the increases of δ18o δd indicate evaporation effect and the decreases of ion concentrations point to dilution effect the weak correlation of cl with δ18o indicates the occurrence of an additional source fig 7 hydrological experiments demonstrated the high permeability of dune sand the saturation permeability coefficient of 10 m d at the dune depth of 60 cm in the badain jaran desert dai 2014 furthermore heavy precipitation of 20 mm d occasionally happened in summer according to the monitor data of wang et al 2013 a recent study also highlighted the importance of heavy precipitation to desert groundwater hou et al 2016 local precipitation has lower ion concentrations and higher δ18o δd relative to groundwater table 1 thus it particularly occasional heavy precipitation could be such an additional source impacting groundwater chemistry in the desert hinterland further na k cl so4 2 concentrations in groundwater increase while δ18o ca2 and mg2 concentrations do not greatly change from the desert hinterland to gurinai guaizihu region fig 10 the main causes of these phenomena can be interpreted as follows 1 the evaporation effect evidenced by the δ18o cl relationship of groundwater fig 7 could not be dominantly responsible for spatial variations of the stable isotopes and ion concentrations probably because groundwater flowed under the dune sand layers fig 10 2 heavy precipitation with low ion concentrations and higher δ18o occasionally happened and thus had the dilution effect on ion concentrations to some degree but did not greatly affect δ18o in groundwater 3 it was observed that abundant evaporites e g halite mirabilite developed in the gurinai guaizihu region by field campaigns and these minerals were easily dissolved into groundwater leading to the increase of na k cl and so4 2 rather than ca2 and mg2 6 conclusion the chemical and h o isotopic characteristics of rainwater lake water and shallow groundwater in the badain jaran desert and surrounding areas are investigated in detail shallow groundwater is alkaline and has the ph and ec values between those of rainwater and lake water na and cl are the major ions of shallow groundwater and lake water while rainwater is enriched in ca2 and so4 2 of the three water bodies lake water has the highest δ18o and δd values and rainwater tends to be more enriched in the stable isotope composition than shallow groundwater shallow groundwater was mainly recharged by local precipitation in terms of the h o isotopic and hydrogeochemical analyses and evaporite and carbonate dissolution is significant to groundwater chemistry in the ayouqi ayq region in the yabulai ybl region halite or sea salt dissolution is more significant than carbonate dissolution to groundwater chemistry the new equation for describing the precipitation isotope elevation effect in northwest china is established as δ18o 0 0029h 4 83 and δd 0 018h 34 1 the h o isotope values of precipitation in the yabulai mountain are recovered by the equations and are close to the intersection point of the gwel and lmwl indicating the initial recharge source of groundwater in the ybl region therefore shallow groundwater of the ybl region was recharged by precipitation at the yabulai mountain rather than at or near the ybl weather station the chemical and h o isotopic investigation in combination with the lake water level shows that lake water was recharged by groundwater in the desert hinterland hydrogeochemical variations from groundwater to lake water are a combined result of mineral dissolution the input of local precipitation and surface evaporation the δ18o and δd values of shallow groundwater are plotted along a same evaporation line for the gurinai guaizihu region desert hinterland and ybl region suggesting a common recharge source the isotopic and hydrogeological evidence reveals that shallow groundwater of the desert hinterland sourced mainly from lateral infiltration of precipitation in the yabulai mountain and then flowed towards the gurinai guaizihu region along the flow pathway the variations of δ18o values were related to evaporation effect and the increases of na k cl and so4 2 in groundwater are probably caused by aquifer evaporite dissolution in addition to evaporation effect whereas the decreases of ca2 and mg2 were mainly associated with dilution effect of occasional heavy precipitation this study not only provides the policymakers with a deep understanding of the regional water cycle for improving local water resource management but also affords a useful

7423,the recharge mechanism of groundwater in the badain jaran desert north china has been a focus of research and still disputable in the past two decades in this study the chemical and hydrogen h and oxygen o isotopic characteristics of shallow groundwater lake water and local precipitation in the badain jaran desert and neighboring areas were investigated to reveal the relationships between various water bodies and the recharge source of shallow groundwater isotopic and hydrogeochemical results show that 1 shallow groundwater was associated with local precipitation in the ayouqi and yabulai regions 2 lake water was mainly recharged by groundwater in the desert hinterland 3 shallow groundwater of the desert hinterland yabulai mountain and gurinai grassland had a common recharge source shallow groundwater of the desert hinterland had a mean recharge elevation of 1869 m a s l on the basis of the isotope altitude relationship and thus originated chiefly from lateral infiltration of precipitation in the yabulai mountain it is further concluded that shallow groundwater flowed towards the gurinai grassland according to the groundwater table contour map along the flow pathway the h o isotopic variations were primarily caused by the evaporation effect but chemical variations of shallow groundwater were affected by multiple factors e g evaporation effect dilution effect of occasional heavy precipitation and dissolution of aquifer evaporites our findings provide new insight into the groundwater cycle and benefit the management of the limited water resources in the arid desert area keywords h o isotopes precipitation lake water groundwater system recharge source badain jaran desert yabulai mountain 1 introduction the badain jaran desert lying in the western inner mongolia is a key component of the arid and semi arid areas of china zhu et al 1980 yang et al 2004 similar to other arid deserts of northwest china this desert is characterized by a large mobile dune area many high dune mountains sparse vegetation and frequent sandstorms zhu et al 1980 yang et al 2004 dong et al 2013 moreover there are strong evaporation rare precipitation little surface runoff and no rivers in this desert nevertheless this desert is also characterized by a lot of springs many lakes and abundant groundwater resources yang and williams 2003 chen et al 2004 ma and edmunds 2006 gates et al 2008 moreover it is widely humid below the 20 cm thick dry dune sand layers in this desert ma et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 in a word the hydrological feature of this desert is different from those of other chinese deserts and has a striking contrast with local climate zhu et al 1980 yang et al 2004 the striking contrast of hydrology with climate and the coexistence of high sand mountains with lakes in the badain jaran desert have attracted wide attention yang and williams 2003 chen et al 2004 ma and edmunds 2006 gates et al 2008 dong et al 2013 plenty of interesting hypotheses were proposed for instance where the groundwater came from how it did come and its link to the formation of dune mountains with regard to these hypotheses numerous studies were conducted in recent years yang and williams 2003 chen et al 2004 ma and edmunds 2006 gates et al 2008 jiao et al 2015 luo et al 2016 for example some authors thought that ancient water from the adjacent yabulai mountain was a main source of shallow groundwater in the badain jaran desert ma and edmunds 2006 gates et al 2008 some suggested that local precipitation recharged groundwater in this desert yang and williams 2003 others insisted that desert groundwater was recharged by snowmelt from the qilian mountains through deep faults chen et al 2004 the viewpoints are divergent and some are even contradictory due to the complexity of hydrogeological systems in the badain jaran desert the discrepancy of researchers viewpoints may be ascribed to individual objectives study areas and techniques since the end of the 20th century tourism and farming have become rapidly growing industries in this region sustainable use of groundwater resource is thus challenging on the one hand groundwater may be vital to maintain the dune landscape chen et al 2004 on the other hand groundwater utilization is essential for economic development of local communities in such a circumstance based on the consideration of various potential sources a detailed understanding of the groundwater recharge mechanism and hydraulic interaction with different waters using novel methods is required for completing the theory of the groundwater cycle and further guiding the sustainable utilization of groundwater resources in the badain jaran desert hydrogen h and oxygen o isotopes the intrinsic tracers of the water molecule are transported conservatively in aquifers and vary only in relation to climatic difference water mixing and surface evaporation thus they are usually regarded as effective tracing tools to determine the evaporation extent of recharge sources recharge conditions mixing proportion of groundwater clark and fritz 1997 nakaya et al 2007 edmunds 2009 currell et al 2010 peng et al 2012 barbieri et al 2017 the techniques have widely been used to study the hydrological cycle especially in the arid and semi arid areas clark and fritz 1997 cuthbert et al 2014 tan et al 2016 as potential sources recharging groundwater in the badain jaran desert waters of the qilian and yabulai mountains lie in different tectonic and climatic units and atmospheric moisture originates from outside for local precipitation of this desert so they should be isotopically different from one to another it is expected that the recharge source and flow pathway of desert groundwater could be determined through h o isotopic comparison with potential sources however the systematical h o isotope dataset of the precipitation lake water groundwater system is scarce for a detailed understanding of the groundwater recharge in the desert in particular the local meteoric water line used as an isotopic reference of groundwater recharge assessment was chiefly established on the basis of the iaea isotopic data from zhangye gnip monitoring station approximately 160 km away from the badain jaran desert or several precipitation samples of the desert hinterland without the precipitation isotope data of at least one hydrological year in previous studies chen et al 2004 ma and edmunds 2006 gates et al 2008 zhao et al 2012 thus previous conclusions on the groundwater recharge of the desert could deviate from the truth in this study we investigate the h o isotopic and hydrogeochemical composition of local precipitation lake water and groundwater in the badain jaran desert and surrounding areas in detail we aim to answer the two questions as follows 1 what are the relationships between various waters and 2 what are the recharge sources and pathways of shallow groundwater in the badain jaran desert 2 study area the badain jaran desert 39 04 42 12 n and 99 23 104 34 e is the third largest desert in china zhu et al 1980 covering an area of about 5 104 km2 with an elevation of 1150 1700 m a s l fig 1 a it is bordered by the beida mountain to the south and the zongnai mountain to the east the yabulai mountain to the southeast and the gurinai grassland and black river to the west and the guaizihu wetland to the north fig 1a in general the elevation decreases from the yabulai mountain to the gurinai grassland across the badain jaran desert fig 1b the badain jaran desert tectonically lies in the basin depression of the alxa tectonic block which formed during the late jurassic and early cretaceous vincent and allen 1999 jurassic and cretaceous rocks are distributed in the fringe while quaternary sediments occupy at the center of the basin depression ma and edmunds 2006 gates et al 2008 gray sandstones and sandy conglomerates are main rocks of shallow aquifers while deep aquifers consist of sandstones which are exposed at the fringe of the desert shang 2014 the aquifers are composed of sandstones granites and quaternary deposits in the ayouqi region while granites are main types of the aquifer rocks in the yabulai mountain fig 1b the badain jaran desert comprises 200 300 m high megadunes with the top height of 400 m dong et al 2013 the dunes are interspersed with lakes occurring in low lying areas throughout the desert there are about 144 lakes existing in the southeastern part of the desert including 119 perennial lakes of the 144 lakes only 5 lakes have the areas of 1 km2 and few lakes are fresh the badain jaran desert climatically lying in the middle of the westerly circulation and the northern margin of the southeast monsoon has a continental climate zhu et al 1980 yang et al 2004 the annual average temperature is 36 c in summer june to august and 10 c in winter december to february of next year the annual average evaporation potential is 2600 mm increasing from the southeast to northwest of the desert rao et al 2009 the annual precipitation amount is 30 120 mm most of the precipitation falls during july to september gradually decreasing from the southeast to northwest of the desert yang and williams 2003 yang et al 2004 small precipitation events are dominant and heavy precipitation occasionally happens in the desert hinterland wang et al 2013 the vegetation in the badain jaran desert consists largely of nitraria tangutorum zygophyllun xanthoxylum reaumuria soongorica and agriophyllum squarrosum wang et al 2015b 3 samples and methods to avoid the seasonal difference summer july august was determined to be the sampling period for groundwater and lake water each year the two sampling campaigns were conducted in the badain jaran desert and surrounding areas during july and august 2013 and 2014 respectively it was found that groundwater sampled in the study area was usually shallow with the depth of 200 m during the sampling campaigns table s1 each groundwater sample was taken 50 cm deep below water surface by a stainless steel sampler the groundwater level was on site measured by a water level meter seventy two shallow groundwater samples were totally from the desert hinterland gw 2 and peripheral areas including the gurinai guaizihu region gw 1 ayouqi ayq region including the bada mountain gw 3 and yabulai ybl region including the yabulai mountain gw 4 fig 1a and table s1 by the same sampler twenty one lake samples were taken 30 cm deep below water surface in the central part of desert lakes lw fig 1a and table s1 two weather stations near the badain jaran desert ayq rw 1 and ybl rw 2 which are away from about 100 km between each other were chosen to collect rainwater samples in two hydrological years july 2013 july 2015 fig 1a the rainwater sample was taken by a standard rainwater sampler for each daily precipitation event the sampler was not opened between precipitation events for preventing dust pollution in addition two rainwater samples were collected at the nuoertu lake of the badain jaran desert rw 3 during sampling campaigns one was taken at july 2013 and the other at july 2014 in total there are 131 rainwater samples of which 54 rainwater samples were collected between july 2013 and august 2014 all the samples were stored in polyethylene bottles which have been rinsed by deionized water three times and dried before sampling the ph and ec electrical conductivity values of water samples were measured by a multi parametric analyzer multi 3400i in the field the precisions of ph and ec were 0 03 and 1 μs cm respectively 10 ml of each unfiltered water sample was preserved in a brown glass vial for the h o isotopic measurement gates et al 2008 the residual sample was filtered through a 0 45 μm millipore membrane filter each filtrate was divided into two aliquots one was stored without further treatment for the anion measurement and the other was acidified with ultra pure nitric acid to a ph value around 2 for the measurement of cations the measurement of major cations ca2 mg2 na and k was performed by an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes thermo icp 6300 in the south engineering geological technology research co ltd of east china major anions cl so4 2 and no3 were measured by ionic chromatography ics 2100 in the college of environment hohai university analytical error was 5 for cations and 3 for anions based on the sample reproducibility hco3 was measured by the hcl titration with a precision of 3 within 24 h of sample collection stable isotopes of shallow groundwater lake water and rainwater samples were measured by using a liquid h o isotope spectrometer picarro l2130 i in the institute of tibetan plateau research chinese academy of sciences the precision was 1 for δd and 0 1 for δ18o normalized to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow standard in order to avoid large measurement uncertainties saline lake water samples were completely distilled to be fresh tds 1 g l before isotope measurement horita and gat 1989 gat 2010 yang et al 2010 for shallow groundwater and lake water samples the measured chemical and h o isotopic data are listed in supplementary material table s1 for precipitation samples the chemical data are cited from rao et al 2017 and the h o isotopic values are measured in this study all of the chemical and isotopic data are statistically displayed in table 1 the phreeqc geochemical code is used to compute the saturation indices of calcite dolomite and gypsum in groundwater and lake water parkhurst and appelo 1999 4 results the ph value of rainwater varies from 6 66 to 8 38 with the volume weighted mean value sd of 7 41 0 3 7 37 0 3 and 8 2 0 23 respectively in rw 1 rw 2 and rw 3 table 1 and fig 2 rainwater tends to be more alkaline in rw 3 than in rw 1 and rw 2 the ec value of rainwater changes between 35 μs cm and 1237 μs cm with the volume weighted mean value sd of 137 214 μs cm 181 228 μs cm and 248 11 3 μs cm respectively in rw 1 rw 2 and rw 3 table 1 and fig 2 the ec value of rainwater is greatly discrete in rw 1 and rw 2 the concentrations of major ions vary greatly with large cv coefficient of variation values of significantly 10 particularly in rw 1 and rw 2 table 1 and fig 2 the chemical type of rainwater is different to some degree from one place to another in detail rainwater is of ca2 na so4 2 hco3 type in rw 1 and rw 2 but is of na ca2 hco3 so4 2 type in rw 3 fig 3 a δ18o δd values of rainwater are also greatly variable from 13 8 to 22 3 77 to 168 with the volume weighted mean values of 4 5 5 6 24 43 3 2 5 1 19 35 and 1 1 1 8 12 2 respectively in rw 1 rw 2 and rw 3 table 1 and fig 2 based on the volume weighted isotope values of monthly precipitation calculated by the isotope values and amount of daily precipitation the local meteoric water line lmwl is established as follows δd 7 84δ18o 6 31 r2 0 96 n 35 this lmwl is different from those provided by obtained in previous studies ma et al 2007 gates et al 2008 zhao et al 2012 ma et al 2007 gave a lmwl using 17 precipitation data of this desert and gurinai areas gates et al 2008 took the lmwl of zhangye as that of this desert and zhao et al 2012 established a lmwl based on six precipitation samples from the ayq and desert hinterland in comparison the established lmwl in this study should be more reliable as a reference for investigating groundwater recharge because it is based on isotope data of two hydrological year precipitation in the badain jaran desert lake water has the ph value from 8 20 to 9 98 with the mean value sd of 9 36 0 54 and has the high ec value of 2 3 ms cm 184 ms cm with the mean value of 83 5 64 5 ms cm table 1 na and cl are the two dominant ions in lake water and are high in concentrations table 1 and fig 3b lake water is enriched in δ18o 2 4 11 8 and δd 48 23 with the mean values of 5 7 4 and 3 20 respectively table 1 as listed in table 1 and shown in fig 2 the ph values are from 7 68 to 9 85 for all groundwater samples and are averagely similar in the four groundwater subareas mean value sd gw 1 8 35 0 35 gw 2 8 57 0 42 gw 3 8 4 0 48 and gw 4 8 3 0 5 the ec value of groundwater has a great variability from 541μs cm to 8960 μs cm with the mean value of 1312 1398 μs cm 817 380 μs cm 3096 4300 μs cm 1874 2510 μs cm respectively for gw 1 gw 2 gw 3 and gw 4 table 1 the ec values are basically higher in gw 3 than in other groundwater subareas fig 2 chemical types of groundwater are different in the four subareas as observed in fig 3a nevertheless most of shallow groundwater samples are dominated by na cl reaching up to 90 of total ions table 1 from gw 1 to gw 2 to gw 3 and to gw 4 na cl and so4 2 have roughly identical trends as well as the ec value differing from other ions fig 2 the δ18o δd values of shallow groundwater vary from 11 8 to 4 8 87 to 1 and the mean values are 2 4 2 45 10 2 7 2 1 43 9 6 7 2 4 55 13 6 4 3 5 59 17 respectively for gw 1 gw 2 gw 3 and gw 4 table 1 except for the abnormal values the δ18o and δd values of shallow groundwater are depleted in gw 3 and gw 4 but enriched in gw 1 and gw 2 fig 2 as a whole without the abnormal values the ph ec values and concentrations of most ions na cl so4 2 k mg2 and hco3 are the lowest in rainwater the middle in shallow groundwater and the highest in lake water but ca2 and no3 are not the case fig 2 of the three water bodies lake water has the highest δ18o and δd values and rainwater tends to be more enriched in the stable isotope composition than shallow groundwater fig 2 5 discussion 5 1 the link of shallow groundwater with local precipitation in the ayouqi and yabulai regions 5 1 1 the ayouqi ayq region shallow groundwater of the ayq region has h o isotopic values falling below the local meteoric water line and being close to the isotope values of local precipitation suggesting that shallow groundwater was mainly recharged by local precipitation and suffered from evaporation to some extent fig 4 shallow groundwater has a higher proportion of na k to cl compared to local precipitation fig 5 a meanwhile the na k cl ratios are 1 and the na k so4 2 ratios are mostly between 1 1 and 2 1 for shallow groundwater samples fig 5a and b in addition the ca2 mg2 ratios are 1 1 for most groundwater samples fig 5d therefore the excess na k and ca2 of groundwater suggest that silicates could partly be hydrolyzed in addition to evaporite and carbonate dissolution in the aquifer rao et al 2015 the saturation indices are 0 69 and 1 19 for calcite and dolomite respectively showing that carbonate dissolution is significant in shallow groundwater of the ayq region the ca2 so4 2 ratios are between 1 1 and 1 5 in shallow groundwater fig 5c and the calculated saturation indice of gypsum is 1 14 implying that few gypsums were dissolved into shallow groundwater 5 1 2 the yabulai ybl region as shown in fig 4 the δd and δ18o values are different between shallow groundwater samples collected from the yabulai region and rainwater samples collected from the yabulai ybl weather station isotopic characteristics of rainwater samples collected from the ybl weather station with the elevation of 1250 m can not represent those of precipitation in the yabulai mountain with the maximum elevation of 1957 m because of the elevation effect gu et al 2011 for determining the link between shallow groundwater and local precipitation it is thus necessary to obtain the δd and δ18o values of local precipitation in the yabulai mountain by the precipitation isotope elevation relationship the precipitation isotope elevation relationship in northwest china is established by choosing fifteen representative areas which are under the control of the westerly on the basis of previous studies guo et al 2015 iaea mwo 2016 δ18o 0 0029h 4 83 and δd 0 018h 34 1 fig 6 the δ18o and δd values are calculated to be 10 5 and 69 respectively for precipitation in the top of the yabulai mountain using the above equations the isotope values of the initial source recharging shallow groundwater are 10 3 for δ18o and 74 for δd determined by the gwel lmwl intersection fig 4 and are close to the calculated isotope values of precipitation in the yabulai mountain therefore it is likely that shallow groundwater was recharged by precipitation in the yabulai mountain rather than precipitation at the ybl weather station yang 2006 the mean δ18o and δd values are 6 4 and 59 respectively for shallow groundwater in the ybl region table 1 greatly differing from the isotope values of the initial source obtained by the lmwl gwel intersection point fig 4 moreover the slope of 4 17 in the gwel is observed in the fig 4 négrel and lachassagne 2000 observed a slope of around 4 in a δ18o δd relationship for surface water during dry season flow a pan evaporation experiment of négrel et al 2011 resulted in a similar evaporation line δd 4 19δ18o 9 17 and revealed significant effect of evaporation on surface water the consistency of our result with the previous studies shows that evaporation effect was strong on groundwater in the ybl region cl concentration is a good indicator reflecting the evaporation extent of natural waters herczeg and edmunds 2000 as cl concentration increases δ18o value increases fig 7 further demonstrating significant evaporation of groundwater in the ybl region the molar ratios of na k cl are between 1 1 and 2 1 for most of shallow groundwater samples fig 5a the molar ratios of na k so4 2 are almost 2 1 fig 5b suggesting that some na silicates were dissolved in the aquifer the molar ratios of ca2 so4 2 are between 1 1 and 1 5 fig 5c implying that additional so4 2 came both from gypsum dissolution and from mirabilite dissolution or human contamination most of shallow groundwater samples lie above the dolomite dissolution line indicating calcite and dolomite dissolution as seen in fig 5d the mean saturation indices of calcite and dolomite are 0 56 and 1 03 respectively also supporting this inference the ca2 cl and mg2 cl ratios are mostly from 1 1 to 1 5 in shallow groundwater fig 5e and f showing that halite or sea salt dissolution is more significant than carbonate dissolution in the aquifer furthermore yang 2006 pointed out that the age of groundwater is not older than 100 years in terms of 3h analyses in addition field investigations showed that there are plenty of shallow groundwater and spring water with low ec values in the yabulai mountain completely different from groundwater with high ec values in the ayq region table s1 as a result shallow groundwater was probably recharged by precipitation infiltration through rock fractures in the yabulai mountain where aquifer weathering could be in the stage of evaporite and carbonate dissolution 5 2 the relationship between shallow groundwater and lake water in the desert hinterland most of lakes are perennial in the desert hinterland the amount of local precipitation was monitored to be too small to maintain the perennial lakes wang et al 2013 dong et al 2016 as shown in fig 4 the δ18o and δd values of lake water are plotted along the groundwater evaporation line although they are obviously more enriched than those of shallow groundwater suggesting a common origin lakes formed earlier but groundwater was young in the desert hinterland yang and williams 2003 chen et al 2004 wu 2014 field investigations showed that springs and travertines are well developed in and around the desert lakes moreover the water level of groundwater is higher than that of lake water fig 8 in addition the lower ion concentrations of shallow groundwater than those of lake water are hard to be interpreted if lake water recharged groundwater table 1 therefore lake water should be recharged by groundwater in the desert hinterland ma and edmunds 2006 liu et al 2016 luo et al 2016 lake water has more na k and cl with lower molar ratios of ca2 cl and mg2 cl 1 5 relative to shallow groundwater in the desert hinterland fig 5a e and f implying the dominance of evaporite dissolution the ca2 mg2 ratio is 1 5 in lake water while it is between the 1 5 line and dolomite dissolution line in shallow groundwater in the desert hinterland fig 5d furthermore the mean saturation indices of lake water and shallow groundwater are 0 91 and 0 51 respectively for calcite and are 3 34 and 1 0 respectively for dolomite these results would indicate that more calcite and dolomite were dissolved into lake water local precipitation should also be a source contributing ions to lake water although it is small and its ion concentrations are low table 1 therefore the higher ion concentrations of lake water compared to shallow groundwater can be ascribed to mineral dissolution and precipitation input in addition to surface evaporation table 1 5 3 the recharge source of shallow groundwater in the desert hinterland some authors proposed that groundwater was recharged by snowmelt of the qilian mountains through deep faults chen et al 2004 however the intersection point values of the gwel and lmwl are apparently different from the δ18o and δd values of snowmelt and river water from the qilian mountains and tibetan plateau fig 4 the ionic compositions are also different between shallow groundwater of the badain jaran desert and snowmelt river water of the qilian mountains and tibetan plateau as shown in figs 3 and 5 consequently from isotopic and hydrogeochemical perspectives it is concluded that shallow groundwater of the desert hinterland is not essentially associated with snowmelt of the qilian mountains and tibetan plateau in fact it is difficult for snowmelt of the qilian mountains to recharge the desert hinterland groundwater because multiple compressed fractures develop in the front zones of the qilian mountains zhang and ming 2006 several mountains such as beida and yabulai separating the badain jaran desert from the hexi corridor could also be barriers preventing groundwater movement from the qilian mountains to desert hinterland some authors emphasized that local precipitation was the main recharge source of groundwater in the desert hinterland yang and williams 2003 however as shown in figs 2 and 4 the δ18o and δd values of precipitation and shallow groundwater in the desert hinterland are different and do not plot on the same evaporation line furthermore major ion concentrations of the two water bodies are distinct in the region table 1 figs 3 and 5 thus the hydrogeochemical and isotopic results disagree with the viewpoint of yang and williams 2003 ma and edmunds 2006 determined a mean infiltration rate of modern precipitation of 0 95 mm y 1 33 mm y in the badain jaran desert using a chloride mass balance technique gates et al 2008 and dong et al 2016 also confirmed that direct infiltration of local precipitation had little contribution to shallow groundwater in this desert our results together with previous studies actually imply the insignificance of precipitation events to desert groundwater since 90 precipitation events were quite small with a mean amount of 5 mm d in 2010 2011 wang et al 2013 as shown in fig 4 the δ18o and δd values are plotted on the same evaporation line for shallow groundwater in the gurinai guaizihu region gw 1 desert hinterland gw 2 and ybl region gw 4 this indicates a common source of shallow groundwater in the three areas the gwel lmwl intersection point indicates the initial recharge source of groundwater in the desert hinterland fig 4 in terms of the δ18o altitude relationship fig 6 the mean recharge altitude of shallow groundwater in the desert hinterland is calculated to be 1869 m surrounding the badain jaran desert the yabulai mountain is 1957 m a s l the zongnai mountain is 1400 m a s l and the beida mountains are from 2000 to 2500 m a s l huang 2007 the qilian mountains 500 km away from this desert have higher altitudes of 4000 6000 m a s l the calculated recharge altitude of groundwater agrees well with the yabulai mountain rather than other mountains showing that shallow groundwater in the desert hinterland originated most likely from the yabulai mountain the terrain elevation decreases gradually from the yabulai mountain to desert hinterland and to gurinai guaizihu region ma and edmunds 2006 gates et al 2008 jiao et al 2015 the water level of groundwater also has a similar variation to the terrain elevation fig 9 thus shallow groundwater flowed from the yabulai mountain to desert hinterland and to gurinai guaizihu region since shallow groundwater of the yabulai mountain was recharged by local precipitation as discussed in section 5 1 2 lateral infiltration of the yabulai mountain precipitation should be a dominant source of shallow groundwater in the desert hinterland fig 1b in theory δ18o δd and ion concentrations of groundwater should increase from the yabulai mountain to desert hinterland and to gurinai guaizihu region due to evaporation if there are not additional sources including local precipitation in fact it is not the case for ion concentrations and h o isotope values in groundwater fig 10 from the yabulai mountain to desert hinterland the increases of δ18o δd indicate evaporation effect and the decreases of ion concentrations point to dilution effect the weak correlation of cl with δ18o indicates the occurrence of an additional source fig 7 hydrological experiments demonstrated the high permeability of dune sand the saturation permeability coefficient of 10 m d at the dune depth of 60 cm in the badain jaran desert dai 2014 furthermore heavy precipitation of 20 mm d occasionally happened in summer according to the monitor data of wang et al 2013 a recent study also highlighted the importance of heavy precipitation to desert groundwater hou et al 2016 local precipitation has lower ion concentrations and higher δ18o δd relative to groundwater table 1 thus it particularly occasional heavy precipitation could be such an additional source impacting groundwater chemistry in the desert hinterland further na k cl so4 2 concentrations in groundwater increase while δ18o ca2 and mg2 concentrations do not greatly change from the desert hinterland to gurinai guaizihu region fig 10 the main causes of these phenomena can be interpreted as follows 1 the evaporation effect evidenced by the δ18o cl relationship of groundwater fig 7 could not be dominantly responsible for spatial variations of the stable isotopes and ion concentrations probably because groundwater flowed under the dune sand layers fig 10 2 heavy precipitation with low ion concentrations and higher δ18o occasionally happened and thus had the dilution effect on ion concentrations to some degree but did not greatly affect δ18o in groundwater 3 it was observed that abundant evaporites e g halite mirabilite developed in the gurinai guaizihu region by field campaigns and these minerals were easily dissolved into groundwater leading to the increase of na k cl and so4 2 rather than ca2 and mg2 6 conclusion the chemical and h o isotopic characteristics of rainwater lake water and shallow groundwater in the badain jaran desert and surrounding areas are investigated in detail shallow groundwater is alkaline and has the ph and ec values between those of rainwater and lake water na and cl are the major ions of shallow groundwater and lake water while rainwater is enriched in ca2 and so4 2 of the three water bodies lake water has the highest δ18o and δd values and rainwater tends to be more enriched in the stable isotope composition than shallow groundwater shallow groundwater was mainly recharged by local precipitation in terms of the h o isotopic and hydrogeochemical analyses and evaporite and carbonate dissolution is significant to groundwater chemistry in the ayouqi ayq region in the yabulai ybl region halite or sea salt dissolution is more significant than carbonate dissolution to groundwater chemistry the new equation for describing the precipitation isotope elevation effect in northwest china is established as δ18o 0 0029h 4 83 and δd 0 018h 34 1 the h o isotope values of precipitation in the yabulai mountain are recovered by the equations and are close to the intersection point of the gwel and lmwl indicating the initial recharge source of groundwater in the ybl region therefore shallow groundwater of the ybl region was recharged by precipitation at the yabulai mountain rather than at or near the ybl weather station the chemical and h o isotopic investigation in combination with the lake water level shows that lake water was recharged by groundwater in the desert hinterland hydrogeochemical variations from groundwater to lake water are a combined result of mineral dissolution the input of local precipitation and surface evaporation the δ18o and δd values of shallow groundwater are plotted along a same evaporation line for the gurinai guaizihu region desert hinterland and ybl region suggesting a common recharge source the isotopic and hydrogeological evidence reveals that shallow groundwater of the desert hinterland sourced mainly from lateral infiltration of precipitation in the yabulai mountain and then flowed towards the gurinai guaizihu region along the flow pathway the variations of δ18o values were related to evaporation effect and the increases of na k cl and so4 2 in groundwater are probably caused by aquifer evaporite dissolution in addition to evaporation effect whereas the decreases of ca2 and mg2 were mainly associated with dilution effect of occasional heavy precipitation this study not only provides the policymakers with a deep understanding of the regional water cycle for improving local water resource management but also affords a useful

7424,due to the non vascular nature of sphagnum mosses the capitula growing surface of the moss must rely solely on capillary action to receive water from beneath moss subsides and swells in accordance with water table levels an effect called mire breathing which has been thought to be a self preservation mechanism although no systematic studies have been done to demonstrate exactly how volume change affects hydrophysical properties of moss in this study the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kunsat and water content of two different species of sphagnum moss were measured at different compression rates up to the maximum of 77 the findings show that the kunsat increases by up to an order of magnitude 10 with compression up to a certain bulk density of the moss after which higher levels of compression result in lowered unsaturated hydraulic conductivity this was coupled with an increase in soil water retention with increased compression the increase of the kunsat with compression suggests that the mire breathing effect should be considered a self preservation mechanism to provide sufficient amount of water to growing moss in times of low water availability

peat moss compression 1 introduction peatlands are organic wetlands national wetlands working group 1997 and cover approximately 3 5 million km2 worldwide mitsch and gosselink 2015 representing a large carbon storage turunen et al 2002 hydrology plays an important role in forming and maintaining the carbon storage in peatlands because peat the poorly decomposed organic matter is formed in anaerobic conditions beneath the water table for over a century peatlands have been harvested for peat for use in agriculture and as an energy source mitsch and gosselink 2015 sphagnum moss is the climax species in peatlands zoltai and pollett 1983 and due to the non vascular nature of sphagnum mosses no root structure the capitula the surface living layer must rely solely on capillary action to receive water from beneath hayward and clymo 1982 there are three dominant sphagnum moss species in canada fuscum rubellum and magellanicum mccarter and price 2014 fuscum and rubellum are hummock species and they grow higher above the water level than magellanicum which as lawn specie grows closer to water hummock forming species particularly sphagnum fuscum have higher shoot density bengtsson et al 2016 conduct and retain more water at low water levels than non hummock species such as magellanicum clymo 1973 mccarter and price 2014 sufficient water availability is essential for the growth of the capitula sphagnum fuscum can retain relatively moist capitula even with a 40 cm deepwater table while sphagnum magellanicum desiccates at this water level mccarter and price 2014 how fast moss transfers water under the capillary action is represented by the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kunsat cm s 1 which depends on volumetric water content θ soil water pressure head ψ pore geometry as well as the gradient of the water potential hayward and clymo 1982 price et al 2008 van genuchten 1980 mire breathing is a seasonal natural change in the surface elevation of peatlands with changing water levels ingram 1983 mire breathing is thought to be a self preservation mechanism of peatlands to access water during the periods of low water availability such as in the dry season schothorst 1977 when the water level is high peat and moss swell thus increasing their volume and raising the surface an increased peat volume can create bigger pores that allow water to drain more easily conversely when the water level is low moss shrinks lowering the surface decreasing its volume which consequently creates smaller pores boelter 1968 it was suggested that the decrease of pore sizes increases the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in moss mccarter and price 2014 and consequently increases the amount of water received by the capitula mccarter and price 2015 although no systematic work has been done to show this relationship recent work in restored peatlands has also indicated a disconnection between the newly establishing moss layer acrotelm and the old remnant cutover surface mccarter and price 2015 taylor and price 2015 even though water is available near the surface of cutover peat the young moss cannot provide enough water to the capitula due to the kunsat θ and the water potential being limited by the large proportion of macropores mccarter and price 2014 taylor and price 2015 it was hypothesised that compression of moss would raise the kunsat as has been shown to happen in mineral soils berli et al 2008 horn et al 1995 radcliffe and rasmussen 2002 richard et al 2001 which means that the capitula would receive more water and thus grow more mccarter and price 2015 understanding how volume change of sphagnum mosses affects the kunsat and volumetric water content could explain the mire breathing as a self preservation mechanism as well as help in peatland restoration therefore the objectives of this paper are to systematically reduce volume of moss via compression and measure the kunsat and volumetric water content response at different compression levels and to quantify how compression of moss affects both the kunsat and water content 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site two large monoliths of sphagnum moss were collected from undisturbed peatlands located near whitemouth in south eastern manitoba canada the first sample was identified as sphagnum fuscum henceforth known as fuscum or fus and the second sample was identified as sphagnum magellanicum known as magellanicum or mag m c leblanc and l rochefort personal communication the coordinates were 49 55 39 6 n 96 14 33 2 w for fuscum and 49 47 07 5 n 95 57 49 9 w for magellanicum during the collection of the samples specific moss types were not targeted although it was elected to take moss from a hummock and a lawn in order to expand the dataset the samples happened to be sphagnum fuscum and sphagnum magellanicum the fuscum sample was from a bog mound surrounded by a fen and magellanicum sample was from a treed bog a large pit 80 cm 50 cm 60 cm was dug with a hand saw immediately adjacent to the selected moss and the monoliths 70 cm 40 cm 50 cm were carefully removed from the pit and placed in plastic containers and brought to the laboratory the adjacent pit was used to allow access to the bottom of the sample so that the saw could cut the bottom of the sample the samples were frozen unsaturated in a chest freezer in order to preserve them and to allow for easier cutting into smaller samples 2 2 sample preparation four cylindrical samples 10 cm diameter and 15 cm tall were cut from each of the monoliths and run for the ksat and kunsat tests without compression which are not part of this study these 15 cm samples were frozen again and then cut into three smaller samples herein referred to as the cores of 5 cm height for a total of 24 cores 12 cores each from the magellanicum and fuscum samples which were used in this study the height of 5 cm was chosen as it is common practice in laboratory work on sphagnum mosses mccarter et al 2017 2 3 methods volume change of moss was achieved by compressing samples vertically between the tension disks of the kunsat apparatus the amount of compression for the samples can be found in table 1 note that in terms of core volume 0 compression means uncompressed original volume and 12 20 etc of compression means 12 20 etc reduction of original volume or in other words volume reduction to 88 80 etc of the original volume for example a 5 cm core would be compressed 0 6 cm 0 6 5 12 for the 12 compression level the range of 70 77 for magellanicum is due to the use of a hydraulic press for maximum compression not used with fuscum the actual compression rate under the press was over 95 as soon as the weight from the press was released the moss expanded and the final compression rate varied between 70 and 77 among the magellanicum cores due to different bulk densities while moss expanded under all compression rates without confinement the kunsat and ksat apparatuses were able to hold the compressed moss and maintain any compression rate up to the maximum of 70 77 in case of magellanicum both the ksat ψ 0 cm and kunsat of the cores were measured for each compression rate at each of the different pressure heads ψ table 1 the wide range of the initial bulk densities allowed for the creation of a diverse dataset fuscum core 4 was not run at 60 compression rate due to time constraints the magellanicum cores had a smaller number of compression stages and pressure heads due to the laborious work involved with the results from the fuscum cores completed first the compression and pressure head levels chosen for the magellanicum cores were selected so they would not jeopardize the trends in the values but save considerable time for example there were 12 fuscum cores tested at 6 different compression rates and at 9 pressure heads minus 9 measurements at 60 for core 4 resulting in 639 separate measurements each measurement was conducted for at least 3 h except for ψ0 cm which was only 30 min in duration this does not consider the setup take down between pressure heads compression steps with the magellanicum cores the number of measurements was reduced nearly in half to 360 12 cores 5 compression levels 6 pressure heads it was deemed acceptable to have different compression rates and pressure heads for fuscum and magellanicum because this study did not originally set out to focus on a direct comparison between the two moss types 2 4 unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in order to determine the kunsat ψ of moss an apparatus with two tension disks was built for a complete description of this measurement method refer to the modified method in mccarter et al 2017 which is an updated version of the original method outlined in price et al 2008 in short a moss core was confined between two water saturated tension disks fig 1 a with a synthetic mesh membrane with pore sizes of 25 µm that allowed water to pass through but not air at any given pressure head used in this study 4 cm to 32 cm the water flow through the sample was maintained by the difference in the elevation head between the disks i e the modified method outlined in mccarter et al 2017 the core was encapsulated in a pvc tube split on one side to allow for easy access to the sample but during the test was closed with hose clamps to eliminate exposure to open air as well as to prevent the compressed moss cores from expansion after each measurement was complete the core was weighed and tension disks were washed all cores were watered from above until water began draining from the bottom of the cores prior to being closed in the pvc tubes in order to compensate for possible drainage and evaporation of water from the cores while the tension disks were being washed the modified method was chosen as it ensures a constant pressure head across the core as the flow is driven by the elevation head not the pressure head mccarter et al 2017 in the original method the flow is driven by both the pressure and elevation heads and thus a pressure head gradient exists within the core between the tension disks as the ultimate goal of this study was to understand the changes in the kunsat and θ with compression the authors did not want to introduce additional uncertainties as to how compression may impact the pressure head gradient in the moss profile if the original method was used based on a temperature logger in the room the temperature of water in the system was around 20 c room temperature and varied 1 5 c with all moss samples removed the system was cleaned with chlorine once a week to kill algae and replaced with clean water due to water loss in the water reservoirs via evaporation new clean water was added to the system throughout the tests distilled water was used in the apparatus to prevent accumulation of dissolved minerals from tap water such as calcium on the surface of the tension disks although the surface tension of distilled water is lower than those of natural peatlands or tap water dissolved particles and elements from the moss cores would have increased the surface tension the use of distilled water is thought to have a negligible effect on the results calculation of the kunsat cm s 1 was based on the darcy buckingham equation for unsaturated flow raats and van genuchten 2006 1 q k unsat d ψ dx 1 where q is the specific discharge cm s 1 dψ is the pressure head difference between the inflow and outflow tension disks cm and dx is the height of the sample cm the specific discharge was found as volumetric discharge rate q cm3 s 1 per cross sectional area a cm2 of the sample 2 q q a because the modified method of the kunsat apparatus was designed to eliminate the pressure head gradient within the sample mccarter et al 2017 meaning that there was only one ψ throughout the sample dψ in eq 1 is equal to 0 with this simplification and substitution of eq 2 into eq 1 the kunsat can be expresses as 3 k unsat q a additionally a simple extension of darcy s law eq 4 into unsaturated conditions also leads to eq 3 4 q ka dh dx where q is discharge cm3 s 1 k is hydraulic conductivity cm s 1 a is the cross sectional area of the sample cm2 dh is the change in hydraulic head cm between the inflow and outflow disks dx is the height of the sample cm because the change in hydraulic head was set to be the same as the height of the sample mccarter et al 2017 dh dx thus dh dx 1 consequently simplifying eq 4 and solving it for k results in eq 3 measuring the outflow from the apparatus was time consuming as discharge amounts were very small and episodic as the water had to overcome the surface tension in the erlenmeyer flask to discharge an automated system was designed to allow for continuous measurements of the twelve cores running simultaneously an arduino microcontroller was programmed to measure discharge from the cores fig 1b the microcontroller operated 12 solenoid valves one for each core with a known volume cm3 and a water level sensor in each valve the water level sensor consisted of two copper wires and if water reached both wires fig 1d it completed an electric circuit indicating that the known volume in a particular valve was full the arduino system opened the given valve to discharge the accumulated water closed the valve and began measuring the time until the water reached the sensor again the time that it took to fill a given volume in a valve was sent via a usb connection to a personal computer where it was logged in a text file for further processing the volume in each valve was known and accounted for and ranged between 5 and 6 cm3 due to small difference in sensor placement the volumes were systematically checked once a week when the cores were run under a new compression rate to ensure no drift in volume occurred 2 5 saturated hydraulic conductivity the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat indicates how fast water moves inside moss under saturated conditions when all pores in moss are filled with water which occurs at pressure heads ψ 0 cm a separate apparatus without the tension disks was designed to determine the saturated hydraulic conductivity fig 2 the use of tap water instead of distilled water in this apparatus was deemed to have an insignificant effect on the ksat because compared to the kunsat tests the ksat tests were of very short duration and with high flow rates for the ksat tests the water flow path was a to b to c to d fig 2 and a moss core was placed in container d where it was confined with disks that were cut from pipette holders to ensure the core stayed intact but that no impediment to flow occurred grid spacing of the pipette holder was 1 cm the multiple reservoirs were used to reduce the effect of flowing water i e the pressure of the water from the tap if placed directly into d would influence the discharge leaving the system water discharge q from container d was measured at three hydraulic head differences i e by moving b c up or down the head differences were different depending on the test density of the sample and the amount of compression but ranged between 3 and 12 mm for lower compression less dense moss up to 25 35 and 50 mm for higher compression denser moss as flow was much slower through the core the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat was calculated based on the slope of a line fitted to the function q cm s 1 vs dh dx cm cm 1 where q is the specific discharge eq 2 in order to increase the precision in the measurements of water levels and pressure heads over the lateral distances between the inflow outflow containers e g as seen on fig 1b in both the kunsat and ksat apparatuses one or two additional graduated cylinders were connected via siphon to the inflow outflow containers not shown in figs 1 and 2 and the water levels were actually measured in the graduated cylinders because the water levels in the cylinders were the same as in the containers as a result it was possible to set the water levels between the containers within a 1 mm limit 3 results a comment on the presentation of the results the authors feel that looking at the trends between all 24 cores split 12 and 12 for fuscum magellanicum is more instructive than at the data of any individual core thus fig 3 illustrates the mean values of all 12 cores per moss type with a 95 confidence interval shown as a grey area however the authors acknowledge that some readers may be interested in seeing individual differences and thus a single individual core core 10 from the magellanicum dataset was elected to show the raw data see appendix a mccarter et al 2017 showed that the flow impedance of the tension disks has to be accounted for during the measurements close to saturation e g ψ 4 cm for fuscum and ψ 5 cm for magellanicum however the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of any core never came close to the maximum values of permeability of the tension disks used in this study therefore the impedance on the flow was ruled out the highest kunsat value among all 24 cores was still 25 below the tension disk flow impedance value the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat for fuscum cores decreased from 2 5 100 to 0 5 100 cm s 1 fig 3a ψ 0 cm the values of the kunsat increased with increased compression from 10 5 to 10 4 cm s 1 at the lowest pressure head ψ 32cm with increased compression the variability in the kunsat measurements decreased as evidenced by the smaller 95 confidence interval at the higher compressions volumetric water content θ of fuscum cores fig 3c increased with compression but unlike the kunsat the variability in θ increased with compression indicated by a greater 95 confidence interval while there was an increase of θ at 12 compared to 0 fig 3c the values of the kunsat at 12 were slightly below the values at 0 fig 3a which is contrary to the general trend it is uncertain what led to the decreased kunsat in this case the general trends found in fuscum cores were also observed in magellanicum cores fig 3b and d however the ksat decreased more rapidly from 1 7 100 cm s 1 to 2 10 3 cm s 1 fig 3b although it was hypothesised that increased compression would increase the kunsat a significant decrease of the kunsat values was observed for the 60 and 70 77 compression rates fig 3b at ψ 17 cm water content in the magellanicum cores at ψ 32 cm fig 3d increased to the maximum θr residual water content of 0 80 0 85 cm3 cm 3 or about 25 higher than fuscum cores similar to the kunsat θ also decreased for the 70 77 compression rate at ψ 17 cm when compared to the previous compression rates fig 3d at the highest compression rate 70 77 in the magellanicum cores both the kunsat and water content θ varied very little i e the lines were more horizontal throughout all unsaturated pressure heads steps ψ 5 cm ψ 32 cm the smoothed plots fig 4 a and b for fuscum and magellanicum respectively were created after applying the loess method in the r analytical package r core team 2017 the grey area is a 95 confidence interval for the fuscum samples the range in hydraulic conductivity from saturation to the residual water content decreased between 6 and 4 orders of magnitude fig 4a depending on the compression level lower range with higher compression note how the curves shift to the right with increasing compression relative to the dashed line representing 0 5 cm3 cm 3 of the volumetric water content similar trends are seen within the magellanicum samples fig 4b though the range in k decrease is more pronounced changing from 6 to 2 orders of magnitude from 0 to 70 77 compression respectively mostly at the expense of the ksat the fuscum and magellanicum samples showed similar trends but yielded different results under compression figs 3 and 4 a convenient proxy for compression is bulk density ρb under the same compression rate a moss sample of high bulk density compresses to a lesser degree than a sample of low bulk density the bulk densities of the 12 uncompressed fuscum cores were between 0 016 and 0 021 g cm 3 with the average density of 0 018 g cm 3 table 1 the bulk density of the 12 uncompressed magellanicum cores ranged from 0 018to 0 033 g cm 3 with an average value of 0 028 g cm 3 comparing the average densities of the uncompressed samples the magellanicum samples were 55 denser than the fuscum samples the maximum bulk density under compression for the fuscum cores was 0 054 g cm 3 while for the magellanicum cores it was 0 123 g cm 3 table 1 the relationships between the hydraulic conductivity and water content with bulk density for both moss types are overlain for a direct comparison fig 5 a and b respectively the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kunsat increased with increasing bulk density for the fuscum samples fig 5a but with the magellanicum samples the kunsat firstly increases and then started to decrease after a bulk density between 0 045 and 0 105 g cm 3 depending on the pressure head with lower pressure heads having the inflection point at higher bulk densities for example for magellanicum samples at ψ 5 cm the decrease started at 0 045 g cm 3 and for ψ 32 cm the decrease began at 0 105 g cm 3 volumetric water content for the fuscum samples generally increased linearly from 0 17 0 25 cm3 cm 3 to 0 6 0 94 cm3 cm 3 with the increasing bulk densities fig 5b volumetric water content in the magellanicum samples increased from 0 3 cm3 cm 3 to 0 85 cm3 cm 3 within the bulk density range of 0 018 g cm 3 0 12 g cm 3 fig 5b the lower the pressure head ψ was the higher the bulk density had to be to reach the maximum θ for ψ 5 cm θ increased to the maximum of 0 9 cm3 cm 3 at 0 07 g cm 3 while for the lowest pressure head ψ 32 cm θ reached the maximum value of 0 85 cm3 cm 3 at 0 12 g cm 3 for ψ 5 cm θ decreased after its inflection value of 0 9 cm3 cm 3 at 0 07 g cm 3 0 8 cm3 cm 3 at 0 12 g cm 3 at the maximum density of 0 12 g cm 3 there was little variation within 0 1 cm3 cm 3 of θ values among all unsaturated pressure heads from ψ 5 cm to ψ 32 cm despite the two different types of sphagnum mosses there was a considerable overlap between the relationships of the hydraulic conductivity k and water content θ with bulk density for the two sets of samples fig 5a and b it is important to recall that the magellanicum samples were run at a different sequence of pressure heads to reduce the number of tests as such it is difficult to say if the small differences that do exist are due to moss differences or pressure head differences as the only overlapping pressure heads were 0 24 and 32 cm at 24 and 32 cm pressure heads the kunsat of fuscum cores was above that of magellanicum cores at densities from 0 02 to 0 04 g cm 3 while being lower at densities from 0 04 to 0 055 g cm 3 these differences ranged from 30 above to 5 below however the ksat at ψ0 cm was nearly identical the fuscum samples also showed a greater increase in volumetric water content than the magellanicum sample with increased density fig 5b although volumetric water content was similar at a bulk density of 0 02 g cm 3 4 discussion most sphagnum mosses grow in the unsaturated conditions present above the water table and experience water saturated conditions only in the spring during snowmelt or heavy rain anthropogenic disturbances notwithstanding peatlands are well suited to shed water in times of surplus due to the extremely high ksat of the surface acrotelm layer therefore this study focuses on the kunsat as it is more relevant and important for surficial sphagnum moss health during the growing season when water tables are lower compression did not affect the porosity of moss much as porosity remained near 90 95 throughout the experiments fig 5b ψ 0 cm therefore the observed changes in k and θ were not dependent on the porosity as much but rather on the pore size distribution and interconnections between the pores this was not surprising given that peat not moss from several metres deep and heavily decomposed can still have a porosity of 85 mccarter and price 2015 physical changes in the structure of moss under compression resulted in a general decrease of the ksat ψ 0 cm increase of the kunsat and increase of volumetric water content θ fig 5 as compression progresses which is represented here by the increasing bulk density big pores become smaller the reduction of the larger pores where the most saturated flow occurred led to the reduction in the ksat fig 5a ψ 0 cm which is in accordance with the modified marshall hydraulic conductivity equation for saturated conductivity rawls et al 1993 where the reduction in the ksat is shown to be proportional to the reduction of the pore radius and pore size classes contributing to the saturated flow because small pores have a greater capillary force than larger pores water in smaller pores holds onto the pore walls more tightly consequently it is harder to drain water from such pores even at low ψ thus increasing water content θ fig 5b the similarity of θ values at bulk densities around 0 12 g cm 3 means that the pores retain the same amount of water at ψ 5 cm and at ψ 32 cm fig 5b with compression the pores that were previously empty or partly filled become filled to a greater extent or completely filled with water which creates more interconnected water films within the moss structure and as a result of the higher water content allows more water transfer hence the increased kunsat values fig 5a it was fortunate that the magellanicum samples were denser than the fuscum samples because had this study only been completed on fuscum samples the inflection point where further compression reduced the kunsat would not have been identified with the magellanicum samples it was possible to actually observe the decrease of the kunsat values under excessive compression fig 5a as the authors previously predicted the pores become so small that they begin to limit the flow of water as seen at ψ 5 cm fig 5a where the kunsat peaks at the bulk density of 0 045 g cm 3 after which it begins to decline with further compression although excessive compression e g bulk density above 0 06 g cm 3 can result in a lowered kunsat it is impossible to maintain that compression rate in the field without physical constraints in fact at the bois des bel peatland restoration site in quebec a trial was conducted in a small section to improve the hydrologic connectivity see below by driving a tractor across the peatland in the winter crushing the 20 cm deep new moss layer that has grown in the past 15 years the maximum moss bulk density that was achieved was 0 048 g cm 3 with an average of 0 03 g cm 3 and only represented a 42 increase in bulk density mccarter and gauthier personal communication the range of the bulk densities of the fuscum sample under compression was about 1 3 of the bulk densities found in the magellanicum sample despite being different moss types and different initial bulk densities both samples showed similar trends in the kunsat particularly in the range between 0 02 and 0 06 g cm 3 as seen by the overlapping lines fig 5a it is most likely that further compression above 60 of fuscum cores would have resulted in the decline of the kunsat similar to magellanicum it is difficult to differentiate the kunsat of fuscum and magellanicum samples because their values overlap within their 95 confidence intervals fig 5a and due to different ψ used however at ψ 24 cm and ψ 32 cm the magellanicum sample had higher kunsat values than fuscum for the initial bulk densities fig 5a bulk density 0 03 g cm 3 which was also observed by mccarter and price 2014 some differences between the two species were observed in water content the fuscum sample retained more water than the magellanicum sample for the same bulk density fig 5b for ψ 24 cm and ψ 32 cm the slope of the lines for fuscum is also greater than for magellanicum indicating that fuscum sample is more sensitive to compression the differences are most likely due to morphological differences of the moss samples although the authors are not aware of studies that have shown the effects of morphology of fuscum and magellanicum on their hydrological properties as a hummock specie fuscum has denser shoots than magellanicum bengtsson et al 2016 and under compression there are more surface interactions and a higher number of smaller pores which retain more water at lower ψ than in magellanicum consequently greater water content at low ψ allows fuscum to sustain its capitula under stress which has also been shown in other studies bengtsson et al 2016 mccarter and price 2014 schipperges and rydin 1998 with the laboratory data available for modelling it would be instructive to see whether the observed compression appreciably increases water availability to the capitula while a rigorous modelling exercise that includes real time peat volume change is important see nijp et al 2017 it is beyond the scope of this paper the authors have elected to use a simple 1 d model retc and hydrus 1d to model the changes in the pressure head distribution and moisture content of moss with and without compression fig 6 the water retention and hydraulic conductivity data from magellanicum core 10 fig a1 and fuscum core 10 not shown were used in retc retention curve to generate the α n and l parameters table 2 required for hydrus 1d within retc the authors used the van genuchten m 1 1 n model fit all water flow parameters but the saturated water content and adjusted the weighting of the points as needed with a bias towards getting the lower points ψ less than 15 cm to fit the curve better than the higher pressure points in hydrus 1d the simulation was completed on water flow in a 1 layer 10 cm deep system with a constant head lower boundary simulating a water table of 30 cm below the surface and a 4 mm day evaporative flux as the upper boundary condition atmospheric boundary condition with surface layer for a total of 10 days this assumes that the 5 cm moss sample was applicable to the full 10 cm layer modelled here the single porosity model of van genuchten mualem was selected the hyaline cells of sphagnum moss can drain at pressure heads below 100 cm hayward and clymo 1982 leading to the desiccation of the capitula top 2 cm the modelling results show that without compression 0 the capitula of fuscum at 2 cm would have a pressure head below 100 cm fig 6a while the pressure head of magellanicum would decrease below 100 cm only in the upper 1 cm fig 6b meaning that the capitula of both mosses would dry when considering compression however the pressure head and water content fig 6c and d of the capitula in both mosses improved for the fuscum sample at 1 cm below the surface the pressure heads were 167 102 and 75 cm for the 0 12 and 24 compression amounts respectively and at 2 cm were 102 63 and 49 cm respectively so that only the upper 1 cm fell below the 100 cm threshold for compressions of 36 and 48 no part of the moss profile fell below 100 cm although magellanicum had a greater initial bulk density of 0 032 g cm 3 than fuscum its capitula still desiccated at 0 compression however only 20 compression was required to keep the profile greater than 100 cm the capitula of fuscum had a much greater pressure head 50 cm at approximately the same bulk density 0 032 g cm 3 or an average of the 36 and 48 compression steps fig 6a most likely the hydrophysical differences between fuscum and magellanicum for the same bulk density could be due to morphological differences illustrating that fuscum is more resistant to water table drawdown can retain more water and can keep up the evaporative demand which was also observed in other studies mccarter and price 2014 2013 these examples show that volume change of moss plays an important role of providing more water to capitula in times of stress such as during water table drawdown 5 limitations the measurement of water content at ψ0 cm saturated state for highly compressed samples was less accurate because the volume of the cores was small enough to make a 1 g measurement difference result in a several percent difference of the volumetric water content also even though 24 moss cores were analysed in this work they represent only 2 types of sphagnum mosses s fuscum and s magellanicum 6 conclusion volume change via compression resulted in improved hydrological properties of moss such as the kunsat and θ therefore the mire breathing should be considered a self preservation response mechanism to dry weather and lowered water tables as moss subsides not only does it come closer to the underlying water surface but it also increases the moisture content and water transfer upwards because water to the capitula moves under the atmospheric evaporative demand very low ψ if sphagnum moss did not subside upon drying then θ and the kunsat could decrease to such a degree that the water transfer to the growing capitula would cease and as a result the evaporative demand from the atmosphere would desiccate the hyaline cells leading to plant death compression of moss could also be helpful in the restoration of peatlands one of the challenges in peatland restoration is that the newly established moss does not receive enough water for its growth from the underlying cutover catotelm peat mccarter and price 2013 the large pores of the new moss are unable to draw water from the small pores of the remnant catotelm cutover peat surface it could be possible

the acknowledgements section of submission including grant numbers where appropriate appendix a core 10 was selected from the magellanicum dataset as it was roughly average among the cores in terms of bulk density values to show in detail how compression affected the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and water content in a single core fig a1 being average in the bulk density did not always result in being average for the kunsat and θ values though no other single core did either the uncompressed bulk density of core 10 was 0 031 g cm 3 and 0 123 g cm 3 for the maximum compression 74 a roughly 4 fold increase fig a1c and d with increased compression the ksat decreased fig a1a ψ0 cm from 3 100 cm s 1 to 3 10 3 cm s 1 whereas the kunsat showed a non linear dependence for the higher pressure heads ψ 5 cm and ψ 10 cm fig a1a the kunsat firstly increased with compression up to 40 green gold and red lines were above one another and with further compression the kunsat generally decreased pink blue and green lines were below one another with the kunsat at ψ 10 cm remaining the same for 40 and 60 for the lowest ψ 32 cm the kunsat increased from 1 4 10 6 cm s 1 at 0 to 1 4 10 4 cm s 1 at 74 though the rate of the increase slowed down with compression also note that with compression the lines become more horizontal suggesting that the higher the compression level is the more similar the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity tends to be at all pressure heads for a given compression rate similar to the trend in the kunsat water content θ fig a1b became more uniform under compression throughout all ψ and reached its residual water content more quickly the 74 compression rate also brought the sample closer to saturation with 0 9 cm3 cm 3 water content throughout all ψ for example at ψ 32 cm water content was 0 85 cm3 cm 3 and it increased almost 3 times compared to uncompressed moss 0 27 cm3 cm 3 looking at the effects of compression on the kunsat via the bulk density fig a1c for ψ 5 cm gold line the kunsat increased from 3 5 10 3 cm s 1 at 0 03 g cm 3 to 23 10 3 cm s 1 at 0 055 g cm 3 after which it decreased to 7 7 10 4 at 0 12 g cm 1 a reduction in the kunsat by nearly 5 times with respect to the kunsat at the uncompressed bulk density for the pressure head ψ 32 cm pink line the kunsat increased sharply from 1 4 10 6 to 25 10 6 more than an order of magnitude increase within the range of bulk densities between 0 03 g cm 3 and 0 04 g cm 3 further increase in bulk density led to a slow increase in the kunsat to the maximum of 1 3 10 4 cm s 1 at 0 12 g cm 3 water content in core 10 fig a1d increased from 0 25 cm3 cm 3 to 0 9 cm3 cm 3 with increase in the bulk density from 0 03 g cm 3 to 0 12 g cm 3 notably the water content for ψ 5 cm reached 0 9 cm3 cm 3 level already at the bulk density of 0 07 g cm 3 after which it remained nearly the same with a very small decrease at the bulk density of 0 12 g cm 3 which can be attributed to the measurement inaccuracy the relationship between the hydraulic conductivity k water content θ and compression rate can be expressed in two ways first the k vs θ where data points are connected by compression rates fig a1e and second the k vs θ where data points are connected by pressure heads fig a1f note that fig a1e and f show the exact same data but points are connected based on either pressure head or compression rate compression generally increased water content as the lines shifted from left to right fig a1e while simultaneously increasing the kunsat up to 40 compression rate fig a1f as well as lowering the ksat fig a1f red line 
7424,due to the non vascular nature of sphagnum mosses the capitula growing surface of the moss must rely solely on capillary action to receive water from beneath moss subsides and swells in accordance with water table levels an effect called mire breathing which has been thought to be a self preservation mechanism although no systematic studies have been done to demonstrate exactly how volume change affects hydrophysical properties of moss in this study the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kunsat and water content of two different species of sphagnum moss were measured at different compression rates up to the maximum of 77 the findings show that the kunsat increases by up to an order of magnitude 10 with compression up to a certain bulk density of the moss after which higher levels of compression result in lowered unsaturated hydraulic conductivity this was coupled with an increase in soil water retention with increased compression the increase of the kunsat with compression suggests that the mire breathing effect should be considered a self preservation mechanism to provide sufficient amount of water to growing moss in times of low water availability

peat moss compression 1 introduction peatlands are organic wetlands national wetlands working group 1997 and cover approximately 3 5 million km2 worldwide mitsch and gosselink 2015 representing a large carbon storage turunen et al 2002 hydrology plays an important role in forming and maintaining the carbon storage in peatlands because peat the poorly decomposed organic matter is formed in anaerobic conditions beneath the water table for over a century peatlands have been harvested for peat for use in agriculture and as an energy source mitsch and gosselink 2015 sphagnum moss is the climax species in peatlands zoltai and pollett 1983 and due to the non vascular nature of sphagnum mosses no root structure the capitula the surface living layer must rely solely on capillary action to receive water from beneath hayward and clymo 1982 there are three dominant sphagnum moss species in canada fuscum rubellum and magellanicum mccarter and price 2014 fuscum and rubellum are hummock species and they grow higher above the water level than magellanicum which as lawn specie grows closer to water hummock forming species particularly sphagnum fuscum have higher shoot density bengtsson et al 2016 conduct and retain more water at low water levels than non hummock species such as magellanicum clymo 1973 mccarter and price 2014 sufficient water availability is essential for the growth of the capitula sphagnum fuscum can retain relatively moist capitula even with a 40 cm deepwater table while sphagnum magellanicum desiccates at this water level mccarter and price 2014 how fast moss transfers water under the capillary action is represented by the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kunsat cm s 1 which depends on volumetric water content θ soil water pressure head ψ pore geometry as well as the gradient of the water potential hayward and clymo 1982 price et al 2008 van genuchten 1980 mire breathing is a seasonal natural change in the surface elevation of peatlands with changing water levels ingram 1983 mire breathing is thought to be a self preservation mechanism of peatlands to access water during the periods of low water availability such as in the dry season schothorst 1977 when the water level is high peat and moss swell thus increasing their volume and raising the surface an increased peat volume can create bigger pores that allow water to drain more easily conversely when the water level is low moss shrinks lowering the surface decreasing its volume which consequently creates smaller pores boelter 1968 it was suggested that the decrease of pore sizes increases the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in moss mccarter and price 2014 and consequently increases the amount of water received by the capitula mccarter and price 2015 although no systematic work has been done to show this relationship recent work in restored peatlands has also indicated a disconnection between the newly establishing moss layer acrotelm and the old remnant cutover surface mccarter and price 2015 taylor and price 2015 even though water is available near the surface of cutover peat the young moss cannot provide enough water to the capitula due to the kunsat θ and the water potential being limited by the large proportion of macropores mccarter and price 2014 taylor and price 2015 it was hypothesised that compression of moss would raise the kunsat as has been shown to happen in mineral soils berli et al 2008 horn et al 1995 radcliffe and rasmussen 2002 richard et al 2001 which means that the capitula would receive more water and thus grow more mccarter and price 2015 understanding how volume change of sphagnum mosses affects the kunsat and volumetric water content could explain the mire breathing as a self preservation mechanism as well as help in peatland restoration therefore the objectives of this paper are to systematically reduce volume of moss via compression and measure the kunsat and volumetric water content response at different compression levels and to quantify how compression of moss affects both the kunsat and water content 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site two large monoliths of sphagnum moss were collected from undisturbed peatlands located near whitemouth in south eastern manitoba canada the first sample was identified as sphagnum fuscum henceforth known as fuscum or fus and the second sample was identified as sphagnum magellanicum known as magellanicum or mag m c leblanc and l rochefort personal communication the coordinates were 49 55 39 6 n 96 14 33 2 w for fuscum and 49 47 07 5 n 95 57 49 9 w for magellanicum during the collection of the samples specific moss types were not targeted although it was elected to take moss from a hummock and a lawn in order to expand the dataset the samples happened to be sphagnum fuscum and sphagnum magellanicum the fuscum sample was from a bog mound surrounded by a fen and magellanicum sample was from a treed bog a large pit 80 cm 50 cm 60 cm was dug with a hand saw immediately adjacent to the selected moss and the monoliths 70 cm 40 cm 50 cm were carefully removed from the pit and placed in plastic containers and brought to the laboratory the adjacent pit was used to allow access to the bottom of the sample so that the saw could cut the bottom of the sample the samples were frozen unsaturated in a chest freezer in order to preserve them and to allow for easier cutting into smaller samples 2 2 sample preparation four cylindrical samples 10 cm diameter and 15 cm tall were cut from each of the monoliths and run for the ksat and kunsat tests without compression which are not part of this study these 15 cm samples were frozen again and then cut into three smaller samples herein referred to as the cores of 5 cm height for a total of 24 cores 12 cores each from the magellanicum and fuscum samples which were used in this study the height of 5 cm was chosen as it is common practice in laboratory work on sphagnum mosses mccarter et al 2017 2 3 methods volume change of moss was achieved by compressing samples vertically between the tension disks of the kunsat apparatus the amount of compression for the samples can be found in table 1 note that in terms of core volume 0 compression means uncompressed original volume and 12 20 etc of compression means 12 20 etc reduction of original volume or in other words volume reduction to 88 80 etc of the original volume for example a 5 cm core would be compressed 0 6 cm 0 6 5 12 for the 12 compression level the range of 70 77 for magellanicum is due to the use of a hydraulic press for maximum compression not used with fuscum the actual compression rate under the press was over 95 as soon as the weight from the press was released the moss expanded and the final compression rate varied between 70 and 77 among the magellanicum cores due to different bulk densities while moss expanded under all compression rates without confinement the kunsat and ksat apparatuses were able to hold the compressed moss and maintain any compression rate up to the maximum of 70 77 in case of magellanicum both the ksat ψ 0 cm and kunsat of the cores were measured for each compression rate at each of the different pressure heads ψ table 1 the wide range of the initial bulk densities allowed for the creation of a diverse dataset fuscum core 4 was not run at 60 compression rate due to time constraints the magellanicum cores had a smaller number of compression stages and pressure heads due to the laborious work involved with the results from the fuscum cores completed first the compression and pressure head levels chosen for the magellanicum cores were selected so they would not jeopardize the trends in the values but save considerable time for example there were 12 fuscum cores tested at 6 different compression rates and at 9 pressure heads minus 9 measurements at 60 for core 4 resulting in 639 separate measurements each measurement was conducted for at least 3 h except for ψ0 cm which was only 30 min in duration this does not consider the setup take down between pressure heads compression steps with the magellanicum cores the number of measurements was reduced nearly in half to 360 12 cores 5 compression levels 6 pressure heads it was deemed acceptable to have different compression rates and pressure heads for fuscum and magellanicum because this study did not originally set out to focus on a direct comparison between the two moss types 2 4 unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in order to determine the kunsat ψ of moss an apparatus with two tension disks was built for a complete description of this measurement method refer to the modified method in mccarter et al 2017 which is an updated version of the original method outlined in price et al 2008 in short a moss core was confined between two water saturated tension disks fig 1 a with a synthetic mesh membrane with pore sizes of 25 µm that allowed water to pass through but not air at any given pressure head used in this study 4 cm to 32 cm the water flow through the sample was maintained by the difference in the elevation head between the disks i e the modified method outlined in mccarter et al 2017 the core was encapsulated in a pvc tube split on one side to allow for easy access to the sample but during the test was closed with hose clamps to eliminate exposure to open air as well as to prevent the compressed moss cores from expansion after each measurement was complete the core was weighed and tension disks were washed all cores were watered from above until water began draining from the bottom of the cores prior to being closed in the pvc tubes in order to compensate for possible drainage and evaporation of water from the cores while the tension disks were being washed the modified method was chosen as it ensures a constant pressure head across the core as the flow is driven by the elevation head not the pressure head mccarter et al 2017 in the original method the flow is driven by both the pressure and elevation heads and thus a pressure head gradient exists within the core between the tension disks as the ultimate goal of this study was to understand the changes in the kunsat and θ with compression the authors did not want to introduce additional uncertainties as to how compression may impact the pressure head gradient in the moss profile if the original method was used based on a temperature logger in the room the temperature of water in the system was around 20 c room temperature and varied 1 5 c with all moss samples removed the system was cleaned with chlorine once a week to kill algae and replaced with clean water due to water loss in the water reservoirs via evaporation new clean water was added to the system throughout the tests distilled water was used in the apparatus to prevent accumulation of dissolved minerals from tap water such as calcium on the surface of the tension disks although the surface tension of distilled water is lower than those of natural peatlands or tap water dissolved particles and elements from the moss cores would have increased the surface tension the use of distilled water is thought to have a negligible effect on the results calculation of the kunsat cm s 1 was based on the darcy buckingham equation for unsaturated flow raats and van genuchten 2006 1 q k unsat d ψ dx 1 where q is the specific discharge cm s 1 dψ is the pressure head difference between the inflow and outflow tension disks cm and dx is the height of the sample cm the specific discharge was found as volumetric discharge rate q cm3 s 1 per cross sectional area a cm2 of the sample 2 q q a because the modified method of the kunsat apparatus was designed to eliminate the pressure head gradient within the sample mccarter et al 2017 meaning that there was only one ψ throughout the sample dψ in eq 1 is equal to 0 with this simplification and substitution of eq 2 into eq 1 the kunsat can be expresses as 3 k unsat q a additionally a simple extension of darcy s law eq 4 into unsaturated conditions also leads to eq 3 4 q ka dh dx where q is discharge cm3 s 1 k is hydraulic conductivity cm s 1 a is the cross sectional area of the sample cm2 dh is the change in hydraulic head cm between the inflow and outflow disks dx is the height of the sample cm because the change in hydraulic head was set to be the same as the height of the sample mccarter et al 2017 dh dx thus dh dx 1 consequently simplifying eq 4 and solving it for k results in eq 3 measuring the outflow from the apparatus was time consuming as discharge amounts were very small and episodic as the water had to overcome the surface tension in the erlenmeyer flask to discharge an automated system was designed to allow for continuous measurements of the twelve cores running simultaneously an arduino microcontroller was programmed to measure discharge from the cores fig 1b the microcontroller operated 12 solenoid valves one for each core with a known volume cm3 and a water level sensor in each valve the water level sensor consisted of two copper wires and if water reached both wires fig 1d it completed an electric circuit indicating that the known volume in a particular valve was full the arduino system opened the given valve to discharge the accumulated water closed the valve and began measuring the time until the water reached the sensor again the time that it took to fill a given volume in a valve was sent via a usb connection to a personal computer where it was logged in a text file for further processing the volume in each valve was known and accounted for and ranged between 5 and 6 cm3 due to small difference in sensor placement the volumes were systematically checked once a week when the cores were run under a new compression rate to ensure no drift in volume occurred 2 5 saturated hydraulic conductivity the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat indicates how fast water moves inside moss under saturated conditions when all pores in moss are filled with water which occurs at pressure heads ψ 0 cm a separate apparatus without the tension disks was designed to determine the saturated hydraulic conductivity fig 2 the use of tap water instead of distilled water in this apparatus was deemed to have an insignificant effect on the ksat because compared to the kunsat tests the ksat tests were of very short duration and with high flow rates for the ksat tests the water flow path was a to b to c to d fig 2 and a moss core was placed in container d where it was confined with disks that were cut from pipette holders to ensure the core stayed intact but that no impediment to flow occurred grid spacing of the pipette holder was 1 cm the multiple reservoirs were used to reduce the effect of flowing water i e the pressure of the water from the tap if placed directly into d would influence the discharge leaving the system water discharge q from container d was measured at three hydraulic head differences i e by moving b c up or down the head differences were different depending on the test density of the sample and the amount of compression but ranged between 3 and 12 mm for lower compression less dense moss up to 25 35 and 50 mm for higher compression denser moss as flow was much slower through the core the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat was calculated based on the slope of a line fitted to the function q cm s 1 vs dh dx cm cm 1 where q is the specific discharge eq 2 in order to increase the precision in the measurements of water levels and pressure heads over the lateral distances between the inflow outflow containers e g as seen on fig 1b in both the kunsat and ksat apparatuses one or two additional graduated cylinders were connected via siphon to the inflow outflow containers not shown in figs 1 and 2 and the water levels were actually measured in the graduated cylinders because the water levels in the cylinders were the same as in the containers as a result it was possible to set the water levels between the containers within a 1 mm limit 3 results a comment on the presentation of the results the authors feel that looking at the trends between all 24 cores split 12 and 12 for fuscum magellanicum is more instructive than at the data of any individual core thus fig 3 illustrates the mean values of all 12 cores per moss type with a 95 confidence interval shown as a grey area however the authors acknowledge that some readers may be interested in seeing individual differences and thus a single individual core core 10 from the magellanicum dataset was elected to show the raw data see appendix a mccarter et al 2017 showed that the flow impedance of the tension disks has to be accounted for during the measurements close to saturation e g ψ 4 cm for fuscum and ψ 5 cm for magellanicum however the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of any core never came close to the maximum values of permeability of the tension disks used in this study therefore the impedance on the flow was ruled out the highest kunsat value among all 24 cores was still 25 below the tension disk flow impedance value the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat for fuscum cores decreased from 2 5 100 to 0 5 100 cm s 1 fig 3a ψ 0 cm the values of the kunsat increased with increased compression from 10 5 to 10 4 cm s 1 at the lowest pressure head ψ 32cm with increased compression the variability in the kunsat measurements decreased as evidenced by the smaller 95 confidence interval at the higher compressions volumetric water content θ of fuscum cores fig 3c increased with compression but unlike the kunsat the variability in θ increased with compression indicated by a greater 95 confidence interval while there was an increase of θ at 12 compared to 0 fig 3c the values of the kunsat at 12 were slightly below the values at 0 fig 3a which is contrary to the general trend it is uncertain what led to the decreased kunsat in this case the general trends found in fuscum cores were also observed in magellanicum cores fig 3b and d however the ksat decreased more rapidly from 1 7 100 cm s 1 to 2 10 3 cm s 1 fig 3b although it was hypothesised that increased compression would increase the kunsat a significant decrease of the kunsat values was observed for the 60 and 70 77 compression rates fig 3b at ψ 17 cm water content in the magellanicum cores at ψ 32 cm fig 3d increased to the maximum θr residual water content of 0 80 0 85 cm3 cm 3 or about 25 higher than fuscum cores similar to the kunsat θ also decreased for the 70 77 compression rate at ψ 17 cm when compared to the previous compression rates fig 3d at the highest compression rate 70 77 in the magellanicum cores both the kunsat and water content θ varied very little i e the lines were more horizontal throughout all unsaturated pressure heads steps ψ 5 cm ψ 32 cm the smoothed plots fig 4 a and b for fuscum and magellanicum respectively were created after applying the loess method in the r analytical package r core team 2017 the grey area is a 95 confidence interval for the fuscum samples the range in hydraulic conductivity from saturation to the residual water content decreased between 6 and 4 orders of magnitude fig 4a depending on the compression level lower range with higher compression note how the curves shift to the right with increasing compression relative to the dashed line representing 0 5 cm3 cm 3 of the volumetric water content similar trends are seen within the magellanicum samples fig 4b though the range in k decrease is more pronounced changing from 6 to 2 orders of magnitude from 0 to 70 77 compression respectively mostly at the expense of the ksat the fuscum and magellanicum samples showed similar trends but yielded different results under compression figs 3 and 4 a convenient proxy for compression is bulk density ρb under the same compression rate a moss sample of high bulk density compresses to a lesser degree than a sample of low bulk density the bulk densities of the 12 uncompressed fuscum cores were between 0 016 and 0 021 g cm 3 with the average density of 0 018 g cm 3 table 1 the bulk density of the 12 uncompressed magellanicum cores ranged from 0 018to 0 033 g cm 3 with an average value of 0 028 g cm 3 comparing the average densities of the uncompressed samples the magellanicum samples were 55 denser than the fuscum samples the maximum bulk density under compression for the fuscum cores was 0 054 g cm 3 while for the magellanicum cores it was 0 123 g cm 3 table 1 the relationships between the hydraulic conductivity and water content with bulk density for both moss types are overlain for a direct comparison fig 5 a and b respectively the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kunsat increased with increasing bulk density for the fuscum samples fig 5a but with the magellanicum samples the kunsat firstly increases and then started to decrease after a bulk density between 0 045 and 0 105 g cm 3 depending on the pressure head with lower pressure heads having the inflection point at higher bulk densities for example for magellanicum samples at ψ 5 cm the decrease started at 0 045 g cm 3 and for ψ 32 cm the decrease began at 0 105 g cm 3 volumetric water content for the fuscum samples generally increased linearly from 0 17 0 25 cm3 cm 3 to 0 6 0 94 cm3 cm 3 with the increasing bulk densities fig 5b volumetric water content in the magellanicum samples increased from 0 3 cm3 cm 3 to 0 85 cm3 cm 3 within the bulk density range of 0 018 g cm 3 0 12 g cm 3 fig 5b the lower the pressure head ψ was the higher the bulk density had to be to reach the maximum θ for ψ 5 cm θ increased to the maximum of 0 9 cm3 cm 3 at 0 07 g cm 3 while for the lowest pressure head ψ 32 cm θ reached the maximum value of 0 85 cm3 cm 3 at 0 12 g cm 3 for ψ 5 cm θ decreased after its inflection value of 0 9 cm3 cm 3 at 0 07 g cm 3 0 8 cm3 cm 3 at 0 12 g cm 3 at the maximum density of 0 12 g cm 3 there was little variation within 0 1 cm3 cm 3 of θ values among all unsaturated pressure heads from ψ 5 cm to ψ 32 cm despite the two different types of sphagnum mosses there was a considerable overlap between the relationships of the hydraulic conductivity k and water content θ with bulk density for the two sets of samples fig 5a and b it is important to recall that the magellanicum samples were run at a different sequence of pressure heads to reduce the number of tests as such it is difficult to say if the small differences that do exist are due to moss differences or pressure head differences as the only overlapping pressure heads were 0 24 and 32 cm at 24 and 32 cm pressure heads the kunsat of fuscum cores was above that of magellanicum cores at densities from 0 02 to 0 04 g cm 3 while being lower at densities from 0 04 to 0 055 g cm 3 these differences ranged from 30 above to 5 below however the ksat at ψ0 cm was nearly identical the fuscum samples also showed a greater increase in volumetric water content than the magellanicum sample with increased density fig 5b although volumetric water content was similar at a bulk density of 0 02 g cm 3 4 discussion most sphagnum mosses grow in the unsaturated conditions present above the water table and experience water saturated conditions only in the spring during snowmelt or heavy rain anthropogenic disturbances notwithstanding peatlands are well suited to shed water in times of surplus due to the extremely high ksat of the surface acrotelm layer therefore this study focuses on the kunsat as it is more relevant and important for surficial sphagnum moss health during the growing season when water tables are lower compression did not affect the porosity of moss much as porosity remained near 90 95 throughout the experiments fig 5b ψ 0 cm therefore the observed changes in k and θ were not dependent on the porosity as much but rather on the pore size distribution and interconnections between the pores this was not surprising given that peat not moss from several metres deep and heavily decomposed can still have a porosity of 85 mccarter and price 2015 physical changes in the structure of moss under compression resulted in a general decrease of the ksat ψ 0 cm increase of the kunsat and increase of volumetric water content θ fig 5 as compression progresses which is represented here by the increasing bulk density big pores become smaller the reduction of the larger pores where the most saturated flow occurred led to the reduction in the ksat fig 5a ψ 0 cm which is in accordance with the modified marshall hydraulic conductivity equation for saturated conductivity rawls et al 1993 where the reduction in the ksat is shown to be proportional to the reduction of the pore radius and pore size classes contributing to the saturated flow because small pores have a greater capillary force than larger pores water in smaller pores holds onto the pore walls more tightly consequently it is harder to drain water from such pores even at low ψ thus increasing water content θ fig 5b the similarity of θ values at bulk densities around 0 12 g cm 3 means that the pores retain the same amount of water at ψ 5 cm and at ψ 32 cm fig 5b with compression the pores that were previously empty or partly filled become filled to a greater extent or completely filled with water which creates more interconnected water films within the moss structure and as a result of the higher water content allows more water transfer hence the increased kunsat values fig 5a it was fortunate that the magellanicum samples were denser than the fuscum samples because had this study only been completed on fuscum samples the inflection point where further compression reduced the kunsat would not have been identified with the magellanicum samples it was possible to actually observe the decrease of the kunsat values under excessive compression fig 5a as the authors previously predicted the pores become so small that they begin to limit the flow of water as seen at ψ 5 cm fig 5a where the kunsat peaks at the bulk density of 0 045 g cm 3 after which it begins to decline with further compression although excessive compression e g bulk density above 0 06 g cm 3 can result in a lowered kunsat it is impossible to maintain that compression rate in the field without physical constraints in fact at the bois des bel peatland restoration site in quebec a trial was conducted in a small section to improve the hydrologic connectivity see below by driving a tractor across the peatland in the winter crushing the 20 cm deep new moss layer that has grown in the past 15 years the maximum moss bulk density that was achieved was 0 048 g cm 3 with an average of 0 03 g cm 3 and only represented a 42 increase in bulk density mccarter and gauthier personal communication the range of the bulk densities of the fuscum sample under compression was about 1 3 of the bulk densities found in the magellanicum sample despite being different moss types and different initial bulk densities both samples showed similar trends in the kunsat particularly in the range between 0 02 and 0 06 g cm 3 as seen by the overlapping lines fig 5a it is most likely that further compression above 60 of fuscum cores would have resulted in the decline of the kunsat similar to magellanicum it is difficult to differentiate the kunsat of fuscum and magellanicum samples because their values overlap within their 95 confidence intervals fig 5a and due to different ψ used however at ψ 24 cm and ψ 32 cm the magellanicum sample had higher kunsat values than fuscum for the initial bulk densities fig 5a bulk density 0 03 g cm 3 which was also observed by mccarter and price 2014 some differences between the two species were observed in water content the fuscum sample retained more water than the magellanicum sample for the same bulk density fig 5b for ψ 24 cm and ψ 32 cm the slope of the lines for fuscum is also greater than for magellanicum indicating that fuscum sample is more sensitive to compression the differences are most likely due to morphological differences of the moss samples although the authors are not aware of studies that have shown the effects of morphology of fuscum and magellanicum on their hydrological properties as a hummock specie fuscum has denser shoots than magellanicum bengtsson et al 2016 and under compression there are more surface interactions and a higher number of smaller pores which retain more water at lower ψ than in magellanicum consequently greater water content at low ψ allows fuscum to sustain its capitula under stress which has also been shown in other studies bengtsson et al 2016 mccarter and price 2014 schipperges and rydin 1998 with the laboratory data available for modelling it would be instructive to see whether the observed compression appreciably increases water availability to the capitula while a rigorous modelling exercise that includes real time peat volume change is important see nijp et al 2017 it is beyond the scope of this paper the authors have elected to use a simple 1 d model retc and hydrus 1d to model the changes in the pressure head distribution and moisture content of moss with and without compression fig 6 the water retention and hydraulic conductivity data from magellanicum core 10 fig a1 and fuscum core 10 not shown were used in retc retention curve to generate the α n and l parameters table 2 required for hydrus 1d within retc the authors used the van genuchten m 1 1 n model fit all water flow parameters but the saturated water content and adjusted the weighting of the points as needed with a bias towards getting the lower points ψ less than 15 cm to fit the curve better than the higher pressure points in hydrus 1d the simulation was completed on water flow in a 1 layer 10 cm deep system with a constant head lower boundary simulating a water table of 30 cm below the surface and a 4 mm day evaporative flux as the upper boundary condition atmospheric boundary condition with surface layer for a total of 10 days this assumes that the 5 cm moss sample was applicable to the full 10 cm layer modelled here the single porosity model of van genuchten mualem was selected the hyaline cells of sphagnum moss can drain at pressure heads below 100 cm hayward and clymo 1982 leading to the desiccation of the capitula top 2 cm the modelling results show that without compression 0 the capitula of fuscum at 2 cm would have a pressure head below 100 cm fig 6a while the pressure head of magellanicum would decrease below 100 cm only in the upper 1 cm fig 6b meaning that the capitula of both mosses would dry when considering compression however the pressure head and water content fig 6c and d of the capitula in both mosses improved for the fuscum sample at 1 cm below the surface the pressure heads were 167 102 and 75 cm for the 0 12 and 24 compression amounts respectively and at 2 cm were 102 63 and 49 cm respectively so that only the upper 1 cm fell below the 100 cm threshold for compressions of 36 and 48 no part of the moss profile fell below 100 cm although magellanicum had a greater initial bulk density of 0 032 g cm 3 than fuscum its capitula still desiccated at 0 compression however only 20 compression was required to keep the profile greater than 100 cm the capitula of fuscum had a much greater pressure head 50 cm at approximately the same bulk density 0 032 g cm 3 or an average of the 36 and 48 compression steps fig 6a most likely the hydrophysical differences between fuscum and magellanicum for the same bulk density could be due to morphological differences illustrating that fuscum is more resistant to water table drawdown can retain more water and can keep up the evaporative demand which was also observed in other studies mccarter and price 2014 2013 these examples show that volume change of moss plays an important role of providing more water to capitula in times of stress such as during water table drawdown 5 limitations the measurement of water content at ψ0 cm saturated state for highly compressed samples was less accurate because the volume of the cores was small enough to make a 1 g measurement difference result in a several percent difference of the volumetric water content also even though 24 moss cores were analysed in this work they represent only 2 types of sphagnum mosses s fuscum and s magellanicum 6 conclusion volume change via compression resulted in improved hydrological properties of moss such as the kunsat and θ therefore the mire breathing should be considered a self preservation response mechanism to dry weather and lowered water tables as moss subsides not only does it come closer to the underlying water surface but it also increases the moisture content and water transfer upwards because water to the capitula moves under the atmospheric evaporative demand very low ψ if sphagnum moss did not subside upon drying then θ and the kunsat could decrease to such a degree that the water transfer to the growing capitula would cease and as a result the evaporative demand from the atmosphere would desiccate the hyaline cells leading to plant death compression of moss could also be helpful in the restoration of peatlands one of the challenges in peatland restoration is that the newly established moss does not receive enough water for its growth from the underlying cutover catotelm peat mccarter and price 2013 the large pores of the new moss are unable to draw water from the small pores of the remnant catotelm cutover peat surface it could be possible to compress the newly established moss in order to increase its connection with cutover peat and thus increase the kunsat acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge funding from brandon

the acknowledgements section of submission including grant numbers where appropriate appendix a core 10 was selected from the magellanicum dataset as it was roughly average among the cores in terms of bulk density values to show in detail how compression affected the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and water content in a single core fig a1 being average in the bulk density did not always result in being average for the kunsat and θ values though no other single core did either the uncompressed bulk density of core 10 was 0 031 g cm 3 and 0 123 g cm 3 for the maximum compression 74 a roughly 4 fold increase fig a1c and d with increased compression the ksat decreased fig a1a ψ0 cm from 3 100 cm s 1 to 3 10 3 cm s 1 whereas the kunsat showed a non linear dependence for the higher pressure heads ψ 5 cm and ψ 10 cm fig a1a the kunsat firstly increased with compression up to 40 green gold and red lines were above one another and with further compression the kunsat generally decreased pink blue and green lines were below one another with the kunsat at ψ 10 cm remaining the same for 40 and 60 for the lowest ψ 32 cm the kunsat increased from 1 4 10 6 cm s 1 at 0 to 1 4 10 4 cm s 1 at 74 though the rate of the increase slowed down with compression also note that with compression the lines become more horizontal suggesting that the higher the compression level is the more similar the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity tends to be at all pressure heads for a given compression rate similar to the trend in the kunsat water content θ fig a1b became more uniform under compression throughout all ψ and reached its residual water content more quickly the 74 compression rate also brought the sample closer to saturation with 0 9 cm3 cm 3 water content throughout all ψ for example at ψ 32 cm water content was 0 85 cm3 cm 3 and it increased almost 3 times compared to uncompressed moss 0 27 cm3 cm 3 looking at the effects of compression on the kunsat via the bulk density fig a1c for ψ 5 cm gold line the kunsat increased from 3 5 10 3 cm s 1 at 0 03 g cm 3 to 23 10 3 cm s 1 at 0 055 g cm 3 after which it decreased to 7 7 10 4 at 0 12 g cm 1 a reduction in the kunsat by nearly 5 times with respect to the kunsat at the uncompressed bulk density for the pressure head ψ 32 cm pink line the kunsat increased sharply from 1 4 10 6 to 25 10 6 more than an order of magnitude increase within the range of bulk densities between 0 03 g cm 3 and 0 04 g cm 3 further increase in bulk density led to a slow increase in the kunsat to the maximum of 1 3 10 4 cm s 1 at 0 12 g cm 3 water content in core 10 fig a1d increased from 0 25 cm3 cm 3 to 0 9 cm3 cm 3 with increase in the bulk density from 0 03 g cm 3 to 0 12 g cm 3 notably the water content for ψ 5 cm reached 0 9 cm3 cm 3 level already at the bulk density of 0 07 g cm 3 after which it remained nearly the same with a very small decrease at the bulk density of 0 12 g cm 3 which can be attributed to the measurement inaccuracy the relationship between the hydraulic conductivity k water content θ and compression rate can be expressed in two ways first the k vs θ where data points are connected by compression rates fig a1e and second the k vs θ where data points are connected by pressure heads fig a1f note that fig a1e and f show the exact same data but points are connected based on either pressure head or compression rate compression generally increased water content as the lines shifted from left to right fig a1e while simultaneously increasing the kunsat up to 40 compression rate fig a1f as well as lowering the ksat fig a1f red line
