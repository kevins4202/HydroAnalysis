14785,mineral scaling is one key obstacle to membrane distillation in hypersaline wastewater desalination but the scaling or fouling mechanism is poorly understood addressing this challenge required revealing the foulants layer formation process in this work the scaling process was deconstructed with a cascade strategy by stepwise changing the composition of the synthetic desulfurization wastewater the flux decline curves presented a 3 stage mode in vacuum membrane distillation vmd heterogeneous nucleation of camg co3 2 caf2 and caco3 was the main incipient scaling mechanism mg si complex was the leading foulant in 2nd stage during which the scaling mechanism shifted from surface to bulk crystallization the flux decreased sharply for the formation of a thick and compacted scaling layer by the bricklaying of caso4 and mg si bsa complexes in the 3rd stage bulk crystallization was identified as the key scaling mechanism in vmd for the high salinity and concentration multiple the organic matter had an anti scaling effect by changing the bulk crystallization humic acids ha and colloidal silica also contributed to incipient scaling for the high affinity to membrane bovine serum albumin bsa acting as the cement of mg si complexes mg altered the si scaling from polymerization to mg si complex formation which significantly influence the mixed scaling mechanism this work deconstructed the mixed scaling process and illuminated the role of main foulants filling in the knowledge gap on the mixed scaling mechanism in vmd for hypersaline wastewater treatment and recovery graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane distillation mixed scaling bricklaying desulfurization wastewater bulk crystallization hypersaline wastewater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water reuse and salt recovery became the primary goal in water intensive industries under the strict wastewater discharge standards industrial wastewater treatment is now a hot issue in water science and market salt removal and recovery is still a far unsolved problem with an ultimate objective of zero liquid discharge zld panagopoulos and haralambous 2020 tong and elimelech 2016 tsai et al 2017 the hypersaline streams are commonly accompanied by high suspended solids organic matters oms or heavy metals which narrowed the selection range of the treatment technologies tsai et al 2017 membrane distillation md a promising desalination technology was widely applied in industrial wastewater treatment on lab scale kebria and rahimpour 2020 zhong et al 2021 more recently it is identified as a potential zld technology for the high concentration multiple even implementation of solidification called membrane crystallization with relatively low fouling potential lu et al 2019 tsai et al 2017 yadav et al 2022 however mineral scaling and the consequent wetting are the main obstacles to the industrial application of md liu et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 therefore understanding the scaling mechanism is essential for fouling and wetting mitigation and a gist for the industrial application scaling is initiated by nucleation and the following crystal growth process under saturation conditions the foreign interface promotes nucleation by lower the free energy barrier which was called heterogeneous nucleation rolf et al 2022 it is a thermodynamically favorable and kinetically faster process the prenucleation clusters formed with a few atoms within seconds at the membrane surface then nucleation and crystal growth begin and triggering on the incipient scaling pouget et al 2009 horseman et al 2019 saha et al 2012 meanwhile the concentration polarization enhances the chemical potential difference intensifies the nucleation and reduces the induction time on the contrary homogeneous crystallization is kinetically slow for the relatively lower free energy horseman et al 2019 but significant influence of homogeneous crystallization on scaling had also been reported in hypersaline wastewater treatment cao et al 2022 zou et al 2018 moreover the heterogeneous crystallization also happened in bulk for the presence of particles colloids and microbes which results in a rapid flux decline sparingly soluble salts like calcium sulfate caso4 calcium carbonate caco3 and magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 are the most common scalants they exhibit diverse morphology structure and properties on membrane surface resulting in distinct influences on flux decline and long term stability gypsum or caso4 scaling is known as a tenacious and adherent foulant in md fortunato et al 2018 warsinger et al 2015 while the significance of caco3 was also reported as compared to gypsum he et al 2009 in addition silica scaling is more complicated for different silica types rolf et al 2022 tong et al 2017 the coexistence of other substances cast another cloud in understanding the scaling process and promotes the research on the synergistic scaling mechanism in recent years su et al 2015 disclosed that common ions in seawater inhibited caco3 scaling and the effect of foreign ions was dependent on the saturation index si of caco3 but iron reduced the gypsum induction time and accelerates precipitation melliti et al 2021 meanwhile different scalants exhibited synergistic effects in the scaling process zarga et al 2012 found caso4 decreased the germination of caco3 by reducing the nucleation energy barrier whereas caco3 had no influence on caso4 but another study asserted that caco3 decreased the crystallization rate of caso4 sheikholeslami and ng 2001 retardation of caso4 crystallization by carbonate mg and other metal ions had also been observed saha et al 2012 sheikholeslami and ng 2001 furthermore synergistic effects between metal ions and silica were found by coprecipitation adsorption and coagulation in md chen et al 2020 qin et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 it was also demonstrated that the colloidal silica delayed the induction of gypsum by collisions between the colloids and nascent caso4 nuclei leading to the morphology transformation from needle like to plate like wang et al 2010 magnesium and silica were easily co precipitated in md but caco3 did not co precipitate with dissolved silica zhang et al 2018 zheng et al 2021 paradoxically the formation of ca si complexes also contributed to membrane scaling as disclosed in other works lu et al 2020 om had a more confusing role in scaling scaling reinforcement was widely reported even under unsaturation concentration by absorption chelation bridging and biological processes shim et al 2002 zularisam et al 2006 results in quick flux decline for the tight and structured foulants layer zheng et al 2018 in md process humic acids ha sodium alginate sa and bovine serum albumin bsa were found to promote scaling by complexation at carboxyl and hydroxy positions cho et al 2018 han et al 2017 however increasing attention was received on the anti scaling effect of om in md recently tijing et al 2015 curcio et al 2010 bsa and ha inhibited scaling by enhancing bulk crystallization while sa had a lower inhabitation effect for the strong interaction with ca2 yan et al 2021 meanwhile the mitigation of silica scaling was also observed by oms in membrane process qin et al 2018 qin et al 2017 besides it was also claimed that om had no impact on permeate flux with low concentration at the time scale of a few hours or days mericq et al 2010 in the real world hypersaline wastewater had a more complicated composition resulting in a more complicated mixed scaling for the coexistence of different types of foulants however most studies focused on the simulated wastewater with single or two specific substances it was unlikely to assess the scaling process in real wastewater where complicated mixtures are present sheikholeslami 2003 it was widely known single salt nucleation and crystallization kinetics cannot be extended to the mixed scaling process therefore systematic studies are necessary to incorporate the effect of the presence of other components on scaling as md was mainly applied in hypersaline wastewater treatment the deconstruction of the role of mixed scalants and disclosure of the scaling mechanism were essential for scaling mitigation chang et al 2003 investigated the scaling composition of the vmd in brackish water treatment which was found predominantly mg oh 2 mgsio3 mgso4 silica and organic matter traces zhong et al 2016 revealed the interactions of mg2 and ca2 with carbonates and silica in vmd for produced water treatment and identified the significant influence of mg si co precipitation on flux decline liu et al 2022 investigated the major species of mineral scales in produced wastewater treatment by md recently md was commonly used in real hypersaline wastewater treatment and the scaling was known as the key issue for application however these studies mainly focus on the composition and mitigation of scaling the scaling layer is still a totally black box and the formation process and mechanism of mixed scaling in md still hanging in the air in this study the mixed scaling in vmd was investigated with a cascade strategy by stepwise adding the key component in synthetic wastewaters the morphology of the scaling layer was investigated by scanning electron microscope sem accompanied by x ray energy spectrometer eds for analyzing the elemental composition and distribution the composition was investigated by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir x ray diffractometer xrd and x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps the scaling process was deconstructed and the role of the main foulants was illuminated by the decomposition of the foulants in the real desulfurization wastewater this work fills in the knowledge gap on the mixed scaling mechanism which can be expanded to other desalination crystallization or pipe scaling processes it also sheds light on scaling mitigation which had significant environmental and social effects under the strict wastewater discharge standards

concentration and the coexistence of oms li et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 the practical scaling was complicated and a key issue in the membrane based treatment process therefore the mixed scaling mechanism was deconstructed by gradually changing the composition of the synthetic wastewater synthetic wastewaters were prepared to simulate the desulfurization wastewater the concentration of different components was based on the real wastewater as previously reported zheng et al 2021 as caso4 was identified as the main inorganic foulant in the md process for desulfurization wastewater treatment ca2 and so4 2 were added in every group as shown in table 1 the effects of magnesium silicates fluoride carbonate and oms were added stepwise to demonstrate the different fouling morphology structure and composition with a concentration as measured in our previous work zheng et al 2021 the si of the feedwaters was calculated by phreeqc software 3 7 3 usgs usa to study the potential scalants during md the bulk crystallization of the synthetic wastewater was studied by static tests the wastewater with a volume of 500 ml in narrow neck bottles was put into an incubator with a shaking speed of 200 rpm under 50 c 10 ml water sample was taken out at 0 1 2 4 6 10 20 25 32 35 45 60 72 and 96 h respectively and the ph and conductivity were recorded the solid samples were obtained by membrane filtration with a 0 45 μm membrane vmd was applied in this work for fouling investigation with a lab scale setup as shown in fig s1 self prepared hollow fiber hf membrane module was used in vmd 20 hfs were encapsulated in a polypropylene annular tube with an effective area of 11 3 cm2 three liters of wastewater were added to the water tank and maintained at 50 c and the vacuum degree was 0 8 by a vacuum pump gm2 0 jinteng china the closed loop mode was applied as the permeate was not returned to feedwater liu et al 2020 the vmd process was terminated when the feedwater was 500 600 ml with a concentration factor of about 5 6 then the bulk deposits and the fouled membranes were collected and the foulants peeling from the membrane surface were also collected to study the difference between the foulants layer and the bulk deposits 2 3 scaling layer characterization the morphology of the bulk deposits and fouled membranes were observed using a field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem hitachi su8020 hitachi japan the elemental composition was analyzed by a hitachi s 3000n scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi japan equipped with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer eds and the elemental distribution was disclosed with eds mapping mode the samples were coated with gold nanoparticles prior to sem observations principal component analysis pca was proceeded for the composition of elements by canoco 5 0 software to study the correlation of each element in foulants layer ftir was applied for functional group recognition in attenuated total reflectance atr mode in a wave number range of 4000 650 cm 1 by cumulating 64 scans at a resolution of 2 cm 1 using a nicolet is10 ftir spectrometer thermo scientific usa xps escalab250xi thermofisher scientific usa with a monochromatic al kα source 1486 6 ev was used to measure the composition of foulants and the chemical state of key elements binding energies were charge

salt concentration of the synthetic desulfurization wastewater was high which had high scaling potential during desalination the si of the feedwaters was calculated by phreeqc software as exhibited in table 2 parkhurst and appelo 2013 the potential scalants were mainly mg si complexes caco3 caf2 and sio2 at the start point mg si complexes presented high si for the high concentration and interaction activity especially for talc chrysotile and sepiolite caco3 in the forms of aragonite and calcite also showed high si which had a high potential for crystallization caso4 had a minus si in every group which had a lower potential for bulk nucleation the ph mainly displayed a three stage decline mode during the bulk crystallization test an instant decrease occurred attributed to the precipitation of carbonate or silica fig s2 for the high si then the ph became stable in a discrepant time for different compositions as co3 2 was exhausted at last the ph declined in groups c e due to the formation of mg si complexes the conductivity of the feed solutions was stable in all groups indicating the static bulk crystallization mainly happened on co3 2 f or silica with low concentration in the feedwater as can be verified by the high si that means the static bulk crystallization had low significance the vmd performance was presented in fig 1 the flux decline curves showed also a three stage process except for group c in the continuous operation it should be noted that the flux increase can be found in groups a and d at the beginning the low feed temperature in the first half an hour was the cause a rapid decline occurred immediately in each group which was attributed to the activation of surface crystallization and the effect of the concentration polarization liu et al 2022 the membrane promoted the surface crystallization of caco3 caf2 and caso4 at the start point as evidenced by the instant ph decrease fig s2 which was responsible for the flux decline in the 1st stage following was a stable flux stage in most groups with a low flux decline rate the transition from surface crystallization to bulk crystallization due to the increasing concentration was believed to be the cause zou et al 2018 and it also demonstrated that the deposition of bulk formed scalants in this stage had a low influence on flux due to the low coverage and loose accumulation on the membrane surface at last a sharp decline happened indicating the severe scaling for the concentration effect the main scaling mechanism in this stage was bulk crystallization due to the high salt concentration cao et al 2022 liu et al 2022 shin and sohn 2016 zou et al 2018 the similar flux decline rate and final flux demonstrated that bulk crystallization was the crucial mechanism in the closed looped vmd for desalination of the hypersaline wastewater also in consideration of the similar concentration multiple in each group and it is also worth noting that the j j0 was similar around 0 3 at about 25 h for all tests indicating the inorganic fouling was the key reason for flux decline meanwhile it can be safe to conclude that the oms showed anti scaling performance in the mixed scaling process silica accelerated the adsorption process and the 3rd stage started at 13 h with a j j0 of 0 8 the high si of sio2 was responsible for the quick surface crystallization and it was believed the high affinity of amorphous hydroxyl silica and the co precipitation with ca were other reasons for the flux decline fig 1 zhong et al 2016 the 2nd stage disappeared in group c as a high concentration of mg was added with a relatively constant decline rate during the whole process even the concentration multiple was high after 20 h of continuous operation the high scaling potential of the mg si complex was believed to be the reason for the high si and the accumulation of the amorphous complexes resulted in the flux decline with a stable rate it means the bulk crystallization was the main incipient fouling mechanism here as the content and si of caco3 and caf2 were relatively low it is also worth mentioning that a maximal ph variation happened in group c due to the consecutive precipitation of silica in the 3rd stage therefore the flux decline rate was a little increased after 15 h due to the co deposition of the two main foulants i e mg si complex and caso4 however when om was added to the feed the flux decline curve turned back to a 3 stage process however the flux decline rate decreased as evidenced by the shorter operation duration and the higher final flux that means the om postponed the scaling process so the flux decline rate decreased in both the 1st and 3rd stage as ha was added the inhibition of mg si complex and caso4 was the main mechanism attributed to its adsorption on the crystal and blocking the active sites for crystal growth cao et al 2022 yan et al 2021 on the contrary the bsa intensified the incipient fouling as shown in fig 1e f as bsa had lower affinity to membrane guan et al 2018 zheng et al 2022 this result was inconsistent with a previous work in which bsa showed more significant scaling postponement for both surface and bulk gypsum scaling yan et al 2021 the difference can be attributed to the mixed scaling process and high salt concentration bsa had high affinity to mg si complexes the leading bulk formed scalants at the preliminary stage result in an enhanced deposition 3 2 morphology and elemental composition all membranes were severely fouled as the concentration multiple was about 6 at the end of the vmd operation also evidenced by the high flux decline rate at the 3rd stage as shown in fig 1 mainly two types of foulants appeared in group a the prevailing needle like crystals were recognized as caso4 with a length width ratio of 3 10 the amorphous and porous foulants distributed in the gap junction of the caso4 and on the bottom of scaling layer were attributed to the coprecipitates of caco3 camg co3 2 and caf2 the bulk deposits showed a similar morphology with the scaling layer on the membrane surface indicating the key role of bulk crystallization in scaling fig s3 meanwhile the foulants were detected in the inner pores and the crystals can be found in the cross section especially for ca fig s4 the dense foulants layer and the hexahedral crystals with bigger size and lower length width ratio appeared in group b the amorphous coprecipitate was the key culprit for the flux decline in the 1st stage while the polymeric silica acted as the agglomerate for the formation of the dense bottom layer the thin but compacted layer was the reason for the absence of scaling in the inner pore structure and was responsible for maintaining the high rejection meanwhile colloidal sio2 with a spherical structure also appeared in the foulants layer and bulk deposits due to the increasing si concentration in vmd the absence of mg and om was responsible for the typical silica fouling which had a higher affinity to the ptfe membrane as compared to caso4 qin et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 on the contrary bulk crystallization was the main mechanism for caso4 and it had a low tendency to deposit on the si contained surface that explains the significantly bigger size and plate like structure as compared to group a wang et al 2010 when mg was added lamellar crystals recognized as mg si complex appeared for the high si and concentration zheng et al 2021 the hexahedral crystals exhibited a similar size as group b resulting from the bulk crystallization and the following deposition the formation of the mg si complex attenuated the fouling of colloidal silica but it can still be found fig s3 it demonstrated that the colloidal silica was first absorbed on the membrane surface followed by the formation and deposition of mg si complexes the caso4 was the leading foulants on the top of the scaling layer due to the high concentration of ca2 and so4 2 however the hexahedral crystals were significantly restrained and embedded in the foulants layer as ha was added into the feedwater with a significantly smaller size that means ha promoted the surface crystallization of ca and also changed the crystallographic form of caso4 cho et al 2018 yan et al 2021 bsa had a totally different effect on scaling as the hexahedral crystals became the leading foulants with a lower length width ratio and were covered by organic matters meanwhile the heterogeneity of the foulants increased in both size and morphology indicating synchronous surface and bulk crystallization it can be also demonstrated for the bulk deposits fig s3 the scaling layer of group f was similar to group e indicating the significance of bulk crystallization on the top of the scaling layer however the foulants on the bottom layer present a similar structure as group d it can be inferred that the ha had a higher affinity to the membrane and promote the surface crystallization while bsa had a high affinity with the crystals and acted as the cement for their stacking that explained the severe cross sectional scaling in groups e and f the main elements on the scaling layer were o c s ca and mg table s1 fig 4 ca s o and mg si complexes were identified for the highly consistent distribution of ca s o and mg si as disclosed by eds mapping for the consistent distribution fig 3 the hexahedral crystals were ca s o complex while the mg si complex present formless morphology and was distributed together with the hexagonal prism zheng et al 2021 the spheroidal crystals were mainly formed by si and o as shown in fig s6 in group b tong et al 2017 and the higher c and n intensity indicated the formation of organic fouling and its role in foulants layer formation the distribution of f and c was significantly distinguished from other foulants demonstrated its source of the original ptfe membrane ca s o complex with a ca s ratio of 0 97 was identified as caso4 it was the leading foulant in group a the difference in the distribution of ca and s and the variated ca s ratio illuminated different ca type foulants the ca s ratio higher than 1 indicated the appearance of other ca involved scalant like caco3 or caf2 while the low ca s may result from the interaction of ca with oms for si mg ratio it presented a significant difference in different groups the low proportion of mg should be the error of the measurement due to its limit of detection as no mg was added in group b the significantly high mg si ratio can be attributed to two reasons 1 mg had a significantly high concentration in the feed mg salts can be a key salt in bulk crystallization which can be easily detected in eds 2 si had higher affinity to membrane and the om especially for bsa so the proportion of si is low under eds the deposit of mg and c can also be found with low intensity which was in accordance with the sem image the spheroidal foulants fit well with si indicating the formation of colloidal si fig s6 meanwhile si is also combined with ca for the formation of amorphous foulants around the hexahedral caso4 the low intensity of f indicates the thick scaling layer which was responsible for the significant flux decline in group b the scaling mechanism significantly changed as mg was added si tend to combined with mg for the formation of formless foulants zhong et al 2016 li et al 2021 the hexahedral foulants mainly appeared at the top layer which was responsible for the monotonic flux decline curve meanwhile the centralized f distribution indicated the higher porosity of the scaling layer which explains the lower flux decline rate in the 3rd stage organic fouling appeared as ha and bsa were used in which mg showed a higher content figs 4 s7 9 hexahedral crystals had a smaller size as ha promotes the surface crystallization of ca and restricts the directional growth of caso4 crystals figs 2 and s7 curcio et al 2010 yan et al 2021 bsa had a higher affinity with crystals rather than the membrane which explains the low coverage of the foulants layer the bigger crystals with lower length width ratio as believed formed in bulk appeared at the top of the foulants layer and were closely bounded by bsa group b had the highest ca and lowest f content for the higher foulants coverage but the lowest ca s ratio of 0 7 indicated that other types of ca foulants as shown in table s1 the highest mg and lowest ca appeared as bsa was added further revealing its higher affinity to the mg si complex while ha tends to chelate with ca and is distributed in the bottom layer explained the lower ca content in groups d and f the ca s and o showed high positive correlation which is a key contributor to pca ii and the main foulants in groups a and b ptfe membrane was distinguished by a high content of carbon and fluoride mg was enriched in group c f for its high concentration in feed and group d f shared a cluster for the use of om meanwhile mg was negatively correlated to ca which was evidence for their distribution in the scaling layer interestingly si was positively correlated to ca but negatively correlated to mg one reason is that the content of si was low in the feed thus the significantly high content of si in group b had a huge influence on pca analysis while the high affinity of si with membrane was another reason as si was mainly distributed in the bottom of the foulants layer when om was added in the feed f content increased indicating the scaling inhibition effect group f showed the highest n content evidence for the high affinity of ha with the membrane and the higher distribution of bsa in the upper layer 3 3 dissecting the mixed scalants the bulk deposits showed different structure with the scaling layer revealed by ftir especially when om was added fig 5 the fouled membranes showed a similar spectrum with the surface foulants except for group e it demonstrated that the top layer caused by bulk crystallization was the main composition of the foulants layer meanwhile the foulants layers in different groups had similar spectra with significant absorption peaks of ptfe at 1204 and 1139 cm 1 indicated the similar composition of the porous particulate layer and thin adsorbed layer the split peaks at around 3400 cm 1 were attributed to oh and h2o at different structured environments the peaks at 1687 and 1628 cm 1 were attributed to the constitutional water mainly caused by gypsum as widely reported ding et al 2020 mandal and mandal 2002 the dispersed peaks at 1620 1700 cm 1 also illuminate the appearance of bassanite peaks appeared at 1659 and 1527 cm 1 as oms were applied which were associated to amide i and amide ii from bsa zheng et al 2018 and it was interesting to find new peaks at 1438 1338 898 and 845 cm 1 in group f on the foulants layer indicating the combination of the oms with ca2 mg2 or si the peak at 1102 cm 1 which appeared in every fouled membrane except group e for the detachment of the foulants layer was attributed to the absorption of so4 2 wang et al 2019 the peaks at 669 and 662 cm 1 also represent the stretching and bending modes of so4 2 the peak shown at 868 cm 1 especially in group b was an indicator of caco3 scaling the small peak at around 800 cm 1 was attributed to si o indicating that the si foulants mainly distributed in the depth position of the foulants layer pálková et al 2010 in group a the composition of the foulants on membrane surface and the bulk deposits were same as also evidenced by sem indicating the predominant role of bulk crystallization a significant shoulder peak at around 980 cm 1 indicated the appearance of si in group b pálková et al 2010 and the surface and bulk foulants displayed significant differences that is the intensity of the co3 2 peak 870 cm 1 increased and the constitutional water and caso4 peaks 1102 669 and 662 cm 1 decreased as mg was added group c the intensity of si was enhanced as it easily combined with mg rather than as colloidal silica and distributed at the bottom of the scaling layer meanwhile si showed higher content in the bulk deposits indicating that it was easily crystallized in bulk as shown in fig s6 due to the high concentration of mg in feedwaters correspondingly caso4 easily accumulated on membrane surface moreover the oh and h2o peaks were significantly enhanced exhibiting the more complicated constitutional water composition for the formation of mixed minerals on the membrane surface when oms were added the absorbance was significantly decreased for the bulk deposits which means the oms impeded the bulk crystallization yan et al 2021 while peaks at 1659 and 1527 cm 1 illuminated the contribution of om to membrane fouling and the om also changed the scaling process as illuminated by new peaks at 1438 and 1338 cm 1 in fig 5 the complicated xrd curves illuminated the intricate mixed scaling process however gypsum caso4 2h2o was the main foulants in all groups the crucial reasons come from two aspects one is the gypsum had a later order in nucleation and crystallization for the low si as shown in table 2 another one was the significantly high concentration of ca2 and so4 2 in the feed solutions therefore the caso4 formed mainly by bulk crystallization at the 3rd stage which was responsible for the similar flux decline pattern in each group meanwhile it had high possibility to showcase at the top of the scaling layer and the exterior of the bulk deposits the foulants mainly gypsum calcite and anhydrite on the membrane surface and the bulk were same in group a indicating the significance of bulk crystallization as demonstrated also by ftir the significantly high intensity of the 0 2 0 facet explained the needle like morphology with a large length width ratio rolf et al 2022 however calcite aragonite dolomite and anhydrite had higher proportion on membrane surface the priority in precipitation for the high si was responsible for the deposition on membrane which can be the reason for the flux decline in the 1st stage meanwhile the right shift of peaks showed constrained crystals growth because of the membrane as si was added in the solution in group b a significant difference between bulk deposits and the scaling layer as also verified by the sem appeared due to the higher affinity of si to membrane and the combination of si and ca the 0 2 0 facet was enhanced on membrane surface confirmed by the prism like morphology meanwhile caco3 had a higher proportion in bulk crystals as si was easily attached to the membrane and retard the deposition of caco3 wang et al 2010 talc showed a significant peak in the bulk deposits in group c 2θ 41 03 while the caso4 showed significantly lower intensity it means the si was prone to combine with mg and mainly happened in bulk zheng et al 2021 zhong et al 2016 meanwhile the diffraction peak at 34 8 originated from sepiolite that is caco3 caso4 and mg si complex appeared in the bulk deposits but caso4 with high intensity of 0 4 1 facet was the leading component in membrane surface similar to group b the mg si complex showed a low appearance while calcite and aragonite had high intensity in the scaling layer as ha was added group d the xrd pattern was significantly changed the 0 4 1 facet was significantly enhanced in membrane surface while 1 3 0 facet was restricted due to the absorption of ha curcio et al 2010 and similar to group c the mg si complexes like talc and akermanite mainly showed in bulk deposits while calcite and aragonite as well as dolomite can be found on membrane surface in group e the mg si complex had higher intensity on membrane surface which was attributed to the combination of bsa it was interesting to find that the composition was simple and similar for bulk crystals and fouled membrane in group f gypsum was the leading component with strong 0 4 1 facet intensity ca o s c mg and si were the main elements for foulants as shown in fig s11 si showed the highest intensity in group b and was mainly colloidal silica sio2 nh2o for the binding energy of 103 4 ev as shown in fig 6 it is significantly different with other groups in where si o 102 6 ev was the main chemical state the si o peak was enhanced for the appearance of ha as also evidenced by eds mapping which illuminated the consolidation of ha on the deposition of mg si complexes formed in bulk however the chemical state of si was more complicated and right shifted as bsa was added in groups e and f indicating the high affinity of bsa to mg si complexes meanwhile n showed the highest intensity in group e for the use of bsa however the highest fluoride signal c f 689 2 ev in group f also revealed that the foulants had a low affinity with the membrane mg was significantly enhanced as oms were added in feed another evidence for the consolidation of oms with mg si complexes mg showed a simple chemical state in vmd which can be attributed to mg si complex as the peak at around 1305 ev but the binding energy increased as bsa was used with peaks at 1305 4 and 1305 9 ev the combination with si was the reason it also explained the increase of mg content as oms were used the c f peak at 293 1 ev and 689 2 ev attributed to ptfe membrane represents the coverage and thickness of the foulants layer the scaling was alleviated as oms were added for the higher c f intensity and the detachment of the foulants layer was the reason for the significantly strong carbon intensity in group e two chemical states of o were found in md mainly in so4 2 532 2 ev and sio2 533 8 ev group b mainly had a so4 2 peak with a lower bind energy of o for the formation of bigger crystals while the proportion of sio2 peak increased as bsa was used indicating that the bsa would promote silica polymerization s showed a complicated chemical state with broad peaks as composed by s 2p3 2 and s 2p1 2 orbitals the so4 2 169 1 ev and caso4 170 2 ev were believed to be the main composition these results indicated the main composition of caso4 or ca mg si so4 and the broad peaks exhibited the more complicated hydrates ca presented mainly two chemical states with peaks at 348 1 ca 2p3 2 gypsum and 351 6 ev ca 2p1 2 caco3 the caf2 was another common scalant in vmd as f was added in each group 3 4 mixed scaling mechanism the key role of main foulants in the mixed scaling process was uncovered in this work as shown in fig 7 the flux decline activated as soon as the vmd started the surface crystallization of camg co3 2 caf2 and caco3 induced by heterogeneous nucleation was responsible for the incipient scaling colloidal silica and ha had high affinity to membrane which also contributed to incipient scaling meanwhile ha and si enhanced the scaling by combining with ca2 at carboxyl groups and the formation of intermolecular bridges between adjacent silica species lu et al 2020 silica was prone to combine with mg for the formation of amorphous mg si complexes which mainly formed in bulk and co precipitated with caso4 meanwhile ca also combined with si to some extent ca also plays a dominant role in the 3rd stage flux decline for the formation of gypsum moreover ha accelerates the deposition of ca as evidenced by the low ca content so4 2 mainly existed in caso4 for the low solubility which also combined with mg si mg altered si scaling from polymerization to mg si complex and significantly influenced the mixed scaling mechanism bsa acts as the cement of the mg si complexes so the scalants on membrane surface tend to gather together however the affinity to membrane was lower as compared to ha thus the scaling layer was easily detached based on the results discussed above it was clear that the incipient scalants were camg co3 2 caf2 caco3 and colloidal silica the membrane surface acted as a catalyst for surface nucleation while concentration polarization facilitated the crystallization ha had high affinity to membrane and ca2 which acted as the bridge and accelerated the ca2 deposition in the 1st stage as presented in fig 7b in the second stage mg si complex formed due to the high concentration of mg especially under the existence of bsa however the mg si complexes were formed in bulk and accumulated loosely on membrane surface thus had low influence on mass transfer at last the caso4 gypsum and bassanite became the leading scalants also accompanied by mg si complexes due to the significant concentration in vmd the thick and compacted scaling layer formed for the co precipitation of the hexahedral caso4 crystals and amorphous mg si complexes silica and bsa which was referred to the bricklaying process in other work zheng et al 2021 4 conclusions scaling is the biggest challenge for membrane based desulfurization wastewater treatment but the mixed scaling process was still a black box in this work we deconstructed the scaling formation process and the role of scalants with a cascade strategy the scaling mechanism was revealed and evidenced by the 3 stage flux decline curves camg co3 2 caf2 and caco3 induced by heterogeneous nucleation were responsible for the incipient scaling colloidal silica and ha also contributed to the incipient scaling for the high affinity which also enhanced the ca2 scaling silica was easily combined with mg for amorphous mg si complexes in bulk while caso4 was the dominant scalant in the 3rd stage flux decline mg altered si scaling from polymerization to mg si complex and significantly influenced the mixed scaling mechanism the scaling inhabitation was found by organic matters ha accelerated the incipient deposition of ca but limit the directional growth of caso4 while bsa tend to combine with mg si complexes the surface crystallization was the main mechanism incipient scaling process the deposition of mg si complexes happened in 2nd stage in which the scaling mechanism shifted from surface to bulk crystallization finally bricklaying of caso4 and mg si complexes results in the thick and compacted scaling layer causing a dramatic flux decline in the 3rd stage in conclusion bulk crystallization and the following bricklaying were the main scaling mechanism in desulfurization wastewater treatment while surface crystallization and absorption were the main incipient scaling mechanism this work fills in the gap in the mixed scaling mechanism in md which can be expanded to other desalination crystallization or pipe scaling processes however it is a proof of concept work more precise research strategy and analysis methods are still needed to

14785,mineral scaling is one key obstacle to membrane distillation in hypersaline wastewater desalination but the scaling or fouling mechanism is poorly understood addressing this challenge required revealing the foulants layer formation process in this work the scaling process was deconstructed with a cascade strategy by stepwise changing the composition of the synthetic desulfurization wastewater the flux decline curves presented a 3 stage mode in vacuum membrane distillation vmd heterogeneous nucleation of camg co3 2 caf2 and caco3 was the main incipient scaling mechanism mg si complex was the leading foulant in 2nd stage during which the scaling mechanism shifted from surface to bulk crystallization the flux decreased sharply for the formation of a thick and compacted scaling layer by the bricklaying of caso4 and mg si bsa complexes in the 3rd stage bulk crystallization was identified as the key scaling mechanism in vmd for the high salinity and concentration multiple the organic matter had an anti scaling effect by changing the bulk crystallization humic acids ha and colloidal silica also contributed to incipient scaling for the high affinity to membrane bovine serum albumin bsa acting as the cement of mg si complexes mg altered the si scaling from polymerization to mg si complex formation which significantly influence the mixed scaling mechanism this work deconstructed the mixed scaling process and illuminated the role of main foulants filling in the knowledge gap on the mixed scaling mechanism in vmd for hypersaline wastewater treatment and recovery graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane distillation mixed scaling bricklaying desulfurization wastewater bulk crystallization hypersaline wastewater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water reuse and salt recovery became the primary goal in water intensive industries under the strict wastewater discharge standards industrial wastewater treatment is now a hot issue in water science and market salt removal and recovery is still a far unsolved problem with an ultimate objective of zero liquid discharge zld panagopoulos and haralambous 2020 tong and elimelech 2016 tsai et al 2017 the hypersaline streams are commonly accompanied by high suspended solids organic matters oms or heavy metals which narrowed the selection range of the treatment technologies tsai et al 2017 membrane distillation md a promising desalination technology was widely applied in industrial wastewater treatment on lab scale kebria and rahimpour 2020 zhong et al 2021 more recently it is identified as a potential zld technology for the high concentration multiple even implementation of solidification called membrane crystallization with relatively low fouling potential lu et al 2019 tsai et al 2017 yadav et al 2022 however mineral scaling and the consequent wetting are the main obstacles to the industrial application of md liu et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 therefore understanding the scaling mechanism is essential for fouling and wetting mitigation and a gist for the industrial application scaling is initiated by nucleation and the following crystal growth process under saturation conditions the foreign interface promotes nucleation by lower the free energy barrier which was called heterogeneous nucleation rolf et al 2022 it is a thermodynamically favorable and kinetically faster process the prenucleation clusters formed with a few atoms within seconds at the membrane surface then nucleation and crystal growth begin and triggering on the incipient scaling pouget et al 2009 horseman et al 2019 saha et al 2012 meanwhile the concentration polarization enhances the chemical potential difference intensifies the nucleation and reduces the induction time on the contrary homogeneous crystallization is kinetically slow for the relatively lower free energy horseman et al 2019 but significant influence of homogeneous crystallization on scaling had also been reported in hypersaline wastewater treatment cao et al 2022 zou et al 2018 moreover the heterogeneous crystallization also happened in bulk for the presence of particles colloids and microbes which results in a rapid flux decline sparingly soluble salts like calcium sulfate caso4 calcium carbonate caco3 and magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 are the most common scalants they exhibit diverse morphology structure and properties on membrane surface resulting in distinct influences on flux decline and long term stability gypsum or caso4 scaling is known as a tenacious and adherent foulant in md fortunato et al 2018 warsinger et al 2015 while the significance of caco3 was also reported as compared to gypsum he et al 2009 in addition silica scaling is more complicated for different silica types rolf et al 2022 tong et al 2017 the coexistence of other substances cast another cloud in understanding the scaling process and promotes the research on the synergistic scaling mechanism in recent years su et al 2015 disclosed that common ions in seawater inhibited caco3 scaling and the effect of foreign ions was dependent on the saturation index si of caco3 but iron reduced the gypsum induction time and accelerates precipitation melliti et al 2021 meanwhile different scalants exhibited synergistic effects in the scaling process zarga et al 2012 found caso4 decreased the germination of caco3 by reducing the nucleation energy barrier whereas caco3 had no influence on caso4 but another study asserted that caco3 decreased the crystallization rate of caso4 sheikholeslami and ng 2001 retardation of caso4 crystallization by carbonate mg and other metal ions had also been observed saha et al 2012 sheikholeslami and ng 2001 furthermore synergistic effects between metal ions and silica were found by coprecipitation adsorption and coagulation in md chen et al 2020 qin et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 it was also demonstrated that the colloidal silica delayed the induction of gypsum by collisions between the colloids and nascent caso4 nuclei leading to the morphology transformation from needle like to plate like wang et al 2010 magnesium and silica were easily co precipitated in md but caco3 did not co precipitate with dissolved silica zhang et al 2018 zheng et al 2021 paradoxically the formation of ca si complexes also contributed to membrane scaling as disclosed in other works lu et al 2020 om had a more confusing role in scaling scaling reinforcement was widely reported even under unsaturation concentration by absorption chelation bridging and biological processes shim et al 2002 zularisam et al 2006 results in quick flux decline for the tight and structured foulants layer zheng et al 2018 in md process humic acids ha sodium alginate sa and bovine serum albumin bsa were found to promote scaling by complexation at carboxyl and hydroxy positions cho et al 2018 han et al 2017 however increasing attention was received on the anti scaling effect of om in md recently tijing et al 2015 curcio et al 2010 bsa and ha inhibited scaling by enhancing bulk crystallization while sa had a lower inhabitation effect for the strong interaction with ca2 yan et al 2021 meanwhile the mitigation of silica scaling was also observed by oms in membrane process qin et al 2018 qin et al 2017 besides it was also claimed that om had no impact on permeate flux with low concentration at the time scale of a few hours or days mericq et al 2010 in the real world hypersaline wastewater had a more complicated composition resulting in a more complicated mixed scaling for the coexistence of different types of foulants however most studies focused on the simulated wastewater with single or two specific substances it was unlikely to assess the scaling process in real wastewater where complicated mixtures are present sheikholeslami 2003 it was widely known single salt nucleation and crystallization kinetics cannot be extended to the mixed scaling process therefore systematic studies are necessary to incorporate the effect of the presence of other components on scaling as md was mainly applied in hypersaline wastewater treatment the deconstruction of the role of mixed scalants and disclosure of the scaling mechanism were essential for scaling mitigation chang et al 2003 investigated the scaling composition of the vmd in brackish water treatment which was found predominantly mg oh 2 mgsio3 mgso4 silica and organic matter traces zhong et al 2016 revealed the interactions of mg2 and ca2 with carbonates and silica in vmd for produced water treatment and identified the significant influence of mg si co precipitation on flux decline liu et al 2022 investigated the major species of mineral scales in produced wastewater treatment by md recently md was commonly used in real hypersaline wastewater treatment and the scaling was known as the key issue for application however these studies mainly focus on the composition and mitigation of scaling the scaling layer is still a totally black box and the formation process and mechanism of mixed scaling in md still hanging in the air in this study the mixed scaling in vmd was investigated with a cascade strategy by stepwise adding the key component in synthetic wastewaters the morphology of the scaling layer was investigated by scanning electron microscope sem accompanied by x ray energy spectrometer eds for analyzing the elemental composition and distribution the composition was investigated by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir x ray diffractometer xrd and x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps the scaling process was deconstructed and the role of the main foulants was illuminated by the decomposition of the foulants in the real desulfurization wastewater this work fills in the knowledge gap on the mixed scaling mechanism which can be expanded to other desalination crystallization or pipe scaling processes it also sheds light on scaling mitigation which had significant environmental and social effects under the strict wastewater discharge standards

concentration and the coexistence of oms li et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 the practical scaling was complicated and a key issue in the membrane based treatment process therefore the mixed scaling mechanism was deconstructed by gradually changing the composition of the synthetic wastewater synthetic wastewaters were prepared to simulate the desulfurization wastewater the concentration of different components was based on the real wastewater as previously reported zheng et al 2021 as caso4 was identified as the main inorganic foulant in the md process for desulfurization wastewater treatment ca2 and so4 2 were added in every group as shown in table 1 the effects of magnesium silicates fluoride carbonate and oms were added stepwise to demonstrate the different fouling morphology structure and composition with a concentration as measured in our previous work zheng et al 2021 the si of the feedwaters was calculated by phreeqc software 3 7 3 usgs usa to study the potential scalants during md the bulk crystallization of the synthetic wastewater was studied by static tests the wastewater with a volume of 500 ml in narrow neck bottles was put into an incubator with a shaking speed of 200 rpm under 50 c 10 ml water sample was taken out at 0 1 2 4 6 10 20 25 32 35 45 60 72 and 96 h respectively and the ph and conductivity were recorded the solid samples were obtained by membrane filtration with a 0 45 μm membrane vmd was applied in this work for fouling investigation with a lab scale setup as shown in fig s1 self prepared hollow fiber hf membrane module was used in vmd 20 hfs were encapsulated in a polypropylene annular tube with an effective area of 11 3 cm2 three liters of wastewater were added to the water tank and maintained at 50 c and the vacuum degree was 0 8 by a vacuum pump gm2 0 jinteng china the closed loop mode was applied as the permeate was not returned to feedwater liu et al 2020 the vmd process was terminated when the feedwater was 500 600 ml with a concentration factor of about 5 6 then the bulk deposits and the fouled membranes were collected and the foulants peeling from the membrane surface were also collected to study the difference between the foulants layer and the bulk deposits 2 3 scaling layer characterization the morphology of the bulk deposits and fouled membranes were observed using a field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem hitachi su8020 hitachi japan the elemental composition was analyzed by a hitachi s 3000n scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi japan equipped with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer eds and the elemental distribution was disclosed with eds mapping mode the samples were coated with gold nanoparticles prior to sem observations principal component analysis pca was proceeded for the composition of elements by canoco 5 0 software to study the correlation of each element in foulants layer ftir was applied for functional group recognition

salt concentration of the synthetic desulfurization wastewater was high which had high scaling potential during desalination the si of the feedwaters was calculated by phreeqc software as exhibited in table 2 parkhurst and appelo 2013 the potential scalants were mainly mg si complexes caco3 caf2 and sio2 at the start point mg si complexes presented high si for the high concentration and interaction activity especially for talc chrysotile and sepiolite caco3 in the forms of aragonite and calcite also showed high si which had a high potential for crystallization caso4 had a minus si in every group which had a lower potential for bulk nucleation the ph mainly displayed a three stage decline mode during the bulk crystallization test an instant decrease occurred attributed to the precipitation of carbonate or silica fig s2 for the high si then the ph became stable in a discrepant time for different compositions as co3 2 was exhausted at last the ph declined in groups c e due to the formation of mg si complexes the conductivity of the feed solutions was stable in all groups indicating the static bulk crystallization mainly happened on co3 2 f or silica with low concentration in the feedwater as can be verified by the high si that means the static bulk crystallization had low significance the vmd performance was presented in fig 1 the flux decline curves showed also a three stage process except for group c in the continuous operation it should be noted that the flux increase can be found in groups a and d at the beginning the low feed temperature in the first half an hour was the cause a rapid decline occurred immediately in each group which was attributed to the activation of surface crystallization and the effect of the concentration polarization liu et al 2022 the membrane promoted the surface crystallization of caco3 caf2 and caso4 at the start point as evidenced by the instant ph decrease fig s2 which was responsible for the flux decline in the 1st stage following was a stable flux stage in most groups with a low flux decline rate the transition from surface crystallization to bulk crystallization due to the increasing concentration was believed to be the cause zou et al 2018 and it also demonstrated that the deposition of bulk formed scalants in this stage had a low influence on flux due to the low coverage and loose accumulation on the membrane surface at last a sharp decline happened indicating the severe scaling for the concentration effect the main scaling mechanism in this stage was bulk crystallization due to the high salt concentration cao et al 2022 liu et al 2022 shin and sohn 2016 zou et al 2018 the similar flux decline rate and final flux demonstrated that bulk crystallization was the crucial mechanism in the closed looped vmd for desalination of the hypersaline wastewater also in consideration of the similar concentration multiple in each group and it is also worth noting that the j j0 was similar around 0 3 at about 25 h for all tests indicating the inorganic fouling was the key reason for flux decline meanwhile it can be safe to conclude that the oms showed anti scaling performance in the mixed scaling process silica accelerated the adsorption process and the 3rd stage started at 13 h with a j j0 of 0 8 the high si of sio2 was responsible for the quick surface crystallization and it was believed the high affinity of amorphous hydroxyl silica and the co precipitation with ca were other reasons for the flux decline fig 1 zhong et al 2016 the 2nd stage disappeared in group c as a high concentration of mg was added with a relatively constant decline rate during the whole process even the concentration multiple was high after 20 h of continuous operation the high scaling potential of the mg si complex was believed to be the reason for the high si and the accumulation of the amorphous complexes resulted in the flux decline with a stable rate it means the bulk crystallization was the main incipient fouling mechanism here as the content and si of caco3 and caf2 were relatively low it is also worth mentioning that a maximal ph variation happened in group c due to the consecutive precipitation of silica in the 3rd stage therefore the flux decline rate was a little increased after 15 h due to the co deposition of the two main foulants i e mg si complex and caso4 however when om was added to the feed the flux decline curve turned back to a 3 stage process however the flux decline rate decreased as evidenced by the shorter operation duration and the higher final flux that means the om postponed the scaling process so the flux decline rate decreased in both the 1st and 3rd stage as ha was added the inhibition of mg si complex and caso4 was the main mechanism attributed to its adsorption on the crystal and blocking the active sites for crystal growth cao et al 2022 yan et al 2021 on the contrary the bsa intensified the incipient fouling as shown in fig 1e f as bsa had lower affinity to membrane guan et al 2018 zheng et al 2022 this result was inconsistent with a previous work in which bsa showed more significant scaling postponement for both surface and bulk gypsum scaling yan et al 2021 the difference can be attributed to the mixed scaling process and high salt concentration bsa had high affinity to mg si complexes the leading bulk formed scalants at the preliminary stage result in an enhanced deposition 3 2 morphology and elemental composition all membranes were severely fouled as the concentration multiple was about 6 at the end of the vmd operation also evidenced by the high flux decline rate at the 3rd stage as shown in fig 1 mainly two types of foulants appeared in group a the prevailing needle like crystals were recognized as caso4 with a length width ratio of 3 10 the amorphous and porous foulants distributed in the gap junction of the caso4 and on the bottom of scaling layer were attributed to the coprecipitates of caco3 camg co3 2 and caf2 the bulk deposits showed a similar morphology with the scaling layer on the membrane surface indicating the key role of bulk crystallization in scaling fig s3 meanwhile the foulants were detected in the inner pores and the crystals can be found in the cross section especially for ca fig s4 the dense foulants layer and the hexahedral crystals with bigger size and lower length width ratio appeared in group b the amorphous coprecipitate was the key culprit for the flux decline in the 1st stage while the polymeric silica acted as the agglomerate for the formation of the dense bottom layer the thin but compacted layer was the reason for the absence of scaling in the inner pore structure and was responsible for maintaining the high rejection meanwhile colloidal sio2 with a spherical structure also appeared in the foulants layer and bulk deposits due to the increasing si concentration in vmd the absence of mg and om was responsible for the typical silica fouling which had a higher affinity to the ptfe membrane as compared to caso4 qin et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 on the contrary bulk crystallization was the main mechanism for caso4 and it had a low tendency to deposit on the si contained surface that explains the significantly bigger size and plate like structure as compared to group a wang et al 2010 when mg was added lamellar crystals recognized as mg si complex appeared for the high si and concentration zheng et al 2021 the hexahedral crystals exhibited a similar size as group b resulting from the bulk crystallization and the following deposition the formation of the mg si complex attenuated the fouling of colloidal silica but it can still be found fig s3 it demonstrated that the colloidal silica was first absorbed on the membrane surface followed by the formation and deposition of mg si complexes the caso4 was the leading foulants on the top of the scaling layer due to the high concentration of ca2 and so4 2 however the hexahedral crystals were significantly restrained and embedded in the foulants layer as ha was added into the feedwater with a significantly smaller size that means ha promoted the surface crystallization of ca and also changed the crystallographic form of caso4 cho et al 2018 yan et al 2021 bsa had a totally different effect on scaling as the hexahedral crystals became the leading foulants with a lower length width ratio and were covered by organic matters meanwhile the heterogeneity of the foulants increased in both size and morphology indicating synchronous surface and bulk crystallization it can be also demonstrated for the bulk deposits fig s3 the scaling layer of group f was similar to group e indicating the significance of bulk crystallization on the top of the scaling layer however the foulants on the bottom layer present a similar structure as group d it can be inferred that the ha had a higher affinity to the membrane and promote the surface crystallization while bsa had a high affinity with the crystals and acted as the cement for their stacking that explained the severe cross sectional scaling in groups e and f the main elements on the scaling layer were o c s ca and mg table s1 fig 4 ca s o and mg si complexes were identified for the highly consistent distribution of ca s o and mg si as disclosed by eds mapping for the consistent distribution fig 3 the hexahedral crystals were ca s o complex while the mg si complex present formless morphology and was distributed together with the hexagonal prism zheng et al 2021 the spheroidal crystals were mainly formed by si and o as shown in fig s6 in group b tong et al 2017 and the higher c and n intensity indicated the formation of organic fouling and its role in foulants layer formation the distribution of f and c was significantly distinguished from other foulants demonstrated its source of the original ptfe membrane ca s o complex with a ca s ratio of 0 97 was identified as caso4 it was the leading foulant in group a the difference in the distribution of ca and s and the variated ca s ratio illuminated different ca type foulants the ca s ratio higher than 1 indicated the appearance of other ca involved scalant like caco3 or caf2 while the low ca s may result from the interaction of ca with oms for si mg ratio it presented a significant difference in different groups the low proportion of mg should be the error of the measurement due to its limit of detection as no mg was added in group b the significantly high mg si ratio can be attributed to two reasons 1 mg had a significantly high concentration in the feed mg salts can be a key salt in bulk crystallization which can be easily detected in eds 2 si had higher affinity to membrane and the om especially for bsa so the proportion of si is low under eds the deposit of mg and c can also be found with low intensity which was in accordance with the sem image the spheroidal foulants fit well with si indicating the formation of colloidal si fig s6 meanwhile si is also combined with ca for the formation of amorphous foulants around the hexahedral caso4 the low intensity of f indicates the thick scaling layer which was responsible for the significant flux decline in group b the scaling mechanism significantly changed as mg was added si tend to combined with mg for the formation of formless foulants zhong et al 2016 li et al 2021 the hexahedral foulants mainly appeared at the top layer which was responsible for the monotonic flux decline curve meanwhile the centralized f distribution indicated the higher porosity of the scaling layer which explains the lower flux decline rate in the 3rd stage organic fouling appeared as ha and bsa were used in which mg showed a higher content figs 4 s7 9 hexahedral crystals had a smaller size as ha promotes the surface crystallization of ca and restricts the directional growth of caso4 crystals figs 2 and s7 curcio et al 2010 yan et al 2021 bsa had a higher affinity with crystals rather than the membrane which explains the low coverage of the foulants layer the bigger crystals with lower length width ratio as believed formed in bulk appeared at the top of the foulants layer and were closely bounded by bsa group b had the highest ca and lowest f content for the higher foulants coverage but the lowest ca s ratio of 0 7 indicated that other types of ca foulants as shown in table s1 the highest mg and lowest ca appeared as bsa was added further revealing its higher affinity to the mg si complex while ha tends to chelate with ca and is distributed in the bottom layer explained the lower ca content in groups d and f the ca s and o showed high positive correlation which is a key contributor to pca ii and the main foulants in groups a and b ptfe membrane was distinguished by a high content of carbon and fluoride mg was enriched in group c f for its high concentration in feed and group d f shared a cluster for the use of om meanwhile mg was negatively correlated to ca which was evidence for their distribution in the scaling layer interestingly si was positively correlated to ca but negatively correlated to mg one reason is that the content of si was low in the feed thus the significantly high content of si in group b had a huge influence on pca analysis while the high affinity of si with membrane was another reason as si was mainly distributed in the bottom of the foulants layer when om was added in the feed f content increased indicating the scaling inhibition effect group f showed the highest n content evidence for the high affinity of ha with the membrane and the higher distribution of bsa in the upper layer 3 3 dissecting the mixed scalants the bulk deposits showed different structure with the scaling layer revealed by ftir especially when om was added fig 5 the fouled membranes showed a similar spectrum with the surface foulants except for group e it demonstrated that the top layer caused by bulk crystallization was the main composition of the foulants layer meanwhile the foulants layers in different groups had similar spectra with significant absorption peaks of ptfe at 1204 and 1139 cm 1 indicated the similar composition of the porous particulate layer and thin adsorbed layer the split peaks at around 3400 cm 1 were attributed to oh and h2o at different structured environments the peaks at 1687 and 1628 cm 1 were attributed to the constitutional water mainly caused by gypsum as widely reported ding et al 2020 mandal and mandal 2002 the dispersed peaks at 1620 1700 cm 1 also illuminate the appearance of bassanite peaks appeared at 1659 and 1527 cm 1 as oms were applied which were associated to amide i and amide ii from bsa zheng et al 2018 and it was interesting to find new peaks at 1438 1338 898 and 845 cm 1 in group f on the foulants layer indicating the combination of the oms with ca2 mg2 or si the peak at 1102 cm 1 which appeared in every fouled membrane except group e for the detachment of the foulants layer was attributed to the absorption of so4 2 wang et al 2019 the peaks at 669 and 662 cm 1 also represent the stretching and bending modes of so4 2 the peak shown at 868 cm 1 especially in group b was an indicator of caco3 scaling the small peak at around 800 cm 1 was attributed to si o indicating that the si foulants mainly distributed in the depth position of the foulants layer pálková et al 2010 in group a the composition of the foulants on membrane surface and the bulk deposits were same as also evidenced by sem indicating the predominant role of bulk crystallization a significant shoulder peak at around 980 cm 1 indicated the appearance of si in group b pálková et al 2010 and the surface and bulk foulants displayed significant differences that is the intensity of the co3 2 peak 870 cm 1 increased and the constitutional water and caso4 peaks 1102 669 and 662 cm 1 decreased as mg was added group c the intensity of si was enhanced as it easily combined with mg rather than as colloidal silica and distributed at the bottom of the scaling layer meanwhile si showed higher content in the bulk deposits indicating that it was easily crystallized in bulk as shown in fig s6 due to the high concentration of mg in feedwaters correspondingly caso4 easily accumulated on membrane surface moreover the oh and h2o peaks were significantly enhanced exhibiting the more complicated constitutional water composition for the formation of mixed minerals on the membrane surface when oms were added the absorbance was significantly decreased for the bulk deposits which means the oms impeded the bulk crystallization yan et al 2021 while peaks at 1659 and 1527 cm 1 illuminated the contribution of om to membrane fouling and the om also changed the scaling process as illuminated by new peaks at 1438 and 1338 cm 1 in fig 5 the complicated xrd curves illuminated the intricate mixed scaling process however gypsum caso4 2h2o was the main foulants in all groups the crucial reasons come from two aspects one is the gypsum had a later order in nucleation and crystallization for the low si as shown in table 2 another one was the significantly high concentration of ca2 and so4 2 in the feed solutions therefore the caso4 formed mainly by bulk crystallization at the 3rd stage which was responsible for the similar flux decline pattern in each group meanwhile it had high possibility to showcase at the top of the scaling layer and the exterior of the bulk deposits the foulants mainly gypsum calcite and anhydrite on the membrane surface and the bulk were same in group a indicating the significance of bulk crystallization as demonstrated also by ftir the significantly high intensity of the 0 2 0 facet explained the needle like morphology with a large length width ratio rolf et al 2022 however calcite aragonite dolomite and anhydrite had higher proportion on membrane surface the priority in precipitation for the high si was responsible for the deposition on membrane which can be the reason for the flux decline in the 1st stage meanwhile the right shift of peaks showed constrained crystals growth because of the membrane as si was added in the solution in group b a significant difference between bulk deposits and the scaling layer as also verified by the sem appeared due to the higher affinity of si to membrane and the combination of si and ca the 0 2 0 facet was enhanced on membrane surface confirmed by the prism like morphology meanwhile caco3 had a higher proportion in bulk crystals as si was easily attached to the membrane and retard the deposition of caco3 wang et al 2010 talc showed a significant peak in the bulk deposits in group c 2θ 41 03 while the caso4 showed significantly lower intensity it means the si was prone to combine with mg and mainly happened in bulk zheng et al 2021 zhong et al 2016 meanwhile the diffraction peak at 34 8 originated from sepiolite that is caco3 caso4 and mg si complex appeared in the bulk deposits but caso4 with high intensity of 0 4 1 facet was the leading component in membrane surface similar to group b the mg si complex showed a low appearance while calcite and aragonite had high intensity in the scaling layer as ha was added group d the xrd pattern was significantly changed the 0 4 1 facet was significantly enhanced in membrane surface while 1 3 0 facet was restricted due to the absorption of ha curcio et al 2010 and similar to group c the mg si complexes like talc and akermanite mainly showed in bulk deposits while calcite and aragonite as well as dolomite can be found on membrane surface in group e the mg si complex had higher intensity on membrane surface which was attributed to the combination of bsa it was interesting to find that the composition was simple and similar for bulk crystals and fouled membrane in group f gypsum was the leading component with strong 0 4 1 facet intensity ca o s c mg and si were the main elements for foulants as shown in fig s11 si showed the highest intensity in group b and was mainly colloidal silica sio2 nh2o for the binding energy of 103 4 ev as shown in fig 6 it is significantly different with other groups in where si o 102 6 ev was the main chemical state the si o peak was enhanced for the appearance of ha as also evidenced by eds mapping which illuminated the consolidation of ha on the deposition of mg si complexes formed in bulk however the chemical state of si was more complicated and right shifted as bsa was added in groups e and f indicating the high affinity of bsa to mg si complexes meanwhile n showed the highest intensity in group e for the use of bsa however the highest fluoride signal c f 689 2 ev in group f also revealed that the foulants had a low affinity with the membrane mg was significantly enhanced as oms were added in feed another evidence for the consolidation of oms with mg si complexes mg showed a simple chemical state in vmd which can be attributed to mg si complex as the peak at around 1305 ev but the binding energy increased as bsa was used with peaks at 1305 4 and 1305 9 ev the combination with si was the reason it also explained the increase of mg content as oms were used the c f peak at 293 1 ev and 689 2 ev attributed to ptfe membrane represents the coverage and thickness of the foulants layer the scaling was alleviated as oms were added for the higher c f intensity and the detachment of the foulants layer was the reason for the significantly strong carbon intensity in group e two chemical states of o were found in md mainly in so4 2 532 2 ev and sio2 533 8 ev group b mainly had a so4 2 peak with a lower bind energy of o for the formation of bigger crystals while the proportion of sio2 peak increased as bsa was used indicating that the bsa would promote silica polymerization s showed a complicated chemical state with broad peaks as composed by s 2p3 2 and s 2p1 2 orbitals the so4 2 169 1 ev and caso4 170 2 ev were believed to be the main composition these results indicated the main composition of caso4 or ca mg si so4 and the broad peaks exhibited the more complicated hydrates ca presented mainly two chemical states with peaks at 348 1 ca 2p3 2 gypsum and 351 6 ev ca 2p1 2 caco3 the caf2 was another common scalant in vmd as f was added in each group 3 4 mixed scaling mechanism the key role of main foulants in the mixed scaling process was uncovered in this work as shown in fig 7 the flux decline activated as soon as the vmd started the surface crystallization of camg co3 2 caf2 and caco3 induced by heterogeneous nucleation was responsible for the incipient scaling colloidal silica and ha had high affinity to membrane which also contributed to incipient scaling meanwhile ha and si enhanced the scaling by combining with ca2 at carboxyl groups and the formation of intermolecular bridges between adjacent silica species lu et al 2020 silica was prone to combine with mg for the formation of amorphous mg si complexes which mainly formed in bulk and co precipitated with caso4 meanwhile ca also combined with si to some extent ca also plays a dominant role in the 3rd stage flux decline for the formation of gypsum moreover ha accelerates the deposition of ca as evidenced by the low ca content so4 2 mainly existed in caso4 for the low solubility which also combined with mg si mg altered si scaling from polymerization to mg si complex and significantly influenced the mixed scaling mechanism bsa acts as the cement of the mg si complexes so the scalants on membrane surface tend to gather together however the affinity to membrane was lower as compared to ha thus the scaling layer was easily detached based on the results discussed above it was clear that the incipient scalants were camg co3 2 caf2 caco3 and colloidal silica the membrane surface acted as a catalyst for surface nucleation while concentration polarization facilitated the crystallization ha had high affinity to membrane and ca2 which acted as the bridge and accelerated the ca2 deposition in the 1st stage as presented in fig 7b in the second stage mg si complex formed due to the high concentration of mg especially under the existence of bsa however the mg si complexes were formed in bulk and accumulated loosely on membrane surface thus had low influence on mass transfer at last the caso4 gypsum and bassanite became the leading scalants also accompanied by mg si complexes due to the significant concentration in vmd the thick and compacted scaling layer formed for the co precipitation of the hexahedral caso4 crystals and amorphous mg si complexes silica and bsa which was referred to the bricklaying process in other work zheng et al 2021 4 conclusions scaling is the biggest challenge for membrane based desulfurization wastewater treatment but the mixed scaling process was still a black box in this work we deconstructed the scaling formation process and the role of scalants with a cascade strategy the scaling mechanism was revealed and evidenced by the 3 stage flux decline curves camg co3 2 caf2 and caco3 induced by heterogeneous nucleation were responsible for the incipient scaling colloidal silica and ha also contributed to the incipient scaling for the high affinity which also enhanced the ca2 scaling silica was easily combined with mg for amorphous mg si complexes in bulk while caso4 was the dominant scalant in the 3rd stage flux decline mg altered si scaling from polymerization to mg si complex and significantly influenced the mixed scaling mechanism the scaling inhabitation was found by organic matters ha accelerated the incipient deposition of ca but limit the directional growth of caso4 while bsa tend to combine with mg si complexes the surface crystallization was the main mechanism incipient scaling process the deposition of mg si complexes happened in 2nd stage in which the scaling mechanism shifted from surface to bulk crystallization finally bricklaying of caso4 and mg si complexes results in the thick and compacted scaling layer causing a dramatic flux decline in the 3rd stage in conclusion bulk crystallization and the following bricklaying were the main scaling mechanism in desulfurization wastewater treatment while surface crystallization and absorption were the main incipient scaling mechanism this work fills in the gap in the mixed scaling mechanism in md which can be expanded to other desalination crystallization or pipe scaling processes however it is a proof of concept work more precise research strategy and analysis methods are still needed to

14786,low permeability aquitards may serve as secondary sources of slow releasing contaminants into the adjacent aquifer system creating considerable obstacles to groundwater cleanup accurately capturing the exchange of contaminant mass between aquitards and aquifers can facilitate site management and remediation previous simulation studies were mainly limited to one dimensional 1d back diffusion from aquitards during the remediation of the source zone in this study a novel two dimensional 2d back diffusion model is developed to investigate the storage and release of contaminants in aquitards after source isolation this model coupled the dynamical decay of isolated sources and the diffusion sorption process of contaminants in the layered aquitards exact analytical solutions for the present 2d multilayer model were derived using the finite cosine transform duhamel theorem separation of variables and transfer matrix method results indicated that the previous 1d model would overestimate the contaminant concentration in the aquitard and the back diffusion risk when the source zone was isolated the proposed 2d back diffusion model enables quantitative prediction of how source zone width source concentration and aquitard heterogeneity impact plume trailing time thus aiding in understanding the mechanisms of aquifer contamination beyond barrier controlled source zones graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords back diffusion plume trailing aquitard barrier analytical solution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater contamination poses severe threats to human and ecosystem health around the world various groundwater remediation programs e g the u s superfund program have been implemented to ensure the security of groundwater utilization however many remediation efforts failed to achieve the expected reductions in contamination levels kueper et al 2014 zhang et al 2022 an essential reason is that contaminants stored in aquitards may serve as a secondary source slowly releasing into adjacent aquifers after the primary contamination source has been remediated or isolated term back diffusion for example chapman and parker 2005 reported at a connecticut site where the contaminant source zone is isolated and downstream plume concentrations remain stabilized at several orders of magnitude above cleanup levels due to back diffusion from a clayey silt aquitard beneath the sand aquifer to facilitate the efficient management and remediation of contaminated sites the back diffusion of contaminants from low permeability soils has attracted considerable attention researchers have attempted to investigate the back diffusion behavior of contaminated aquitards through laboratory experiments sale et al 2008 tatti et al 2016 wanner and hunkeler 2015 yang et al 2015 you et al 2020 however these low permeability experiments are typically time consuming resulting in only a limited number of scenarios to be evaluated modeling studies were thus developed to extend the restricted experimental studies and assess the long term effects of back diffusion chapman et al 2012 seyedabbasi et al 2012 wanner et al 2018 yang et al 2017 numerical models can handle many complicated situations involving irregularly shaped low permeability regions and competitive adsorption and non uniform degradation reactions of multiple species chambon et al 2010 chapman et al 2012 muniruzzaman and rolle 2021 rasa et al 2011 wanner et al 2018 nevertheless these models typically require high resolution grids to capture large concentration gradients in the low permeability media which can lead to poor computational efficiency falta and wang 2017 another reason why numerical models are not commonly used for site risk assessment is the detailed site information requirements and the high learning costs analytical solutions are popular as screening tools in back diffusion risk assessment because they can efficiently obtain order of magnitude estimates with few input parameters required chambon et al 2011 also they can provide a benchmark for more complex numerical models over the past decade several analytical solutions have been developed to simulate contaminant back diffusion from a thick aquitard brown et al 2012 parker et al 2004 a thin argillaceous formation yang et al 2016 2017 low permeability fractured media chambon et al 2011 and layered sedimentary aquitards ding and feng 2022 ding et al 2022 these solutions assessed the long term risk of back diffusion after source zone remediation and are limited to one dimensional 1d diffusion in low permeability media in fact cost effective containment measures e g vertical barrier are increasingly employed for source zone control ding et al 2020 du et al 2015 filz et al 2001 shackelford et al 2005 xie et al 2018a nevertheless aquitard back diffusion subjected to barrier controlled source zones see fig 1 has not received much attention furthermore previous 1d back diffusion models are inapplicable to scenarios where the source zone is isolated because of the different concentrations on the two sides of the vertical barrier fig 1 to our knowledge the multidimensional back diffusion models under barrier controlled source zone have not been addressed and this research seeks to fill the critical gap in clear insight into the effect of barrier isolation on the back diffusion behavior of contaminants through aquitards and the persistence of the aquifer plume outside the barrier the main objectives of this work are to 1 develop a novel two dimensional 2d analytical model capable of describing the storage and release of contaminants in the layered aquitard subjected to barrier controlled source zones 2 compare the differences between the previous 1d model and the proposed 2d model in predicting the forward and back diffusion behaviors and 3 investigate the effects of space time characteristics of isolated sources and aquitard heterogeneity on the back diffusion risks 2 analytical model for 2d back diffusion fig 1 depicts an aquifer aquitard model involving the 2d transport of contaminants the model begins with the downward migration of dissolved phase contaminants from the barrier controlled source zone into the underlying aquitards driven by a concentration gradient i e forward diffusion the contaminants subsequently diffuse laterally and vertically in layered aquitards with adsorption desorption then the contaminated aquitard acts as a secondary source releasing contaminants to the clean aquifer outside the vertical barrier i e back diffusion this means the aquitards are essential channels for contaminants from the barrier controlled source zone to enter the downstream aquifer the present model allows for an arbitrary number of sedimentary aquitards and a time dependent concentration of source zone naturally the development of this screening level model also relies on several assumptions 1 each aquitard was assumed as homogeneous and isotropic cherry et al 2004 2 contaminant transport in the low permeability aquitards was considered to be dominated by diffusion ignoring advection brown et al 2012 3 contaminant adsorption desorption was assumed to be linear instantaneous and reversible xie et al 2018b 4 vertical barriers did not fail in the timeframe studied peng et al 2021 and their thickness was neglected 5 aquitard material parameters are not variable with time based on fick s second law the governing equation for the 2d diffusion adsorption coupled transport of contaminants in multilayer aquitards can be written as follows zheng and bennett 2002 1 r d i c i x z t t d x i 2 c i x z t x 2 d z i 2 c i x z t z 2 i 1 2 3 m where ci x z t ml 3 is the contaminant concentration in the i th aquitard x l and z l are the horizontal and vertical coordinates in the cartesian coordinate system respectively t t is the elapsed time rd i dimensionless is the retardation factor of the i th aquitard for contaminants dx i l2t 1 and dz i l2t 1 are the horizontal and vertical diffusion coefficients of contaminants in the i th aquitard respectively since advection in low permeability aquitards is neglected both dx i and dz i in this study are equal to the effective diffusion coefficient d l2t 1 based on the linear sorption isotherm model the retardation factor rd i is determined by 2 r i 1 ρ d i k d i n i where k d i l3m 1 is the contaminant distribution coefficient between the soil particles and pore water in the i th aquitard which is also the slope of the sorption isotherm ρd i ml 3 is the dry density of the i th aquitard and ni dimensionless is the porosity of the i th aquitard initially the contaminant concentration in the low permeability aquitard system is zero namely 3 c i x z t 0 0 i 1 2 3 m the boundary condition at the top of the aquitards should satisfy the concentration continuity and thus is written as follows 4 c 1 x z 0 t c s x t where cs x t ml 3 is the concentration of contaminants in the overlying aquifer here the source zone of the aquifer is enclosed by vertical barriers and the following segmentation function can represent cs 5 c s x t f s x t l 1 x l 2 0 x l 1 and x l 2 where fs x t ml 3 is the time and space dependent concentration distribution in the barrier controlled source zone and x l 1 and x l 2 are the locations of the upstream and downstream barriers respectively for the aquitard interfaces the continuum conditions for concentration and flux need to be satisfied 6 c i x z z i t c i 1 x z z i t i 1 2 3 m 1 7 n i d z i c i x z z i t z n i 1 d z i 1 c i 1 x z z i t z i 1 2 3 m 1 two types of typical outlet conditions are considered at the bottom boundary of the aquitard system the dirichlet boundary condition also known as the zero concentration boundary of eq 8 was adopted to reflect groundwater flushing xie et al 2018b and the neumann boundary condition also known as the non flux boundary of eq 9 was used to consider the bottom bedrock yang et al 2015 8 dirichlet boundary condition c m x z z m t 0 9 neumann boundary condition c m x z z m t z 0 the left and right boundaries of the low permeability aquitard system were set as non flux boundaries 10 c i x 0 z t x 0 i 1 2 3 m 11 c i x l z t x 0 i 1 2 3 m an idealized semi infinite domain model can also be obtained by setting an approximately infinite value of l in eq 11 i e ci x z t z a novel coupled solution method that employs the finite cosine transform duhamel theorem separation of variables and the transfer matrix method is developed to obtain analytical solutions for the 2d back diffusion problem depicted by eqs 1 11 the derivation of the concentration solutions is thoroughly documented in appendix a based on fick s first law the mass flux from the source zone into the aquitards can be written as 12 f i n x t n 1 d z 1 c 1 x z 0 t z l 1 x l 2 the mass flux of back diffusion into the overlying aquifer outside the barrier is 13 f o u t x t n 1 d z 1 c 1 x z 0 t z x l 1 and x l 2 hence the flux average concentration ca in the aquifer outside the barrier can be given as follows yang et al 2015 14 c a t 0 l 1 f o u t x t d x l 2 l f o u t x t d x n a v a h a where na v a and ha are the porosity seepage velocity and thickness of the overlying aquifer 3 convergence and verification of the back diffusion solution 3 1 convergence this section begins with a convergence test for the general solution of eq a26 a layered low permeability soil model is adopted as the base case this model consists of silt clay loam silt loam and clay layers from above to below each with a thickness of 0 3 m the material parameters are given in table s1 see supplementary material the width of the model along the x axis is set to 50 m to avoid the effect of the boundary a 2 m wide barrier controlled source zone is located in the center of the overlying aquifer i e l 1 24 m and l 2 26 m where the contaminant concentration satisfies the exponential decay function fs c 0 exp λst the initial concentration c 0 and decay coefficient λs were set to 1 mg l and 0 2 year 1 respectively the exponential function which is derived from the power law model falta et al 2007 2005 suk et al 2022 is a well established source depletion function that has been extensively validated both theoretically and experimentally chen and jawitz 2009 newell et al 2006 zhu and sykes 2004 it is a reliable tool for characterizing the dissolution and remediation of contaminant sources the neumann bottom boundary condition was adopted for the solution of eq a26 generated by the finite cosine inversion a reliable result can be obtained by choosing a suitable number of summation terms table s2 demonstrates the gradual convergence of the concentration solution eq a26 in the space time domain as the number of summation terms km is increased from 50 to 500 see supplementary material the results for km 300 are almost identical to those for km 500 so km 300 will be taken for the next analysis 3 2 numerical verification the converged solution was then verified by a numerical model built with the finite element software comsol multiphysics 5 6 the numerical model was divided into 2418 grid cells in comsol and solved using the convective diffusion equation module the total simulation time was 50 years with a time step of 0 5 years figs 2 a demonstrates that the concentration profiles obtained from the present analytical scheme and the comsol numerical model are almost identical as for the back diffusion flux fout the results obtained by the two methods also agree fig 2b 3 3 experiment verification yang et al 2016 carried out a well controlled back diffusion flow chamber experiment 28 12 1 2 cm in size as shown in fig s1 supplementary material the chamber was successively filled with 4 cm thick sand high permeability zone and 7 cm thick kaolinite low permeability zone a continuously stirred tank reactor cstr achieved an exponential decay of the bromide source concentration the source concentration decreased from 10 g l to 0 g l over 40 days i e the source decay coefficient is 0 125 day 1 the bromide solute was delivered to the sand layer using a syringe pump with a piston pump at the outlet to control the steady state flow teflon tape was placed on the top of the kaolinite layer to prevent bromide escape see fig s1 which was simplified to a zero flux boundary neumann boundary condition in this study the molecular diffusion coefficient of bromide d 0 was measured to be 1 7 10 4 m2 d the tortuosity factor τ porosity n and retardation factor rd of kaolinite were 0 2 0 6 and 1 respectively yang et al 2016 bromide solute concentrations in kaolinite were measured using the electrical conductivity method and compared with the advanced analytical solution in this study the theoretical solution predictions agree well with the experimental data set fig 3 therefore the convergence and correctness of the analytical solutions have been illustrated and then applied to investigate the two dimensional back diffusion from layered aquitards and the consequent persistence of the aquifer plume 4 results and discussion the layered aquitard model used in section 3 1 will be used as a base case for the subsequent investigation the material parameters for the aquitards and the overlying aquifer are given in tables s1 and s3 respectively the contamination sources are isolated in the x 24 m to 26 m region of the aquifer and their initial concentration and decay coefficients of contaminant source are 1100 mg l and 0 2 year 1 respectively chapman and parker 2005 4 1 comparison with the previous 1d back diffusion model as mentioned in the introduction previous back diffusion models usually ignore the horizontal diffusion of contaminants in aquitards resulting in 1d models to facilitate analytical solutions in fact horizontal diffusion could change the distribution of contaminants in aquitards and influence the subsequent long term back diffusion behavior compared to the proposed 2d model shown in fig 4 b the simplified 1d models fig 4a overestimated the concentration of contaminants in the aquitards below the source zone the difference in concentrations predicted by the two models was quantified by δc c 1d c 2d c 2d with a larger δc implying a larger difference fig 4c with a successive increase in the horizontal distance from the source center δc increased and reached a maximum of 100 below the barrier δc also grew with time fig 4c as an example for the position x 25 6 m z 0 3 m the δc was only 8 at t 20 years but it would increase to 38 as the elapsed time t increased to 200 years when the depth z increases to 0 6 m fig s2 shows that there is still a significant difference between the predicted concentrations from the 1d and 2d models the above results suggested that previous 1d models are not well suited for predicting contaminant concentrations below the barrier controlled source zone especially long term concentrations below the edge of the source zone the present 2d model not only allowed for more accurate predictions of the concentration in the low permeability aquitards beneath the source zone but also captured the contamination in the surrounding low permeability zone with a tendency of release back into the overlying aquifer fig 4b t 10 years as time t increases to 20 years a decrease in the concentration in the aquitards was observed fig 4d which might be attributed to the coupling of horizontal and back diffusion of contaminants this 2d back diffusion behavior would potentially threaten the aquifer outside the barrier but cannot be predicted by previous 1d models fig 5 further compares the 1d model source zone without barrier and 2d model with barrier to investigate the effect of source isolation on the back diffusion from contaminated aquitards the extent initial concentrations and decay coefficients of the contaminant source for both models were consistent with the base case fig 5a shows that the barrier free isolation case has a later onset of back diffusion due to the need for concentration gradient reversal ding et al 2022 but its contaminant mass discharge is faster the isolation of the source zone significantly reduced the reverse release of contaminants into the aquifer fig 5a for example the cumulative mass discharge in the barrier isolation case at 100 years was only about half that of the no isolation case these released contaminants can create a long term plume in the aquifer as shown in fig 5b trichloroethylene tce was selected as the targeted contaminant and its maximum concentration level of 5 μg l was used as the screening value svtce following u s epa 2009 the point at which the concentration of tce in the aquifer meets the svtce has been designated as the plume trailing time for the base case barrier isolation for the source zone reduced the plume trailing time from 64 9 to 10 7 years fig 5b which also indicated that the previous simplified 1d model might significantly overestimate the risk of plume tailing when the aquifer source zone is isolated the following part of this study moves on to describe in greater detail the 2d back diffusion from the aquitards underlying barrier controlled source zones 4 2 effect of contamination source zone characteristics this section will investigate the effects of isolated source zone characteristics including source zone width ws l 2 l 1 and concentration decay coefficient λs on the 2d back diffusion behavior and the consequent aquifer plume persistence with an increase in ws the mass of contaminants reverse released into the aquifer outside the barrier was reduced fig 6 a specifically the cumulative mass discharge during back diffusion cmd was decreased by 50 with doubling the width of the source zone this might be due to a fixed source mass with smaller concentrations in the broader source zone a larger ws would thus result in a smaller flux averaged concentration ca and trailing time t t fig 6b for example the t t decreased from 15 9 to 6 years as ws increased from 1 to 4 m these findings suggested that the site management and remediation projects should appropriately consider increasing the extent of contaminant source isolation zones within the allowed site boundaries fig 6c quantified this relationship of t t ws that is fitted by an exponential decay function t t a l exp b l ws with a set of fitting parameters a l and b l fig s3 shows that the relationship of t t ws in a homogeneous aquitard system also satisfies exponential functions the decay coefficient λs of source concentration could also significantly affect the plume trailing time t t ding and feng 2022 the t t increased from 10 6 years to nearly a century when λs decreased from 0 2 to 0 025 year 1 fig 7 a as λs continued to decline t t would still increase considerably which could also be fitted as the exponential function of t t a l exp b l lg λs fig 7b based on extensive scenario simulation the relationship between the fitting parameters a l and b l and the source zone width ws is given in fig 7c therefore the specific prediction formula for the plume trailing time overlying the layered aquitard system was obtained i e t t 4 162 e 0 466 ws exp 1 644 0 115ws lg λs likewise the exponential decay function could predict the relationship of t t λs in a homogeneous aquitard system fig s4 the above fitting functions provided quantified relationships between the plume trailing time and the source decay coefficient and implied that accelerating the depletion of the contaminants in the containment zone by remediation techniques such as extraction is an efficient measure to inhibit back diffusion from aquitards 4 3 effects of aquitard heterogeneity stratified aquitards have been commonly observed especially in coastal areas cherry et al 2004 hendry et al 2011 xu et al 2009 this section compared the layered and homogeneous models to investigate the role of aquitard heterogeneity in 2d back diffusion in the early stages the two models predicted almost identical flux averaged concentrations in the overlying aquifer and the prediction differences increased gradually over time fig 8 a this was because the contaminants initially entered only the same top aquitard in both models e g t 2 years in fig 8b and later the contaminants penetrated different underlying aquitards e g t 10 years in fig 8b affecting the long term back diffusion behavior thus fig 8a presents an 8 6 year or 1 7 year difference in plume trailing times predicted by the layered model t t layer and the homogeneous model t t homo when the retardation factor of the top aquitard rd 1 1 or rd 1 5 the maximum relative difference between t t layer and t t homo δ t t homo t t layer t t layer reached 83 5 fig 9 with a successive increase in rd 1 t t homo decreased in contrast t t layer increased giving rise to a smaller δ when rd 1 7 5 the simplified homogeneous model significantly overestimated the trailing time of the plume above the heterogeneous aquitard system implying that the layered model is required to enable a more accurate prediction fig 10 further analyzes the coupling effect of the thickness and retardation factor of the top aquitard on the prediction error between homogeneous and layered models δ t t homo t t layer t t layer using a criterion of δ 5 dash line fig 10 is divided into a strong effect zone of aquitard stratification in the lower left side δ 5 and a weak effect zone in the upper right side δ 5 clearly simplified homogeneous models are not applicable in predicting the back diffusion of contaminants from layered aquitard systems with small topsoil thickness and retardation factors such simplification may result in a prediction error of up to 180 in the plume trailing time 5 conclusions this work developed a two dimensional back diffusion analytical model to rapidly predict the storage and release of contaminants from the layered aquitards subjected to barrier controlled source zones the effects of multidimensional transport of contaminants space time characteristics of barrier controlled source zones and aquitard heterogeneity on the back diffusion behavior were investigated the main findings were drawn as follows 1 previous one dimensional back diffusion models would significantly overestimate the long term concentrations of contaminants in the aquitards especially below the edge of the barrier controlled source zone 2 when dealing with heterogeneous aquitards utilizing the simplified homogeneous model may lead to a prediction error of more than 180 in the trailing time for the overlying aquifer plume 3 enlarging the barrier controlled source zone and employing remediation techniques to accelerate source depletion would be advantageous in efficiently preventing aquitard back diffusion appendix a derivation of the 2d back diffusion solution the methodology employed involves a sequence of five key steps the first step is to perform a finite cosine transform of a1 c k z t 2 l 0 l c x z t c o s k π x l d x into the governing equations of eq 1 with the aid of the left and right boundary conditions eqs 10 11 one yields a2 r d i c i k z t t d z i 2 c i k z t z 2 k 2 π 2 d x i l 2 c i k z t i 1 2 3 m where k is the finite cosine transform parameter following the above transform procedure the initial conditions eq 3 boundary conditions eqs 4 8 9 and interface continuity conditions eqs 6 7 in the finite cosine transform domain can also be written as a3 c i k z t 0 0 i 1 2 3 m a4 c 1 k z 0 t c s k t a5 c m k z z m t 0 a6 c m k z z m t z 0 a7 c i k z z i t c i 1 k z z i t i 1 2 3 m 1 a8 n i d z i c i k z z i t z n i 1 d z i 1 c i 1 k z z i t z i 1 2 3 m 1 notably to obtain the exact analytical expression of cs k t in eq a4 using the finite cosine transform of eq a1 the function fs x t in eq 5 is typically required to be an elementary function of x such as linear exponential or trigonometric functions or their combinations if fs x t is an arbitrary concentration distribution concerning x it can also be approximately equivalent using piecewise elementary functions to obtain an approximate explicit solution for cs k t in step 2 duhamel s theorem of eq a9 is introduced to solve the transport problem with the time dependent boundary of eq a4 a9 c i k z t 0 t c s k τ φ i k z t τ t d τ i 1 2 3 m where φi k z t is the auxiliary function substituting the

14786,low permeability aquitards may serve as secondary sources of slow releasing contaminants into the adjacent aquifer system creating considerable obstacles to groundwater cleanup accurately capturing the exchange of contaminant mass between aquitards and aquifers can facilitate site management and remediation previous simulation studies were mainly limited to one dimensional 1d back diffusion from aquitards during the remediation of the source zone in this study a novel two dimensional 2d back diffusion model is developed to investigate the storage and release of contaminants in aquitards after source isolation this model coupled the dynamical decay of isolated sources and the diffusion sorption process of contaminants in the layered aquitards exact analytical solutions for the present 2d multilayer model were derived using the finite cosine transform duhamel theorem separation of variables and transfer matrix method results indicated that the previous 1d model would overestimate the contaminant concentration in the aquitard and the back diffusion risk when the source zone was isolated the proposed 2d back diffusion model enables quantitative prediction of how source zone width source concentration and aquitard heterogeneity impact plume trailing time thus aiding in understanding the mechanisms of aquifer contamination beyond barrier controlled source zones graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords back diffusion plume trailing aquitard barrier analytical solution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater contamination poses severe threats to human and ecosystem health around the world various groundwater remediation programs e g the u s superfund program have been implemented to ensure the security of groundwater utilization however many remediation efforts failed to achieve the expected reductions in contamination levels kueper et al 2014 zhang et al 2022 an essential reason is that contaminants stored in aquitards may serve as a secondary source slowly releasing into adjacent aquifers after the primary contamination source has been remediated or isolated term back diffusion for example chapman and parker 2005 reported at a connecticut site where the contaminant source zone is isolated and downstream plume concentrations remain stabilized at several orders of magnitude above cleanup levels due to back diffusion from a clayey silt aquitard beneath the sand aquifer to facilitate the efficient management and remediation of contaminated sites the back diffusion of contaminants from low permeability soils has attracted considerable attention researchers have attempted to investigate the back diffusion behavior of contaminated aquitards through laboratory experiments sale et al 2008 tatti et al 2016 wanner and hunkeler 2015 yang et al 2015 you et al 2020 however these low permeability experiments are typically time consuming resulting in only a limited number of scenarios to be evaluated modeling studies were thus developed to extend the restricted experimental studies and assess the long term effects of back diffusion chapman et al 2012 seyedabbasi et al 2012 wanner et al 2018 yang et al 2017 numerical models can handle many complicated situations involving irregularly shaped low permeability regions and competitive adsorption and non uniform degradation reactions of multiple species chambon et al 2010 chapman et al 2012 muniruzzaman and rolle 2021 rasa et al 2011 wanner et al 2018 nevertheless these models typically require high resolution grids to capture large concentration gradients in the low permeability media which can lead to poor computational efficiency falta and wang 2017 another reason why numerical models are not commonly used for site risk assessment is the detailed site information requirements and the high learning costs analytical solutions are popular as screening tools in back diffusion risk assessment because they can efficiently obtain order of magnitude estimates with few input parameters required chambon et al 2011 also they can provide a benchmark for more complex numerical models over the past decade several analytical solutions have been developed to simulate contaminant back diffusion from a thick aquitard brown et al 2012 parker et al 2004 a thin argillaceous formation yang et al 2016 2017 low permeability fractured media chambon et al 2011 and layered sedimentary aquitards ding and feng 2022 ding et al 2022 these solutions assessed the long term risk of back diffusion after source zone remediation and are limited to one dimensional 1d diffusion in low permeability media in fact cost effective containment measures e g vertical barrier are increasingly employed for source zone control ding et al 2020 du et al 2015 filz et al 2001 shackelford et al 2005 xie et al 2018a nevertheless aquitard back diffusion subjected to barrier controlled source zones see fig 1 has not received much attention furthermore previous 1d back diffusion models are inapplicable to scenarios where the source zone is isolated because of the different concentrations on the two sides of the vertical barrier fig 1 to our knowledge the multidimensional back diffusion models under barrier controlled source zone have not been addressed and this research seeks to fill the critical gap in clear insight into the effect of barrier isolation on the back diffusion behavior of contaminants through aquitards and the persistence of the aquifer plume outside the barrier the main objectives of this work are to 1 develop a novel two dimensional 2d analytical model capable of describing the storage and release of contaminants in the layered aquitard subjected to barrier controlled source zones 2 compare the differences between the previous 1d model and the proposed 2d model in predicting the forward and back diffusion behaviors and 3 investigate the effects of space time characteristics of isolated sources and aquitard heterogeneity on the back diffusion risks 2 analytical model for 2d back diffusion fig 1 depicts an aquifer aquitard model involving the 2d transport of contaminants the model begins with the downward migration of dissolved phase contaminants from the barrier controlled source zone into the underlying aquitards driven by a concentration gradient i e forward diffusion the contaminants subsequently diffuse laterally and vertically in layered aquitards with adsorption desorption then the contaminated aquitard acts as a secondary source releasing contaminants to the clean aquifer outside the vertical barrier i e back diffusion this means the aquitards are essential channels for contaminants from the barrier controlled source zone to enter the downstream aquifer the present model allows for an arbitrary number of sedimentary aquitards and a time dependent concentration of source zone naturally the development of this screening level model also relies on several assumptions 1 each aquitard was assumed as homogeneous and isotropic cherry et al 2004 2 contaminant transport in the low permeability aquitards was considered to be dominated by diffusion ignoring advection brown et al 2012 3 contaminant adsorption desorption was assumed to be linear instantaneous and reversible xie et al 2018b 4 vertical barriers did not fail in the timeframe studied peng et al 2021 and their thickness was neglected 5 aquitard material parameters are not variable with time based on fick s second law the governing equation for the 2d diffusion adsorption coupled transport of contaminants in multilayer aquitards can be written as follows zheng and bennett 2002 1 r d i c i x z t t d x i 2 c i x z t x 2 d z i 2 c i x z t z 2 i 1 2 3 m where ci x z t ml 3 is the contaminant concentration in the i th aquitard x l and z l are the horizontal and vertical coordinates in the cartesian coordinate system respectively t t is the elapsed time rd i dimensionless is the retardation factor of the i th aquitard for contaminants dx i l2t 1 and dz i l2t 1 are the horizontal and vertical diffusion coefficients of contaminants in the i th aquitard respectively since advection in low permeability aquitards is neglected both dx i and dz i in this study are equal to the effective diffusion coefficient d l2t 1 based on the linear sorption isotherm model the retardation factor rd i is determined by 2 r i 1 ρ d i k d i n i where k d i l3m 1 is the contaminant distribution coefficient between the soil particles and pore water in the i th aquitard which is also the slope of the sorption isotherm ρd i ml 3 is the dry density of the i th aquitard and ni dimensionless is the porosity of the i th aquitard initially the contaminant concentration in the low permeability aquitard system is zero namely 3 c i x z t 0 0 i 1 2 3 m the boundary condition at the top of the aquitards should satisfy the concentration continuity and thus is written as follows 4 c 1 x z 0 t c s x t where cs x t ml 3 is the concentration of contaminants in the overlying aquifer here the source zone of the aquifer is enclosed by vertical barriers and the following segmentation function can represent cs 5 c s x t f s x t l 1 x l 2 0 x l 1 and x l 2 where fs x t ml 3 is the time and space dependent concentration distribution in the barrier controlled source zone and x l 1 and x l 2 are the locations of the upstream and downstream barriers respectively for the aquitard interfaces the continuum conditions for concentration and flux need to be satisfied 6 c i x z z i t c i 1 x z z i t i 1 2 3 m 1 7 n i d z i c i x z z i t z n i 1 d z i 1 c i 1 x z z i t z i 1 2 3 m 1 two types of typical outlet conditions are considered at the bottom boundary of the aquitard system the dirichlet boundary condition also known as the zero concentration boundary of eq 8 was adopted to reflect groundwater flushing xie et al 2018b and the neumann boundary condition also known as the non flux boundary of eq 9 was used to consider the bottom bedrock yang et al 2015 8 dirichlet boundary condition c m x z z m t 0 9 neumann boundary condition c m x z z m t z 0 the left and right boundaries of the low permeability aquitard system were set as non flux boundaries 10 c i x 0 z t x 0 i 1 2 3 m 11 c i x l z t x 0 i 1 2 3 m an idealized semi infinite domain model can also be obtained by setting an approximately infinite value of l in eq 11 i e ci x z t z a novel coupled solution method that employs the finite cosine transform duhamel theorem separation of variables and the transfer matrix method is developed to obtain analytical solutions for the 2d back diffusion problem depicted by eqs 1 11 the derivation of the concentration solutions is thoroughly documented in appendix a based on fick s first law the mass flux from the source zone into the aquitards can be written as 12 f i n x t n 1 d z 1 c 1 x z 0 t z l 1 x l 2 the mass flux of back diffusion into the overlying aquifer outside the barrier is 13 f o u t x t n 1 d z 1 c 1 x z 0 t z x l 1 and x l 2 hence the flux average concentration ca in the aquifer outside the barrier can be given as follows yang et al 2015 14 c a t 0 l 1 f o u t x t d x l 2 l f o u t x t d x n a v a h a where na v a and ha are the porosity seepage velocity and thickness of the overlying aquifer 3 convergence and verification of the back diffusion solution 3 1 convergence this section begins with a convergence test for the general solution of eq a26 a layered low permeability soil model is adopted as the base case this model consists of silt clay loam silt loam and clay layers from above to below each with a thickness of 0 3 m the material parameters are given in table s1 see supplementary material the width of the model along the x axis is set to 50 m to avoid the effect of the boundary a 2 m wide barrier controlled source zone is located in the center of the overlying aquifer i e l 1 24 m and l 2 26 m where the contaminant concentration satisfies the exponential decay function fs c 0 exp λst the initial concentration c 0 and decay coefficient λs were set to 1 mg l and 0 2 year 1 respectively the exponential function which is derived from the power law model falta et al 2007 2005 suk et al 2022 is a well established source depletion function that has been extensively validated both theoretically and experimentally chen and jawitz 2009 newell et al 2006 zhu and sykes 2004 it is a reliable tool for characterizing the dissolution and remediation of contaminant sources the neumann bottom boundary condition was adopted for the solution of eq a26 generated by the finite cosine inversion a reliable result can be obtained by choosing a suitable number of summation terms table s2 demonstrates the gradual convergence of the concentration solution eq a26 in the space time domain as the number of summation terms km is increased from 50 to 500 see supplementary material the results for km 300 are almost identical to those for km 500 so km 300 will be taken for the next analysis 3 2 numerical verification the converged solution was then verified by a numerical model built with the finite element software comsol multiphysics 5 6 the numerical model was divided into 2418 grid cells in comsol and solved using the convective diffusion equation module the total simulation time was 50 years with a time step of 0 5 years figs 2 a demonstrates that the concentration profiles obtained from the present analytical scheme and the comsol numerical model are almost identical as for the back diffusion flux fout the results obtained by the two methods also agree fig 2b 3 3 experiment verification yang et al 2016 carried out a well controlled back diffusion flow chamber experiment 28 12 1 2 cm in size as shown in fig s1 supplementary material the chamber was successively filled with 4 cm thick sand high permeability zone and 7 cm thick kaolinite low permeability zone a continuously stirred tank reactor cstr achieved an exponential decay of the bromide source concentration the source concentration decreased from 10 g l to 0 g l over 40 days i e the source decay coefficient is 0 125 day 1 the bromide solute was delivered to the sand layer using a syringe pump with a piston pump at the outlet to control the steady state flow teflon tape was placed on the top of the kaolinite layer to prevent bromide escape see fig s1 which was simplified to a zero flux boundary neumann boundary condition in this study the molecular diffusion coefficient of bromide d 0 was measured to be 1 7 10 4 m2 d the tortuosity factor τ porosity n and retardation factor rd of kaolinite were 0 2 0 6 and 1 respectively yang et al 2016 bromide solute concentrations in kaolinite were measured using the electrical conductivity method and compared with the advanced analytical solution in this study the theoretical solution predictions agree well with the experimental data set fig 3 therefore the convergence and correctness of the analytical solutions have been illustrated and then applied to investigate the two dimensional back diffusion from layered aquitards and the consequent persistence of the aquifer plume 4 results and discussion the layered aquitard model used in section 3 1 will be used as a base case for the subsequent investigation the material parameters for the aquitards and the overlying aquifer are given in tables s1 and s3 respectively the contamination sources are isolated in the x 24 m to 26 m region of the aquifer and their initial concentration and decay coefficients of contaminant source are 1100 mg l and 0 2 year 1 respectively chapman and parker 2005 4 1 comparison with the previous 1d back diffusion model as mentioned in the introduction previous back diffusion models usually ignore the horizontal diffusion of contaminants in aquitards resulting in 1d models to facilitate analytical solutions in fact horizontal diffusion could change the distribution of contaminants in aquitards and influence the subsequent long term back diffusion behavior compared to the proposed 2d model shown in fig 4 b the simplified 1d models fig 4a overestimated the concentration of contaminants in the aquitards below the source zone the difference in concentrations predicted by the two models was quantified by δc c 1d c 2d c 2d with a larger δc implying a larger difference fig 4c with a successive increase in the horizontal distance from the source center δc increased and reached a maximum of 100 below the barrier δc also grew with time fig 4c as an example for the position x 25 6 m z 0 3 m the δc was only 8 at t 20 years but it would increase to 38 as the elapsed time t increased to 200 years when the depth z increases to 0 6 m fig s2 shows that there is still a significant difference between the predicted concentrations from the 1d and 2d models the above results suggested that previous 1d models are not well suited for predicting contaminant concentrations below the barrier controlled source zone especially long term concentrations below the edge of the source zone the present 2d model not only allowed for more accurate predictions of the concentration in the low permeability aquitards beneath the source zone but also captured the contamination in the surrounding low permeability zone with a tendency of release back into the overlying aquifer fig 4b t 10 years as time t increases to 20 years a decrease in the concentration in the aquitards was observed fig 4d which might be attributed to the coupling of horizontal and back diffusion of contaminants this 2d back diffusion behavior would potentially threaten the aquifer outside the barrier but cannot be predicted by previous 1d models fig 5 further compares the 1d model source zone without barrier and 2d model with barrier to investigate the effect of source isolation on the back diffusion from contaminated aquitards the extent initial concentrations and decay coefficients of the contaminant source for both models were consistent with the base case fig 5a shows that the barrier free isolation case has a later onset of back diffusion due to the need for concentration gradient reversal ding et al 2022 but its contaminant mass discharge is faster the isolation of the source zone significantly reduced the reverse release of contaminants into the aquifer fig 5a for example the cumulative mass discharge in the barrier isolation case at 100 years was only about half that of the no isolation case these released contaminants can create a long term plume in the aquifer as shown in fig 5b trichloroethylene tce was selected as the targeted contaminant and its maximum concentration level of 5 μg l was used as the screening value svtce following u s epa 2009 the point at which the concentration of tce in the aquifer meets the svtce has been designated as the plume trailing time for the base case barrier isolation for the source zone reduced the plume trailing time from 64 9 to 10 7 years fig 5b which also indicated that the previous simplified 1d model might significantly overestimate the risk of plume tailing when the aquifer source zone is isolated the following part of this study moves on to describe in greater detail the 2d back diffusion from the aquitards underlying barrier controlled source zones 4 2 effect of contamination source zone characteristics this section will investigate the effects of isolated source zone characteristics including source zone width ws l 2 l 1 and concentration decay coefficient λs on the 2d back diffusion behavior and the consequent aquifer plume persistence with an increase in ws the mass of contaminants reverse released into the aquifer outside the barrier was reduced fig 6 a specifically the cumulative mass discharge during back diffusion cmd was decreased by 50 with doubling the width of the source zone this might be due to a fixed source mass with smaller concentrations in the broader source zone a larger ws would thus result in a smaller flux averaged concentration ca and trailing time t t fig 6b for example the t t decreased from 15 9 to 6 years as ws increased from 1 to 4 m these findings suggested that the site management and remediation projects should appropriately consider increasing the extent of contaminant source isolation zones within the allowed site boundaries fig 6c quantified this relationship of t t ws that is fitted by an exponential decay function t t a l exp b l ws with a set of fitting parameters a l and b l fig s3 shows that the relationship of t t ws in a homogeneous aquitard system also satisfies exponential functions the decay coefficient λs of source concentration could also significantly affect the plume trailing time t t ding and feng 2022 the t t increased from 10 6 years to nearly a century when λs decreased from 0 2 to 0 025 year 1 fig 7 a as λs continued to decline t t would still increase considerably which could also be fitted as the exponential function of t t a l exp b l lg λs fig 7b based on extensive scenario simulation the relationship between the fitting parameters a l and b l and the source zone width ws is given in fig 7c therefore the specific prediction formula for the plume trailing time overlying the layered aquitard system was obtained i e t t 4 162 e 0 466 ws exp 1 644 0 115ws lg λs likewise the exponential decay function could predict the relationship of t t λs in a homogeneous aquitard system fig s4 the above fitting functions provided quantified relationships between the plume trailing time and the source decay coefficient and implied that accelerating the depletion of the contaminants in the containment zone by remediation techniques such as extraction is an efficient measure to inhibit back diffusion from aquitards 4 3 effects of aquitard heterogeneity stratified aquitards have been commonly observed especially in coastal areas cherry et al 2004 hendry et al 2011 xu et al 2009 this section compared the layered and homogeneous models to investigate the role of aquitard heterogeneity in 2d back diffusion in the early stages the two models predicted almost identical flux averaged concentrations in the overlying aquifer and the prediction differences increased gradually over time fig 8 a this was because the contaminants initially entered only the same top aquitard in both models e g t 2 years in fig 8b and later the contaminants penetrated different underlying aquitards e g t 10 years in fig 8b affecting the long term back diffusion behavior thus fig 8a presents an 8 6 year or 1 7 year difference in plume trailing times predicted by the layered model t t layer and the homogeneous model t t homo when the retardation factor of the top aquitard rd 1 1 or rd 1 5 the maximum relative difference between t t layer and t t homo δ t t homo t t layer t t layer reached 83 5 fig 9 with a successive increase in rd 1 t t homo decreased in contrast t t layer increased giving rise to a smaller δ when rd 1 7 5 the simplified homogeneous model significantly overestimated the trailing time of the plume above the heterogeneous aquitard system implying that the layered model is required to enable a more accurate prediction fig 10 further analyzes the coupling effect of the thickness and retardation factor of the top aquitard on the prediction error between homogeneous and layered models δ t t homo t t layer t t layer using a criterion of δ 5 dash line fig 10 is divided into a strong effect zone of aquitard stratification in the lower left side δ 5 and a weak effect zone in the upper right side δ 5 clearly simplified homogeneous models are not applicable in predicting the back diffusion of contaminants from layered aquitard systems with small topsoil thickness and retardation factors such simplification may result in a prediction error of up to 180 in the plume trailing time 5 conclusions this work developed a two dimensional back diffusion analytical model to rapidly predict the storage and release of contaminants from the layered aquitards subjected to barrier controlled source zones the effects of multidimensional transport of contaminants space time characteristics of barrier controlled source zones and aquitard heterogeneity on the back diffusion behavior were investigated the main findings were drawn as follows 1 previous one dimensional back diffusion models would significantly overestimate the long term concentrations of contaminants in the aquitards especially below the edge of the barrier controlled source zone 2 when dealing with heterogeneous aquitards utilizing the simplified homogeneous model may lead to a prediction error of more than 180 in the trailing time for the overlying aquifer plume 3 enlarging the barrier controlled source zone and employing remediation techniques to accelerate source depletion would be advantageous in efficiently preventing aquitard back diffusion appendix a derivation of the 2d back diffusion solution the methodology employed involves a sequence of five key steps the first step is to perform a finite cosine transform of a1 c k z t 2

the function fs x t in eq 5 is typically required to be an elementary function of x such as linear exponential or trigonometric functions or their combinations if fs x t is an arbitrary concentration

14787,water footprint wf assessments have become a significant tool for the sustainable management in recent years effective rainfall peff is a critical indicator for characterizing soil moisture green water wfgreen and calculating irrigation requirements blue water wfblue however majority of the water footprint analyses employ empirical or numerical models to predict peff and the number of studies for experimental validation of these models are quite insufficient the main scope of this study is to test the performance of commonly used peff estimation models in relation to the soil water balance swb of an experimental site accordingly the daily and monthly soil water budget is estimated from a maize field which is characterized as semi arid land with continental climate ankara turkey equipped with moisture sensors then peff wfgreen and wfblue parameters are calculated using fp us br usda scs fao aglw cropwat and suet methods and compared with swb method employed models were highly variable cropwat and us br predictions were the most accurate in majority of months the cropwat method estimated the peff with a maximum deviation of 5 from the swb method in addition the cropwat method predicted blue wf with an error less than 1 the widely utilized usda scs approach did not produce expected results the fao aglw method provided the lowest performance for each parameter we also find that the errors in estimating peff in semi arid conditions cause green and blue wf outputs to be quite less accurate than the dry and humid cases this study provides one of the most detailed assessments about the impact of effective rainfall on the blue and green wf results with high temporal resolution the findings of this study are important for the accuracy and performance of the formulae used in peff estimations and to develop more precise blue and green wf analyses in the future graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords effective rainfall soil water balance cropwat usda scs us br suet data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is the primary driving force behind agricultural production water scarcity in arid and semiarid regions around the world necessitates the prudent use of existing water resources the agricultural sector consumes an average of 70 of the world s water and more than 40 in many oecd nations oecd 2021 irrigated agriculture covers almost 275 million hectares throughout the world and accounts for 40 of global food production unesco 2021 the ever increasing global population the heterogeneity of natural resources the evolution of dietary practices and the increase in agricultural and industrial pollution have all negatively contributed to water scarcity problems in addition climate change is anticipated to exacerbate these problems it is predicted that an additional 5 20 of the world s population will confront serious water scarcity issues at an increase in average global temperature of 2 c schewe et al 2014 water related conflicts on the other hand are projected to increase shortly soon particularly in transboundary areas some researchers argue that water will be the next battleground for global political and economic objectives kreamer 2012 according to the united nations un water scarcity pollution and cooperation over transboundary basins are posing increasing difficulties for countries having access to adequate water sanitation and hygiene is a basic human right providing everyone with access to healthy water resources is one of the primary focuses of un sdg sustainable development goals un 2022 consequently researchers and engineers as well as local national and international organizations are working on more accurate management and planning solutions to mitigate the impact of water shortages and droughts especially in arid and semi arid regions conventional approaches and statistics provide limited information for water management studies largely ignoring indirect water utilization water footprint wf is a recently developed and more comprehensive indicator that separately measures the degree and type of human allocation and combines them into a single unit of water volume muratoglu 2021 wf methodology is an effective tool providing detailed information for integrated water management studies considering spatial and temporal variations of the natural resources the method is closely related to sdg 6 3 and 6 4 vanham et al 2019 the wf of a particular product is defined as the total volume of freshwater resources to produce that product considering its full supply chain hoekstra et al 2011 it represents the amount of hidden water behind the products and helps in understanding the effect of production and consumption on local and global water resources hoekstra et al 2011 the water requirements of agricultural products are determined by quantifying evapotranspiration et losses throughout the growing season therefore the wf of plants relies heavily on et rainfall and irrigation are the two primary inputs by which the crop et requirements are supplied accordingly the total amount of rainfall exploited through the production process is known as green water in other words green water is defined as the entire amount of precipitation that does not become runoff or percolate to replenish groundwater hoekstra et al 2011 xu and wu 2018 on the other hand the total surface and groundwater resources applied as irrigation are categorized as blue water both blue and green wfs are classified as consumptive wf components finally the gray wf is the pollutive component and defined as the total volume of water needed to dilute the contaminants back to the local environmental standards hoekstra et al 2011 irrigation and effective precipitation are two key factors that affect the blue and green wf of crops irrigation infrastructure considerably stabilizes food availability and prices especially in arid and semi arid regions hanjra and qureshi 2010 design and operation of an irrigation system that most effectively satisfies the goals and objectives of sustainable irrigated agriculture are dependent on the physical site characteristics soil type slope elevation etc the rooting depth of the crops and the precipitation during the growing season the need for irrigation is affected by the distribution of precipitation during the growing season as well as the amount of precipitation lost through evaporation surface runoff and deep percolation to estimate irrigation needs correctly it is necessary to determine the amount of precipitation stored in the rootzone of the plants upon reaching the ground the precipitation is separated into three components evapotranspiration surface runoff and infiltration a portion of infiltrating rainfall is retained in the rootzone with the remainder reaching groundwater also only a fraction of the total water in the rootzone is readily available to supply the crop water requirements bos et al 2009 accordingly effective precipitation peff is defined as the total amount of precipitation that contributes to the evapotranspiration requirements of a crop cover salazar et al 1994 by reducing a particular amount of irrigation water needed bos et al 2009 various parameters impact the ratio of total precipitation to be effective these parameters can be grouped into three classes precipitation amount frequency times of occurrence intensity land soil information topography surface depth to the groundwater infiltration rate water holding capacity evaporation and crop characteristics cultivation periods evapotranspiration crop coefficients etc instant determination of soil moisture changes due to rainfall is of great importance for the correct estimation of irrigation water requirements thus wf bos et al 2009 therefore the most advanced approaches to estimating the peff are based on conducting dynamic soil water balance swb analysis in a particular temporal resolution mostly daily bos et al 2009 the daily swb method is recommended as the most accurate approach to computing green et and wfgreen ali and mubarak 2017 hess 2010 a wide variety of input parameters and associated uncertainties make the physical modeling of peff extremely difficult experimentally detecting the soil moisture around the root zone of crops cultivated across a large area is also time and cost intensive consequently irrigation practitioners and wf specialists have limited access to these types of data and expertise therefore previous studies generated or applied simplified methodologies such as fixed percentage of rainfall fp u s bureau of reclamation us br u s department of agriculture soil conservation service usda scs and dependable rain method by water resources development and management service of food and agriculture organization of the un fao aglw etc blue water directly represents the irrigation requirement of agricultural products and has a higher opportunity cost relative to green water therefore many researchers have paid little attention to green water footprint analyses however the most common approach for calculating the blue wf is based on subtracting the green wf from the overall water demand of the crop section 2 3 2 accurate estimation of green wf thus peff is significant since it has a direct impact on the quantity of blue wf in agricultural products hess 2010 accordingly many studies reported that the green water footprint is closely related to effective precipitation huang et al 2019 sun et al 2013 furthermore peff is determined to be one of the most essential parameters for the blue water footprint in the agriculture sector huang et al 2019 despite its importance in agricultural water management the detailed analysis of effective precipitation for optimal allocation of freshwater resources and improved water use efficiency is mostly neglected gong et al 2020 xie et al 2018 several previous studies have analyzed the performance of peff estimation methods under varying crop climatic and soil conditions adnan and khan 2009 ali and mubarak 2017 awad et al 2021 bokke and shoro 2020 gómez et al 2021 marković et al 2021 mohan et al 1996 patwardhan et al 1990 rahimi et al 2013 2014 however these researchers did not investigate the impact of the models on water footprint as a result some of their conclusions cannot be applied to the measurement of wf xu and wu 2018 analyzed the availability of green water by country using the usda scs and cropwat methods however their research focuses on the availability of resources rather than demand or footprint in addition they included a limited number of methods and the performance of these methods concerning the swb remains unclear pongpinyopap and mungcharoen 2012 reported the impact of usda scs fp fao aglw and swb methods on the green water footprint of cassava based ethanol although their study is one of the first studies to examine the influence of peff methods the wfblue and the temporal variations in both wf components are not examined similarly hess 2010 estimated wfgreen in a temperate environment england nevertheless the swb model used in both investigations hess 2010 pongpinyopap and mungcharoen 2012 is numerical they did not conduct an experimental study of site scale soil water contents methods for calculating effective precipitation have various limitations and it may be unsuitable to adopt a single method in all circumstances the majority of the previous wf analyses estimated the effective precipitation using the usda scs approach döll and siebert 2002 novoa et al 2019 smith 1992 nonetheless some studies demonstrate that the usda scs method yields inaccurate wf quantification ali and mubarak 2017 hess 2010 pongpinyopap and mungcharoen 2012 on the other hand site scale experimental works are challenging and expensive in comparison to the application of numerical models however experimental quantification of effective rainfall via the specimens and sensors directly taken from studied land is quite important for testing the accuracy of the applied peff approach accordingly the main scope of this study is to test the performance of commonly used peff estimation models for agricultural wf concerning the soil water balance swb of an experimental site to the best our knowledge only a few previous wf studies have investigated the effective rainfall by experimental measurements from the agricultural site in addition we incorporated daily and monthly swb analyses and quantified the green and blue wf results with a reasonably high temporal resolution in two consecutive agricultural years furthermore the impact of the total rainfall heterogeneities in the rainfall regime crop evapotranspiration severe cases dry and humid seasons and peff estimation errors on green and blue wf are discussed in detail accordingly the novel aspects of this study are as follows verifying the effective rainfall and wf results using the soil water balance observations from an experimental site combining the peff estimation methods with the wf results including the green et and wf results in addition to the blue et and wf results and considering a relatively higher time resolution that includes both inter and intra annual variations the following are the research questions for this study how effective are available methods at simulating effective precipitation how do these models affect green and blue wf throughout the agricultural year 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data 2 1 1 location this study was conducted between 27 april 2017 and 23 october 2018 at the haymana research and training center of the agricultural faculty of ankara university 39 37 n and 32 41 e with an average altitude of 1061 m located in ankara türkiye fig 1 the area is dominated by a temperate continental climate with cold and snowy winters and hot and dry summers averaged across 1960 to 2018 the mean annual minimum and maximum temperatures relative humidity and total precipitation are 6 4 c and 17 8 c 64 and 409 mm respectively tsms 2021 climatic parameters during the experimental period are given in table 1 2 1 2 soil properties selected properties of the soils are presented in table 2 both disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected from geo referenced sites at 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm depths and analyzed according to the methods presented 2 1 3 meteorological data the hourly and daily meteorological data were measured via an automated meteorological station ag300 installed near the experimental site 100 m the measured climatic parameters were precipitation mm air temperature c mean highest lowest relative humidity mean highest lowest solar radiation w m 2 and wind speed m s 1 table 3 2 1 4 cultural practices the experiment was conducted in three plots each measuring 280 m2 40 m 7 m maize zea mays l cv pioneer p0573 seeds were sowed on 29 april 2017 1st year and 2 may 2018 2nd year with a spacing of 16 cm between plants and 70 cm between rows with a corn seeder fertilizer applications nitrogen and phosphorus were made according to the results of the soil analysis the maize is harvested on 01 november 2017 1st year and 23 october 2018 2nd year standard cultural procedures were managed to prevent pests and diseases 2 1 5 measurement of soil water status and irrigation in order to determine soil water status correctly drill drop soil moisture sensors sentek 2021 which are capable of determining soil moisture hourly in 10 cm intervals were placed at 90 cm and 120 cm soil depth the sensors were installed in the middle of the experimental plots between 2 subsurface drip lines and 2 drippers fig 2 the sensors were calibrated using the gravimetric method hourly soil moisture measurements were taken throughout the growing season subsurface drip irrigation sdi was used at a 40 cm depth and 70 cm interval the dripline emitter spacing and flow rates were 40 cm and 2 1 l h 1 respectively the used in line drippers have an integral pressure adjustment mechanism with continuous self cleaning anti syphon and root protection feature to prevent the entry of capillary roots into the dripper to eliminate the negative pressure that may occur during the application of lateral drippers daily et was calculated with the penman monteith method using the climate data obtained from the meteorological station and irrigation was done when available moisture in 60 cm depth of soil depleted to 70 in other words irrigation was done when 30 of the available water was consumed within 0 60 cm soil profile by replenishing to the field capacity irrigation interval varied between 3 and 5 days the crop coefficient kc ini 0 29 kc mid 1 23 and kc end 0 35 values used in the calculation of etc were taken from the manual prepared by tagem 2017 irrigation water had an electrical conductivity ec of 0 59 ds m 1 salt absorption ratio sar of 1 01 and ph of 8 25 which has no degree of restriction on use 2 2 effective rainfall estimation methods effective rainfall peff is defined as the part of total precipitation that is available to satisfy crop water requirements hershfield 1964 the most detailed definition by fao describes the peff as the amount of annual or seasonal precipitation used for crop production in direct and or indirect ways including the evapotranspiration losses during the growing period evaporated water from the surface of the soil water intercepted vegetation cover and certain fractions contributing leaching and percolation losses related with the crop growth dastane 1978 accordingly surface runoff deep percolation losses and excess moisture within the soil after the harvest are classified as ineffective dastane 1978 effective rainfall is a parameter of climatic factors soil cover site management topography etc 2 2 1 fixed percentage of rainfall fp fp is the most primitive version of effective rainfall calculation methods in this method the peff is modeled as a certain fraction of average rainfall eq 1 this fraction a is usually specified to be between 70 and 90 of total rainfall in which the surface runoff and deep percolation losses are assumed to be around 10 30 pongpinyopap and mungcharoen 2012 smith 1992 in this study the method has been applied for a values of 0 7 0 75 and 0 8 as fp 70 fp 75 and fp 80 respectively 1 p e f f a p where peff is the effective rainfall mm a is the fp fraction p is the total monthly rainfall mm 2 2 2 u s bureau of reclamation method us br this method which calculates effective rainfall based on increments of monthly rainfall is recommended for arid and semi arid regions stamm 1967 this method has been developed only considering surface runoff therefore it neglects many essential parameters such as soil type crop specie and frequency and distribution of rainfall it also does not consider aridity factor the accuracy of this method is low therefore it can under or over estimate effective rainfall depending upon the distribution of rainfall application of us br method can be used for broad planning purposes but may not be suited for instantaneous uses ali and mubarak 2017 2 2 3 usda soil conservation service method usda scs this method has been developed using 50 years of rainfall records at 22 locations representing different climatic and soil conditions throughout the united states this method is reported to deliver satisfactory results for areas with low intensity of rainfall and high soil infiltration rate dastane 1978 especially in water scarce regions bokke and shoro 2020 u s department of agriculture soil conservation service has reported the method as follows usda scs 1993 2 p

and d is the usable soil water storage in usda scs method recommends d to be between 40 and 60 of soil water capacity in the root zone based on the applied irrigation however d is assumed as 35 in this study because irrigation was done when available moisture in 60 cm depth of soil depleted to 70 5 error 2 2 4 dependable rain fao aglw method based on an analysis carried out for different arid and sub humid climates fao aglw service has developed an empirical formula to estimate dependable rain eq 4 this formula can be used for design purposes where 80 probability of exceedance is required smith 1992 the dependable rain method is preferable in water sufficient areas and small scale irrigation schemes bokke and shoro 2020 4 p e f f 0 6 p 10 p 70 m m 0 8 p 24 p 70 m m where peff is the effective rainfall mm and p is the total rainfall in a month mm respectively 2 2 5 cropwat method this method provides the most extensively used approach to effective rainfall modeling it is also called as smith smith 1992 method several studies have reported this method as the simplified version of the usda scs method xu and wu 2018 while many other studies including the majority of the studies on water footprint analyses characterize it as directly the usda scs method hess 2010 hoekstra et al 2011 zhuo et al 2022 however the authors have found no evidence of its relation with the original usda scs method section 2 2 3 the method s prominence in the literature stems from its integration with the cropwat software developed by the un food and agriculture organization fao the monthly cropwat effective rainfall equation can be written as below 5 p e f f p 125 0 2 p 125 p 250 m m 125 0 1 p p 250 m m 2 2 6 suet software tagem suet v 1 0 is an irrigation management and plant water consumption system developed by the general directorate of agricultural research and policies of türkiye ministry tagem of agriculture and forestry köksal et al 2022 suet 2023 tagem suet is able to calculate etc irrigation scheduling irrigation modules flow rates and water resources need according to selected irrigation method drip sprinkler and surface irrigation the program calculates effective precipitation based on three different scenarios table 4 2 2 7 soil water balance swb method this technique involves measuring the incoming and exiting water flux into the crop zone over a period of time allen et al 1998 this method is regarded as one of the best approaches for estimating effective precipitation in this study the swb model is used as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of other methodologies therefore when the name of the model is not included the analysis was conducted using the swb model irrigation water was applied according to the soil water balance swb method as 6 e t c i p r o d p c r δ s f δ s w where etc is crop evapotranspiration mm i is irrigation consumptive water use needed to satisfy crop water demand mm p is effective rainfall mm ro is surface runoff mm dp is deep percolation mm cr is capillary rise mm sf is subsurface flow mm and sw is the change in soil water content mm the deep percolation dp was monitored by soil water content variation using soil moisture sensors placed at 90 and 120 cm soil depth 2 3 modeling agricultural water footprint 2 3 1 modeling the crop evapotranspiration etc the crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions etc is defined as the evapotranspiration from disease free well fertilized crops grown in large fields under optimum soil water conditions and achieving full production under the given climatic conditions jensen et al 1990 allen et al 1998 where the conditions encountered in the field differ from the standard conditions management and environmental conditions a correction on etc is required low soil fertility salt toxicity soil waterlogging pests diseases presence of hard or impenetrable soil horizons in the root zone may result in scanty plant growth and reduced evapotranspiration under these conditions water stress is said to occur and evapotranspiration under these conditions are referred as crop evapotranspiration under non standard conditions etc adj or actual crop evapotranspiration eta allen et al 1998 etc in this field is equal to eta because there are no any limitations presence of pests and diseases soil conditions and water shortage in the field the evapotranspiration over a crop canopy can be directly measured using tanks and lysimeters water balance method energy balance method mass transfer eddy flux correlation method or combination equation energy balance plus heat and mass transfer jensen et al 1990 however the crop coefficient approach is the most common and globally accepted way of calculating etc allen et al 1998 in this method the etc is estimated by multiplying the crop coefficients kc by the reference evapotranspiration eto eq 7 this is a semi empirical method where the crop coefficients are determined experimentally by the ratio of direct measurement of etc to the eto here the reference evapotranspiration is calculated by using evapotranspiration models the reference crop evapotranspiration eto is a hypothetical index of climate parameters where the reference crop is always taken as grass here the crop and soil characteristics are included in the kc the main advantage of this method is the ability to calculate the evapotranspiration of various crops with respect to a standard crop by employing pre determined atmospheric characteristics although there are different methods to estimate reference evapotranspiration the fao penman monteith method eq 8 is accepted as the sole method for accurate calculation of the et0 in this study reference evapotranspiration eto values were calculated with the daily time steps using fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 eq 8 based on the recorded meteorological variables crop evapotranspiration etc was calculated using 7 e t c k c x e t o 8 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where etc is crop evapotranspiration eto is reference crop evapotranspiration and kc is dimensionless crop coefficient kc ini 0

average daily air temperature c u2 is the wind speed m s 1 es is the saturation vapor pressure kpa ea is the actual vapor pressure kpa δ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 2 3 2 modeling blue and green evapotranspiration the crop water requirement model is based on effective precipitation peff estimations section 2 2 the model assumes that the irrigation requirements ir of the cultivated crops are fully covered by the precipitation accordingly the ir is assumed to be zero when effective rainfall is greater than crop evapotranspiration etc on the other hand ir practically becomes the difference between etc and peff if the available effective rainfall is smaller than the crop evapotranspiration muratoglu 2019 eq 9 9 i r 0 p e f f e t c e t c p e f f p e f f e t c where ir is the irrigation requirement mm and etc is the crop evapotranspiration mm accordingly based on this approach the blue and green evapotranspiration rates can be written as hoekstra et al 2011 10 e t b l u e max 0 e t c p e f f 11 e t g r e e n min e t c p e f f where etblue is the blue evapotranspiration mm etgreen is the green evapotranspiration mm 2 3 3 water footprint indicators almost all water exploitation in agriculture is based on evapotranspiration the water footprint of agricultural products is calculated by summing up the evapotranspiration losses at the plantation area accordingly the blue water footprint wfblue is equal to the surface water resources that are used by crops cwublue which is calculated by total etblue similarly the green wf is equal to the rainwater that is used in the plantation area cwugreen which is equal to the etgreen therefore the calculation procedure and the method used for modeling both etblue and etgreen are crucially important for the accurate estimation of wf within a region eqs 12 18 in this study the total wf is taken as the sum of the blue and green wf s vwc is the virtual water content showing the water footprint per unit quantity usually defined as the employed water volume per production mass of the crops in terms of m3 ton 1 12 c w u b l u e m 3 h a 10 e t b l u e m m 13 c w u g r e e n m 3

conversion 1mm 10 m3 ha 1 vwc is the virtual water content m3 ton 1 p is the production quantity tons a is the cultivated area ha finally the blue water content bwc is defined as the ratio of the wfblue to the total wf 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall and crop evapotranspiration characteristics the daily rainfall records and crop evapotranspiration data for two crop growing seasons 2017 and 2018 are compared in fig 3 accordingly the frequency and intensity of the rainfall at the first two months may and june of the cultivation period is relatively high the evapotranspiration of crops increases significantly between july and august the graphs reveal a substantial requirement for irrigation in the research area particularly after july on the other hand the average daily crop evapotranspiration of maize in the study area was 3 51 and 3 23 mm for 2017 and 2018 respectively average daily precipitation amounts for these years were 0 56 and 1 47 mm respectively 2018 was more humid than 2017 having more frequent and strong rainfall characteristics with some days exceeding 20 mm in the study area total rainfall in the cultivation period was 104 2 and 258 mm for 2017 and 2018 respectively the number of wet days were recorded to be 39 and 54 for the cultivation periods of 2017 and 2018 respectively 3 2 effective rainfall predictions comparison of effective rainfall estimations through seven different methods applied this study is illustrated in fig 4 it is seen that the effective rainfall across different cultivation years varies considerably in 2017 almost all methods underestimated peff with respect to swb approach however higher deviations from the swb in may and october 2018 deserve attention percent deviation graph at the bottom of fig 4 represents the success of the used methods to estimate the peff with respect to the swb method it is seen that the cropwat method provides quite compatible results with monthly soil water balance the maximum deviation of cropwat method except may and october 2018 remains below 5 the us br method also delivered consistent results with low deviations from swb approach however remarkable deviations are observed in may and october 2018 in may 2018 us br method underestimated peff by 76 while cropwat method overestimated by 83 it should be noted that these were wet periods while the average monthly precipitation during the growing season is 48 9 mm may and october received 152 4 and 73 6 mm of precipitation respectively extreme and sudden precipitation occurrences significantly diverge these methodologies from the swb approach unexpected high and short term rainfalls were observed in may and october of 2018 table 1 fig 3 as a result part of the rainwater is lost through deep percolation and run off only a small percent of this precipitation is stored in the root zone thus accepted as effective because of these reasons deviation of effective rainfall was found relatively higher however due to its principle the us br method gave low estimation as indicated in section 2 2 2 this method can under or over estimate effective rainfall depending upon the distribution of rainfall the higher the precipitation increment range the lower the effective rainfall these results indicated that under extreme and sudden precipitation almost all estimation methods gave failure estimations due to site specific conditions such as the soil texture the soil structure the depth of the root zone and the crop specie therefore not only site specific conditions but also uniformity of precipitation is an important in the calculation of effective rainfall 3 3 blue and green et estimations etgreen etc and etblue etc lines for various peff methods in consecutive agricultural years are illustrated in fig 5 here the slope of the curves is essential for deriving the proportion of crop evapotranspiration that is covered by soil moisture etgreen or irrigation etblue mild slopes that approximate a flat line in etgreen graphs represent very low soil moisture and peff is close to zero therefore the crop water requirements are satisfied by blue water or irrigation alternatively the slope of the etgreen etc line approaching to 45 indicates that the crop water requirement is mostly covered by soil moisture similarly the slope of etblue etc lines nearing 45 shows that almost all crop water requirements are met by irrigating the land in the study area high blue water is required for both years of agriculture particularly from june to august when the soil moisture is insufficient despite significant differences in precipitation heights no remarkable variations in etgreen are seen between the two years summertime soil moisture availability is particularly intriguing in the study area in contrast to the considerably increased rainfall availability rainfall height in 2018 is more than double that of 2017 section 3 1 quite flat etgreen etc and steep etblue etc lines were observed in 2018 which occasionally grew more severe than 2017 in 2017 the total etc for maize cultivation is around 653 mm and approximately 122 mm 18 7 of etc according to swb method of the total etc is covered by soil moisture the total etc is declined to 592 mm in 2018 due to meteorological variables however no considerable change is observed in etgreen 19 9 of etc according to swb method this is due to the fact that may and october of 2018 experienced significant rainfall intensity although mid summer season had relatively lower humidity this conclusion is supported by fig 5 in which the overall peff in august and september of 2018 was very low in contrast to the overall rise in annual rainfall height lower daily precipitation heights in 2018 summer season resulted in less effective precipitation and a modest increase in the demand for blue water this case demonstrates that the seasonal uniformity of precipitation is more essential than its overall height in terms of its effectiveness and ability to be transformed into soil moisture more homogeneous rainfall characteristics lead decreased need of irrigation even if the total rainfall height is somewhat lower in this study all of the peff methods fp75 us br usda scs fao aglw cropwat and suet have underestimated the etgreen and overestimated etblue when compared to the swb approach indicated with red dashed lines in fig 5 similar to the peff estimates in section 3 3 cropwat us br and fp75 methods performed quite well in comparison to the swb approach the cropwat method provided the most accurate estimate of both etgreen and etblue us br method accurately predicted the etgreen but fp75 estimated etblue more precisely than us br finally the fao aglw and suet techniques demonstrated the poorest performance for both etgreen and etblue the reason for this situation can be understood with a closer inspection of these two methods according to fao aglw precipitation amounts lower than 17 mm gives negative values thus not accepted as effective calculation methods of effective precipitation in suet software assumes that if daily precipitation is lower than et0 the precipitation is not accepted as effective and taken as zero 1st situation however this approach is false because if field capacity of soil is not exceeded the soil will be able to store precipitation and it is available for consumptive use an exception of this situation can only be seen in extended warm dry periods for rainfed agriculture during extended warm dry periods rainfall less than 5 mm would not be considered effective as this amount would likely evaporate from the surface before infiltrating into the ground the effect of these approaches on blue and green wf are further discussed in section 3 4 3 4 water footprint predictions dynamic charts showing the monthly variations of peff etc wfgreen wfblue and wftotal are provided in fig 6 similarly the annual results are reported in fig 7 the graphs demonstrate that maize grown in the research region is highly dependent on blue water in both years the demand for blue water is approximately four times that green water availability according to the swb approach the total wf of maize cultivation is obtained as 182 8 m3 in 2017 and reduced by 9 3 to 165 8 m3 in 2018 in contrast to having higher total rainfall height 2018 shows no substantial change in blue water reliance with a minor decrease in 2018 the total peff grew by 37 swb approach although the rise in yearly precipitation did not result in a substantial change in wf accounts overall in contrast all methods underestimated the annual wfgreen and overestimated the annual wfblue compared to the swb approach cropwat method delivered the most compatible outcomes with swb monthly aggregated variations in green and blue water footprints may provide a more detailed view fig 8 shows that the estimation errors become higher towards the harvest time monthly availability of green water did not represent significant change in summer period especially in 2018 high rainfall intensity in spring and autumn seasons temporarily decreased the irrigation need but did not have a considerable impact on the soil water availability of the consequent months that is effective for agriculture consequently the annual blue and green wf estimations by various methods employed in this study and percent deviations from the swb approach are listed in table 5 all methods underestimated the wfgreen with changing accuracies overall percent errors of wfgreen became quite higher than wfblue cropwat and us br method represented least deviations from the swb approach cropwat predicted the wfgreen by 4 1 and 1 7 for consecutive agricultural years respectively wfblue estimation of cropwat for both years became smaller than 1 similarly the deviation of the us br method was around 5 1 in 2017 us br represented deteriorating performance in 2018 increased humidity fao aglw method represented fairly bad performance for both years suet method failed by a high degree especially for the estimation of wfgreen other methods represented quite high modeling errors it can be said that the estimation errors became greater in 2017 than 2018 for both wf components this is mostly associated with the underestimation of peff due to the rainfall characteristics of 2017 monthly deviations of wfgreen and wfblue from swb for various methods are described in fig 9 here extremities in dry and humid months and its impact on green and blue wf components are quite interesting july 2017 and august 2018 represent the driest months for the study period the estimation errors in wf becomes minimum even if the deviations in peff are high in these two months because the water footprint is a combined function of effective precipitation and crop evapotranspiration eqs 9 11 the estimation errors in peff does not always identically reflected in water footprint result if figs 4 and 9 evaluated comparingly it is seen that when the rainfall is considerably low the green water footprint approximates to zero eq 11 and the blue water mostly approximates the total theoretical etc eq 10 this means that for the water footprint analyses in dry environment and seasons the wf results are not much sensitive to the peff on the other hand may and october 2018 represent the most humid time periods in this study the wf estimations from various methods are quite close in these periods except us br method even the peff is overestimated by most methods in the wet seasons the peff becomes greater than the etc this means that more water exists in the soil than the crop water need therefore the etgreen approximates to the theoretical etc eq 11 accordingly almost no irrigation requirement is needed and the blue water approximates to zero both driest july 2017 and august 2018 and more humid may and october 2018 months in the study area show that estimation errors in both green and blue wf becomes minimum in extreme dry and humid periods even the peff methods represents high deviations from swb consequently the wf is mostly associated with the relative effect of peff with respect to etc high underestimations of peff when the peff etc lead substantially lower wfgreen and higher wfblue accordingly when peff etc wfblue 0 and the wfgreen becomes insensitive to the peff finally in the semi arid regions the blue and green wf becomes more sensitive to peff estimations such as the study area in the present work 3 5 comparison of usda scs swb and cropwat methods the fp us br fao aglw and cropwat methodologies provide a straightforward approach to peff as they require only precipitation data the suet software employs a function of daily precipitation and reference evapotranspiration the usda scs approach utilizes soil evapotranspiration and precipitation data accordingly usda scs is more comprehensive than alternatives therefore this method has been used in many of the previous studies aboutalebi et al 2018 adnan and khan 2009 akhtar and athar 2020 coughlan and huda 2008 rahimi et al 2013 sharifi et al 2013 several studies have demonstrated however that the commonly utilized usda scs method performs much worse than the other approaches xu and wu 2018 showed that the usda scs approach produces lower peff values than the cropwat method in ten us locations hess 2010 analyzed the green wf of pasture in temperate environment england and found that usda scs method has underestimated the peff by 74 88 comparing to the daily swb model pongpinyopap and mungcharoen 2012 compared the usda scs the fp and fao aglw methods with the results of daily swb for cassava based ethanol in thailand and demonstrated that these methods underestimate the wfgreen by 54 56 and 70 respectively mohan et al 1996 determined that the usda scs method is unsuitable to be applied to lowland rice water management ali and mubarak 2017 have also highlighted that usda scs approach underestimates the peff in comparison to the swb method similar to these studies we found that the usda scs method consistently underestimated the peff during the 2 year study period with the exception of may 2018 fig 4 may 2018 was the wettest month in this study with 152 4 mm of rainfall corresponding to three times the average monthly precipitation the best estimate of peff is determined to be in this month with 6 5 deviation from the swb in the remaining months of both cultivation years the usda scs method exhibited quite high deviation between 20 and 100 in general the usda scs method s accuracy rises during humid months fig 4 on the other hand usda scs method underestimated the annual wfgreen by 37 4 and 20 6 in 2017 and 2018 respectively similarly the wfblue is overestimated by 8 6 and 5 1 respectively table 5 overall following fao aglw and suet the usda scs approach exhibited one of the highest percent errors the primary concerns with the usda scs technique are argued to be connected to climatic and soil information that differs from the model s spatial and temporal limits several researchers indicated that the usda scs method is well suited for high infiltrated soils and lower rainfall intensity adnan and khan 2009 ali and mubarak 2017 xu and wu 2018 the infiltration rate of the study soil was 8 mm h 1 which can be classified as low on the other hand the classification of the daily rainfall height in terms of the accuracy of the usda scs technique is quite ambiguous in this study the usda scs performed poorly especially when monthly total rainfall was less than 50 60 mm due to regional weather circumstances a broad range of precipitation was not analyzed future research could improve our understanding of these models performance across a wide range of rainfall intensities there is a common misunderstanding of the usda scs model in the wf literature due to the peff model preferences in the cropwat algorithm fao 2022 some researchers indicated that the usda scs model was applied in their analyses using the cropwat program hoekstra et al 2011 muratoglu et al 2022 singh et al 2022 sun et al 2013 wang et al 2014 yan et al 2023 zhai et al 2019 however the model covered by cropwat 8 0 is entirely different and the algorithm does not support the standard usda scs model specified in eqs 2 and 3 we categorize the model utilized by these studies as cropwat approach sections 2 2 3 and 2 2 5 3 6 reliability of the wf outputs in this study the total wf of maize is obtained as 386 and 337 m3 t 1 for 2017 and 2018 respectively swb approach mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 determined the global average wf of maize production as 1028 m3 t 1 for 1996 2005 wf research reveal the high variability of the blue and green wf at different spatial and temporal extents therefore the comparison should be provided at similar climate soil and crop conditions in one of the first investigations mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 reported the average wf of maize production in ankara city as 819 m3 t 1 a more recent study by muratoglu and avanoz 2021 found the average wf of maize to be between 565 and 897 m3 t 1 in ankara city for 2008 2019 similarly esetlili et al 2022 reported approximate results in the present study the wf is found to be less than the previous estimates this is mostly related to the high maize yield in the study area the wf is inversely proportional to the crop yield where lower yields lead higher wf values hoekstra et al 2011 muratoglu 2019 the remarkable influence of site management practice on yield increase and thus decreasing the wf is also stated by han et al 2018 they found a decreasing logarithmic relationship between the wf and yield y 3384x 0 795 we obtained an average yield of 17 2 t ha 1 karaca bilgen 2020 while the average maize yield in the ankara city is reported to be around half of this value with 8 49 t ha 1 tsi 2021 the average yield reported here not only contains well managed but also poor managed practices as known yield potential is greatly affected by nutrient deficiencies or imbalances poor soil quality root and or shoot diseases insect pests weed competition degree of water deficit etc on the other hand we attained a relatively high blue water content bwc as approximately 81 accordingly our findings are supported by the most recent previous estimates from muratoglu and avanoz 2021 and mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 arranged for the same study area but different methodology 3 7 temporal variations in wf several prior studies have investigated the wf of maize production ahmadi et al 2021 arrien et al 2021 duan et al 2016 elbeltagi et al 2020 han et al 2018 huang et al 2019 karandish and šimůnek 2019 nana et al 2014 sun et al 2013 have also provided a comprehensive analysis accounting the inter annual variations however the intra annual variations within the agricultural season of the wf remain quite unexplored in the previous works the present study includes a relatively higher temporal resolution in which the monthly variations in wfgreen and wfblue for two consecutive agricultural years are reported comparison of monthly and annual water footprints with average peff and etc is provided figs 6 and 7 cumulative variations of both wf components are also illustrated fig 8 the months of cultivation and harvest may and october represented the lowest wf the wf is then raised until july which has the highest wf and accounts for about one third of the annual wf august also had a reasonably high wf accounting for roughly a fourth of the yearly wf the monthly wf then reduced till harvest in addition we observe that the monthly fluctuation did not significantly vary from the peff model in use fig 7 also demonstrates that the total yearly blue green wf in this study is independent of the peff nonetheless the bwc differs from employed the peff model inter and especially intra annual fluctuations in wf components would be of great assistance to water management and optimization research in the field 3 8 sensitivity and variability this study does not include a specific statistical sensitivity and variability analysis however the percent estimations in wf with respect to the peff and etc for different climate periods are analyzed in section 3 4 the sensitivity of maize with respect to the input parameters were assessed by a few previous researchers zhuo et al 2014 assessed the sensitivity of wf to the rainfall evapotranspiration crop coefficient crop calendar soil water content yield response factor and maximum yield they observed that modeling errors in precipitation results in significant underestimation of wfblue and smaller overestimation of wfgreen however our discussion in sections 3 3 and 3 4 shows that the wfgreen is more susceptible to the effective rainfall than wfblue table 5 this is mostly related to their grid based dynamic soil water balance method and having less bwc 48 which is quite lower than this study comparison of our study with zhuo et al 2014 reveals that the sensitivity of wfgreen would be higher in decreased humidity nonetheless our finding in section 3 4 is that the wf is primarily determined by the combined effect of peff and etc and that during severe dry and humid periods estimation errors in wf become less sensitive to peff according to sun et al 2013 the variability of wfgreen and wfblue is primarily caused by effective precipitation and non climatic agricultural inputs they proved that wfgreen is positively correlated with peff while wfblue is negatively correlated which is also verified by the present study in addition zhuo et al 2014 concluded that optimizing the planting and harvesting dates for maize might significantly reduce its irrigation needs another sensitivity analysis by tuninetti et al 2015 indicates that the available water content and precipitation have a major effect on maize wf furthermore they emphasized that maize is particularly sensitive to planting date even a one day shift in the growing cycle of maize results in an increase in its virtual water content tuninetti et al 2015 li et al 2022 found that the wf of maize is the most sensitive than wheat rice and soybean maize is also the most susceptible crop to the reference evapotranspiration and soil evaporation coefficient according to their research 3 9 limitations and future improvements the commonly used peff models are analyzed in this study there are several other methods that are not included in this study we ignored the renfro equation model chow 1964 since it uses the average irrigation application and ratio of consumptive water use as input parameters additionally the renfro equation model is reported to have poor accuracy rahimi et al 2013 hershfield nomograph hershfield 1964 is likewise disregarded because it utilizes the mean annual seasonal rainfall evapotranspiration and irrigation amounts mohan et al 1996 the use of potential evapotranspiration precipitation ratio technique which is developed for specific projects in india is also excluded because it is not a globally accepted model dastane 1978 other regional and crop specific peff estimation methods are also neglected such as indian 1 indian 2 japanese and vietnam models mohan et al 1996 the temporal resolution of the employed models should also be considered in wf analyses most of the models are developed to be applied in a standard monthly time step except the swb and suet models employed in this study therefore we prefer performance comparisons and analyses based on monthly time intervals the accuracy and applicability of the employed model would be improved with finer temporal resolutions such as 10 days weekly or daily liu et al 2009 suggested that the most accurate period for the cropwat approach is 10 days cropwat algorithm has the capability to be implemented in one third of a month however most peff models are unable of being applied in shorter time periods in addition direct linear interpolation or coefficient multiplication to reduce the time step might result in inaccuracies on the other hand the planting and harvest times in our field experiments are scheduled to coincide at the start or end of the corresponding months nevertheless this is not always practicable in agriculture the agricultural calendar rarely coincides with month intervals incorporating effective precipitation over multiple days preceding and following agriculture would lead misleading results the majority of existing models are mostly based on total precipitation for ease of application effective precipitation is influenced by numerous other variables such as the frequency and intensity of the rainfall topography surface depth to the groundwater infiltration rate water holding capacity cultivation periods evapotranspiration crop coefficients rooting depths etc according to the authors models with limited parameters and low temporal resolution may be applicable in recent years however the accuracy and cost effectiveness of real time measurement devices and technologies as well as the reliability of computer based numerical tools and remote sensing applications have risen future research considering soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012 and gis based srivastava et al 2019 approaches validated with the field experiments would provide more site and climate specific and accurate data for optimum water management in agricultural fields due to the reliance on a particular experimental site the effect of soil drainage is not considered in this study future studies on the efficiency of models that account for infiltration capacity are anticipated to reveal important details additionally as stated by ali and mubarak 2017 differentiating the models for wet and dry land crops and considering their rooting depths might produce more accurate findings finally the gray water footprint wfgrey component is outside the focus of this study like majority of the previous peff related investigations wfgrey analyses are conducted to estimate the degree of contamination of water resources rather than direct consumption in terms of total wf amounts wfgrey is not a significant component accounting for around 10 of the total wf hoekstra et al 2011 4 conclusion in this study the performance accuracy and reliability of commonly used effective rainfall peff models fp us br usda scs fao aglw cropwat suet and swb and corresponding green wfgreen and blue water footprints wfblue are analyzed for an experimental maize cultivation field in semi arid continental climate the study is conducted for two agricultural years 2017 and 2018 having different precipitation patterns our analysis revealed considerable findings regarding the peff and its relationship with wfgreen and wfblue no remarkable changes in etgreen are observed between the two agricultural seasons despite noteworthy increase in precipitation height in 2018 we found that the seasonal uniformity of precipitation is more essential than its overall height in terms of its effectiveness and ability to be transformed into useful soil moisture more homogeneous rainfall characteristics lead decreased need of irrigation even if the total rainfall height is somewhat lower in accordance with the swb method the total wf of maize cultivation is calculated to be 182 8 m3 in 2017 and 165 8 m3 in 2018 the rise in yearly precipitation elevated the peff by 37 from 2017 to 2018 while there was no a considerable change in wf accounts in contrast to the remarkably higher total rainfall height in 2018 the reliance on blue water showed no significant change with a slight decline in both years the demand for blue water exceeds the supply of green water by about four times our green and blue virtual water content findings are verified by the most recent estimations previously compiled for the same research region the cropwat method delivered quite compatible results with swb method for peff wfgreen and wfblue parameters similar to the previous studies we observed that the usda scs method consistently underestimated the peff during the 2 year study period higher humidity increased the accuracy of the usda scs method the estimation errors in peff does not always identically reflected in water footprint results all approaches underestimated wfgreen with varying degrees of accuracy overall percent errors of wfgreen became quite higher than that of wfblue cropwat and us br method represented least deviations from the swb approach but their performance degraded with increasing humidity cropwat predicted the wfgreen by 4 1 and 1 7 for consecutive agricultural years wfblue estimation of cropwat for both years became less than 1 us br fao aglw method represented fairly bad performance for both years suet method failed by a high degree especially for estimation of wfgreen we found that both wfgreen and wfblue is more sensitive to peff in semi arid environment than arid and humid climate in the study area etc was rarely smaller than peff also the complete dry months were minimum therefore peff estimations from numerical or empirical methods leaded higher deviations from swb approach higher humidity and higher aridity lead that the results to become more independent from the peff estimations comparing the previous studies we observed that wfgreen is more susceptible to the peff than wfblue in semi arid environments finally we proved that combined impact of etc and peff is quite important in terms of

14787,water footprint wf assessments have become a significant tool for the sustainable management in recent years effective rainfall peff is a critical indicator for characterizing soil moisture green water wfgreen and calculating irrigation requirements blue water wfblue however majority of the water footprint analyses employ empirical or numerical models to predict peff and the number of studies for experimental validation of these models are quite insufficient the main scope of this study is to test the performance of commonly used peff estimation models in relation to the soil water balance swb of an experimental site accordingly the daily and monthly soil water budget is estimated from a maize field which is characterized as semi arid land with continental climate ankara turkey equipped with moisture sensors then peff wfgreen and wfblue parameters are calculated using fp us br usda scs fao aglw cropwat and suet methods and compared with swb method employed models were highly variable cropwat and us br predictions were the most accurate in majority of months the cropwat method estimated the peff with a maximum deviation of 5 from the swb method in addition the cropwat method predicted blue wf with an error less than 1 the widely utilized usda scs approach did not produce expected results the fao aglw method provided the lowest performance for each parameter we also find that the errors in estimating peff in semi arid conditions cause green and blue wf outputs to be quite less accurate than the dry and humid cases this study provides one of the most detailed assessments about the impact of effective rainfall on the blue and green wf results with high temporal resolution the findings of this study are important for the accuracy and performance of the formulae used in peff estimations and to develop more precise blue and green wf analyses in the future graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords effective rainfall soil water balance cropwat usda scs us br suet data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is the primary driving force behind agricultural production water scarcity in arid and semiarid regions around the world necessitates the prudent use of existing water resources the agricultural sector consumes an average of 70 of the world s water and more than 40 in many oecd nations oecd 2021 irrigated agriculture covers almost 275 million hectares throughout the world and accounts for 40 of global food production unesco 2021 the ever increasing global population the heterogeneity of natural resources the evolution of dietary practices and the increase in agricultural and industrial pollution have all negatively contributed to water scarcity problems in addition climate change is anticipated to exacerbate these problems it is predicted that an additional 5 20 of the world s population will confront serious water scarcity issues at an increase in average global temperature of 2 c schewe et al 2014 water related conflicts on the other hand are projected to increase shortly soon particularly in transboundary areas some researchers argue that water will be the next battleground for global political and economic objectives kreamer 2012 according to the united nations un water scarcity pollution and cooperation over transboundary basins are posing increasing difficulties for countries having access to adequate water sanitation and hygiene is a basic human right providing everyone with access to healthy water resources is one of the primary focuses of un sdg sustainable development goals un 2022 consequently researchers and engineers as well as local national and international organizations are working on more accurate management and planning solutions to mitigate the impact of water shortages and droughts especially in arid and semi arid regions conventional approaches and statistics provide limited information for water management studies largely ignoring indirect water utilization water footprint wf is a recently developed and more comprehensive indicator that separately measures the degree and type of human allocation and combines them into a single unit of water volume muratoglu 2021 wf methodology is an effective tool providing detailed information for integrated water management studies considering spatial and temporal variations of the natural resources the method is closely related to sdg 6 3 and 6 4 vanham et al 2019 the wf of a particular product is defined as the total volume of freshwater resources to produce that product considering its full supply chain hoekstra et al 2011 it represents the amount of hidden water behind the products and helps in understanding the effect of production and consumption on local and global water resources hoekstra et al 2011 the water requirements of agricultural products are determined by quantifying evapotranspiration et losses throughout the growing season therefore the wf of plants relies heavily on et rainfall and irrigation are the two primary inputs by which the crop et requirements are supplied accordingly the total amount of rainfall exploited through the production process is known as green water in other words green water is defined as the entire amount of precipitation that does not become runoff or percolate to replenish groundwater hoekstra et al 2011 xu and wu 2018 on the other hand the total surface and groundwater resources applied as irrigation are categorized as blue water both blue and green wfs are classified as consumptive wf components finally the gray wf is the pollutive component and defined as the total volume of water needed to dilute the contaminants back to the local environmental standards hoekstra et al 2011 irrigation and effective precipitation are two key factors that affect the blue and green wf of crops irrigation infrastructure considerably stabilizes food availability and prices especially in arid and semi arid regions hanjra and qureshi 2010 design and operation of an irrigation system that most effectively satisfies the goals and objectives of sustainable irrigated agriculture are dependent on the physical site characteristics soil type slope elevation etc the rooting depth of the crops and the precipitation during the growing season the need for irrigation is affected by the distribution of precipitation during the growing season as well as the amount of precipitation lost through evaporation surface runoff and deep percolation to estimate irrigation needs correctly it is necessary to determine the amount of precipitation stored in the rootzone of the plants upon reaching the ground the precipitation is separated into three components evapotranspiration surface runoff and infiltration a portion of infiltrating rainfall is retained in the rootzone with the remainder reaching groundwater also only a fraction of the total water in the rootzone is readily available to supply the crop water requirements bos et al 2009 accordingly effective precipitation peff is defined as the total amount of precipitation that contributes to the evapotranspiration requirements of a crop cover salazar et al 1994 by reducing a particular amount of irrigation water needed bos et al 2009 various parameters impact the ratio of total precipitation to be effective these parameters can be grouped into three classes precipitation amount frequency times of occurrence intensity land soil information topography surface depth to the groundwater infiltration rate water holding capacity evaporation and crop characteristics cultivation periods evapotranspiration crop coefficients etc instant determination of soil moisture changes due to rainfall is of great importance for the correct estimation of irrigation water requirements thus wf bos et al 2009 therefore the most advanced approaches to estimating the peff are based on conducting dynamic soil water balance swb analysis in a particular temporal resolution mostly daily bos et al 2009 the daily swb method is recommended as the most accurate approach to computing green et and wfgreen ali and mubarak 2017 hess 2010 a wide variety of input parameters and associated uncertainties make the physical modeling of peff extremely difficult experimentally detecting the soil moisture around the root zone of crops cultivated across a large area is also time and cost intensive consequently irrigation practitioners and wf specialists have limited access to these types of data and expertise therefore previous studies generated or applied simplified methodologies such as fixed percentage of rainfall fp u s bureau of reclamation us br u s department of agriculture soil conservation service usda scs and dependable rain method by water resources development and management service of food and agriculture organization of the un fao aglw etc blue water directly represents the irrigation requirement of agricultural products and has a higher opportunity cost relative to green water therefore many researchers have paid little attention to green water footprint analyses however the most common approach for calculating the blue wf is based on subtracting the green wf from the overall water demand of the crop section 2 3 2 accurate estimation of green wf thus peff is significant since it has a direct impact on the quantity of blue wf in agricultural products hess 2010 accordingly many studies reported that the green water footprint is closely related to effective precipitation huang et al 2019 sun et al 2013 furthermore peff is determined to be one of the most essential parameters for the blue water footprint in the agriculture sector huang et al 2019 despite its importance in agricultural water management the detailed analysis of effective precipitation for optimal allocation of freshwater resources and improved water use efficiency is mostly neglected gong et al 2020 xie et al 2018 several previous studies have analyzed the performance of peff estimation methods under varying crop climatic and soil conditions adnan and khan 2009 ali and mubarak 2017 awad et al 2021 bokke and shoro 2020 gómez et al 2021 marković et al 2021 mohan et al 1996 patwardhan et al 1990 rahimi et al 2013 2014 however these researchers did not investigate the impact of the models on water footprint as a result some of their conclusions cannot be applied to the measurement of wf xu and wu 2018 analyzed the availability of green water by country using the usda scs and cropwat methods however their research focuses on the availability of resources rather than demand or footprint in addition they included a limited number of methods and the performance of these methods concerning the swb remains unclear pongpinyopap and mungcharoen 2012 reported the impact of usda scs fp fao aglw and swb methods on the green water footprint of cassava based ethanol although their study is one of the first studies to examine the influence of peff methods the wfblue and the temporal variations in both wf components are not examined similarly hess 2010 estimated wfgreen in a temperate environment england nevertheless the swb model used in both investigations hess 2010 pongpinyopap and mungcharoen 2012 is numerical they did not conduct an experimental study of site scale soil water contents methods for calculating effective precipitation have various limitations and it may be unsuitable to adopt a single method in all circumstances the majority of the previous wf analyses estimated the effective precipitation using the usda scs approach döll and siebert 2002 novoa et al 2019 smith 1992 nonetheless some studies demonstrate that the usda scs method yields inaccurate wf quantification ali and mubarak 2017 hess 2010 pongpinyopap and mungcharoen 2012 on the other hand site scale experimental works are challenging and expensive in comparison to the application of numerical models however experimental quantification of effective rainfall via the specimens and sensors directly taken from studied land is quite important for testing the accuracy of the applied peff approach accordingly the main scope of this study is to test the performance of commonly used peff estimation models for agricultural wf concerning the soil water balance swb of an experimental site to the best our knowledge only a few previous wf studies have investigated the effective rainfall by experimental measurements from the agricultural site in addition we incorporated daily and monthly swb analyses and quantified the green and blue wf results with a reasonably high temporal resolution in two consecutive agricultural years furthermore the impact of the total rainfall heterogeneities in the rainfall regime crop evapotranspiration severe cases dry and humid seasons and peff estimation errors on green and blue wf are discussed in detail accordingly the novel aspects of this study are as follows verifying the effective rainfall and wf results using the soil water balance observations from an experimental site combining the peff estimation methods with the wf results including the green et and wf results in addition to the blue et and wf results and considering a relatively higher time resolution that includes both inter and intra annual variations the following are the research questions for this study how effective are available methods at simulating effective precipitation how do these models affect green and blue wf throughout the agricultural year 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data 2 1 1 location this study was conducted between 27 april 2017 and 23 october 2018 at the haymana research and training center of the agricultural faculty of ankara university 39 37 n and 32 41 e with an average altitude of 1061 m located in ankara türkiye fig 1 the area is dominated by a temperate continental climate with cold and snowy winters

interval the dripline emitter spacing and flow rates were 40 cm and 2 1 l h 1 respectively the used in line drippers have an integral pressure adjustment mechanism with continuous self cleaning anti syphon and root protection feature to prevent the entry of capillary roots into the dripper to eliminate the negative pressure that may occur during the application of lateral drippers daily et was calculated with the penman monteith method using the climate data obtained from the meteorological station and irrigation was done when available moisture in 60 cm depth of soil depleted to 70 in other words irrigation was done when 30 of the available water was consumed within 0 60 cm soil profile by replenishing to the field capacity irrigation interval varied between 3 and 5 days the crop coefficient kc ini 0 29 kc mid 1 23 and kc end 0 35 values used in the calculation of etc were taken from the manual prepared by tagem 2017 irrigation water had an electrical conductivity ec of 0 59 ds m 1 salt absorption ratio sar of 1 01 and ph of 8 25 which has no degree of restriction on use 2 2 effective rainfall estimation methods effective rainfall peff is defined as the part of total precipitation that is available to satisfy crop water requirements hershfield 1964 the most detailed definition by fao describes the peff as the amount of annual or seasonal precipitation used for crop production in direct and or indirect ways including the evapotranspiration losses during the growing period evaporated water from the surface of the soil water intercepted vegetation cover and certain fractions contributing leaching and percolation losses related with the crop growth dastane 1978 accordingly surface runoff deep percolation losses and excess moisture within the soil after the harvest are classified as ineffective dastane 1978 effective rainfall is a parameter of climatic factors soil cover site management topography etc 2 2 1 fixed percentage of rainfall fp fp is the most primitive version of effective rainfall calculation methods in this method the peff is modeled as a certain fraction of average rainfall eq 1 this fraction a is usually specified to be between 70 and 90 of total rainfall in which the surface runoff and deep percolation losses are assumed to be around 10 30 pongpinyopap and mungcharoen 2012 smith 1992 in this study the method has been applied for a values of 0 7 0 75 and 0 8 as fp 70 fp 75 and fp 80 respectively 1 p e f f a p where peff is the effective rainfall mm a is the fp fraction p is the total monthly rainfall mm 2 2 2 u s bureau of reclamation method us br this method which calculates effective rainfall based on increments of monthly rainfall is recommended for arid and semi arid regions stamm 1967 this method has been developed only considering surface runoff therefore it neglects many essential parameters such as soil type crop specie and frequency and distribution of rainfall it also does not consider aridity factor the accuracy of this method is low therefore it can under or over estimate effective rainfall depending upon the distribution of rainfall application of us br method can be used for broad planning purposes but may not be suited for instantaneous uses ali and mubarak 2017 2 2 3 usda soil conservation service method usda scs this method has been developed using 50 years of rainfall records at 22 locations representing different climatic and soil conditions throughout the united states this method is reported to deliver satisfactory results for areas with low intensity of rainfall and high soil infiltration rate dastane 1978 especially in water scarce regions bokke and shoro 2020 u s department of agriculture soil conservation service has reported the method as follows usda scs 1993 2 p

and d is the usable soil water storage in usda scs method recommends d to be between 40 and 60 of soil water capacity in the root zone based on the applied irrigation however d is assumed as 35 in this study because irrigation was done when available moisture in 60 cm depth of soil depleted to 70 5 error 2 2 4 dependable rain fao aglw method based on an analysis carried out for different arid and sub humid climates fao aglw service has developed an empirical formula to estimate dependable rain eq 4 this formula can be used for design purposes where 80 probability of exceedance is required smith 1992 the dependable rain method is preferable in water sufficient areas and small scale irrigation schemes bokke and shoro 2020 4 p e f f 0 6 p 10 p 70 m m 0 8 p 24 p 70 m m where peff is the effective rainfall mm and p is the total rainfall in a month mm respectively 2 2 5 cropwat method this method provides the most extensively used approach to effective rainfall modeling it is also called as smith smith 1992 method several studies have reported this method as the simplified version of the usda scs method xu and wu 2018 while many other studies including the majority of the studies on water footprint analyses characterize it as directly the usda scs method hess 2010 hoekstra et al 2011 zhuo et al 2022 however the authors have found no evidence of its relation with the original usda scs method section 2 2 3 the method s prominence in the literature stems from its integration with the cropwat software developed by the un food and agriculture organization fao the monthly cropwat effective rainfall equation can be written as below 5 p e f f p 125 0 2 p 125 p 250 m m 125 0 1 p p 250 m m 2 2 6 suet software tagem suet v 1 0 is an irrigation management and plant water consumption system developed by the general directorate of agricultural research and policies of türkiye ministry tagem of agriculture and forestry köksal et al 2022 suet 2023 tagem suet is able to calculate etc irrigation scheduling irrigation modules flow rates and water resources need according to selected irrigation method drip sprinkler and surface irrigation the program calculates effective precipitation based on three different scenarios table 4 2 2 7 soil water balance swb method this technique involves measuring the incoming and exiting water flux into the crop zone over a period of time allen et al 1998 this method is regarded as one of the best approaches for estimating effective precipitation in this study the swb model is used as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of other methodologies therefore when the name of the model is not included the analysis was conducted using the swb model irrigation water was applied according to the soil water balance swb method as 6 e t c i p r o d p c r δ s f δ s w where etc is crop evapotranspiration mm i is irrigation consumptive water use needed to satisfy crop water demand mm p is effective rainfall mm ro is surface runoff mm dp is deep percolation mm cr is capillary rise mm sf is subsurface flow mm and sw is the change in soil water content mm the deep percolation dp was monitored by soil water content variation using soil moisture sensors placed at 90 and 120 cm soil depth 2 3 modeling agricultural water footprint 2 3 1 modeling the crop evapotranspiration etc the crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions etc is defined as the evapotranspiration from disease free well fertilized crops grown in large fields under optimum soil water conditions and achieving full production under the given climatic conditions jensen et al 1990 allen et al 1998 where the conditions encountered in the field differ from the standard conditions management and environmental conditions a correction on etc is required low soil fertility salt toxicity soil waterlogging pests diseases presence of hard or impenetrable soil horizons in the root zone may result in scanty plant growth and reduced evapotranspiration under these conditions water stress is said to occur and evapotranspiration under these conditions are referred as crop evapotranspiration under non standard conditions etc adj or actual crop evapotranspiration eta allen et al 1998 etc in this field is equal to eta because there are no any limitations presence of pests and diseases soil conditions and water shortage in the field the evapotranspiration over a crop canopy can be directly measured using tanks and lysimeters water balance method energy balance method mass transfer eddy flux correlation method or combination equation energy balance plus heat and mass transfer jensen et al 1990 however the crop coefficient approach is the most common and globally accepted way of calculating etc allen et al 1998 in this method the etc is estimated by multiplying the crop coefficients kc by the reference evapotranspiration eto eq 7 this is a semi empirical method where the crop coefficients are determined experimentally by the ratio of direct measurement of etc to the eto here the reference evapotranspiration is calculated by using evapotranspiration models the reference crop evapotranspiration eto is a hypothetical index of climate parameters where the reference crop is always taken as grass here the crop and soil characteristics are included in the kc the main advantage of this method is the ability to calculate the evapotranspiration of various crops with respect to a standard crop by employing pre determined atmospheric characteristics although there are different methods to estimate reference evapotranspiration the fao penman monteith method eq 8 is accepted as the sole method for accurate calculation of the et0 in this study reference evapotranspiration eto values were calculated with the daily time steps using fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 eq 8 based on the recorded meteorological variables crop evapotranspiration etc was calculated using 7 e t c k c x e t o 8 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where etc is crop evapotranspiration eto is reference crop evapotranspiration and kc is dimensionless crop coefficient kc ini 0

average daily air temperature c u2 is the wind speed m s 1 es is the saturation vapor pressure kpa ea is the actual vapor pressure kpa δ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 2 3 2 modeling blue and green evapotranspiration the crop water requirement model is based on effective precipitation peff estimations section 2 2 the model assumes that the irrigation requirements ir of the cultivated crops are fully covered by the precipitation accordingly the ir is assumed to be zero when effective rainfall is greater than crop evapotranspiration etc on the other hand ir practically becomes the difference between etc and peff if the available effective rainfall is smaller than the crop evapotranspiration muratoglu 2019 eq 9 9 i r 0 p e f f e t c e t c p e f f p e f f e t c where ir is the irrigation requirement mm and etc is the crop evapotranspiration mm accordingly based on this approach the blue and green evapotranspiration rates can be written as hoekstra et al 2011 10 e t b l u e max 0 e t c p e f f 11 e t g r e e n min e t c p e f f where etblue is the blue evapotranspiration mm etgreen is the green evapotranspiration mm 2 3 3 water footprint indicators almost all water exploitation in agriculture is based on evapotranspiration the water footprint of agricultural products is calculated by summing up the evapotranspiration losses at the plantation area accordingly the blue water footprint wfblue is equal to the surface water resources that are used by crops cwublue which is calculated by total etblue similarly the green wf is equal to the rainwater that is used in the plantation area cwugreen which is equal to the etgreen therefore the calculation procedure and the method used for modeling both etblue and etgreen are crucially important for the accurate estimation of wf within a region eqs 12 18 in this study the total wf is taken as the sum of the blue and green wf s vwc is the virtual water content showing the water footprint per unit quantity usually defined as the employed water volume per production mass of the crops in terms of m3 ton 1 12 c w u b l u e m 3 h a 10 e t b l u e m m 13 c w u g r e e n m 3

conversion 1mm 10 m3 ha 1 vwc is the virtual water content m3 ton 1 p is the production quantity tons a is the cultivated area ha finally the blue water content bwc is defined as the ratio of the wfblue to the total wf 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall and crop evapotranspiration characteristics the daily rainfall records and crop evapotranspiration data for two crop growing seasons 2017 and 2018 are compared in fig 3 accordingly the frequency and intensity of the rainfall at the first two months may and june of the cultivation period is relatively high the evapotranspiration of crops increases significantly between july and august the graphs reveal a substantial requirement for irrigation in the research area particularly after july on the other hand the average daily crop evapotranspiration of maize in the study area was 3 51 and 3 23 mm for 2017 and 2018 respectively average daily precipitation amounts for these years were 0 56 and 1 47 mm respectively 2018 was more humid than 2017 having more frequent and strong rainfall characteristics with some days exceeding 20 mm in the study area total rainfall in the cultivation period was 104 2 and 258 mm for 2017 and 2018 respectively the number of wet days were recorded to be 39 and 54 for the cultivation periods of 2017 and 2018 respectively 3 2 effective rainfall predictions comparison of effective rainfall estimations through seven different methods applied this study is illustrated in fig 4 it is seen that the effective rainfall across different cultivation years varies considerably in 2017 almost all methods underestimated peff with respect to swb approach however higher deviations from the swb in may and october 2018 deserve attention percent deviation graph at the bottom of fig 4 represents the success of the used methods to estimate the peff with respect to the swb method it is seen that the cropwat method provides quite compatible results with monthly soil water balance the maximum deviation of cropwat method except may and october 2018 remains below 5 the us br method also delivered consistent results with low deviations from swb approach however remarkable deviations are observed in may and october 2018 in may 2018 us br method underestimated peff by 76 while cropwat method overestimated by 83 it should be noted that these were wet periods while the average monthly precipitation during the growing season is 48 9 mm may and october received 152 4 and 73 6 mm of precipitation respectively extreme and sudden precipitation occurrences significantly diverge these methodologies from the swb approach unexpected high and short term rainfalls were observed in may and october of 2018 table 1 fig 3 as a result part of the rainwater is lost through deep percolation and run off only a small percent of this precipitation is stored in the root zone thus accepted as effective because of these reasons deviation of effective rainfall was found relatively higher however due to its principle the us br method gave low estimation as indicated in section 2 2 2 this method can under or over estimate effective rainfall depending upon the distribution of rainfall the higher the precipitation increment range the lower the effective rainfall these results indicated that under extreme and sudden precipitation almost all estimation methods gave failure estimations due to site specific conditions such as the soil texture the soil structure the depth of the root zone and the crop specie therefore not only site specific conditions but also uniformity of precipitation is an important in the calculation of effective rainfall 3 3 blue and green et estimations etgreen etc and etblue etc lines for various peff methods in consecutive agricultural years are illustrated in fig 5 here the slope of the curves is essential for deriving the proportion of crop evapotranspiration that is covered by soil moisture etgreen or irrigation etblue mild slopes that approximate a flat line in etgreen graphs represent very low soil moisture and peff is close to zero therefore the crop water requirements are satisfied by blue water or irrigation alternatively the slope of the etgreen etc line approaching to 45 indicates that the crop water requirement is mostly covered by soil moisture similarly the slope of etblue etc lines nearing 45 shows that almost all crop water requirements are met by irrigating the land in the study area high blue water is required for both years of agriculture particularly from june to august when the soil moisture is insufficient despite significant differences in precipitation heights no remarkable variations in etgreen are seen between the two years summertime soil moisture availability is particularly intriguing in the study area in contrast to the considerably increased rainfall availability rainfall height in 2018 is more than double that of 2017 section 3 1 quite flat etgreen etc and steep etblue etc lines were observed in 2018 which occasionally grew more severe than 2017 in 2017 the total etc for maize cultivation is around 653 mm and approximately 122 mm 18 7 of etc according to swb method of the total etc is covered by soil moisture the total etc is declined to 592 mm in 2018 due to meteorological variables however no considerable change is observed in etgreen 19 9 of etc according to swb method this is due to the fact that may and october of 2018 experienced significant rainfall intensity although mid summer season had relatively lower humidity this conclusion is supported by fig 5 in which the overall peff in august and september of 2018 was very low in contrast to the overall rise in annual rainfall height lower daily precipitation heights in 2018 summer season resulted in less effective precipitation and a modest increase in the demand for blue water this case demonstrates that the seasonal uniformity of precipitation is more essential than its overall height in terms of its effectiveness and ability to be transformed into soil moisture more homogeneous rainfall characteristics lead decreased need of irrigation even if the total rainfall height is somewhat lower in this study all of the peff methods fp75 us br usda scs fao aglw cropwat and suet have underestimated the etgreen and overestimated etblue when compared to the swb approach indicated with red dashed lines in fig 5 similar to the peff estimates in section 3 3 cropwat us br and fp75 methods performed quite well in comparison to the swb approach the cropwat method provided the most accurate estimate of both etgreen and etblue us br method accurately predicted the etgreen but fp75 estimated etblue more precisely than us br finally the fao aglw and suet techniques demonstrated the poorest performance for both etgreen and etblue the reason for this situation can be understood with a closer inspection of these two methods according to fao aglw precipitation amounts lower than 17 mm gives negative values thus not accepted as effective calculation methods of effective precipitation in suet software assumes that if daily precipitation is lower than et0 the precipitation is not accepted as effective and taken as zero 1st situation however this approach is false because if field capacity of soil is not exceeded the soil will be able to store precipitation and it is available for consumptive use an exception of this situation can only be seen in extended warm dry periods for rainfed agriculture during extended warm dry periods rainfall less than 5 mm would not be considered effective as this amount would likely evaporate from the surface before infiltrating into the ground the effect of these approaches on blue and green wf are further discussed in section 3 4 3 4 water footprint predictions dynamic charts showing the monthly variations of peff etc wfgreen wfblue and wftotal are provided in fig 6 similarly the annual results are reported in fig 7 the graphs demonstrate that maize grown in the research region is highly dependent on blue water in both years the demand for blue water is approximately four times that green water availability according to the swb approach the total wf of maize cultivation is obtained as 182 8 m3 in 2017 and reduced by 9 3 to 165 8 m3 in 2018 in contrast to having higher total rainfall height 2018 shows no substantial change in blue water reliance with a minor decrease in 2018 the total peff grew by 37 swb approach although the rise in yearly precipitation did not result in a substantial change in wf accounts overall in contrast all methods underestimated the annual wfgreen and overestimated the annual wfblue compared to the swb approach cropwat method delivered the most compatible outcomes with swb monthly aggregated variations in green and blue water footprints may provide a more detailed view fig 8 shows that the estimation errors become higher towards the harvest time monthly availability of green water did not represent significant change in summer period especially in 2018 high rainfall intensity in spring and autumn seasons temporarily decreased the irrigation need but did not have a considerable impact on the soil water availability of the consequent months that is effective for agriculture consequently the annual blue and green wf estimations by various methods employed in this study and percent deviations from the swb approach are listed in table 5 all methods underestimated the wfgreen with changing accuracies overall percent errors of wfgreen became quite higher than wfblue cropwat and us br method represented least deviations from the swb approach cropwat predicted the wfgreen by 4 1 and 1 7 for consecutive agricultural years respectively wfblue estimation of cropwat for both years became smaller than 1 similarly the deviation of the us br method was around 5 1 in 2017 us br represented deteriorating performance in 2018 increased humidity fao aglw method represented fairly bad performance for both years suet method failed by a high degree especially for the estimation of wfgreen other methods represented quite high modeling errors it can be said that the estimation errors became greater in 2017 than 2018 for both wf components this is mostly associated with the underestimation of peff due to the rainfall characteristics of 2017 monthly deviations of wfgreen and wfblue from swb for various methods are described in fig 9 here extremities in dry and humid months and its impact on green and blue wf components are quite interesting july 2017 and august 2018 represent the driest months for the study period the estimation errors in wf becomes minimum even if the deviations in peff are high in these two months because the water footprint is a combined function of effective precipitation and crop evapotranspiration eqs 9 11 the estimation errors in peff does not always identically reflected in water footprint result if figs 4 and 9 evaluated comparingly it is seen that when the rainfall is considerably low the green water footprint approximates to zero eq 11 and the blue water mostly approximates the total theoretical etc eq 10 this means that for the water footprint analyses in dry environment and seasons the wf results are not much sensitive to the peff on the other hand may and october 2018 represent the most humid time periods in this study the wf estimations from various methods are quite close in these periods except us br method even the peff is overestimated by most methods in the wet seasons the peff becomes greater than the etc this means that more water exists in the soil than the crop water need therefore the etgreen approximates to the theoretical etc eq 11 accordingly almost no irrigation requirement is needed and the blue water approximates to zero both driest july 2017 and august 2018 and more humid may and october 2018 months in the study area show that estimation errors in both green and blue wf becomes minimum in extreme dry and humid periods even the peff methods represents high deviations from swb consequently the wf is mostly associated with the relative effect of peff with respect to etc high underestimations of peff when the peff etc lead substantially lower wfgreen and higher wfblue accordingly when peff etc wfblue 0 and the wfgreen becomes insensitive to the peff finally in the semi arid regions the blue and green wf becomes more sensitive to peff estimations such as the study area in the present work 3 5 comparison of usda scs swb and cropwat methods the fp us br fao aglw and cropwat methodologies provide a straightforward approach to peff as they require only precipitation data the suet software employs a function of daily precipitation and reference evapotranspiration the usda scs approach utilizes soil evapotranspiration and precipitation data accordingly usda scs is more comprehensive than alternatives therefore this method has been used in many of the previous studies aboutalebi et al 2018 adnan and khan 2009 akhtar and athar 2020 coughlan and huda 2008 rahimi et al 2013 sharifi et al 2013 several studies have demonstrated however that the commonly utilized usda scs method performs much worse than the other approaches xu and wu 2018 showed that the usda scs approach produces lower peff values than the cropwat method in ten us locations hess 2010 analyzed the green wf of pasture in temperate environment england and found that usda scs method has underestimated the peff by 74 88 comparing to the daily swb model pongpinyopap and mungcharoen 2012 compared the usda scs the fp and fao aglw methods with the results of daily swb for cassava based ethanol in thailand and demonstrated that these methods underestimate the wfgreen by 54 56 and 70 respectively mohan et al 1996 determined that the usda scs method is unsuitable to be applied to lowland rice water management ali and mubarak 2017 have also highlighted that usda scs approach underestimates the peff in comparison to the swb method similar to these studies we found that the usda scs method consistently underestimated the peff during the 2 year study period with the exception of may 2018 fig 4 may 2018 was the wettest month in this study with 152 4 mm of rainfall corresponding to three times the average monthly precipitation the best estimate of peff is determined to be in this month with 6 5 deviation from the swb in the remaining months of both cultivation years the usda scs method exhibited quite high deviation between 20 and 100 in general the usda scs method s accuracy rises during humid months fig 4 on the other hand usda scs method underestimated the annual wfgreen by 37 4 and 20 6 in 2017 and 2018 respectively similarly the wfblue is overestimated by 8 6 and 5 1 respectively table 5 overall following fao aglw and suet the usda scs approach exhibited one of the highest percent errors the primary concerns with the usda scs technique are argued to be connected to climatic and soil information that differs from the model s spatial and temporal limits several researchers indicated that the usda scs method is well suited for high infiltrated soils and lower rainfall intensity adnan and khan 2009 ali and mubarak 2017 xu and wu 2018 the infiltration rate of the study soil was 8 mm h 1 which can be classified as low on the other hand the classification of the daily rainfall height in terms of the accuracy of the usda scs technique is quite ambiguous in this study the usda scs performed poorly especially when monthly total rainfall was less than 50 60 mm due to regional weather circumstances a broad range of precipitation was not analyzed future research could improve our understanding of these models performance across a wide range of rainfall intensities there is a common misunderstanding of the usda scs model in the wf literature due to the peff model preferences in the cropwat algorithm fao 2022 some researchers indicated that the usda scs model was applied in their analyses using the cropwat program hoekstra et al 2011 muratoglu et al 2022 singh et al 2022 sun et al 2013 wang et al 2014 yan et al 2023 zhai et al 2019 however the model covered by cropwat 8 0 is entirely different and the algorithm does not support the standard usda scs model specified in eqs 2 and 3 we categorize the model utilized by these studies as cropwat approach sections 2 2 3 and 2 2 5 3 6 reliability of the wf outputs in this study the total wf of maize is obtained as 386 and 337 m3 t 1 for 2017 and 2018 respectively swb approach mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 determined the global average wf of maize production as 1028 m3 t 1 for 1996 2005 wf research reveal the high variability of the blue and green wf at different spatial and temporal extents therefore the comparison should be provided at similar climate soil and crop conditions in one of the first investigations mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 reported the average wf of maize production in ankara city as 819 m3 t 1 a more recent study by muratoglu and avanoz 2021 found the average wf of maize to be between 565 and 897 m3 t 1 in ankara city for 2008 2019 similarly esetlili et al 2022 reported approximate results in the present study the wf is found to be less than the previous estimates this is mostly related to the high maize yield in the study area the wf is inversely proportional to the crop yield where lower yields lead higher wf values hoekstra et al 2011 muratoglu 2019 the remarkable influence of site management practice on yield increase and thus decreasing the wf is also stated by han et al 2018 they found a decreasing logarithmic relationship between the wf and yield y 3384x 0 795 we obtained an average yield of 17 2 t ha 1 karaca bilgen 2020 while the average maize yield in the ankara city is reported to be around half of this value with 8 49 t ha 1 tsi 2021 the average yield reported here not only contains well managed but also poor managed practices as known yield potential is greatly affected by nutrient deficiencies or imbalances poor soil quality root and or shoot diseases insect pests weed competition degree of water deficit etc on the other hand we attained a relatively high blue water content bwc as approximately 81 accordingly our findings are supported by the most recent previous estimates from muratoglu and avanoz 2021 and mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 arranged for the same study area but different methodology 3 7 temporal variations in wf several prior studies have investigated the wf of maize production ahmadi et al 2021 arrien et al 2021 duan et al 2016 elbeltagi et al 2020 han et al 2018 huang et al 2019 karandish and šimůnek 2019 nana et al 2014 sun et al 2013 have also provided a comprehensive analysis accounting the inter annual variations however the intra annual variations within the agricultural season of the wf remain quite unexplored in the previous works the present study includes a relatively higher temporal resolution in which the monthly variations in wfgreen and wfblue for two consecutive agricultural years are reported comparison of monthly and annual water footprints with average peff and etc is provided figs 6 and 7 cumulative variations of both wf components are also illustrated fig 8 the months of cultivation and harvest may and october represented the lowest wf the wf is then raised until july which has the highest wf and accounts for about one third of the annual wf august also had a reasonably high wf accounting for roughly a fourth of the yearly wf the monthly wf then reduced till harvest in addition we observe that the monthly fluctuation did not significantly vary from the peff model in use fig 7 also demonstrates that the total yearly blue green wf in this study is independent of the peff nonetheless the bwc differs from employed the peff model inter and especially intra annual fluctuations in wf components would be of great assistance to water management and optimization research in the field 3 8 sensitivity and variability this study does not include a specific statistical sensitivity and variability analysis however the percent estimations in wf with respect to the peff and etc for different climate periods are analyzed in section 3 4 the sensitivity of maize with respect to the input parameters were assessed by a few previous researchers zhuo et al 2014 assessed the sensitivity of wf to the rainfall evapotranspiration crop coefficient crop calendar soil water content yield response factor and maximum yield they observed that modeling errors in precipitation results in significant underestimation of wfblue and smaller overestimation of wfgreen however our discussion in sections 3 3 and 3 4 shows that the wfgreen is more susceptible to the effective rainfall than wfblue table 5 this is mostly related to their grid based dynamic soil water balance method and having less bwc 48 which is quite lower than this study comparison of our study with zhuo et al 2014 reveals that the sensitivity of wfgreen would be higher in decreased humidity nonetheless our finding in section 3 4 is that the wf is primarily determined by the combined effect of peff and etc and that during severe dry and humid periods estimation errors in wf become less sensitive to peff according to sun et al 2013 the variability of wfgreen and wfblue is primarily caused by effective precipitation and non climatic agricultural inputs they proved that wfgreen is positively correlated with peff while wfblue is negatively correlated which is also verified by the present study in addition zhuo et al 2014 concluded that optimizing the planting and harvesting dates for maize might significantly reduce its irrigation needs another sensitivity analysis by tuninetti et al 2015 indicates that the available water content and precipitation have a major effect on maize wf furthermore they emphasized that maize is particularly sensitive to planting date even a one day shift in the growing cycle of maize results in an increase in its virtual water content tuninetti et al 2015 li et al 2022 found that the wf of maize is the most sensitive than wheat rice and soybean maize is also the most susceptible crop to the reference evapotranspiration and soil evaporation coefficient according to their research 3 9 limitations and future improvements the commonly used peff models are analyzed in this study there are several other methods that are not included in this study we ignored the renfro equation model chow 1964 since it uses the average irrigation application and ratio of consumptive water use as input parameters additionally the renfro equation model is reported to have poor accuracy rahimi et al 2013 hershfield nomograph hershfield 1964 is likewise disregarded because it utilizes the mean annual seasonal rainfall evapotranspiration and irrigation amounts mohan et al 1996 the use of potential evapotranspiration precipitation ratio technique which is developed for specific projects in india is also excluded because it is not a globally accepted model dastane 1978 other regional and crop specific peff estimation methods are also neglected such as indian 1 indian 2 japanese and vietnam models mohan et al 1996 the temporal resolution of the employed models should also be considered in wf analyses most of the models are developed to be applied in a standard monthly time step except the swb and suet models employed in this study therefore we prefer performance comparisons and analyses based on monthly time intervals the accuracy and applicability of the employed model would be improved with finer temporal resolutions such as 10 days weekly or daily liu et al 2009 suggested that the most accurate period for the cropwat approach is 10 days cropwat algorithm has the capability to be implemented in one third of a month however most peff models are unable of being applied in shorter time periods in addition direct linear interpolation or coefficient multiplication to reduce the time step might result in inaccuracies on the other hand the planting and harvest times in our field experiments are scheduled to coincide at the start or end of the corresponding months nevertheless this is not always practicable in agriculture the agricultural calendar rarely coincides with month intervals incorporating effective precipitation over multiple days preceding and following agriculture would lead misleading results the majority of existing models are mostly based on total precipitation for ease of application effective precipitation is influenced by numerous other variables such as the frequency and intensity of the rainfall topography surface depth to the groundwater infiltration rate water holding capacity cultivation periods evapotranspiration crop coefficients rooting depths etc according to the authors models with limited parameters and low temporal resolution may be applicable in recent years however the accuracy and cost effectiveness of real time measurement devices and technologies as well as the reliability of computer based numerical tools and remote sensing applications have risen future research considering soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012 and gis based srivastava et al 2019 approaches validated with the field experiments would provide more site and climate specific and accurate data for optimum water management in agricultural fields due to the reliance on a particular experimental site the effect of soil drainage is not considered in this study future studies on the efficiency of models that account for infiltration capacity are anticipated to reveal important details additionally as stated by ali and mubarak 2017 differentiating the models for wet and dry land crops and considering their rooting depths might produce more accurate findings finally the gray water footprint wfgrey component is outside the focus of this study like majority of the previous peff related investigations wfgrey analyses are conducted to estimate the degree of contamination of water resources rather than direct consumption in terms of total wf amounts wfgrey is not a significant component accounting for around 10 of the total wf hoekstra et al 2011 4 conclusion in this study the performance accuracy and reliability of commonly used effective rainfall peff models fp us br usda scs fao aglw cropwat suet and swb and corresponding green wfgreen and blue water footprints wfblue are analyzed for an experimental maize cultivation field in semi arid continental climate the study is conducted for two agricultural years 2017 and 2018 having different precipitation patterns our analysis revealed considerable findings regarding the peff and its relationship with wfgreen and wfblue no remarkable changes in etgreen are observed between the two agricultural seasons despite noteworthy increase in precipitation height in 2018 we found that the seasonal uniformity of precipitation is more essential than its overall height in terms of its effectiveness and ability to be transformed into useful soil moisture more homogeneous rainfall characteristics lead decreased need of irrigation even if the total rainfall height is somewhat lower in accordance with the swb method the total wf of maize cultivation is calculated to be 182 8 m3 in 2017 and 165 8 m3 in 2018 the rise in yearly precipitation elevated the peff by 37 from 2017 to 2018 while there was no a considerable change in wf accounts in contrast to the remarkably higher total rainfall height in 2018 the reliance on blue water showed no significant change with a slight decline in both years the demand for blue water exceeds the supply of green water by about four times our green and blue virtual water content findings are verified by the most recent estimations previously compiled for the same research region the cropwat method delivered quite compatible results with swb method for peff wfgreen and wfblue parameters similar to the previous studies we observed that the usda scs method consistently underestimated the peff during the 2 year study period higher humidity increased the accuracy of the usda scs method the estimation errors in peff does not always identically reflected in water footprint results all approaches underestimated wfgreen with varying degrees of accuracy overall percent errors of wfgreen became quite higher than that of wfblue cropwat and us br method represented least deviations from the swb approach but their performance degraded with increasing humidity cropwat predicted the wfgreen by 4 1 and 1 7 for consecutive agricultural years wfblue estimation of cropwat for both years became less than 1 us br fao aglw method represented fairly bad performance for both years suet method failed by a high degree especially for estimation of wfgreen we found that both wfgreen and wfblue is more sensitive to peff in semi arid environment than arid and humid climate in the study area etc was rarely smaller than peff also the complete dry months were minimum therefore peff estimations from numerical or empirical methods leaded higher deviations from swb approach higher humidity and higher aridity lead that the results to become more independent from the peff estimations comparing the previous studies we observed that wfgreen is more susceptible to the peff than wfblue in semi arid environments finally we proved that combined impact of etc and peff is quite important in terms of

14788,the oxidation of the emerging nanomaterial black phosphorus bp affected by ph and oxygen has been carefully documented however in natural waters there is a large amount of chemically reactive organic matters like fulvic acid fa whose impacts on degradation and stability of few layer bp or bp nanosheets bpns are scarcely disclosed hence we investigated the kinetics of bpns degradation products h2po2 hpo3 2 and po4 3 in the presence of fa the results showed that the apparent reaction rate constants of bpns were 0 026 0 050 and 0 060 d 1 under oxygen and light condition and 0 005 0 016 and 0 023 d 1 under hypoxia and darkness condition at fa gradients of 0 2 5 and 5 mgc l respectively microscopic observations simple molecular simulation experiment and density functional theory computation explained that fa significantly enhanced the degradation of p atoms on the bpns surface through the indirect pathway of reducing the energy barrier of o2 dissociative adsorption and the direct pathway of chemical adsorption which caused the p p bond on the bpns surface to break down and formed p o bonds or c p bonds this study revealed for the first time the degradation mechanism of bpns in the presence of fa which is a chemical mechanism of the bpns transformation behavior it helps to make a more scientific risk assessment of bp in natural waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords black phosphorus fulvic acid degradation chemical adsorption energy barrier data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as one of the emerging two dimensional materials black phosphorus bp is similar to natural graphene and consists of a puckered honeycomb layer structure li et al 2014 it has a high charge carrier mobility 1000 cm2v 1s 1 and a thickness dependent band gap 0 3 2 ev rodin et al 2014 takao et al 1981 which makes it a great application in the fields of battery energy storage sun et al 2014 cancer treatment sun et al 2016 electrocatalytic labelling mayorga martinez et al 2016 and photocatalytic nitrogen fixation qiu et al 2018 unlike the allotropes of phosphorus including red phosphorus and white phosphorus bp has a thermodynamically more stable structure however its chemical stability is worse than that of red phosphorus liu et al 2015 qu et al 2020 in addition in all applications and studies of bp it has been achieved under black phosphorus nanosheets bpns li et al 2022 ran et al 2017 in air the surface of bpns is susceptibly covered by a stable protective layer composed of phosphorus oxides p x o y edmonds et al 2015 however in an aqueous environment the surface of the few layer bpns is easily oxidized by dissolved oxygen and released into the water in the form of phosphorus oxyanions mainly including h2po2 hpo3 2 and po4 3 zhang et al 2018 resulting in further exposure and degradation of the underlying bpns and the remaining bpns will be completely degraded huang et al 2015 yi et al 2017 eswaraiah et al 2016 in previous well documented research oxygen increases the degradation rate of bpns by one order of magnitude while ph increases it by two orders of magnitude zeng et al 2022 the half life of bpns is reduced from 88 days in acidic ph 4 and hypoxic water to 6 86 hours in alkaline ph 11 and oxygenated water zhang et al 2019 notably after bpns is discharged into natural waters it can cause oxidative stress dependent and developmental toxicity to aquatic organisms wu et al 2020 yang et al 2021 on the other hand its degradation product phosphate would promote the growth of organisms such as chlorella vulgaris which is a major driver of eutrophication in water bodies li et al 2020 it is clear that bp is already a potential threat to aquatic ecosystems and drinking water safety fulvic acid fa a major fraction of natural organic matter nom is ubiquitous in natural waters and its diverse chemical composition determines its various environmental behaviors including adsorption liang et al 2011 complexation iglesias et al 2003 and solubilization tian et al 2012 zhou et al 2016b thus affecting the speciation and biological effects of pollutants wang et al 2022 there have been extensive reports demonstrating that graphene reacts with fa through adsorption and complexation with high reversibility and almost no destruction of its properties ali et al 2020 chowdhury et al 2014 bpns has similar structure and properties to graphene but is less stable than graphene which may have a more complex reaction with fa in addition nom exposed to light generates reactive oxygen species such as singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals maddigapu et al 2011 zhang and sun 2019 which can effectively promote the degradation of substances li et al 2008 maddigapu et al 2011 previous studies have shown that the stability of bpns in water is affected by oxygen ph and light favron et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2016a and the chemical form of degradation products varies depending on the environment however few studies currently focus on the effect of nom on the stability or degradation of bp in water it would be unfavorable to disclose the degradation behavior of bp in natural waters and hinder a more comprehensive assessment of its environmental risk in water bodies qu et al 2020 in this study the degradation of bpns at different fa concentrations is investigated based on previous experiments with a single influencing factor light or oxygen stevenson 1995 stott and martin 1990 two reaction conditions one favoring degradation oxygen and light and one favoring stability hypoxia and darkness were designed the products of bpns were analyzed by ion chromatography ic and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the main reaction mechanism critical functional groups and micro response of bpns degradation affected by fa were analyzed by combining parallel reaction kinetic model density functional theory dft computation and electron microscopy technology with the aim of disclosing the processes and mechanisms of nom s effects on bpns degradation 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials bp powder of 99 998 purity was purchased from jiangsu xianfeng nanomaterial technology co ltd china 50 mg of bp powder was added into in a custom made three port test tube with 6 ml of ultrapure water the three port test tube was placed in ice cold water 0 c and bp was crushed and dispersed with an ultrasonic crusher at 20 25 khz and 25 power for 10 h to obtain bpns zhang et al 2019 during the crushing n2 was continuously injectd into one end of the test tube at a flow rate of 60 ml min to ensure the a hypoxic crushing environment and prevent the bp powder from excessive oxidation in advance fa 2s101f extracted from water in the suwannee river was purchased from the international humic substances society ihss usa 2 2 instrument analysis the xps escalab250xi thermo fisher scientific usa was used to measure the surface sensitive photoelectron spectroscopy of p 2p and c 1s nuclear grades and to observe the variations of bpns surface composition the absorption spectra of the samples in the range of 200 600 nm were recorded by a uv vis absorption spectrometer uv 1900 shimadzu japan bpns and fa samples before and after the degradation experiment were dripped on sio2 si substrate dried naturally at room temperature and the thickness and surface roughness of the samples were characterized by scanning images of single chip atomic force microscope afm ngauge canada figs s1 and s2 the surface morphology of the sample before and after degradation experiment was scanned by transmission electron microscope tem jem2100 japan at 200 kv accelerating voltage figs s1 and s2 the degradation products of bpns were quantitatively analyzed by ion chromatography eco ic metrohm switzerland chromatographic conditions metrosep a supp 5 4 150 mm was used as the analytical column 4 mmol l na2co3 6 mmol l naoh and 10 v v acetone were used as eluent and 5 v v sulfuric acid was used as the regenerating liquid the concentrations of total dissolved phosphorus tdp and bpns in the samples were determined by flow injection instrument es7800ii nanjing zhigan environmental technology co ltd china and ultraviolet spectrophotometer total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu japan and ph meter fe28 mettler toledo usa were used to monitor the changes of dissolved organic carbon doc and hydrogen ion h during the degradation processes 2 3 experimental designs of degradation in the natural waters fa concentrations typicallly range from 1 to 10 mg l lawrence 1980 in the batch degradation experiment under the oxygen and light condition bpns reaction bottles with air exchange at various fa gradients 0 2 5 and 5 mgc l were placed in an artificial climate chamber bic 250 shanghai boxun medical biological instrument co ltd china with the continuous illumination intensity of 197 0 4 8 µmol photon cm2 s 1 ambient daylight at 25 c and the whole mirror inside the chamber ensured that light sources from three directions were uniformly irradiated on each sample placed at intervals in the hypoxia and darkness experimental design another groups of reaction samples in anaerobic bottles wrapped within aluminum foil were placed the artificial climate chamber at 25 c based on previous studies samples were collected at a dense and then sparse intervals to extend the experimental period tdp total bpns bpns degradation products toc and ph were monitored at each storage time details of the experimental design of degradation are provided in text s1 2 4 dft computation in a previous study the variation of distances and adsorption energies δe of oh h2o and h3o on the surface of bpns was obtained by dft computation zhang et al 2019 and then the oxidation effect of oh h2o and h3o on bpns was verified thus in this study combined with the conceptual molecular structure diagram of fa zhang et al 2021 and the concentration of selected fa type functional groups in the ihss we mainly focus on the role of carboxyl cooh and hydroxyl oh contained in fa all first principles computations zhang et al 2019 were implemented in the vienna ab initio simulation package vasp henkelman et al 2000 john et al 1996 kresse and furthmüller 1996 details of the dft computation are given in text s2 2 5 bpns degradation experiment affected by simple organic molecules in addition to the dft computation a certain amount of simple organic molecules with different functional groups cooh and oh including acetic acid benzoic acid ethanol and phenol were separately added into four groups of bpns solution according to the content of cooh and oh in fa 1 mgc fa contains 11 17 µmol cooh and 2 84 µmol oh ritchie and perdue 2003 concentrations of tdp were measured before and after the reaction for 10 days to indicate the effect of simple organic molecules with cooh and or oh on the bpns degradation under the oxygen and light condition 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation kinetics of bpns affected by fa the peak intensities of hypophosphite h2po2 phosphite hpo3 2 and phosphate po4 3 in the ion chromatogram increased with the storage time under the oxygen and light condition indicating that bpns is continuously oxidized notably the concentrations of bpns degradation products with fa concentrations of 2 5 mgc l fa 2 5 and 5 mgc l fa 5 were significantly higher than those of the control group without fa fa 0 at the same storage time fig s3 the molar percentage change of bpns degradation products did not change significantly at the same level of fa concentration fig s4 table s1 which is consistent with the previous study plutnar et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 the molar percentages of h2po2 in the fa 2 5 17 2 and fa 5 18 1 groups were significantly higher than in the fa 0 13 2 group p 0 001 whereas the molar percentages of hpo3 2 in the fa 2 5 47 2 and fa 5 46 1 groups were significantly lower than in the fa 0 51 3 group p 0 001 and there were no significant differences among the experimental groups in term of the molar percentages of po4 3 the solution containing each phosphorus oxyanion was stored under the same oxygen and light condition the absence of other phosphorus oxyanions throughout the storage time in the presence or the absence of fa indicated that we could exclude the possibility of mutual transformation among the degradation products fig s5 at the same time the oxidation kinetics of bpns in the presence and absence of fa were obtained by plotting and fitting the variation curves of δ h2po2 δ hpo3 2 and δ po4 3 fig 1 b d the kinetics indicated that δ pox showed a monoexponential increase thus the degradation of bpns in water containing fa conformed to the pseudo first order parallel reaction model we calculated the apparent degradation rate constant of bpns kbp and the apparent generation rate constants of three phosphorus oxyanions ki kiii and kv for h2po2 hpo3 2 and po4 3 respectively by eqs 1 4 as follows zhang et al 2018 1 k b p k i k i i i k v 2 δ o p b p n s 0 1 e k i k i i i k v t 3 δ p o x k x b p n s 0 k i k i i i k v 1 e k i k i i i k v t 4 a k x b p n s 0 k i k i i i k v k x a k i k i i i k v b p n s 0 where δ po x is the corrected concentrations of three phosphorus oxyanions h2po2 hpo3 2 and po4 3 by subtracting their concentrations at the initial storage time t 0 0 d from those at a specific storage time δ o p is the sum of δ h2po2 δ hpo3 2 and δ po4 3 bpns 0 is the apparent initial concentration of bpns which is proposed to be the concentration of p atoms at the edge sites of the nanoflakes zhang et al 2018 after 43 days of storage the sum of δ h2po2 δ hpo3 2 and δ po4 3 δ o p increased to 98 5 207 8 and 240 5 µmol l in fa 0 fa 2 5 and fa 5 groups respectively indicating that fa would enhance the degradation amount of bpns the apparent degradation rate constants of bpns k bp were 0 026 0 050 and 0 060 d 1 in the fa 0 fa 2 5 and fa 5 groups respectively fig 1a table s2 among which the k bp values in the fa 2 5 and fa 5 groups were 2 and 2 3 times of that in the fa 0 further indicating that fa would also enhance the degradation rates of bpns on the other hand it was found that the k bp of the fa group was not proportional to its concentration gradient which might be related to the rapid aggregation and deposition of bpns related studies have shown that bpns exists steadily and dispersedly can have more chances to fully bind to the target tao et al 2017 yang et al 2020 whereas low ph will accelerate the aggregation and deposition of bpns which may reduce the specific surface area of the oxidation reaction and affect its oxidative degradation rate with respect to the apparent generation rate constants of each degradation product fig 1b d table s2 it can be seen that kiii kv ki indicating that hpo3 2 was generated the fastest followed by po4 3 and h2po2 in the fa 2 5 group ki kiii and kv were 2 6 1 9 and 2 0 times as high as those of the control group fa 0 and in the fa 5 group they were 3 4 2 4 and 2 5 times respectively although the sequences of ki kiii and kv in the fa 2 5 and fa 5 groups were the same as in the fa 0 group the growth rate of ki is larger than those of kv and kiii after addition of fa thus we could conclude that fa can increase the apparent generation rate of h2po2 more easily than other phosphorus oxyanions but its product yield did not depend on the concentrations of fa 3 2 micro response of bpns degradation to fa in the fa 0 group fig 2 a the surface of the bpns showed a uniform texture which was consistent with the bpns in the stock solution fig s1 text s3 but its dispersed state was different from the just prepared bpns the light and dark color in the image due to the thickness indicated that the bpns started to aggregate slowly which was consistent with the previous study zhang et al 2018 in contrast in the fa groups the fa adhered to the surface or drifted around the bpns at the edge of the bpns red circle in fig 2b c after degradation the surface and morphology of bpns were changed due to different degrees of oxidation in the fa 0 group the aggregation of bpns is clearer than that before the reaction furthermore it can be clearly seen that many white spots appear on the uniform surface of bpns fig 2d indicating the thinning of the few layer bpns we proposed that the free phosphorus oxyanions generated by the oxidation of bp were released from the surface of bpns into the water with the increase of fa concentration the small white dots became large area with corrugated shapes furthermore the area of bpns in the tem image in the fa 5 group was smaller than that in the control group which proved that fa could promote the molecular structure collapse of bpns in the afm image the scattered lamellar structure of the freshly broken bpns fig s6a and the obvious accumulation of bpns in the fa 0 group fig s6b after the degradation reaction could be found whereas the size of bpns in the fa 2 5 and fa 5 groups fig s6c d are significantly smaller than in the fa 0 group the thickness of bpns in the fa 0 group was 87 7 53 3 nm before the reaction which was significantly smaller than that in the fa 2 5 109 5 88 8 nm p 0 01 and fa 5 groups 115 3 62 9 nm p 0 001 fig s7 according to the afm results of fa stock solution fig s2 the thickness of fa molecules is large and there should be more than simple adsorption of fa on the surface of bpns by groups alone the molecule must be considered as a whole so the existence of thicker thickness is possible and normal combined with the tem image and dft results in the following text we proposed that fa would adhere to the surface of bpns thus increasing its thickness however after a long time of oxidative degradation the thickness of bpns was significantly thinner as indicated by the thickness of 37 9 29 4 and 32 9 22 3 nm in the fa 2 5 and fa 5 groups respectively the t test of thickness between fa groups and the control also indicated that fa significantly decreased the thickness of bpns after degradation p 0 05 therefore it is suggested that the oxidative degradation pathway of bp started from the surface layer to the inside and fa promoted the oxidative degradation by adhering with bpns the higher concentration of fa would increase the adhesion opportunity with the surface of bpns resulting in faster degradation and larger thickness changes the c1s spectrum in xps showed that both the initial bpns and its residues after 90 days of reaction in the fa 0 group had strong characteristic peaks of the binding energy at three positions 284 8 285 7 and 287 2 ev fig 3 a which corresponded to cc co and c o bonds respectively it indicated that the raw bpns contained carbon and cc co and c o bonds accounted for 65 24 and 12 respectively the shape of the c1s spectrum of the oxidized bpns was different from that of the raw bpns after decomposing the c1s spectrum we found that the c1s spectrum shape of bpns in the reaction group without fa was affected by increased cc 75 and c o 15 bonds and decreased co bond 10 which might be caused by the dissolution of oxygen containing carbon in the bp during the degradation experiment in the fa 5 mgc l group the binding energy peak at 285 18 ev i e c p bond was observed solely yu et al 2018 after verifying that the fa stock solution contained negligible p by ion chromatography or tdp analysis fig s5 we assumed that some functional groups in fa could be adsorbed on the surface of bpns and the interaction between c and p atoms would change from physical adsorption to chemical adsorption thus forming c p bond 18 the shape of the p2p photoelectron spectrum in xps for the raw bpns was double peaks like it mainly contained p 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 orbitals with binding energy positions of 129 98 and 130 88 ev and was labelled as p1 corresponding to the p p bond in bpns the small peaks at position of 133 9 and 134 8 ev labelled as p2 represented phosphorus oxyanions pox fig 3b according to the relative proportion of peak area under each decomposed spectrum it can be found that p1 and p2 accounted for 94 and 6 respectively indicating that the oxidation degree of bpns before the reaction is very low however after 90 days of degradation reaction the relative proportions of p1 and p2 peak areas in fa 0 group were 91 and 9 respectively whereas those in fa group were 81 and 19 respectively the differences of p1 and p2 between the raw and oxidized bpns indicated that bpns was transformed into oxygenated phosphorus huang et al 2015 zhou et al 2016a the differences of p1 and p2 between the control and fa groups further indicated that fa facilitated the surface oxidation of bpns according to the analysis of the p2p spectral regions in other studies the peak at the binding energy of about 133 9 ev was assigned to p o or c p type bonds valero romero et al 2017 yu et al 2018 including c po3 or c2po2 wu and radovic 2006 and the peak at 134 8 ev was assigned to the p o bond edmonds et al 2015 valero romero et al 2017 the composition of p o c p in the fa group is larger than in the control group in addition the atr ftir results also confirmed the formation of c p bonds in the presence of fa as indicated by the strong signal peak at 902 cm 1 fig s8 yu et al 2018 2015 these may indicate that formation of c p bonds between fa and bpns by chemical absorption may play a crucial role in accelerating the oxidation of bpns 3 3 response of doc and h to bpns degradation affected by fa in this study the aqueous doc increased with the storage time fig s9a and there was no significant difference in the corrected concentration of doc by subtracting the initial doc from the measured one δdoc between the control group fa 0 and the fa groups fa 2 5 and fa 5 p 0 5 anova there was a good linear relationship between δdoc and δ o p in different fa groups fig s9b indicating that carbon released from bpns during the degradation contributed to the aqueous doc thus the slope of the linear curves could be explained as the apparent molar doc released per molar bpns degraded mrc p the mrc p values in the fa 2 5 0 27 and fa 5 0 26 groups were much smaller than in the fa 0 0 99 group in the fa 0 group there was no c p bond on the raw and degraded bpns however c p bond occurred on the surface of degraded bpns in fa groups indicating that some molecules in fa were trapped by bpns through adsorption and binding interaction fig 3a thus we could conclude that the mrc p was regulated by released carbon in bpns and trapped carbon from fa the positive mrc p meant that the carbon released from bpns was larger than the carbon trapped by bpns in detail according to the mrc p 1 of fa 0 group the molar ratio of oxidative degradation of p atoms to net release of c atoms was 1 1 however there were no differences between the fa 2 5 and fa 5 groups in terms of mrc p which was only one fourth of fa 0 fa was largely trapped on the surface of bpns due to the strong affinity between some organic molecules in fa and bpns if the limited affinity sites on the bpns surface were occupied by fa the net carbon released could not be changed even if the fa concentration was increased the corrected concentrations of hydrogen ion δ h by subtracting the initial hydrogen ion calculated by ph from the measured one increased with the storage time indicating that h was continuously produced during the conversion of bpns to phosphorus oxyanions fig s10 the first order kinetic equation was fitted to δ h and the apparent formation rate constants k h of δ h were 0 012 0 004 0 044 0 004 and 0 058 0 003 d 1 at fa concentrations of 0 2 5 and 5 mgc l respectively the k h values were close to the k bp values in the fa 2 5 and fa 5 groups and the k h value of δ h was only half of the k bp values in the fa 0 groups we suggested that the conversion rate of h in the system would be changed by the conversion efficiency and the pathways of the products in the presence of fa the linear regression analysis between where the corrected concentrations of three phosphorus oxyanions h2po2 hpo3 2 and po4 3 by subtracting their concentrations at the initial storage time t 0 0 d from those at a specific storage time δ po x and δ h in fig s11 and table s3 showed that the contribution of different phosphorus oxyanions to the change of h could be clarified by the good linear relationship r2 0 98 the fitting slope ratio of h2po2 hpo3 2 and po4 3 in the fa 0 group was about 1 3 3 r1 whereas that in the fa 2 5 and fa 5 groups was about 1 2 2 r2 previous study also found contribution of three phosphorus oxoacids to h is 1 3 3 in the system without fa based on the formation energy of h3pox x 2 3 4 at the edge of bp after structural optimization as shown in table s4 zhang et al 2018 therefore we proposed two empirical contribution equations to calculate the theoretical δ h based on δ pox as follows 5 δ h δ h2po2 δ hpo3 2 3 δ po4 3 3 for fa 0 group 6 δ h δ h2po2 δ hpo3 2 2 δ po4 3 2 for fa 2 5 and fa 5 groups to verify the above equations the theoretical δ h calculated by eqs 5 and 6 and the measured δ h were plotted along the 1 1 line in fig 4 although the anova indicated that there were no significant differences between the theoretical and the measured δ h p 0 05 the p value could partially reveal the applicability of each equation in explaining the data the p value close to 1 indicated that the theoretical and measured data were more located along the 1 1 line and that 0 05 indicated that there were significant deviations between the theoretical and measured data the r1 ratio was more applicable for the fa 0 group and r2 ratio was more applicable for the fa 2 5 and fa 5 groups this indicated that the addition of fa changed the oxidation pathway of bpns thus increasing the apparent formation rate of h based on the theoretical definition of the formation equation of phosphorus oxoacids by bpns oh h and o in the absence of fa by eq s2 zhang et al 2018 we also defined a formation equation of phosphorus oxoacids in the presence of fa as shown in eq s3 in text s4 from which we could depict the response of h to bpns degradation affected by fa fig s12 in the aqueous phase graphene adsorbs to fa through electrostatic interactions hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding zhao et al 2014 similarly bpns was assumed to react with fa in the same pathway the existing studies have shown that fa has negative zeta potential in low ph environment yang and xing 2009 and bpns surface also has electronegativity yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 there is electrostatic mutual repulsion between fa and bpns which is not favorable for fa adsorption on bpns surface therefore when the ph was lowered by the addition of fa the phenomena of enhanced oxidative degradation of bpns aere attributed to two possible mechanisms 1 due to the hydrophobic surface of bpns fa was adsorbed on bpns through van der waals forces yang and xing 2009 and lower ph facilitated the interaction due to the increased hydrophobicity of fa the oh and cooh functional groups in fa could interact with the p atom on the surface of bpns after the adsorption section 3 2 the hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding between fa and bpns are stronger than the electrostatic repulsion which might enable fa to adsorb on the surface of bpns 2 cooh and oh in fa directly act as hydrogen bond donors to o2 to accelerate the oxidation process of the p atom 3 4 molecular interaction between bpns and fa the role of cooh and oh the critical reactive groups of fa in promoting the degradation of bpns under oxygen and light condition was disclosed by the first principles calculations using dft fig s13 the minimum energy pathway mep for o2 decomposition on the bpns surface under the action of aliphatic and aromatic cooh and oh was calculated and shown in fig 5 a it was found that aliphatic cooh r1 cooh and oh r1 oh could not be adsorbed simultaneously so separate calculations were performed the dissociative adsorption energies of r1 cooh and r1 oh on bpns surface are 1 23 and 1 03 ev respectively whereas that of o2 is 0 33 ev indicating that r1 cooh and r1 oh are more easily adsorbed on bpns surface while aromatic cooh r2 cooh and oh r2 oh could not be adsorbed by bpns surface the decomposition of o2 molecules on the bpns surface is exothermic but has to overcome an energy barrier of 0 40 ev table s5 whereas the dissociation energy potentials of o2 molecules are 0 08 and 0 25 ev for r1 cooh and r1 oh respectively and 0 21 and 0 58 ev for r2 cooh and r2 oh respectively thus we concluded that r1 cooh r2 cooh and r1 oh could accelerate the adsorption of o atoms on the surface of bpns by lowering the energy barrier of o2 molecules and then make bpns oxidized however under the action of r2 oh the dissociation energy barrier of o2 increases which shows that it has no promoting effect on the oxidation of bpns a previous study showed that the h atom in h2o is bonded to an o atom chemically adsorbed on bpns by h bonds causing irreversible deformation of water molecules zhou et al 2016a this shows that oxidized p will eventually be decomposed by water molecules in ultrapure water the dft computation in this study showed that the h atoms in both r1 cooh and r1 oh were connected to the o atoms adsorbed on the bpns surface at a closer distance through h bonds when the dissociation of o2 molecules was promoted by r1 cooh and r1 oh fig s13 unlike r1 cooh the h bond between r1 oh and bpns disappears at the end of the reaction with o2 both r2 cooh and r2 oh formed h bonds with o atoms only at the end state of the reaction although both cooh and oh in fa could pull the oxidized p atoms in the form of pox away from the surface of bpns through h bonding the more persistent bond between r1 cooh and pox through h bonding made better performance of r1 cooh in enhancement of bpns degradation in the kinetic study of bpns degradation although the fa concentration in the fa 5 group was 2 times of that in the fa 2 5 group the apparent degradation rate constant ratio between the fa 5 and fa 2 5 groups was less than 2 according to enhancement degradation mechanism raised by xps and dft it is explained that the combination of c atom in r1 cooh with p atom on the surface of bpns through c p bond would occupy the reaction site which affected the further formation of pox furthermore r2 cooh only dissociates near bpns and does not promote oxidation r1 oh could react with phosphorus oxoacids to form ester compounds akbayeva et al 2007 plutnar et al 2018 thus reducing the product concentration in the bpns degradation experiment with simple organic molecules the ph ranged from 4 to 5 in ultrapure water the difference in oxidation efficiency of bpns at ph 4 and ph 5 can be ignored as indicated by the previous study zhang et al 2019 according to the tdp changes tdp after 10 days of degradation under oxygen and light condition fig s14 the average δtdp for acetic acid benzoic acid ethanol phenol and the ultrapure water are 66 80 58 79 57 21 56 86 and 51 60 mol l respectively the δtdp for phenol was lower than that for pure water δtdp for acetic acid was significantly higher than that for pure water p 0 05 but there were no significant differences between other organics and pure water the linear regression analysis further confirmed that the experimental degradation results of simple organic molecules were in complete agreement with the dft computation results fig 5b the δtdp in the presence of fa was up to 2 times larger than that in the presence of the simple organic molecules which could be attributed to the synergistic effects of diverse molecules in fa 3 5 effect of fa on stability of bpns under hypoxia and darkness condition in the deep surface water or groundwater there is a lack of oxygen and or light thus we designed a hypoxia and darkness condition to simulate the effect of fa on the stability of bpns after it enters the deep surface water or groundwater with organic matter previous studies have shown that light can support the oxygen oxidation of bpns but the unilateral promoting effect is not remarkable favron et al 2015 the k bp values 0 005 0 016 and 0 023 d 1 of bpns under the hypoxia and darkness condition were much lower than those 0 026 0 050 and 0 060 d 1 under the oxygen and light condition for the fa 0 fa 2 5 and fa 5 groups tables s6 the k bp for the fa 0 fa 2 5 and fa 5 groups under the oxygen and light condition were 5 2 3 2 and 2 6 times of that under the hypoxia and darkness condition respectively indicating that the hypoxia and darkness condition would inhibit the degradation of bpns but fa might resist to the inhibitory effect it is explained that fa would preferentially react with o2 and cause dissociation of o2 which facilitates the oxidation of bpns however when o2 was absent and only fa existed fa might be directly adsorbed on the surface of bpns and react with p to promote its oxidation the ratio of corrected k bp fa 5 by k bp fa 0 to corrected k bp fa 2 5 by k bp fa 0 under the oxygen and light condition 1 47 was slightly smaller than that 1 70 under the hypoxia and darkness condition indicating that the twofold enhancement effect of fa on the degradation rate of bpns is more clear under the hypoxia and darkness condition the direct effect of fa on bpns was more conducive to its oxidative degradation from tables s2 and s6 it could be seen that the degradation products of bpns might be oxygen and fa dependent as indicated by the ratios of relatively increased apparent formation rate constants compared to the control groups fa 0 among the major degradation products of bpns h2po2 δki n hpo3 2 δkiii n and po4 3 δkv n the ratios of δki n δkiii n δkv n were 1 7 1 1 1 and 1 7 1 1 for fa 2 5 and fa 5 under oxygen and light condition respectively indicating that the formation of h2po2 was more enhanced by fa than hpo3 2 and po4 3 nevertheless the ratios of δki n δkiii n δkv n were 1 4 1 1 7 and 1 4 1 1 9 for fa 2 5 and fa 5 under hypoxia and darkness condition respectively indicating that the formation of po4 3 was most enhanced by fa the hypoxia and darkness condition seemed to be more conducive to the formation of po4 3 in the presence of fa the variations of δ doc under the hypoxia and darkness condition are similar to those under the oxygen and light condition as well as the fitting results fig s15 the fitting slope ratio of h2po2 hpo3 2 and po4 3 was 1 2 1 4 for the fa 0 group under the hypoxia and darkness condition fig s16 table s6 which was quite different from that of the fa 0 group under the oxygen and light condition it indicated that the oxidation pathway of bpns under the hypoxia and darkness condition might be different from that under the oxygen and light condition 3 6 potential degradation mechanisms of bpns in water with without fa according to previous reports and the present study we depicted the degradation pathways of bpns to h3po2 h3po3 and h3po4 in the presence and absence of fa r cooh or r oh scheme 1 in the absence of fa the hydrophobicity of the bpns surface prevented water molecules from binding to p atom the p atom can only be oxidized by the dissolved oxygen in the water path α in scheme 1 forming a dangling o structure structure i in scheme 1 on the bpns surface the dangling o structure was transformed into a bridging o after a short time van druenen et al 2019 therefore the weakened hydrophobicity of the bpns surface allowed oh to react with the p atom to form a p o bond by chemisorption structure ii in scheme 1 the p o structure reacted with water molecules through hydrogen bonds to form structure iii in scheme 1 wu et al 2018 based on the formation energy of h3pox x 2 3 4 on the edge of bpns in table s4 zhang et al 2018 structure iii was proposed as an intermediate to form h3po3 and h3po4 by hydrolysis or react with oh zhang et al 2019 showed that the alkaline condition was favorable for bpns oxidation and the formation process was not affected by o2 or light zhang et al 2019 so we proposed that h3po2 is the hydrolysis product of structure ⅶ according the present study the reactive group cooh in the fa molecule accelerated the process of o2 adsorption on the bpns surface by lowering the reaction barrier of o2 under the oxygen and light condition thus increasing the production rate of intermediates similarly the oh group in the fa molecule was also able to form structure vii by adsorption so fa facilitated the increase of h3po2 yield however under hypoxia and darkness condition the limitation of o2 facilitated hydrophobicity of bpns surface and reduced concentrations of structures i iii so the oxidation rate of bpns is low than under oxygen and light condition the addition of fa significantly increases the concentration of intermediate structures iii iv v and vii through absorption or adsorption of the reactive group cooh path β in scheme 1 adsorption of the oh group path γ in scheme 1 and interaction with very small amount of o2 in the environment to oxidize the p atoms whereas the cooh group is absorbed onto the bpns surface to obtain structure iv at first followed the stepwise dissociation to obtain structures i and vii tang et al 2021 the formation of h3po4 is shown to be influenced by o and oh in the definition of the formation pathway of h3pox text s4 therefore increasing concentration of oh in fa increased the productivity of h3po4 to a greater extent after the addition of fa compared to h3po2 and h3po3 notably the specific intermediate degradation product was inferred based on previous literatures and needed to be further confirmed in our future study 3 7 implications to environmental risk assessment of bpns in the aquatic ecosystem in natural waters the reactivity of bpns and its degradation products is much more complicated the unique structure of bpns creates a nano knife effect and occupies cellular channels causing metabolic abnormalities and other physicochemical ways to destroy biological cells and affect the their normal growth li et al 2020 song et al 2018 xiong et al 2018 owing to the instability of bpns o2 ph and light can cause bpns to degrade into phosphorus oxoacids the thinner bpns has faster degradation rate favron et al 2015 on the other hand fa is easily stimulated to produce reactive oxygen species under light condition cory et al 2009 filipe et al 2020 which would affect the degradation of bpns but in this study the sources of oxygen were not categorized for discussion and will be explored in the near future wang et al 2021 the present study demonstrated that the active groups oh and cooh of natural organic matter could enhance the oxidative degradation of bpns among the degradation products phosphate could cause abnormal algal growth li et al 2020 which is the main factor of the eutrophication lee et al 2005 lee and jones 1986 in the upper part of the aquatic system where dissolved oxygen and light are sufficient fa significantly increases the concentrations of oxidative degradation of bpns through direct or indirect reactions with dissolved oxygen and fa in the bottom of the aquatic system the hypoxia and darkness conditions might not facilitate the increasing of bpns degradation products but the presence of fa would enhance the formation of phosphate in addition bpns reacts with high concentrations of organic reagents to form large amounts of organic phosphorus compounds ops and fa probably reacts with bpns over long periods of time to form similar products like phosphate esters fig s12 scheme 1 plutnar et al 2018 increasing the source of organic pollutants in the water column and ops also have potential effects on non target species including humans costa 2006 which deserves further study in the future 4 conclusions some significant conclusions in this study were drawn as follows 1 fa can promote the oxidative degradation of bpns in water with a monoexponential increase in the concentration of degradation products and no conversion between them thus the degradation of bpns in water containing fa can be explained by a parallel pseudo first order kinetic model 2 the reactive groups cooh and oh in the fa molecule are adsorbed on the surface of bpns and react with o2 through hydrogen bonding lowering the reaction potential of o2 and accelerating the oxidation of the surface p atoms the reactive groups can also react with p atoms to destroy the surface bpns structure which also promotes the degradation of bpns without the presence of o2 3 under the oxygen and light conditions the oh in fa molecules significantly promoted h2po2 production while under hypoxia and darkness conditions as the reactive group cooh was absorbed into the surface of bpns to decompose and obtain o and oh which significantly promoted the production of po4 3 compared to h2po2 and hpo3 2 although higher concentration of fa will increase more yield of the product the efficiency of fa promotion varied with the conditions credit authorship contribution statement xiaorui chen

14788,the oxidation of the emerging nanomaterial black phosphorus bp affected by ph and oxygen has been carefully documented however in natural waters there is a large amount of chemically reactive organic matters like fulvic acid fa whose impacts on degradation and stability of few layer bp or bp nanosheets bpns are scarcely disclosed hence we investigated the kinetics of bpns degradation products h2po2 hpo3 2 and po4 3 in the presence of fa the results showed that the apparent reaction rate constants of bpns were 0 026 0 050 and 0 060 d 1 under oxygen and light condition and 0 005 0 016 and 0 023 d 1 under hypoxia and darkness condition at fa gradients of 0 2 5 and 5 mgc l respectively microscopic observations simple molecular simulation experiment and density functional theory computation explained that fa significantly enhanced the degradation of p atoms on the bpns surface through the indirect pathway of reducing the energy barrier of o2 dissociative adsorption and the direct pathway of chemical adsorption which caused the p p bond on the bpns surface to break down and formed p o bonds or c p bonds this study revealed for the first time the degradation mechanism of bpns in the presence of fa which is a chemical mechanism of the bpns transformation behavior it helps to make a more scientific risk assessment of bp in natural waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords black phosphorus fulvic acid degradation chemical adsorption energy barrier data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as one of the emerging two dimensional materials black phosphorus bp is similar to natural graphene and consists of a puckered honeycomb layer structure li et al 2014 it has a high charge carrier mobility 1000 cm2v 1s 1 and a thickness dependent band gap 0 3 2 ev rodin et al 2014 takao et al 1981 which makes it a great application in the fields of battery energy storage sun et al 2014 cancer treatment sun et al 2016 electrocatalytic labelling mayorga martinez et al 2016 and photocatalytic nitrogen fixation qiu et al 2018 unlike the allotropes of phosphorus including red phosphorus and white phosphorus bp has a thermodynamically more stable structure however its chemical stability is worse than that of red phosphorus liu et al 2015 qu et al 2020 in addition in all applications and studies of bp it has been achieved under black phosphorus nanosheets bpns li et al 2022 ran et al 2017 in air the surface of bpns is susceptibly covered by a stable protective layer composed of phosphorus oxides p x o y edmonds et al 2015 however in an aqueous environment the surface of the few layer bpns is easily oxidized by dissolved oxygen and released into the water in the form of phosphorus oxyanions mainly including h2po2 hpo3 2 and po4 3 zhang et al 2018 resulting in further exposure and degradation of the underlying bpns and the remaining bpns will be completely degraded huang et al 2015 yi et al 2017 eswaraiah et al 2016 in previous well documented research oxygen increases the degradation rate of bpns by one order of magnitude while ph increases it by two orders of magnitude zeng et al 2022 the half life of bpns is reduced from 88 days in acidic ph 4 and hypoxic water to 6 86 hours in alkaline ph 11 and oxygenated water zhang et al 2019 notably after bpns is discharged into natural waters it can cause oxidative stress dependent and developmental toxicity to aquatic organisms wu et al 2020 yang et al 2021 on the other hand its degradation product phosphate would promote the growth of organisms such as chlorella vulgaris which is a major driver of eutrophication in water bodies li et al 2020 it is clear that bp is already a potential threat to aquatic ecosystems and drinking water safety fulvic acid fa a major fraction of natural organic matter nom is ubiquitous in natural waters and its diverse chemical composition determines its various environmental behaviors including adsorption liang et al 2011 complexation iglesias et al 2003 and solubilization tian et al 2012 zhou et al 2016b thus affecting the speciation and biological effects of pollutants wang et al 2022 there have been extensive reports demonstrating that graphene reacts with fa through adsorption and complexation with high reversibility and almost no destruction of its properties ali et al 2020 chowdhury et al 2014 bpns has similar structure and properties to graphene but is less stable than graphene which may have a more complex reaction with fa in addition nom exposed to light generates reactive oxygen species such as singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals maddigapu et al 2011 zhang and sun 2019 which can effectively promote the degradation of substances li et al 2008 maddigapu et al 2011 previous studies have shown that the stability of bpns in water is affected by oxygen ph and light favron et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2016a and the chemical form of degradation products varies depending on the environment however few studies currently focus on the effect of nom on the stability or degradation of bp in water it would be unfavorable to disclose the degradation behavior of bp in natural waters and hinder a more comprehensive assessment of its environmental risk in water bodies qu et al 2020 in this study the degradation of bpns at different fa concentrations is investigated based on previous experiments with a single influencing factor light or oxygen stevenson 1995 stott and martin 1990 two reaction conditions one favoring degradation oxygen and light and one favoring stability hypoxia and darkness were designed the products of bpns were analyzed by ion chromatography ic and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the main reaction mechanism critical functional groups and micro response of bpns degradation affected by fa were analyzed by combining parallel reaction kinetic model density functional theory dft computation and electron microscopy technology with the aim of disclosing the processes and mechanisms of nom s effects on bpns degradation 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials bp powder of 99 998 purity was purchased from jiangsu xianfeng nanomaterial technology co ltd china 50 mg of bp powder was added into in a custom made three port test tube with 6 ml of ultrapure water the three port test tube was placed in ice cold water 0 c and bp was crushed and dispersed with an ultrasonic crusher at 20 25 khz and 25 power for 10 h to obtain bpns zhang et al 2019 during the crushing n2 was continuously injectd into one end of the test tube at a flow rate of 60 ml min to ensure the a hypoxic crushing environment and prevent the bp powder from excessive oxidation in advance fa 2s101f extracted from water in the suwannee river was purchased from the international humic substances society ihss usa 2 2 instrument analysis the xps escalab250xi thermo fisher scientific usa was used to measure the surface sensitive photoelectron spectroscopy of p 2p and c 1s nuclear grades and to observe the variations of bpns surface composition the absorption spectra of the samples in the range of 200 600 nm were recorded by a uv vis absorption spectrometer uv 1900 shimadzu japan bpns and fa samples before and after the degradation experiment were dripped on sio2 si substrate dried naturally at room temperature and the thickness and surface roughness of the samples were characterized by scanning images of single chip atomic force microscope afm ngauge canada figs s1 and s2 the surface morphology of the sample before and after degradation experiment was scanned by transmission electron microscope tem jem2100 japan at 200 kv accelerating voltage figs s1 and s2 the degradation products of bpns were quantitatively analyzed by ion chromatography eco ic metrohm switzerland chromatographic conditions metrosep a supp 5 4 150 mm was used as the analytical column 4 mmol l na2co3 6 mmol l naoh and 10 v v acetone were used as eluent and 5 v v sulfuric acid was used as the regenerating liquid the concentrations of total dissolved phosphorus tdp and bpns in the samples were determined by flow injection instrument es7800ii nanjing zhigan environmental technology co ltd china and ultraviolet spectrophotometer total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu japan and ph meter fe28 mettler toledo usa were used to monitor the changes of dissolved organic carbon doc and hydrogen ion h during the degradation processes 2 3 experimental designs of degradation in the natural waters fa concentrations typicallly range from 1 to 10 mg l lawrence 1980 in the batch degradation experiment under the oxygen and light condition bpns reaction bottles with air exchange at various fa gradients 0 2 5 and 5 mgc l were placed in an artificial climate chamber bic 250 shanghai boxun medical biological instrument co ltd china with the continuous illumination intensity of 197 0 4 8 µmol photon cm2 s 1 ambient daylight at 25 c and the whole mirror inside the chamber ensured that light sources from three directions were uniformly irradiated on each sample placed at intervals in the hypoxia and darkness experimental design another groups of reaction samples in anaerobic bottles wrapped within aluminum foil were placed the artificial climate chamber at 25 c based on previous studies samples were collected at a dense and then sparse intervals to extend the experimental period tdp total bpns bpns degradation products toc and ph were monitored at each storage time details of the experimental design of degradation are provided in text s1 2 4 dft computation in a previous study the variation of distances and adsorption energies δe of oh h2o and h3o on the surface of bpns was obtained by dft computation zhang et al 2019 and then the oxidation effect of oh h2o and h3o on bpns was verified thus in this study combined with the conceptual molecular structure diagram of fa zhang et al 2021 and the concentration of selected fa type functional groups in the ihss we mainly focus on the role of carboxyl cooh and hydroxyl oh contained in fa all first principles computations zhang et al 2019 were implemented in the vienna ab initio simulation package vasp henkelman et al 2000 john et al 1996 kresse and furthmüller 1996 details of the dft computation are given in text s2 2 5 bpns degradation experiment affected by simple organic molecules in addition to the dft computation a certain amount of simple organic molecules with different functional groups cooh and oh including acetic acid benzoic acid ethanol and phenol were separately added into four groups of bpns solution according to the content of cooh and oh in fa 1 mgc fa contains 11 17 µmol cooh and 2 84 µmol oh ritchie and perdue 2003 concentrations of tdp were measured before and after the reaction for 10 days to indicate the effect of simple organic molecules with cooh and or oh on the bpns degradation under the oxygen and light condition 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation kinetics of bpns affected by fa the peak intensities of hypophosphite h2po2 phosphite hpo3 2 and phosphate po4 3 in the ion chromatogram increased with the storage time under the oxygen and light condition indicating that bpns is continuously oxidized notably the concentrations of bpns degradation products with fa concentrations of 2 5 mgc l fa 2 5 and 5 mgc l fa 5 were significantly higher than those of the control group without fa fa 0 at the same storage time fig s3 the molar percentage change of bpns degradation products did not change significantly at the same level of fa concentration fig s4 table s1 which is consistent with the previous study plutnar et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 the molar percentages of h2po2 in the fa 2 5 17 2 and fa 5 18 1 groups were significantly higher than in the fa 0 13 2 group p 0 001 whereas the molar percentages of hpo3 2 in the fa 2 5 47 2 and fa 5 46 1 groups were significantly lower than in the fa 0 51 3 group p 0 001 and there were no significant differences among the experimental groups in term of the molar percentages of po4 3 the solution containing each phosphorus oxyanion was stored under the same oxygen and light condition the absence of other phosphorus oxyanions throughout the storage time in the presence or the absence of fa indicated that we could exclude the possibility of mutual transformation among the degradation products fig s5 at the same time the oxidation kinetics of bpns in the presence and absence of fa were obtained by plotting and fitting the variation curves of δ h2po2 δ hpo3 2 and δ po4 3 fig 1 b d the kinetics indicated that δ pox showed a monoexponential increase thus the degradation of bpns in water containing fa conformed to the pseudo first order parallel reaction model we calculated the apparent degradation rate constant of bpns kbp and the apparent generation rate constants of three phosphorus oxyanions ki kiii and kv for h2po2 hpo3 2 and po4 3 respectively by eqs 1 4 as follows zhang et al 2018 1 k b p k i k i i i k v 2 δ o p b p n s 0 1 e k i k i i i k v t 3 δ p o x k x b p n s 0 k i k i i i k v 1 e k i k i i i k v t 4 a k x b p n s 0 k i k i i i k v k x a k i k i i i k v b p n s 0 where δ po x is the corrected concentrations of three phosphorus oxyanions h2po2 hpo3 2 and po4 3 by subtracting their concentrations at the initial storage time t 0 0 d from those at a specific storage time δ o p is the sum of δ h2po2 δ hpo3 2 and δ po4 3 bpns 0 is the apparent initial concentration of bpns which is proposed to be the concentration of p atoms at the edge sites of the nanoflakes zhang et al 2018 after 43 days of storage the sum of δ h2po2 δ hpo3 2 and δ po4 3 δ o p increased to 98 5 207 8 and 240 5 µmol l in fa 0 fa 2 5 and fa 5 groups respectively indicating that fa would enhance the degradation amount of bpns the apparent degradation rate constants of bpns k bp were 0 026 0 050 and 0 060 d 1 in the fa 0 fa 2 5 and fa 5 groups respectively fig 1a table s2 among which the k bp values in the fa 2 5 and fa 5 groups were 2 and 2 3 times of that in the fa 0 further indicating that fa would also enhance the degradation rates of bpns on the other hand it was found that the k bp of the fa group was not proportional to its concentration gradient which might be related to the rapid aggregation and deposition of bpns related studies have shown that bpns exists steadily and dispersedly can have more chances to fully bind to the target tao et al 2017 yang et al 2020 whereas low ph will accelerate the aggregation and deposition of bpns which may reduce the specific surface area of the oxidation reaction and affect its oxidative degradation rate with respect to the apparent generation rate constants of each degradation product fig 1b d table s2 it can be seen that kiii kv ki indicating that hpo3 2 was generated the fastest followed by po4 3 and h2po2 in the fa 2 5 group ki kiii and kv were 2 6 1 9 and 2 0 times as high as those of the control group fa 0 and in the fa 5 group they were 3 4 2 4 and 2 5 times respectively although the sequences of ki kiii and kv in the fa 2 5 and fa 5 groups were the same as in the fa 0 group the growth rate of ki is larger than those of kv and kiii after addition of fa thus we could conclude that fa can increase the apparent generation rate of h2po2 more easily than other phosphorus oxyanions but its product yield did not depend on the concentrations of fa 3 2 micro response of bpns degradation to fa in the fa 0 group fig 2 a the surface of the bpns showed a uniform texture which was consistent with the bpns in the stock solution fig s1 text s3 but its dispersed state was different from the just prepared bpns the light and dark color in the image due to the thickness indicated that the bpns started to aggregate slowly which was consistent with the previous study zhang et al 2018 in contrast in the fa groups the fa adhered to the surface or drifted around the bpns at the edge of the bpns red circle in fig 2b c after degradation the surface and morphology of bpns were changed due to different degrees of oxidation in the fa 0 group the aggregation of bpns is clearer than that before the reaction furthermore it can be clearly seen that many white spots appear on the uniform surface of bpns fig 2d indicating the thinning of the few layer bpns we proposed that the free phosphorus oxyanions generated by the oxidation of bp were released from the surface of bpns into the water with the increase of fa concentration the small white dots became large area with corrugated shapes furthermore the area of bpns in the tem image in the fa 5 group was smaller than that in the control group which proved that fa could promote the molecular structure collapse of bpns in the afm image the scattered lamellar structure of the freshly broken bpns fig s6a and the obvious accumulation of bpns in the fa 0 group fig s6b after the degradation reaction could be found whereas the size of bpns in the fa 2 5 and fa 5 groups fig s6c d are significantly smaller than in the fa 0 group the thickness of bpns in the fa 0 group was 87 7 53 3 nm before the reaction which was significantly smaller than that in the fa 2 5 109 5 88 8 nm p 0 01 and fa 5 groups 115 3 62 9 nm p 0 001 fig s7 according to the afm results of fa stock solution fig s2 the thickness of fa molecules is large and there should be more than simple adsorption of fa on the surface of bpns by groups alone the molecule must be considered as a whole so the existence of thicker thickness is possible and normal combined with the tem image and dft results in the following text we proposed that fa would adhere to the surface of bpns thus increasing its thickness however after a long time of oxidative degradation the thickness of bpns was significantly thinner as indicated by the thickness of 37 9 29 4 and 32 9 22 3 nm in the fa 2 5 and fa 5 groups respectively the t test of thickness between fa groups and the control also indicated that fa significantly decreased the thickness of bpns after degradation p 0 05 therefore it is suggested that the oxidative degradation pathway of bp started from the surface layer to the inside and fa promoted the oxidative degradation by adhering with bpns the higher concentration of fa would increase the adhesion opportunity with the surface of bpns resulting in faster degradation and larger thickness changes the c1s spectrum in xps showed that both the initial bpns and its residues after 90 days of reaction in the fa 0 group had strong characteristic peaks of the binding energy at three positions 284 8 285 7 and 287 2 ev fig 3 a which corresponded to cc co and c o bonds respectively it indicated that the raw bpns contained carbon and cc co and c o bonds accounted for 65 24 and 12 respectively the shape of the c1s spectrum of the oxidized bpns was different from that of the raw bpns after decomposing the c1s spectrum we found that the c1s spectrum shape of bpns in the reaction group without fa was affected by increased cc 75 and c o 15 bonds and decreased co bond 10 which might be caused by the dissolution of oxygen containing carbon in the bp during the degradation experiment in the fa 5 mgc l group the binding energy peak at 285 18 ev i e c p bond was observed solely yu et al 2018 after verifying that the fa stock solution contained negligible p by ion chromatography or tdp analysis fig s5 we assumed that some functional groups in fa could be adsorbed on the surface of bpns and the interaction between c and p atoms would change from physical adsorption to chemical adsorption thus forming c p bond 18 the shape of the p2p photoelectron spectrum in xps for the raw bpns was double peaks like it mainly contained p 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 orbitals with binding energy positions of 129 98 and 130 88 ev and was labelled as p1 corresponding to the p p bond in bpns the small peaks at position of 133 9 and 134 8 ev labelled as p2 represented phosphorus oxyanions pox fig 3b according to the relative proportion of peak area under each decomposed spectrum it can be found that p1 and p2 accounted for 94 and 6 respectively indicating that the oxidation degree of bpns before the reaction is very low however after 90 days of degradation reaction the relative proportions of p1 and p2 peak areas in fa 0 group were 91 and 9 respectively whereas those in fa group were 81 and 19 respectively the differences of p1 and p2 between the raw and oxidized bpns indicated that bpns was transformed into oxygenated phosphorus huang et al 2015 zhou et al 2016a the differences of p1 and p2 between the control and fa groups further indicated that fa facilitated the surface oxidation of bpns according to the analysis of the p2p spectral regions in other studies the peak at the binding energy of about 133 9 ev was assigned to p o or c p type bonds valero romero et al 2017 yu et al 2018 including c po3 or c2po2 wu and radovic 2006 and the peak at 134 8 ev was assigned to the p o bond edmonds et al 2015 valero romero et al 2017 the composition of p o c p in the fa group is larger than in the control group in addition the atr ftir results also confirmed the formation of c p bonds in the presence of fa as indicated by the strong signal peak at 902 cm 1 fig s8 yu et al 2018 2015 these may indicate that formation of c p bonds between fa and bpns by chemical absorption may play a crucial role in accelerating the oxidation of bpns 3 3 response of doc and h to bpns degradation affected by fa in this study the aqueous doc increased with the storage time fig s9a and there was no significant difference in the corrected concentration of doc by subtracting the initial doc from the measured one δdoc between the control group fa 0 and the fa groups fa 2 5 and fa 5 p 0 5 anova there was a good linear relationship between δdoc and δ o p in different fa groups fig s9b indicating that carbon released from bpns during the degradation contributed to the aqueous doc thus the slope of the linear curves could be explained as the apparent molar doc released per molar bpns degraded mrc p the mrc p values in the fa 2 5 0 27 and fa 5 0 26 groups were much smaller than in the fa 0 0 99 group in the fa 0 group there was no c p bond on the raw and degraded bpns however c p bond occurred on the surface of degraded bpns in fa groups indicating that some molecules in fa were trapped by bpns through adsorption and binding interaction fig 3a thus we could conclude that the mrc p was regulated by released carbon in bpns and trapped carbon from fa the positive mrc p meant that the carbon released from bpns was larger than the carbon trapped by bpns in detail according to the mrc p 1 of fa 0 group the molar ratio of oxidative degradation of p atoms to net release of c atoms was 1 1 however there were no differences between the fa 2 5 and fa 5 groups in terms of mrc p which was only one fourth of fa 0 fa was largely trapped on the surface of bpns due to the strong affinity between some organic molecules in fa and bpns if the limited affinity sites on the bpns surface were occupied by fa the net carbon released could not be changed even if the fa concentration was increased the corrected concentrations of hydrogen ion δ h by subtracting the initial hydrogen ion calculated by ph from the measured one increased with the storage time indicating that h was continuously produced during the conversion of bpns to phosphorus oxyanions fig s10 the first order kinetic equation was fitted to δ h and the apparent formation rate constants k h of δ h were 0 012 0 004 0 044 0 004 and 0 058 0 003 d 1 at fa concentrations of 0 2 5 and 5 mgc l respectively the k h values were close to the k bp values in the fa 2 5 and fa 5 groups and the k h value of δ h was only half of the k bp values in the fa 0 groups we suggested that the conversion rate of h in the system would be changed by the conversion efficiency and the pathways of the products in the presence of fa the linear regression analysis between where the corrected concentrations of three phosphorus oxyanions h2po2 hpo3 2 and po4 3 by subtracting their concentrations at the initial storage time t 0 0 d from those at a specific storage time δ po x and δ h in fig s11 and table s3 showed that the contribution of different phosphorus oxyanions to the change of h could be clarified by the good linear relationship r2 0 98 the fitting slope ratio of h2po2 hpo3 2 and po4 3 in the fa 0 group was about 1 3 3 r1 whereas that in the fa 2 5 and fa 5 groups was about 1 2 2 r2 previous study also found contribution of three phosphorus oxoacids to h is 1 3 3 in the system without fa based on the formation energy of h3pox x 2 3 4 at the edge of bp after structural optimization as shown in table s4 zhang et al 2018 therefore we proposed two empirical contribution equations to calculate the theoretical δ h based on δ pox as follows 5 δ h δ h2po2 δ hpo3 2 3 δ po4 3 3 for fa 0 group 6 δ h δ h2po2 δ hpo3 2 2 δ po4 3 2 for fa 2 5 and fa 5 groups to verify the above equations the theoretical δ h calculated by eqs 5 and 6 and the measured δ h were plotted along the 1 1 line in fig 4 although the anova indicated that there were no significant differences between the theoretical and the measured δ h p 0 05 the p value could partially reveal the applicability of each equation in explaining the data the p value close to 1 indicated that the theoretical and measured data were more located along the 1 1 line and that 0 05 indicated that there were significant deviations between the theoretical and measured data the r1 ratio was more applicable for the fa 0 group and r2 ratio was more applicable for the fa 2 5 and fa 5 groups this indicated that the addition of fa changed the oxidation pathway of bpns thus increasing the apparent formation rate of h based on the theoretical definition of the formation equation of phosphorus oxoacids by bpns oh h and o in the absence of fa by eq s2 zhang et al 2018 we also defined a formation equation of phosphorus oxoacids in the presence of fa as shown in eq s3 in text s4 from which we could depict the response of h to bpns degradation affected by fa fig s12 in the aqueous phase graphene adsorbs to fa through electrostatic interactions hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding zhao et al 2014 similarly bpns was assumed to react with fa in the same pathway the existing studies have shown that fa has negative zeta potential in low ph environment yang and xing 2009 and bpns surface also has electronegativity yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 there is electrostatic mutual repulsion between fa and bpns which is not favorable for fa adsorption on bpns surface therefore when the ph was lowered by the addition of fa the phenomena of enhanced oxidative degradation of bpns aere attributed to two possible mechanisms 1 due to the hydrophobic surface of bpns fa was adsorbed on bpns through van der waals forces yang and xing 2009 and lower ph facilitated the interaction due to the increased hydrophobicity of fa the oh and cooh functional groups in fa could interact with the p atom on the surface of bpns after the adsorption section 3 2 the hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding between fa and bpns are stronger than the electrostatic repulsion which might enable fa to adsorb on the surface of bpns 2 cooh and oh in fa directly act as hydrogen bond donors to o2 to accelerate the oxidation process of the p atom 3 4 molecular interaction between bpns and fa the role of cooh and oh the critical reactive groups of fa in promoting the degradation of bpns under oxygen and light condition was disclosed by the first principles calculations using dft fig s13 the minimum energy pathway mep for o2 decomposition on the bpns surface under the action of aliphatic and aromatic cooh and oh was calculated and shown in fig 5 a it was found that aliphatic cooh r1 cooh and oh r1 oh could not be adsorbed simultaneously so separate calculations were performed the dissociative adsorption energies of r1 cooh and r1 oh on bpns surface are 1 23 and 1 03 ev respectively whereas that of o2 is 0 33 ev indicating that r1 cooh and r1 oh are more easily adsorbed on bpns surface while aromatic cooh r2 cooh and oh r2 oh could not be adsorbed by bpns surface the decomposition of o2 molecules on the bpns surface is exothermic but has to overcome an energy barrier of 0 40 ev table s5 whereas the dissociation energy potentials of o2 molecules are 0 08 and 0 25 ev for r1 cooh and r1 oh respectively and 0 21 and 0 58 ev for r2 cooh and r2 oh respectively thus we concluded that r1 cooh r2 cooh and r1 oh could accelerate the adsorption of o atoms on the surface of bpns by lowering the energy barrier of o2 molecules and then make bpns oxidized however under the action of r2 oh the dissociation energy barrier of o2 increases which shows that it has no promoting effect on the oxidation of bpns a previous study showed that the h atom in h2o is bonded to an o atom chemically adsorbed on bpns by h bonds causing irreversible deformation of water molecules zhou et al 2016a this shows that oxidized p will eventually be decomposed by water molecules in ultrapure water the dft computation in this study showed that the h atoms in both r1 cooh and r1 oh were connected to the o atoms adsorbed on the bpns surface at a closer distance through h bonds when the dissociation of o2 molecules was promoted by r1 cooh and r1 oh fig s13 unlike r1 cooh the h bond between r1 oh and bpns disappears at the end of the reaction with o2 both r2 cooh and r2 oh formed h bonds with o atoms only at the end state of the reaction although both cooh and oh in fa could pull the oxidized p atoms in the form of pox away from the surface of bpns through h bonding the more persistent bond between r1 cooh and pox through h bonding made better performance of r1 cooh in enhancement of bpns degradation in the kinetic study of bpns degradation although the fa concentration in the fa 5 group was 2 times of that in the fa 2 5 group the apparent degradation rate constant ratio between the fa 5 and fa 2 5 groups was less than 2 according to enhancement degradation mechanism raised by xps and dft it is explained that the combination of c atom in r1 cooh with p atom on the surface of bpns through c p bond would occupy the reaction site which affected the further formation of pox furthermore r2 cooh only dissociates near bpns and does not promote oxidation r1 oh could react with phosphorus oxoacids to form ester compounds akbayeva et al 2007 plutnar et al 2018 thus reducing the product concentration in the bpns degradation experiment with simple organic molecules the ph ranged from 4 to 5 in ultrapure water the difference in oxidation efficiency of bpns at ph 4 and ph 5 can be ignored as indicated by the previous study zhang et al 2019 according to the tdp changes tdp after 10 days of degradation under oxygen and light condition fig s14 the average δtdp for acetic acid benzoic acid ethanol phenol and the ultrapure water are 66 80 58 79 57 21 56 86 and 51 60 mol l respectively the δtdp for phenol was lower than that for pure water δtdp for acetic acid was significantly higher than that for pure water p 0 05 but there were no significant differences between other organics and pure water the linear regression analysis further confirmed that the experimental degradation results of simple organic molecules were in complete agreement with the dft computation results fig 5b the δtdp in the presence of fa was up to 2 times larger than that in the presence of the simple organic molecules which could be attributed to the synergistic effects of diverse molecules in fa 3 5 effect of fa on stability of bpns under hypoxia and darkness condition in the deep surface water or groundwater there is a lack of oxygen and or light thus we designed a hypoxia and darkness condition to simulate the effect of fa on the stability of bpns after it enters the deep surface water or groundwater with organic matter previous studies have shown that light can support the oxygen oxidation of bpns but the unilateral promoting effect is not remarkable favron et al 2015 the k bp values 0 005 0 016 and 0 023 d 1 of bpns under the hypoxia and darkness condition were much lower than those 0 026 0 050 and 0 060 d 1 under the oxygen and light condition for the fa 0 fa 2 5 and fa 5 groups tables s6 the k bp for the fa 0 fa 2 5 and fa 5 groups under the oxygen and light condition were 5 2 3 2 and 2 6 times of that under the hypoxia and darkness condition respectively indicating that the hypoxia and darkness condition would inhibit the degradation of bpns but fa might resist to the inhibitory effect it is explained that fa would preferentially react with o2 and cause dissociation of o2 which facilitates the oxidation of bpns however when o2 was absent and only fa existed fa might be directly adsorbed on the surface of bpns and react with p to promote its oxidation the ratio of corrected k bp fa 5 by k bp fa 0 to corrected k bp fa 2 5 by k bp fa 0 under the oxygen and light condition 1 47 was slightly smaller than that 1 70 under the hypoxia and darkness condition indicating that the twofold enhancement effect of fa on the degradation rate of bpns is more clear under the hypoxia and darkness condition the direct effect of fa on bpns was more conducive to its oxidative degradation from tables s2 and s6 it could be seen that the degradation products of bpns might be oxygen and fa dependent as indicated by the ratios of relatively increased apparent formation rate constants compared to the control groups fa 0 among the major degradation products of bpns h2po2 δki n hpo3 2 δkiii n and po4 3 δkv n the ratios of δki n δkiii n δkv n were 1 7 1 1 1 and 1 7 1 1 for fa 2 5 and fa 5 under oxygen and light condition respectively indicating that the formation of h2po2 was more enhanced by fa than hpo3 2 and po4 3 nevertheless the ratios of δki n δkiii n δkv n were 1 4 1 1 7 and 1 4 1 1 9 for fa 2 5 and fa 5 under hypoxia and darkness condition respectively indicating that the formation of po4 3 was most enhanced by fa the hypoxia and darkness condition seemed to be more conducive to the formation of po4 3 in the presence of fa the variations of δ doc under the hypoxia and darkness condition are similar to those under the oxygen and light condition as well as the fitting results fig s15 the fitting slope ratio of h2po2 hpo3 2 and po4 3 was 1 2 1 4 for the fa 0 group under the hypoxia and darkness condition fig s16 table s6 which was quite different from that of the fa 0 group under the oxygen and light condition it indicated that the oxidation pathway of bpns under the hypoxia and darkness condition might be different from that under the oxygen and light condition 3 6 potential degradation mechanisms of bpns in water with without fa according to previous reports and the present study we depicted the degradation pathways of bpns to h3po2 h3po3 and h3po4 in the presence and absence of fa r cooh or r oh scheme 1 in the absence of fa the hydrophobicity of the bpns surface prevented water molecules from binding to p atom the p atom can only be oxidized by the dissolved oxygen in the water path α in scheme 1 forming a dangling o structure structure i in scheme 1 on the bpns surface the dangling o structure was transformed into a bridging o after a short time van druenen et al 2019 therefore the weakened hydrophobicity of the bpns surface allowed oh to react with the p atom to form a p o bond by chemisorption structure ii in scheme 1 the p o structure reacted with water molecules through hydrogen bonds to form structure iii in scheme 1 wu et al 2018 based on the formation energy of h3pox x 2 3 4 on the edge of bpns in table s4 zhang et al 2018 structure iii was proposed as an intermediate to form h3po3 and h3po4 by hydrolysis or react with oh zhang et al 2019 showed that the alkaline condition was favorable for bpns oxidation and the formation process was not affected by o2 or light zhang et al 2019 so we proposed that h3po2 is the hydrolysis product of structure ⅶ according the present study the reactive group cooh in the fa molecule accelerated the process of o2 adsorption on the bpns surface by lowering the reaction barrier of o2 under the oxygen and light condition thus increasing the production rate of intermediates similarly the oh group in the fa molecule was also able to form structure vii by adsorption so fa facilitated the increase of h3po2 yield however under hypoxia and darkness condition the limitation of o2 facilitated hydrophobicity of bpns surface and reduced concentrations of structures i iii so the oxidation rate of bpns is low than under oxygen and light condition the addition of fa significantly increases the concentration of intermediate structures iii iv v and vii through absorption or adsorption of the reactive group cooh path β in scheme 1 adsorption of the oh group path γ in scheme 1 and interaction with very small amount of o2 in the environment to oxidize the p atoms whereas the cooh group is absorbed onto the bpns surface to obtain structure iv at first followed the stepwise dissociation to obtain structures i and vii tang et al 2021 the formation of h3po4 is shown to be influenced by o and oh in the definition of the formation pathway of h3pox text s4 therefore increasing concentration of oh in fa increased the productivity of h3po4 to a greater extent after the addition of fa compared to h3po2 and h3po3 notably the specific intermediate degradation product was inferred based on previous literatures and needed to be further confirmed in our future study 3 7 implications to environmental risk assessment of bpns in the aquatic ecosystem in natural waters the reactivity of bpns and its degradation products is much more complicated the unique structure of bpns creates a nano knife effect and occupies cellular channels causing metabolic abnormalities and other physicochemical ways to destroy biological cells and affect the their normal growth li et al 2020 song et al 2018 xiong et al 2018 owing to the instability of bpns o2 ph and light can cause bpns to degrade into phosphorus oxoacids the thinner bpns has faster degradation rate favron et al 2015 on the other hand fa is easily stimulated to produce reactive oxygen species under light condition cory et al 2009 filipe et al 2020 which would affect the degradation of bpns but in this study the sources of oxygen were not categorized for discussion and will be explored in the near future wang et al 2021 the present study demonstrated that the active groups oh and cooh of natural organic matter could enhance the oxidative degradation of bpns among the degradation products phosphate could cause abnormal algal growth li et al 2020 which is the main factor of the eutrophication lee et al 2005 lee and jones 1986 in the upper part of the aquatic system where dissolved oxygen and light are sufficient fa significantly increases the concentrations of oxidative degradation of bpns through direct or indirect reactions with dissolved oxygen and fa in the bottom of the aquatic system the hypoxia and darkness conditions might not facilitate the increasing of bpns degradation products but the presence of fa would enhance the formation of phosphate in addition bpns reacts with high concentrations of organic reagents to form large amounts of organic phosphorus compounds ops and fa probably reacts with bpns over long periods of time to form similar products like phosphate esters fig s12 scheme 1 plutnar et al 2018 increasing the source of organic pollutants in the water column and ops also have potential effects on non target species including humans costa 2006 which deserves further study in the future 4 conclusions some significant conclusions in this study were drawn as follows 1 fa can promote the oxidative degradation of bpns in water with a monoexponential increase in the concentration of degradation products and no conversion between them thus the degradation of bpns in water containing fa can be explained by a parallel pseudo first order kinetic model 2 the reactive groups cooh and oh in the fa molecule are adsorbed on the surface of bpns and react with o2 through hydrogen bonding lowering the reaction potential of o2 and accelerating the oxidation of the surface p atoms the reactive groups can also react with p atoms to destroy the surface bpns structure which also promotes the degradation of bpns without the presence of o2 3 under the oxygen and light conditions the oh in fa molecules significantly promoted h2po2 production while under hypoxia and darkness conditions as the reactive group cooh was absorbed into the surface of bpns to decompose and obtain o and oh which significantly promoted the production of po4 3 compared to h2po2 and hpo3 2 although higher concentration of fa will increase more yield of the product the efficiency of fa promotion varied with the conditions credit authorship contribution statement xiaorui chen

14789,in membrane technology for water wastewater treatment the concepts of critical flux jc and limiting flux jl suggest the existence of a threshold flux below which no fouling occurs however their important roles on stable flux duration have not been sufficiently understood this work adopts a collision attachment approach to clarify the relationship of jc jl to metastable i e short term stable and long term stable fluxes based on their dependence on initial flux j 0 foulant clean membrane energy barrier ef m and foulant fouled membrane energy barrier ef f when j 0 is below jl water flux remains stable over a long time even for the case of j 0 over jc thanks to the strongly repulsive ef f at j 0 jl and j 0 jc the water flux is unstable at the beginning of filtration and the flux ultimately decreases to jl as the long term stable flux under the condition of jl j 0 jc an initial metastable flux appears owing to the high ef m with longer metastable period observed at lower j 0 and for more hydrophilic charged membrane or colloids nevertheless rapid flux decline occurs subsequently due to the energy barrier shifting to weak ef f and the water flux eventually degenerates to jl in long term fouling duration our results provide significant guidelines for fouling control strategies with respect to membrane design feedwater pretreatment and operational optimization graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords critical flux limiting flux metastable flux long term stable flux collision attachment theory data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction owing to the merits of excellent performance small footprint and low energy consumption nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro have attracted great attention in advanced water wastewater treatment field khanzada et al 2020 osorio et al 2022 su et al 2021 however membrane fouling particularly colloidal fouling is consistently the bottleneck that restricts its wide application shannon et al 2008 tang et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 generally speaking colloidal fouling is highly affected by membrane properties i e charge wang et al 2019 hydrophobicity shan et al 2016 and roughness hoek et al 2003 feed characteristics including colloidal charge boussu et al 2007 colloidal hydrophobicity wang et al 2016 and solution chemistry chen et al 2017 and operational conditions e g permeate flux wang and tang 2011b and crossflow velocity tang et al 2011 among all the above factors permeate flux is a particularly interesting parameter as an important landmark the theory of critical flux was proposed by field et al 1995 and bacchin et al 1995 in 1995 who stated that there existed a critical flux below which little fouling happened above it fouling was observed the critical flux is strongly dependent on colloid membrane interaction tang et al 2011 xie et al 2021 for instance elevated critical flux was observed for more hydrophilic membrane thanks to the strengthened hydration repulsion of foulant clean membrane f m etemadi et al 2020 xie et al 2021 another equally important concept is the limiting flux which represents the maximum stationary flux achieved when increasing pressure for a given solution aimar and field 1992 porter 1972 tang and leckie 2007 in contrast to the critical flux corresponding to the fouling triggering on start up the limiting flux scales a maximum stable flux after fouling saturation tang and leckie 2007 observed that all the flux curves above a threshold eventually collapsed to an identical pseudo stable value i e limiting flux whereas flux loss was negligible for operating flux below the limiting value the limiting flux is significantly influenced by solution chemistry for typical organic colloids e g humic acid and protein high limiting flux was observed at high ph or low ionic strength owing to the enhanced electrostatic repulsion of foulant fouled membrane f f tang et al 2009 tang and leckie 2007 wang and tang 2011b in past few decades both the critical and limiting fluxes have been applied as effective strategies for fouling control bacchin et al 2006 field and pearce 2011 lan et al 2017 tang et al 2011 according to the concept of critical limiting flux membrane flux can remain stable over a long time when the initial flux below a threshold value bacchin et al 2006 tang et al 2011 however metastable flux was experimentally observed recently that flux curves under constant pressure began to substantially decline after experiencing hours or days initial metastable period shan et al 2016 wang et al 2016 2019 obviously such metastable flux does not conform to the critical or limiting flux strictly nevertheless it is greatly promising as a novel effective antifouling strategy by extending the metastable period thus one may ask why does the metastable flux drop unexpectedly how can we extend the metastable period effectively what are the relationships between critical flux or limiting flux and short term and long term stable fluxes all these doubts need to be carefully clarified for effective fouling control recently liu et al 2020 expounded that the initial metastable flux appeared at high f m but low f f interaction since critical flux and limiting flux are also greatly affected by colloid surface interaction liu et al 2020 tang and leckie 2007 a comprehensive examination of f m and f f effects on colloidal stability is essential for clarifying the relations of critical and limiting fluxes to stable flux duration furthermore as the colloid membrane interaction is strongly dependent on foulant and membrane properties e g charge and hydrophobicity liu et al 2021a shan et al 2016 tang et al 2011 tang et al 2009 a systematical investigation of their critical influences on colloidal fouling would be beneficial for membrane design and feedwater pretreatment in the current work we report a collision attachment ca approach liu et al 2018 to relate the critical and limiting fluxes to metastable and long term stable fluxes based on their dependence on initial permeate flux and colloid membrane interaction in ca model fouling is recognized as two key processes i e colloidal particles collision with the membrane and their subsequent attachment onto the membrane liu et al 2021a 2021b in particular the probability of successful colloidal attachment is described by boltzmann equation which can scale the critical roles of permeate flux and energy barrier of colloid membrane on colloidal fouling liu et al 2018 although the ca model has been applied to explore the critical roles of permeate flux and energy barrier liu et al 2021a 2018 2021b the previous works relied on a highly simplified assumption of constant energy barrier of foulant membrane with respect to filtration time by incorporating the fouling transition behavior i e from f m to f f the ca approach developed herein can dissect the critical roles of permeate flux ef m and ef f on colloidal stability unlike the existing publications that generally emphasized on raising the values of critical and limiting fluxes this study highlights the critical roles of flux and energy barrier on period of stable flux furthermore the crucial effects of membrane and foulant properties i e charge and hydrophobicity are also effectively evaluated through ca approach coupled with xdlvo theory our modeling results provide new insights and critical implications for fouling control under constant pressure mode 2 theory in the subsections the ca model is first presented in section 2 1 afterwards the modifications of colloid surface interaction and permeate flux are briefly introduced in section 2 2 and section 2 3 respectively 2 1 collision attachment model the ca approach has been conventionally adopted to simulate the behavior of colloid colloid collision in the field of coagulation thomas et al 1999 valioulis and list 1984 liu and co workers liu et al 2021a 2018 recently applied it to model membrane fouling behavior by recognizing a membrane as an infinitely large particle and fouling as a series of collisions of colloidal particles with the membrane as shown in fig 1 colloidal particles can migrate towards the membrane and collide with the membrane under the permeate drag effect liu et al 2018 tang et al 2009 according to ca model the rate of fouling i e rate of successful colloidal attachment onto the membrane dmf dt is determined by colloidal collision frequency jcb and the corresponding attachment efficiency γ liu et al 2018 1 d m f d t γ j c b where mf is the mass of deposited colloidal particles in the filtration time t j and cb are the permeate flux and the colloidal concentration in bulk flow respectively the mass flux jcb characterizes the frequency of colloidal particles colliding with the membrane while the attachment efficiency γ represents the probability of colloidal attachment onto membrane for any collision event liu et al 2021b the value of γ can be further described by boltzmann distribution law via considering the effects of hydrodynamics drag interaction colloid surface interaction as well as concentration polarization cp on colloidal deposition liu et al 2018 see supporting information s1 for details 2 γ 1 1 exp δ e b k b t δ e d k b t j k m where kb is the boltzmann s constant and t is absolute temperature δeb is the energy barrier due to colloid membrane interaction defending foulant attachment the value of which is determined according to the modification of f m to f f interaction see section 2 2 for details the term δed stands for the hydrodynamic drag interaction promoting colloidal attachment and δed can be linked to the permeate flux through stokes equation as liu et al 2021b 3 δ e d 3 π μ d p j l d β j where μ is the feed viscosity and dp is the colloidal size ld is the relative displacement of colloid under drag force with β the permeate drag coefficient in eq 2 the term j km accounts for the role of cp i e the relative ratio of forward transport j over backward diffusion km with km the mass transfer coefficient in practice km is often estimated based on brownian diffusion coefficient d porter 1972 and the fluid channel geometry hoek et al 2002 for a typical spacer filled channel in crossflow filtration km can be given by liu et al 2021b 4 k m 0 2 u 0 57 ρ 0 17 d 0 6 μ 0 17 d h 0 43 where u is the crossflow velocity and ρ is the fluid density the term dh is the hydrodynamic diameter of the membrane channel the value of which can be calculated according to the spacer geometry liu et al 2021b overall the terms δeb kbt δed kbt and j km in eq 2 incorporate the effects of energy barrier permeate drag and cp respectively greater j gives rise to higher γ as a result of the raised drag and cp whereas smaller γ appears at larger δeb due to the enhanced colloid membrane repulsion 2 2 colloid surface interaction as illustrated in fig 1 when colloidal particles approach the membrane surface the energy barrier δeb arising from foulant membrane interaction will resist their deposition and those who overcome the energy barrier can successfully attach onto the membrane the value of δeb is determined by adopting a weighted average of f m energy barrier ef m and f f energy barrier ef f liu et al 2020 5 δ e b 1 ω e f m ω e f f where ω is the coverage coefficient to quantify the influence of deposited foulant and can be given by 6 ω n a n c m f m c 0 ω 1 where na is the amount of colloidal particle number at time t

potential and contact angle see supporting information s2 for details 2 3 permeate flux equation the foulant deposition can also modify the membrane flux under constant applied pressure for any given time the water flux can be determined according to membrane filtration equation hong and elimelech 1997 liu et al 2020 9 j δ p μ r m α f m f where δp rm and mf are the operating pressure the membrane intrinsic resistance and the mass of foulant deposition respectively it is worthwhile to note that since pore blocking is not involved in nf ro only cake filtration is the main behavior of colloidal fouling in our study in this case the cake resistance rf can be generally given by the product of the specific cake resistance αf and the amount of foulant mass deposition mf see eq 9 the value of αf can be determined through carmen kozeny equation carman 1997 or cake layer model tang et al 2007 in this work a referenced αf of 3 0 1013 m g is adopted for simulation based on our previous report liu et al 2018 the models in sections 2 1 2 3 provide a facile way to investigate the critical roles of water flux energy barrier of colloid membrane interaction and colloidal and membrane properties zeta potential ζ and contact angle θ on colloidal fouling the detailed algorithm procedures are given in supporting information s3 and model verifications indicate that the ca predicted water fluxes are in well agreement with the experimental results for colloidal fouling of nf membranes refer to supporting information s4 for details 3 results and discussion 3 1 role of initial water flux it has been well recognized that the critical flux jc is affected by f m energy barrier ef m while the limiting flux jl is dominated by f f energy barrier ef f liu et al 2020 tang and leckie 2007 to comprehensively understand the relationship between jc jl and metastable and long term stable fluxes we investigate the role of initial flux j 0 on colloidal stability under the conditions where ef m equal to less than and greater than ef f with the main simulation parameters listed in table 1 at ef m ef f 12 0 kbt fig 2 a clearly shows that obvious flux decline occurs at great initial flux j 0 50 μm s whereas water flux is still stable over the entire 100 h duration when j 0 40 μm s therefore the value of limiting flux is between 40 and 50 μm s a further close observation of the final pseudo stable flux value for j 0 50 μm s in fig 2a suggests that the limiting flux should be around 45 μm s such fouling phenomena fit the limiting flux theory tang and leckie 2007 that permeate flux above jl eventually approaches the jl value an estimated jl of around 45 μm s in fig 2a at the same time our results also conform to the critical flux theory field et al 1995 no fouling can be observed when initial flux below a critical value as a result of the identical ef m and ef f the jc and jl share the same value accordingly essentially the critical and limiting fluxes can be recognized as water flux corresponding to the negligible fouling rate under constant energy barrier ef m ef f fig 2b clearly shows an increasing j 0 from 10 to 70 μm s results in an elevated initial dmf dt by orders of magnitude i e from 10 9 to 10 5 g m2s reflecting the combined influences of increased collision frequency eq 1 enhanced cp and elevated attachment efficiency eq 2 over the entire 100 h filtration a gradually decreased rate of fouling occurs for high j 0 50 μm s whilst dmf dt remains constant at j 0 40 μm s with the latter corresponding to the sub critical limiting fluxes fig 2a in view of critical limiting flux being about 45 μm s in this set the threshold dmf dt i e the critical fouling rate below which little no fouling happens in this study should be in the range of about 2 5 10 7 g m2s the value of which is comparable to our previous report liu et al 2018 keeping ef m at 12 0 kbt but increasing ef f to 14 0 kbt brings about negligible flux declines during the whole 100 h filtration for j 0 of 50 and 60 μm s in addition to j 0 40 μm s fig 2c the values of the former are above the critical flux the jc value should also be approximately 45 μm s due to the fixed ef m although such results seem to be counterintuitive they can be reasonably interpreted by the evolutions of fouling rate and energy barrier as shown in fig 2d despite that the fouling rates for j 0 50 and 60 μm s are above the threshold dmf dt in the initial stage their values become less than the threshold value only after a couple of hours ensuring a relatively stable flux over the long term filtration duration indeed the initial attached colloidal particles can modify the membrane surface tending to a highly repulsive ef f fig s2a of supporting information s5 and thus lowering fouling rate substantially eventually resulting in a self terminated fouling behavior even for the case of ef m 0 supporting information s6 our modeling supports the experimental observation wang and tang 2011a that for filtration of positively charged lysozyme by a negatively charged nf membrane water flux can maintain a long term stable state after initial slight loss thanks to the strongly repulsive f f interaction a much severe fouling happens at fixed ef m 12 0 kbt but lowered ef f 7 0 kbt fig 2e at the end of 100 h filtration all the fluxes for j 0 20 μm s tend to a relatively low stable flux 15 μm s due to the weak f f interaction revealing the limiting flux at such level our simulations underpin the previous reports tang et al 2009 tang and leckie 2007 the long term fouling is highly governed by f f interaction nevertheless owing to the strong f m repulsion there exists an initial metastable flux with extended metastable period tmp at decreased j 0 specifically rapid flux loss without metastable period is observed for high j 0 above 50 μm s decreasing j 0 from 40 to 20 μm s can effectively prolong the tmp from only a couple of hours to over 40 h while for a low j 0 of 10 μm s the water flux remains stable without any obvious decline in the entire 100 h filtration by comparison with the values of critical flux jc 45 μm s and limiting flux 10 μm s jl 15 μm s the metastable flux seems to be sub critical flux but super limiting flux despite being at sub critical flux state the substantial and continued flux declines occurs in the latter fouling period which is against the typical critical flux theory that little fouling occurs when operational flux below a critical value bacchin et al 2006 nevertheless it can be rationally explained by the fouling transition of colloid surface interaction briefly the conditioning of the membrane surface with initial attached particles will lower the energy barrier from relatively high ef m toward weak ef f fig s2b of supporting information s5 serving as seeds for further foulant attachment similar to the traditional nucleation to crystallization process le gouellec and elimelech 2002 lin et al 2005 hence although a high ef m at sub critical flux j 0 20 40 μm s indicates an excellent antifouling ability with negligible dmf dt below threshold value the nucleus effect of the deposited colloidal particles results in the accelerated rise of the fouling rate above threshold value fig 2f eventually leading to the remarkable decline of water flux fig 2e after the completion of transition from ef m to ef f the subsequent fouling rate begin to decline due to the decreased permeate drag at weak f f domination simulation results in fig 2a f reveal that the role of initial flux is greatly affected by f m and f f interactions according to the relative magnitudes of ef m and ef f the role of j 0 on stable flux can be summarized as the following three cases ef m ef f see fig 3 a in the ideal condition that the energy barriers of f m and f f have the identical magnitude the value of critical flux jc is equal to that of limiting flux jl when j 0 is below jc or jl no flux decline occurs for long term filtration for j 0 above jc or jl the long term stable flux value approaches the critical limiting flux ef m ef f see fig 3b in this case the critical flux jc is less than the limiting flux jl when j 0 j l flux for long term filtration remains stable with negligible fouling even at j 0 above j c thanks to the conditioning of membrane surface by highly repulsive f f interaction while for j 0 jl flux decline happens and the long term stable flux value achieves to jl ef m ef f see fig 3c and d when the repulsion of f m is greater than that of f f the value of jc is above jl at j 0 jl no flux reduction appears with j 0 value as the long term stable flux when j 0 above jl but below jc the metastable flux yellow curve in fig 3c appears as a result of high f m repulsion and its upper and lower limit are critical flux and limiting flux respectively the metastable flux period lasts longer at lower j 0 with a barely noticeable period at j 0 jc but infinite period at j 0 jl fig 3d nevertheless owing to the seed effect of the initial attached foulant the water flux will decrease to jl value as the long term stable flux the green curve in fig 3c while for j 0 over jc water flux drops at the beginning of the filtration and eventually approaches jl for long term filtration 3 2 role of membrane properties fouling can be greatly affected by membrane properties due to their important roles on foulant membrane interaction hoek et al 2003 shan et al 2016 wang et al 2019 for example membranes with more hydrophilic surface generally exhibit better antifouling ability thanks to the suppressed f m hydrophobic attraction shan et al 2016 to cater for the practical application we dissect the crucial influence of membrane contact angle θm standing for membrane hydrophilicity on colloidal stability at a long filtration time of 200 h all the flux curves collapse to nearly the same pseudo stable value see insert of fig 4 a echoing the limiting flux independent of membrane properties despite that our simulations clearly indicate that the initial flux behavior is highly dependent on membrane contact angle with an initial flux of 20 μm s an extended metastable duration tmp happens for membrane with smaller θm specifically the metastable flux period is barely noticeable for θm 60 while the tmp can effectively be prolonged to 5 0 and 55 h by decreasing θm to 56 and 55 thanks to the enhanced hydrated repulsion of f m at reduced θm fig 4c our simulations are consistent with the existing experimental observation of much longer stable flux period 60 h for a super hydrophilic membrane compared to the shorter metastable duration 1 h for other less hydrophilic or more hydrophobic membranes shan et al 2016 fig 4b plots the evolution of particle deposition over time in the initial filtration period a slower foulant accumulation appears at lower contact angle as a result of smaller attachment efficiency eq 2 arising from stronger f m repulsion fig 4c for each given θm the number of deposited particles per square micrometer μm2 appears to be linearly dependent on filtration time on log scale which is attributed to the nearly constant energy barrier in metastable duration fig 4c however once the initial deposited particles achieve a threshold amount rapid foulant deposition happens accompanied by remarkable barrier shifting from f m to f f fig 4c indeed despite the initial particle deposition behaviors present distinct for membrane with different θm their later fouling features are tending to the identical f f dominated behavior pink curve in fig 4b fig 4d further describes the effects of θm on stable flux briefly the limiting flux value jl is constant regardless of membrane properties with the green shading i e the sub limiting fluxes standing for the long term stable flux region while the critical flux jc is strongly dependent on membrane θm with higher jc obtained at lower θm an interesting observation in fig 4d is that there seems to be a threshold θm around 56 a slight decrease of θm by only several degrees can elevate jc by more than one order of magnitudes accompanied by the extremely expanding range of metastable fluxes yellow shading in fig 4d meanwhile the metastable period tmp is also greatly extended fig 4e for example the tmp for j 0 of 20 μm s is 1 0 h when θm at 56 5 whereas it sharply increases 1000 times i e 1000 h when θm decrease to 53 7 δθm 3 0 our results highlight the importance of tuning membrane contact angle below the threshold value for powerfully retarding fouling via raising the critical flux value and prolonging the metastable flux period effectively similarly the membrane zeta potential ζm also plays an important role on colloidal stability where the larger critical flux and longer metastable period occur at decreased ζm with more negative charges refer to supporting information s8 for details this result echoes a recent report wang et al 2019 that more salient metastable flux period appears at increased application of external voltage thanks to the strengthened electrostatic repulsion of f m 3 3 role of colloidal properties like membrane properties colloidal properties are equally important for fouling through the alteration of colloid surface interaction liu et al 2021a tang et al 2011 as a typical example rapid flux drops appeared at ph near the isoelectric point high ionic strength or high calcium ion which is attributed to the suppressed f m or f f electrostatic repulsion tang et al 2011 2009 to better understand the vital influence of electrostatic interaction fig 5 a investigates the effect of colloidal zeta potential on fouling development unlike the negligible influence of membrane properties on long term fouling performance fig 4a the colloidal zeta potential ζf is critical for fouling process from the beginning to the end fig 5a as shown in fig 5a flux decline is much milder over the entire filtration for foulant with more negative ζf which is ascribed to their stronger f m and f f electrostatic repulsion fig 5b specifically rapid flux declines without metastable period occur for colloid with slightly negative zeta potential i e ζf 10 and 20 mv decreasing ζf to 35 mv with more negative charge gives rise to a remarkable metastable flux period tmp 20 h followed by mild flux loss as a result of the strengthened repulsion fig 5b and thus reduced attachment probability eq 2 further reducing ζf to 40 mv leads to even long term stable flux without obvious fouling thanks to the domination of great energy barrier over the entire 100 h filtration 12 kbt fig 5b to fully disclose the key role of colloidal charge fig 5c draws the critical limiting metastable and long term stable fluxes as a function of ζf overall a decreasing ζf from 10 to 40 mv with increasing negative charges leads to notably raised critical flux jc and limiting flux jl i e from around 0 1 to several dozen μm s accordingly the metastable flux values also go up more than two orders of magnitude yellow shading in fig 5c at the same time the metastable period tmp becomes longer when ζf decreases from 30 to 40 mv at j 0 of 20 μm s fig 5d more importantly like the membrane contact angle there also exists a threshold colloidal ζf around 35 mv in which a little bit reduction of ζf leads to orders of magnitude extension of metastable period tmp in addition to ζf the colloidal contact angle θf also has significant influence on colloidal fouling with less severe flux declines and longer metastable period occurring at decreased θf owing to the suppressed acid base repulsion of colloid membrane refer to supporting information s9 for details 3 4 interplay of flux and energy section 3 1 investigates the role of initial flux on colloidal fouling while sections 3 2 and 3 3 dissect the effects of membrane and colloidal properties through their importance on f m and f f interaction to achieve a comprehensive understanding of colloidal stability the interplay of initial flux j 0 and energy barrier i e ef m and ef f is further examined in this section we first define an initial threshold energy barrier eith i e the critical energy barrier above which fouling is negligible for each given j 0 we then assess the joint role of flux energy through comparing the magnitudes of eith to ef m and ef f or j 0 to jc and jl by adopting a threshold dmf dt of 3 10 7 g m2s fig 6 a plots the curve of j 0 vs eith as expected a higher j 0 requires a larger eith to lower attachment efficiency for avoiding fouling effectively for instance the value of eith is 8 6 11 4 and 13 9 kbt for j 0 of 20 40 and 60 μm s respectively based on the relative magnitudes of eith ef m and ef f the relations of critical limiting fluxes to metastable and long term stable fluxes are as follows fig 6b c ø long term stable flux region at eith ef f see green shading at j 0 jl owing to the self terminated fouling behavior for more repulsive f f compared to eith little fouling happens and membrane flux remains constant over a long term filtration even for the case of j 0 jc ø unstable flux region at eith ef f eith ef m see red shading at j 0 jl j 0 jc since both barriers of f m and f f are too weak to effectively resist particle deposition obvious flux decline happens at the beginning of filtration which is more severe at higher j 0 or lower ef m or lower ef f marked by deeper red ø metastable flux region at ef f eith ef m see yellow shading at jl j 0 jc in this region the initial water flux can maintain stable due to the great ef m eith with longer metastable period appearing at smaller j 0 or greater ef m or greater ef f indicated by deeper yellow while the nuclear effect of the deposited particles leads to the rapid flux decline in the subsequent filtration by reducing the energy barrier towards weak ef f eith eventually the metastable flux degenerates to jl as stable flux over the long term filtration furthermore fig 7 a provides more details for the joint effects of j 0 and ef m on metastable flux period tmp for each given j 0 there seems to be a nearly linear increase of tmp on ef m at a log scale with similar slopes for various j 0 see the theoretical basis in supporting information s7 for each fixed ef m increased j 0 results in decreased metastable period obviously however when the energy difference between ef m and eith as the horizontal coordinate the role of initial flux becomes less discernible fig 7b suggesting that the underlying factor in governing metastable period is the surplus of ef m over eith 4 conclusion and implications for the first time this work systematically investigates the relations of critical flux jc and limiting flux jl to metastable and long term stable fluxes through a ca approach our simulations highlight the crucial roles of initial flux j 0 f m energy barrier ef m and f f energy barrier ef f on colloidal stability when j 0 jl the water flux remains stable over a long time even for the case of j 0 over jc thanks to the more repulsive ef f compared to initial threshold energy barrier eith i e the critical energy barrier above which no little fouling occurs for each given j 0 at j 0 jl j 0 jc water flux is unstable at the beginning of filtration owing to both weak ef m eith and ef f eith and the flux ultimately lowers to jl as the long term stable flux under the condition of jl j 0 jc an initial metastable flux appears due to the high ef m eith with barely noticeable metastable period at j 0 jc but infinite period at j 0 decreasing to jl furthermore the metastable period can also be greatly prolonged at decreased contact angle or zeta potential of membrane or foulant nevertheless rapid flux decline occurs subsequently owing to the energy barrier shifting to weak ef f eith and the metastable flux eventually degenerates to jl as the long term stable flux our results have significant implications for regulating operational conditions when adopting critical flux jc and limiting flux jl as fouling control strategies one needs to distinguish the short term stable i e metastable and long term stable flux the long term stable flux is independent of critical flux but dependent on limiting flux whereas the metastable flux is dependent on both critical flux and limiting flux sub critical flux operation may lead to a short term stable flux if j 0 above jl owing to the seed effect of the initial deposited foulants to ensure a long term stable flux the operational flux j 0 should be below jl in real application the operating flux selection is highly dependent on energy barriers of f m and f f in the context of ef m ef f controlling water flux below critical limiting flux should be a great guide for fouling control while at high ef m but low ef f critical flux should be adopted as the upper bound of operating flux for fouling control for the case of small ef m but great ef f limiting flux jl should be applied as the upper limit of operation flux for fouling control since unstable flux happens at water flux over both critical flux and limiting flux high operating flux j 0 above jc and jl should be strictly avoided due to the great permeate drag that promotes severe fouling which can significantly affect membrane operational stability however excessive pursuit of low flux j 0 jc or j 0 jl is also not recommended as lowered water production means increased investment and operational cost due to the trade off effect between metastable flux value and its period fig 3d moderate flux is often adopted e g 12 45 l m 2 h 1 for brackish water treatment in practice greenlee et al 2009 besides operating flux selection should also consider the types of membrane module in real application for typical nf ro spiral wound module applied in desalination or water reuse owing to the difficult membrane cleaning a relatively lower j 0 is favored to achieve longer metastable duration while for hollow fiber membranes or flat sheet membranes with effectively cleaning a relatively larger j 0 still below jc within tolerable cleaning frequency can be implemented to obtain more productive water modeling results also have important guidelines for membrane preparation and feedwater adjustment for coping with unfavorable feed small ef f and low jl values the design of membranes with more hydrophilic or more charged is fundamentally essential for achieving higher critical flux and longer metastable period see fig 4 and supporting information s8 furthermore membrane selection should be in accordance with the anticipated operating flux j 0 or a demand water production as suggested in fig 7 the underlying factor in governing metastable flux period is the surplus of f m energy barrier ef m over the initial threshold energy barrier eith i e the critical energy barrier above which fouling is negligible for each given j 0 therefore the ef m value for selected nf ro membranes should be far more than eith to achieve a relatively long metastable period however it should be clearly aware that even the excellent antifouling membrane may fail due to the energy barrier shifting to weak repulsive f f considering the great influences of colloidal properties on both ef m and ef f pretreatment problematic feedwater e g via coagulation wang et al 2020 adsorption zhang et al 2023 and oxidation zhang et al 2022 may be an effective way to reduce fouling for long term filtration as enlightened from fig 5 and supporting information s9 adjusting contact angle and zeta potential of colloids in accordance with the threshold value is able to resist fouling powerfully through effectively raising the jc and jl values more importantly a high jl can ensure a high value of long term stable flux due to the self terminated fouling behavior even for poor antifouling membranes supporting information s6 traditionally flux pressure experimental observations fradin and field 1999 wu et al 1999 were adopted to determine a steady state flux i e critical flux however the duration of the fouling test using this method was often performed within a couple of hours e g 2 h and thus the obtained pseudo stable flux may not maintain over a long time filtration owing to the fouling shifting from high ef m to low ef f repulsion compared to the flux pressure measurements the ca approach

14789,in membrane technology for water wastewater treatment the concepts of critical flux jc and limiting flux jl suggest the existence of a threshold flux below which no fouling occurs however their important roles on stable flux duration have not been sufficiently understood this work adopts a collision attachment approach to clarify the relationship of jc jl to metastable i e short term stable and long term stable fluxes based on their dependence on initial flux j 0 foulant clean membrane energy barrier ef m and foulant fouled membrane energy barrier ef f when j 0 is below jl water flux remains stable over a long time even for the case of j 0 over jc thanks to the strongly repulsive ef f at j 0 jl and j 0 jc the water flux is unstable at the beginning of filtration and the flux ultimately decreases to jl as the long term stable flux under the condition of jl j 0 jc an initial metastable flux appears owing to the high ef m with longer metastable period observed at lower j 0 and for more hydrophilic charged membrane or colloids nevertheless rapid flux decline occurs subsequently due to the energy barrier shifting to weak ef f and the water flux eventually degenerates to

introduction owing to the merits of excellent performance small footprint and low energy consumption nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro have attracted great attention in advanced water wastewater treatment field khanzada et al 2020 osorio et al 2022 su et al 2021 however membrane fouling particularly colloidal fouling is consistently the bottleneck that restricts its wide application shannon et al 2008 tang et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 generally speaking colloidal fouling is highly affected by membrane properties i e charge wang et al 2019 hydrophobicity shan et al 2016 and roughness hoek et al 2003 feed characteristics including colloidal charge boussu et al 2007 colloidal hydrophobicity wang et al 2016 and solution chemistry chen et al 2017 and operational conditions e g permeate flux wang and tang 2011b and crossflow velocity tang et al 2011 among all the above factors permeate flux is a particularly interesting parameter as an important landmark the theory of critical flux was proposed by field et al 1995 and bacchin et al 1995 in 1995 who stated that there existed a critical flux below which little fouling happened above it fouling was observed the critical flux is strongly dependent on colloid membrane interaction tang et al 2011 xie et al 2021 for instance elevated critical flux was observed for more hydrophilic membrane thanks to the strengthened hydration repulsion of foulant clean membrane f m etemadi et al 2020 xie et al 2021 another equally important concept is the limiting flux which represents the maximum stationary flux achieved when increasing pressure for a given solution aimar and field 1992 porter 1972 tang and leckie 2007 in contrast to the critical flux corresponding to the fouling triggering on start up the limiting flux scales a maximum stable flux after fouling saturation tang and leckie 2007 observed that all the flux curves above a threshold eventually collapsed to an identical pseudo stable value i e limiting flux whereas flux loss was negligible for operating flux below the limiting value the limiting flux is significantly influenced by solution chemistry for typical organic colloids e g humic acid and protein high limiting flux was observed at high ph or low ionic strength owing to the enhanced electrostatic repulsion of foulant fouled membrane f f tang et al 2009 tang and leckie 2007 wang and tang 2011b in past few decades both the critical and limiting fluxes have been applied as effective strategies for fouling control bacchin et al 2006 field and pearce 2011 lan et al 2017 tang et al 2011 according to the concept of critical limiting flux membrane flux can remain stable over a long time when the initial flux below a threshold value bacchin et al 2006 tang et al 2011 however metastable flux was experimentally observed recently that flux curves under constant pressure began to substantially decline after experiencing hours or days initial metastable period shan et al 2016 wang et al 2016 2019 obviously such metastable flux does not conform to the critical or limiting flux strictly nevertheless it is greatly promising as a novel effective antifouling strategy by extending the metastable period thus one may ask why does the metastable flux drop unexpectedly how can we extend the metastable period effectively what are the relationships between critical flux or limiting flux and short term and long term stable fluxes all these doubts need to be carefully clarified for effective fouling control recently liu et al 2020 expounded that the initial metastable flux appeared at high f m but low f f interaction since critical flux and limiting flux are also greatly affected by colloid surface interaction liu et al 2020 tang and leckie 2007 a comprehensive examination of f m and f f effects on colloidal stability is essential for clarifying the relations of critical and limiting fluxes to stable flux duration furthermore as the colloid membrane interaction is strongly dependent on foulant and membrane properties e g charge and hydrophobicity liu et al 2021a shan et al 2016 tang et al 2011 tang et al 2009 a systematical investigation of their critical influences on colloidal fouling would be beneficial for membrane design and feedwater pretreatment in the current work we report a collision attachment ca approach liu et al 2018 to relate the critical and limiting fluxes to metastable and long term stable fluxes based on their dependence on initial permeate flux and colloid membrane interaction in ca model fouling is recognized as two key processes i e colloidal particles collision with the membrane and their subsequent attachment onto the membrane liu et al 2021a 2021b in particular the probability of successful colloidal attachment is described by boltzmann equation which can scale the critical roles of permeate flux and energy barrier of colloid membrane on colloidal fouling liu et al 2018 although the ca model has been applied to explore the critical roles of permeate flux and energy barrier liu et al 2021a 2018 2021b the previous works relied on a highly simplified assumption of constant energy barrier of foulant membrane with respect to filtration time by incorporating the fouling transition behavior i e from f m to f f the ca approach developed herein can dissect the critical roles of permeate flux ef m and ef f on colloidal stability unlike the existing publications that generally emphasized on raising the values of critical and limiting fluxes this study highlights the critical roles of flux and energy barrier on period of stable flux furthermore the crucial effects of membrane and foulant properties i e charge and hydrophobicity are also effectively evaluated through ca approach coupled with xdlvo theory our modeling results provide new insights and critical implications for fouling control under constant pressure mode 2 theory in the subsections the ca model is first presented in section 2 1 afterwards the modifications of colloid surface interaction and permeate flux are briefly introduced in section 2 2 and section 2 3 respectively 2 1 collision attachment model the ca approach has been conventionally adopted to simulate the behavior of colloid colloid collision in the field of coagulation thomas et al 1999 valioulis and list 1984 liu and co workers liu et al 2021a 2018 recently applied it to model membrane fouling behavior by recognizing a membrane as an infinitely large particle and fouling as a series of collisions of colloidal particles with the membrane as shown in fig 1 colloidal particles can migrate towards the membrane and collide with the membrane under the permeate drag effect liu et al 2018 tang et al 2009 according to ca model the rate of fouling i e rate of successful colloidal attachment onto the membrane dmf dt is determined by colloidal collision frequency jcb and the corresponding attachment efficiency γ liu et al 2018 1 d m f d t γ j c b where mf is the mass of deposited colloidal particles in the filtration time t j and cb are the permeate flux and the colloidal concentration in bulk flow respectively the mass flux jcb characterizes the frequency of colloidal particles colliding with the membrane while the attachment efficiency γ represents the probability of colloidal attachment onto membrane for any collision event liu et al 2021b the value of γ can be further described by boltzmann distribution law via considering the effects of hydrodynamics drag interaction colloid surface interaction as well as concentration polarization cp on colloidal deposition liu et al 2018 see supporting information s1 for details 2 γ 1 1 exp δ e b k b t δ e d k b t j k m where kb is the boltzmann s constant and t is absolute temperature δeb is the energy barrier due to colloid membrane interaction defending foulant attachment the value of which is determined according to the modification of f m to f f interaction see section 2 2 for details the term δed stands for the hydrodynamic drag interaction promoting colloidal attachment and δed can be linked to the permeate flux through stokes equation as liu et al 2021b 3 δ e d 3 π μ d p j l d β j where μ is the feed viscosity and dp is the colloidal size ld is the relative displacement of colloid under drag force with β the permeate drag coefficient in eq 2 the term j km accounts for the role of cp i e the relative ratio of forward transport j over backward diffusion km with km the mass transfer coefficient in practice km is often estimated based on brownian diffusion coefficient d porter 1972 and the fluid channel geometry hoek et al 2002 for a typical spacer filled channel in crossflow filtration km can be given by liu et al 2021b 4 k m 0 2 u 0 57 ρ 0 17 d 0 6 μ 0 17 d h 0 43 where u is the crossflow velocity and ρ is the fluid density the term dh is the hydrodynamic diameter of the membrane channel the value of which can be calculated according to the spacer geometry liu et al 2021b overall the terms δeb kbt δed kbt and j km in eq 2 incorporate the effects of energy barrier permeate drag and cp respectively greater j gives rise to higher γ as a result of the raised drag and cp whereas smaller γ appears at larger δeb due to the enhanced colloid membrane repulsion 2 2 colloid surface interaction as illustrated in fig 1 when colloidal particles approach the membrane surface the energy barrier δeb arising from foulant membrane interaction will resist their deposition and those who overcome the energy barrier can successfully attach onto the membrane the value of δeb is determined by adopting a weighted average of f m energy barrier ef m and f f energy barrier ef f liu et al 2020 5 δ e b 1 ω e f m ω e f f where ω is the coverage coefficient to quantify the influence of deposited foulant and can be given by 6 ω n a n c m f m c 0 ω 1 where na is the amount of colloidal particle number at time t

potential and contact angle see supporting information s2 for details 2 3 permeate flux equation the foulant deposition can also modify the membrane flux under constant applied pressure for any given time the water flux can be determined according to membrane filtration equation hong and elimelech 1997 liu et al 2020 9 j δ p μ r m α f m f where δp rm and mf are the operating pressure the membrane intrinsic resistance and the mass of foulant deposition respectively it is worthwhile to note that since pore blocking is not involved in nf ro only cake filtration is the main behavior of colloidal fouling in our study in this case the cake resistance rf can be generally given by the product of the specific cake resistance αf and the amount of foulant mass deposition mf see eq 9 the value of αf can be determined through carmen kozeny equation carman 1997 or cake layer model tang et al 2007 in this work a referenced αf of 3 0 1013 m g is adopted for simulation based on our previous report liu et al 2018 the models in sections 2 1 2 3 provide a facile way to investigate the critical roles of water flux energy barrier of colloid membrane interaction and colloidal and membrane properties zeta potential ζ and contact angle θ on colloidal fouling the detailed algorithm procedures are given in supporting information s3 and model verifications indicate that the ca predicted water fluxes are in well agreement with the experimental results for colloidal fouling of nf membranes refer to supporting information s4 for details 3 results and discussion 3 1 role of initial water flux it has been well recognized that the critical flux jc is affected by f m energy barrier ef m while the limiting flux jl is dominated by f f energy barrier ef f liu et al 2020 tang and leckie 2007 to comprehensively understand the relationship between jc jl and metastable and long term stable fluxes we investigate the role of initial flux j 0 on colloidal stability under the conditions where ef m equal to less than and greater than ef f with the main simulation parameters listed in table 1 at ef m ef f 12 0 kbt fig 2 a clearly shows that obvious flux decline occurs at great initial flux j 0 50 μm s whereas water flux is still stable over the entire 100 h duration when j 0 40 μm s therefore the value of limiting flux is between 40 and 50 μm s a further close observation of the final pseudo stable flux value for j 0 50 μm s in fig 2a suggests that the limiting flux should be around 45 μm s such fouling phenomena fit the limiting flux theory tang and leckie 2007 that permeate flux above jl eventually approaches the jl value an estimated jl of around 45 μm s in fig 2a at the same time our results also conform to the critical flux theory field et al 1995 no fouling can be observed when initial flux below a critical value as a result of the identical ef m and ef f the jc and jl share the same value accordingly essentially the critical and limiting fluxes can be recognized as water flux corresponding to the negligible fouling rate under constant energy barrier ef m ef f fig 2b clearly shows an increasing j 0 from 10 to 70 μm s results in an elevated initial dmf dt by orders of magnitude i e from 10 9 to 10 5 g m2s reflecting the combined influences of increased collision frequency eq 1 enhanced cp and elevated attachment efficiency eq 2 over the entire 100 h filtration a gradually decreased rate of fouling occurs for high j 0 50 μm s whilst dmf dt remains constant at j 0 40 μm s with the latter corresponding to the sub critical limiting fluxes fig 2a in view of critical limiting flux being about 45 μm s in this set the threshold dmf dt i e the critical fouling rate below which little no fouling happens in this study should be in the range of about 2 5 10 7 g m2s the value of which is comparable to our previous report liu et al 2018 keeping ef m at 12 0 kbt but increasing ef f to 14 0 kbt brings about negligible flux declines during the whole 100 h filtration for j 0 of 50 and 60 μm s in addition to j 0 40 μm s fig 2c the values of the former are above the critical flux the jc value should also be approximately 45 μm s due to the fixed ef m although such results seem to be counterintuitive they can be reasonably interpreted by the evolutions of fouling rate and energy barrier as shown in fig 2d despite that the fouling rates for j 0 50 and 60 μm s are above the threshold dmf dt in the initial stage their values become less than the threshold value only after a couple of hours ensuring a relatively stable flux over the long term filtration duration indeed the initial attached colloidal particles can modify the membrane surface tending to a highly repulsive ef f fig s2a of supporting information s5 and thus lowering fouling rate substantially eventually resulting in a self terminated fouling behavior even for the case of ef m 0 supporting information s6 our modeling supports the experimental observation wang and tang 2011a that for filtration of positively charged lysozyme by a negatively charged nf membrane water flux can maintain a long term stable state after initial slight loss thanks to the strongly repulsive f f interaction a much severe fouling happens at fixed ef m 12 0 kbt but lowered ef f 7 0 kbt fig 2e at the end of 100 h filtration all the fluxes for j 0 20 μm s tend to a relatively low stable flux 15 μm s due to the weak f f interaction revealing the limiting flux at such level our simulations underpin the previous reports tang et al 2009 tang and leckie 2007 the long term fouling is highly governed by f f interaction nevertheless owing to the strong f m repulsion there exists an initial metastable flux with extended metastable period tmp at decreased j 0 specifically rapid flux loss without metastable period is observed for high j 0 above 50 μm s decreasing j 0 from 40 to 20 μm s can effectively prolong the tmp from only a couple of hours to over 40 h while for a low j 0 of 10 μm s the water flux remains stable without any obvious decline in the entire 100 h filtration by comparison with the values of critical flux jc 45 μm s and limiting flux 10 μm s jl 15 μm s the metastable flux seems to be sub critical flux but super limiting flux despite being at sub critical flux state the substantial and continued flux declines occurs in the latter fouling period which is against the typical critical flux theory that little fouling occurs when operational flux below a critical value bacchin et al 2006 nevertheless it can be rationally explained by the fouling transition of colloid surface interaction briefly the conditioning of the membrane surface with initial attached particles will lower the energy barrier from relatively high ef m toward weak ef f fig s2b of supporting information s5 serving as seeds for further foulant attachment similar to the traditional nucleation to crystallization process le gouellec and elimelech 2002 lin et al 2005 hence although a high ef m at sub critical flux j 0 20 40 μm s indicates an excellent antifouling ability with negligible dmf dt below threshold value the nucleus effect of the deposited colloidal particles results in the accelerated rise of the fouling rate above threshold value fig 2f eventually leading to the remarkable decline of water flux fig 2e after the completion of transition from ef m to ef f the subsequent fouling rate begin to decline due to the decreased permeate drag at weak f f domination simulation results in fig 2a f reveal that the role of initial flux is greatly affected by f m and f f interactions according to the relative magnitudes of ef m and ef f the role of j 0 on stable flux can be summarized as the following three cases ef m ef f see fig 3 a in the ideal condition that the energy barriers of f m and f f have the identical magnitude the value of critical flux jc is equal to that of limiting flux jl when j 0 is below jc or jl no flux decline occurs for long term filtration for j 0 above jc or jl the long term stable flux value approaches the critical limiting flux ef m ef f see fig 3b in this case the critical flux jc is less than the limiting flux jl when j 0 j l flux for long term filtration remains stable with negligible fouling even at j 0 above j c thanks to the conditioning of membrane surface by highly repulsive f f interaction while for j 0 jl flux decline happens and the long term stable flux value achieves to jl ef m ef f see fig 3c and d when the repulsion of f m is greater than that of f f the value of jc is above jl at j 0 jl no flux reduction appears with j 0 value as the long term stable flux when j 0 above jl but below jc the metastable flux yellow curve in fig 3c appears as a result of high f m repulsion and its upper and lower limit are critical flux and limiting flux respectively the metastable flux period lasts longer at lower j 0 with a barely noticeable period at j 0 jc but infinite period at j 0 jl fig 3d nevertheless owing to the seed effect of the initial attached foulant the water flux will decrease to jl value as the long term stable flux the green curve in fig 3c while for j 0 over jc water flux drops at the beginning of the filtration and eventually approaches jl for long term filtration 3 2 role of membrane properties fouling can be greatly affected by membrane properties due to their important roles on foulant membrane interaction hoek et al 2003 shan et al 2016 wang et al 2019 for example membranes with more hydrophilic surface generally exhibit better antifouling ability thanks to the suppressed f m hydrophobic attraction shan et al 2016 to cater for the practical application we dissect the crucial influence of membrane contact angle θm standing for membrane hydrophilicity on colloidal stability at a long filtration time of 200 h all the flux curves collapse to nearly the same pseudo stable value see insert of fig 4 a echoing the limiting flux independent of membrane properties despite that our simulations clearly indicate that the initial flux behavior is highly dependent on membrane contact angle with an initial flux of 20 μm s an extended metastable duration tmp happens for membrane with smaller θm specifically the metastable flux period is barely noticeable for θm 60 while the tmp can effectively be prolonged to 5 0 and 55 h by decreasing θm to 56 and 55 thanks to the enhanced hydrated repulsion of f m at reduced θm fig 4c our simulations are consistent with the existing experimental observation of much longer stable flux period 60 h for a super hydrophilic membrane compared to the shorter metastable duration 1 h for other less hydrophilic or more hydrophobic membranes shan et al 2016 fig 4b plots the evolution of particle deposition over time in the initial filtration period a slower foulant accumulation appears at lower contact angle as a result of smaller attachment efficiency eq 2 arising from stronger f m repulsion fig 4c for each given θm the number of deposited particles per square micrometer μm2 appears to be linearly dependent on filtration time on log scale which is attributed to the nearly constant energy barrier in metastable duration fig 4c however once the initial deposited particles achieve a threshold amount rapid foulant deposition happens accompanied by remarkable barrier shifting from f m to f f fig 4c indeed despite the initial particle deposition behaviors present distinct for membrane with different θm their later fouling features are tending to the identical f f dominated behavior pink curve in fig 4b fig 4d further describes the effects of θm on stable flux briefly the limiting flux value jl is constant regardless of membrane properties with the green shading i e the sub limiting fluxes standing for the long term stable flux region while the critical flux jc is strongly dependent on membrane θm with higher jc obtained at lower θm an interesting observation in fig 4d is that there seems to be a threshold θm around 56 a slight decrease of θm by only several degrees can elevate jc by more than one order of magnitudes accompanied by the extremely expanding range of metastable fluxes yellow shading in fig 4d meanwhile the metastable period tmp is also greatly extended fig 4e for example the tmp for j 0 of 20 μm s is 1 0 h when θm at 56 5 whereas it sharply increases 1000 times i e 1000 h when θm decrease to 53 7 δθm 3 0 our results highlight the importance of tuning membrane contact angle below the threshold value for powerfully retarding fouling via raising the critical flux value and prolonging the metastable flux period effectively similarly the membrane zeta potential ζm also plays an important role on colloidal stability where the larger critical flux and longer metastable period occur at decreased ζm with more negative charges refer to supporting information s8 for details this result echoes a recent report wang et al 2019 that more salient metastable flux period appears at increased application of external voltage thanks to the strengthened electrostatic repulsion of f m 3 3 role of colloidal properties like membrane properties colloidal properties are equally important for fouling through the alteration of colloid surface interaction liu et al 2021a tang et al 2011 as a typical example rapid flux drops appeared at ph near the isoelectric point high ionic strength or high calcium ion which is attributed to the suppressed f m or f f electrostatic repulsion tang et al 2011 2009 to better understand the vital influence of electrostatic interaction fig 5 a investigates the effect of colloidal zeta potential on fouling development unlike the negligible influence of membrane properties on long term fouling performance fig 4a the colloidal zeta potential ζf is critical for fouling process from the beginning to the end fig 5a as shown in fig 5a flux decline is much milder over the entire filtration for foulant with more negative ζf which is ascribed to their stronger f m and f f electrostatic repulsion fig 5b specifically rapid flux declines without metastable period occur for colloid with slightly negative zeta potential i e ζf 10 and 20 mv decreasing ζf to 35 mv with more negative charge gives rise to a remarkable metastable flux period tmp 20 h followed by mild flux loss as a result of the strengthened repulsion fig 5b and thus reduced attachment probability eq 2 further reducing ζf to 40 mv leads to even long term stable flux without obvious fouling thanks to the domination of great energy barrier over the entire 100 h filtration 12 kbt fig 5b to fully disclose the key role of colloidal charge fig 5c draws the critical limiting metastable and long term stable fluxes as a function of ζf overall a decreasing ζf from 10 to 40 mv with increasing negative charges leads to notably raised critical flux jc and limiting flux jl i e from around 0 1 to several dozen μm s accordingly the metastable flux values also go up more than two orders of magnitude yellow shading in fig 5c at the same time the metastable period tmp becomes longer when ζf decreases from 30 to 40 mv at j 0 of 20 μm s fig 5d more importantly like the membrane contact angle there also exists a threshold colloidal ζf around 35 mv in which a little bit reduction of ζf leads to orders of magnitude extension of metastable period tmp in addition to ζf the colloidal contact angle θf also has significant influence on colloidal fouling with less severe flux declines and longer metastable period occurring at decreased θf owing to the suppressed acid base repulsion of colloid membrane refer to supporting information s9 for details 3 4 interplay of flux and energy section 3 1 investigates the role of initial flux on colloidal fouling while sections 3 2 and 3 3 dissect the effects of membrane and colloidal properties through their importance on f m and f f interaction to achieve a comprehensive understanding of colloidal stability the interplay of initial flux j 0 and energy barrier i e ef m and ef f is further examined in this section we first define an initial threshold energy barrier eith i e the critical energy barrier above which fouling is negligible for each given j 0 we then assess the joint role of flux energy through comparing the magnitudes of eith to ef m and ef f or j 0 to jc and jl by adopting a threshold dmf dt of 3 10 7 g m2s fig 6 a plots the curve of j 0 vs eith as expected a higher j 0 requires a larger eith to lower attachment efficiency for avoiding fouling effectively for instance the value of eith is 8 6 11 4 and 13 9 kbt for j 0 of 20 40 and 60 μm s respectively based on the relative magnitudes of eith ef m and ef f the relations of critical limiting fluxes to metastable and long term stable fluxes are as follows fig 6b c ø long term stable flux region at eith ef f see green shading at j 0 jl owing to the self terminated fouling behavior for more repulsive f f compared to eith little fouling happens and membrane flux remains constant over a long term filtration even for the case of j 0 jc ø unstable flux region at eith ef f eith ef m see red shading at j 0 jl j 0 jc since both barriers of f m and f f are too weak to effectively resist particle deposition obvious flux decline happens at the beginning of filtration which is more severe at higher j 0 or lower ef m or lower ef f marked by deeper red ø metastable flux region at ef f eith ef m see yellow shading at jl j 0 jc in this region the initial water flux can maintain stable due to the great ef m eith with longer metastable period appearing at smaller j 0 or greater ef m or greater ef f indicated by deeper yellow while the nuclear effect of the deposited particles leads to the rapid flux decline in the subsequent filtration by reducing the energy barrier towards weak ef f eith eventually the metastable flux degenerates to jl as stable flux over the long term filtration furthermore fig 7 a provides more details for the joint effects of j 0 and ef m on metastable flux period tmp for each given j 0 there seems to be a nearly linear increase of tmp on ef m at a log scale with similar slopes for various j 0 see the theoretical basis in supporting information s7 for each fixed ef m increased j 0 results in decreased metastable period obviously however when the energy difference between ef m and eith as the horizontal coordinate the role of initial flux becomes less discernible fig 7b suggesting that the underlying factor in governing metastable period is the surplus of ef m over eith 4 conclusion and implications for the first time this work systematically investigates the relations of critical flux jc and limiting flux jl to metastable and long term stable fluxes through a ca approach our simulations highlight the crucial roles of initial flux j 0 f m energy barrier ef m and f f energy barrier ef f on colloidal stability when j 0 jl the water flux remains stable over a long time even for the case of j 0 over jc thanks to the more repulsive ef f compared to initial threshold energy barrier eith i e the critical energy barrier above which no little fouling occurs for each given j 0 at j 0 jl j 0 jc water flux is unstable at the beginning of filtration owing to both weak ef m eith and ef f eith and the flux ultimately lowers to jl as the long term stable flux under the condition of jl j 0 jc an initial metastable flux appears due to the high ef m eith with barely noticeable metastable period at j 0 jc but infinite period at j 0 decreasing to jl furthermore the metastable period can also be greatly prolonged at decreased contact angle or zeta potential of membrane or foulant nevertheless rapid flux decline occurs subsequently owing to the energy barrier shifting to weak ef f eith and the metastable flux eventually degenerates to jl as the long term stable flux our results have significant implications for regulating operational conditions when adopting critical flux jc and limiting flux jl as fouling control strategies one needs to distinguish the short term stable i e metastable and long term stable flux the long term stable flux is independent of critical flux but dependent on limiting flux whereas the metastable flux is dependent on both critical flux and limiting flux sub critical flux operation may lead to a short term stable flux if j 0 above jl owing to the seed effect of the initial deposited foulants to ensure a long term stable flux the operational flux j 0 should be below jl in real application the operating flux selection is highly dependent on energy barriers of f m and f f in the context of ef m ef f controlling water flux below critical limiting flux should be a great guide for fouling control while at high ef m but low ef f critical flux should be adopted as the upper bound of operating flux for fouling control for the case of small ef m but great ef f limiting flux jl should be applied as the upper limit of operation flux for fouling control since unstable flux happens at water flux over both critical flux and limiting flux high operating flux j 0 above jc and jl should be strictly avoided due to the great permeate drag that promotes severe fouling which can significantly affect membrane operational stability however excessive pursuit of low flux j 0 jc or j 0 jl is also not recommended as lowered water production means increased investment and operational cost due to the trade off effect between metastable flux value and its period fig 3d moderate flux is often adopted e g 12 45 l m 2 h 1 for brackish water treatment in practice greenlee et al 2009 besides operating flux selection should also consider the types of membrane module in real application for typical nf ro spiral wound module applied in desalination or water reuse owing to the difficult membrane cleaning a relatively lower j 0 is favored to achieve longer metastable duration while for hollow fiber membranes or flat sheet membranes with effectively cleaning a relatively larger j 0 still below jc within tolerable cleaning frequency can be implemented to obtain more productive water modeling results also have important guidelines for membrane preparation and feedwater adjustment for coping with unfavorable feed small ef f and low jl values the design of membranes with more hydrophilic or more charged is fundamentally essential for achieving higher critical flux and longer metastable period see fig 4 and supporting information s8 furthermore membrane selection should be in accordance with the anticipated operating flux j 0 or a demand water production as suggested in fig 7 the underlying factor in governing metastable flux period is the surplus of f m energy barrier ef m over the initial threshold energy barrier eith i e the critical energy barrier above which fouling is negligible for each given j 0 therefore the ef m value for selected nf ro membranes should be far more than eith to achieve a relatively long metastable period however it should be clearly aware that even the excellent antifouling membrane may fail due to the energy barrier shifting to weak repulsive f f considering the great influences of colloidal properties on both ef m and ef f pretreatment problematic feedwater e g via coagulation wang et al 2020 adsorption zhang et al 2023 and oxidation zhang et al 2022 may be an effective way to reduce fouling for long term filtration as enlightened from fig 5 and supporting information s9 adjusting contact angle and zeta potential of colloids in accordance with the threshold value is able to resist fouling powerfully through effectively raising the jc and jl values more importantly a high jl can ensure a high value of long term stable flux due to the self terminated fouling behavior even for poor antifouling membranes supporting information s6 traditionally flux pressure experimental observations fradin and field 1999 wu et al 1999 were adopted to determine a steady state flux i e critical flux however the duration of the fouling test using this method was often performed within a couple of hours e g 2 h and thus the obtained pseudo stable flux may not maintain over a long time filtration owing to the fouling shifting from high ef m to low ef f repulsion compared to the flux pressure measurements the ca approach developed herein provides a facile approach for not only determining the value of stable flux i e jc and jl but also predicting the period of metastable flux declaration of competing interest the
