1530,the widespread presence of entrapped dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl in the subsurface poses a continuing challenge to groundwater remediation cost effective and high resolution subsurface characterization is a critical issue for further dnapl recovery due to the complexity of dnapl source zone architecture sza geophysical techniques provide a noninvasive spatially continuous and cost effective way for monitoring the dnapl remediation process in particular the spectral induced polarization sip method has shown great potential in environmental problems in this study we performed real time sip measurements on dnapl contaminated soil in columns to quantitatively assess the ability of sip method for monitoring surfactant enhanced dnapl remediation process chemical data was simultaneously collected during the remediation process to verify the results obtained by sip method taking account into the variations of subsurface environment we conducted a series of column flushing experiments under different flow rate surfactant concentrations and fluid salinities the results highlight that sip method is able to effectively monitor the dnapl remediation process as well as to evaluate the remediation efficiency under different conditions the variations in the flow rate the concentration of surfactant and the salinity of pore water not only affect remediation effectiveness but also have an impact on the sip signatures this study shows that sip performs better for monitoring dnapl remediation at a relatively low flow rate of 0 4 m d low surfactant concentration of 5000 mg l and high salinity of 1 0 s m with an error of saturation estimation rmse s 0 1 keywords spectral induced polarization dnapl surfactant enhanced remediation groundwater hydrogeophysics 1 introduction contamination of soils and groundwater system by dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl such as trichloroethylene tce and tetrachloroethylene pce is considered as a common environmental problem essaid et al 2015 pankow and cherry 1996 after release into the subsurface dnapl can migrate rapidly through the water table and saturated zone under the influence of gravity until trapped along the pathways or reaching a low permeable layer mackay and cherry 1989 pankow and cherry 1996 due to their toxicity nature the entrapped dnapl in subsurface will become an enormous threat for drinking water and human health consequently the remediation of dnapl contaminated sites is urgently required successful implementation of remediation strategies relies on the high resolution characterization of the dnapl contaminated sites chambers et al 2010 kavanaugh and rao 2003 although traditional site investigations like borehole sampling could offer precise measurements of groundwater and soil samples they can only provide discrete information in vertical profiles and probably expand the contamination zone through the intrusive drilling griffin and watson 2002 peter et al 2008 in order to overcome the limitations of the traditional methods geophysical techniques are emerging as promising tools for dnapl detection noel et al 2016 sparrenbom et al 2017 tildy et al 2017 these non invasive methods will not damage the contaminated site or cause secondary contamination during geophysical surveys due to its sensitivity to the water content chemistry of pore water and pore geometry the spectral induced polarization sip method has shown great potential in environmental problems breede and kemna 2012 koch et al 2011 lesmes and frye 2001 since 1980s sip has been used to recognize oil contamination in soils vanhala 1997 vinegar and waxman 1984 a large number of laboratory results have verified the feasibility of sip method for monitoring dnapl contamination schmutz et al 2012 schwartz and furman 2012 however there are only few studies on the application of sip method to characterize and monitor dnapl remediation process previous works have shown that biogeochemical processes including microbial growth chi et al 2014 davis et al 2006 microbial mineral transformations personna et al 2015 slater et al 2007 and mineral dissolution placencia gómez et al 2013 can arouse significant sip responses therefore electrical methods in particular sip method are increasingly applied in the study of dnapl biodegradation process aal et al 2006 cassidy et al 2001 mellage et al 2018b heenan et al 2013 performed an investigation showing the sensitivity of sip method to microbial enhanced oil recovery processes their study reported an obvious increase in the magnitude of phase and imaginary conductivity a few researchers have also tried to explore the applicability of sip method in monitoring the chemical remediation process of organic contaminants including chemical oxidation and zerovalent iron remediation flores orozco et al 2015 hort et al 2014 qualitative evaluations reveal that sip method is able to track the temporal changes of complex conductivity during dnapl remediation process e g heenan et al 2013 however it is unable to quantify the performance of sip method for monitoring dnapl remediation therefore it is necessary to develop quantitative assessment of sip method for characterizing dnapl remediation process numerous studies have shown that the addition of surfactants in flushing solution can significantly enhance the apparent solubility of dnapl thereby improving its remediation efficiency paria 2008 trellu et al 2016 compared to bioremediation technique surfactant enhanced remediation has been one of the most widely used techniques for its high efficiency and cost effectiveness mao et al 2015 in this study we use sip method as the tool to monitor the surfactant enhanced dnapl remediation process the remediation effectiveness for dnapl contaminant have been demonstrated to be affected by the surfactant concentration flow rate and ionic strength kim et al 2005 malliaris et al 1986 these factors probably also have an influence on the sip performance for monitoring dnapl remediation process we thus conducted a series of column flushing experiments on dnapl contaminated soil with consideration of flow rate surfactant concentration and fluid salinity both spectral complex conductivity and dissolved contaminant concentration data were collected during the remediation process by comparing the dnapl saturation and remediation efficiency estimated by sip and chemical methods we aim to quantitatively evaluate the ability of sip method for characterizing dnapl remediation process under different conditions the work of this paper will provide a new monitoring method for field remediation professionals not only limited to chemical remediation 2 spectral induced polarization the spectral induced polarization sip method has been demonstrated to be sensitive to the changes of physical and chemical properties in pore scale such as pore geometry johansson et al 2019 pore fluid chemistry lesmes and frye 2001 revil and skold 2011 schwartz et al 2014 and interface chemistry mellage et al 2018a which may be a potential tool for the evaluation of remediation techniques the sip measurements are generally carried out using a four electrode configuration two of electrodes are used for current injection and another two are served as potential electrodes the measurements are repeated over a range of frequencies as a result the spectral impedance magnitude σ and phase shift φ between injected current and received potential are obtained the measured sip response is generally expressed as complex conductivity σ consisting of in phase conductivity σ and imaginary conductivity σ vinegar and waxman 1984 1 σ σ exp iφ σ i σ where i 1 σ represents the conduction term electromigration and σ represents the reversible energy storage term charge polarization the presence of oil contaminant in soil is found to have significant influence on its sip responses schmutz et al 2010 schwartz et al 2012 vanhala 1997 for the unsaturated soil where pore space filling with multiphase fluids e g water and oil both in phase and imaginary conductivities were shown a power law dependency on water saturation 0 s w 1 this power law relationship can be expressed as revil 2013 vinegar and waxman 1984 2 σ 1 f s w n σ w s w n 1 σ s 3 σ σ s w 1 0 s w p where f is the formation factor s w is the water saturation in pores n is the saturation exponent for in phase conductivity σ w is the pore water conductivity σ s is the surface conductivity σ s w 1 0 denotes the imaginary conductivity in fully water saturated condition p is the saturation exponent for imaginary conductivity in order to provide a quantitative evaluation of the sip method for monitoring remediation process eqs 2 and 3 are used in this study to predict the dnapl saturations from sip measurements 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials the soil used in this study was extracted from xinjiang china 85 34 e 44 54 n its physicochemical properties are provided in table 1 the cation exchange capacity cec measurement was obtained with the hexamminecobalt trichloride solution spectrophotometric method as suggested in the environmental protection standards of the people s republic of china hj 889 2017 the soil organic matter som percentage was determined by multiplying the organic carbon concentration by a constant factor 1 724 tabatabai 1996 the organic carbon concentration of this soil was acquired by an element analyzer variomacro chns germany zhang et al 2018 the soil composition was performed using the x ray fluorescence system xrf arl 9800 switzerland the specific surface area data was obtained by the automatic static chemical absorber asap 2020 hd88 micromeritics trichloroethylene tce a representative of the typical hydrocarbon contaminant was chosen in this study which is commonly existing in organic contaminated sites rothmel et al 1998 since tce is carcinogenic to human beings it should be cautioned with the uses of tce in laboratory experiments as remediation agent we used the nonionic surfactant tween 80 an effective surfactant for the remediation of contaminated soil cheng et al 2017 pennell et al 1993 surfactant refers to a heterogeneous long chain molecule including hydrophilic group head group which tends to enter into aqueous phase and hydrophobic group tail group which prefers to combine with soil or contaminant e g dnapl at low concentration surfactant existing in the solution is in the form of monomers with the increase of surfactant concentration the micelles begin to form above a certain critical value this specific surfactant concentration is called critical micelle concentration cmc vishnyakov et al 2013 these micelles could easily disperse the contaminant and remarkably improve its solubility in aqueous phase tween 80 was selected in this study for the following two reasons for one thing it is of strong solubilization capacity and little toxicity on soil microorganisms fernando bautista et al 2009 yang et al 2010 for another thing as a nonionic surfactant it hardly ionizes in water mao et al 2015 thus it should not interfere with the sip measurements during surfactant enhanced remediation of contaminated soil the fluids properties are also summarized in table 1 3 2 experimental column set up the experimental column was constructed from a polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe tube which features excellent chemical stability corrosion resistance and electric insulation it had an inner diameter of 30 mm length of 230 mm and wall thickness of 3 mm fig 1 two stainless steel filters with a pore diameter of 0 074 mm were placed at both ends of the column avoiding the loss of soil with outflow as well as serving as the current electrodes the column was instrumented with two lateral ports for potential electrode emplacement 60 mm apart in order to reduce the polarization error the distance between the current electrode and potential electrode is expected to be at least twice the sample width zimmermann et al 2008 as a result the potential electrode was placed 85 mm from the current electrode the column was sealed at either end by the ptfe caps 3 3 column flushing experiments the column was wet packed with soil to ensure the sample fully water saturated specifically the column was filled by stepwise adding a few mm of solution followed by a small amount of soil and then using a rubber hammer to achieve a compact pack a water surface was always kept above the soil during the whole compaction this step was repeated until the entire column was filled after packing the column was flushed for 10 pore volume pvs with background solution at a constant flux to achieve the equilibrium for further experiment as a result the measured electrical conductivity ec of collected effluent samples showed essentially unchangeable after 10 pvs fig 1 ① after pre flush the columns were residually saturated with tce following the experimental methodology of powers et al 1992 and park and bielefeldt 2005 this experimental methodology was developed to obtain a homogeneous distribution of tce in column the dyed tce was injected into the bottom of the column at a rate of 0 4 ml min using a harvard apparatus syringe pump sigma aldrich corp st louis missouri usa this upward mode was applied for a relatively stable displacement kueper and frind 1988 tce was injected until it came out from the top cap this step was to displace the water in pores and saturate with tce fig 1 ② next the background solution was pumped into the top of the column at 4 ml min to displace the mobile tce and obtain a minimum residual tce saturation the solution was continuously pumped until tce was no longer flushed out meanwhile the effluent was collected from the bottom to calculate the volume of displaced tce the volume of residual tce in column was obtained by making a difference of volume between tce injected and tce displaced fig 1 ③ after tce injection the contaminated column was subjected to a long term flush of surfactant solution effluent samples were taken at intervals using an automatic collector these effluent samples were collected for ec and tce concentration measurements fig 1 ④ approximately 20 30 pore volumes of surfactant flushing were required for the remediation process properties of the column flushing experiments are summarized in table 2 3 4 control column control columns were also performed to separate the influence of surfactant on sip signature the preparations of control columns were identical to the columns that used in the column flushing experiments but were not contaminated with tce after pre flushing of the columns same surfactant solutions used in the columns contaminated with tce were pumped through the control columns effluent samples were analyzed for ec measurements properties of the control columns are summarized in table s1 in the supplementary data 3 5 spectral induced polarization measurements sip measurements were made with a four electrode configuration using a portable spectral induced polarization psip unit ontash ermac inc nj u s a two current electrodes made of stainless steel filter mesh were placed at either end of the column allowing for a homogeneous current distribution across the whole sample two custom made ag agcl potential electrodes were encased in a ptfe tube with a diameter of 5 mm and length of 100 mm consisting of a silver stick with a diameter of 1 5 mm and 15 g l agar gel containing 1 m kcl the phase shift and impedance were measured at 40 frequency intervals between 0 01 hz 20 khz the geometric factor of the column set up k m 1 was determined by k l a where l was the distance between the two potential electrodes in m a in m2 denoted the surface area of the cross section of the column the calculated geometrical factor was 84 88 m 1 in this study the accuracy and the stability of this sip measurement system was verified by conducting two duplicate column tests and measuring the complex conductivity on a salted water 0 1 s m nacl see fig s1 in the supplementary data the phase error was much smaller than 0 1 mrad within frequencies ranging from 0 01 hz to 100 hz the in phase conductivity is almost constant at the whole frequency range with an error smaller than 0 01 s m the phase and conductivity were found to be nearly invariant with time to provide a quantitative assessment for applying sip method to monitor dnapl remediation process the tce saturation remaining in the column needs to be obtained from sip measurements according to revil 2013 and vinegar and waxman 1984 the in phase and quadrature conductivity can be expressed as a function of water saturation eqs 2 and 3 in section 2 in order to predict the average water saturation remaining in the column the parameters including the formation factor f the surface conductivity σ s the in phase conductivity saturation exponent n and the quadrature conductivity saturation exponent p must be acquired for the experiment the formation factor f and the surface conductivity σ s were determined by measuring the in phase conductivity of fully water saturated samples with water salinities ranging from 0 01 s m to 10 s m the in phase conductivity data versus the pore water conductivities was then plotted the data were fitted with eq 2 to determine the values of f and σ s s w 1 0 the obtained f and σ s were 5 1023 and 0 005 s m respectively further the saturation exponents n and p were obtained by measuring the in phase and quadrature conductivities at varying water saturations fig 2 we followed similar experimental procedures as presented in section 3 3 to determine exponents n and p 1 the column was wet packed with natural soil and keep fully water saturated 2 the column was flushed for 10 pvs with background solution at a constant flux after that the initial in phase conductivity and phase were recorded by the sip measurement system 3 the dyed tce was injected from the bottom into the column at a rate of 0 4 ml min using a syringe pump this injection was not stopped until it came out from the top cap 4 the background solution was pumped from the top into column at 4 ml min to intermittently displace the mobile tce in pores the pump was stopped at intervals to control the volume of tce displaced allowing for the determinations of water saturations at different stages of tce displacement at each stage the displaced tce volume and the complex conductivity in phase conductivity and phase were measured the in phase conductivity and quadrature conductivity versus water saturation at the peak frequency was then plotted the values of n and p were determined by fitting the data 1 33 and 0 43 respectively it should be noted that we assumed the tce geometry and distribution within contaminated soil would not change during each temporary stop for sip measurements since the column was fully liquid saturated the tce average saturation s o remaining in the column should be s o 1 s w based on this established power law relationship concerning water saturation and complex conductivity the tce average saturation could be acquired from real time sip measurements 3 6 chemical measurements the collected effluent samples would be used for electrical conductivity ec and tce concentration measurements the ec values of effluent samples were measured by a conductivity meter it should be noted that the electrical conductivity here refers to the mobile fluid conductivity not bulk conductivity consisting of pore fluids and solid material fig 3 displays the temporal variations of ec during remediation process under different flushing conditions during the first 5 pore volumes a significant decreasing trend of ec is observed for all cases this decrease is due to the replacement of original pore water with the fresh surfactant solution in later time the ec values tends to be stable which indicates that the change of complex conductivity including in phase conductivity and phase during the remediation process was mainly caused by tce removal not by other factors like release of soil colloids to characterize the change of tce content in the column the effluent samples were analyzed with headspace gas chromatography hs gc teledyne tekmar ht3tm agilent 6890 n gc system u s a prior to effluent samples measurements a linear relationship between the peak area and the tce concentration was determined by measuring the peak areas of seven standard samples at known tce concentrations using hs gc analysis see fig s2 in the supplementary data based on this established linear relationship the tce concentration in effluent samples can be calculated by measuring its actual peak area the tce volume collected in the effluent samples was thus obtained by making a mathematical integration of measured tce concentration using matlab next the difference of tce volume between the injected and collected in the effluent samples was made this difference value represented the volume of tce remaining in the column finally the tce average saturation was determined by the ratio of tce volume remaining in the column to the pore volume of the soil fig 4 shows an example of the tce average saturation as a function of pore volumes the error bar indicates the uncertainties in saturation calculations the upper and lower bounder of the error bars present the maximum and minimum values of the calculated tce saturation respectively 3 7 data analysis to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the sip measurement system for monitoring dnapl contaminated soil remediation the root mean square error rmse was selected as an error index for data analysis it was used to characterize the difference of tce saturation and remediation efficiency between that estimated by sip method and that calculated by hs gc analysis 4 rmse s 1 n g i 1 n g s sip s hs gc 2 5 rmse r 1 n g i 1 n g r sip r hs gc 2 where rmse s denotes the rmse for tce saturation rmse r represents the rmse for remediation efficiency n g is the number of points s sip and s hs gc denote the estimated tce saturation from sip measurement and the measured tce saturation by hs gc analysis respectively r sip and r hs gc denote the estimated remediation efficiency from sip measurement and the measured remediation efficiency by hs gc analysis respectively 4 results since there was no significant change in in phase conductivity and phase with time in control columns the results of control columns were not shown here details can be seen in figs s3 s5 in the supplementary data these results indicated that the surfactant alone almost had no influence on the sip response during surfactant flushing in order to make it clear the organization of this part for each scenario was shown as follows first the chemical results in terms of tce average saturation and cumulative remediation efficiency during the surfactant flushing were presented this was followed by the temporal complex conductivity spectra measured during the tce remediation process next commonly used petrophysical relationships eqs 2 and 3 in this paper were applied to estimate the tce saturation and remediation efficiency from sip measurements these results were then compared with the chemical results to quantitatively evaluate the ability of sip method for long term monitoring of tce remediation and estimation of tce remediation efficiency 4 1 sip responses to tce removal under varying flow rate fig 5 presented the chemical results in terms of tce average saturation and cumulative remediation efficiency during the surfactant flushing under different flow rates the addition of surfactant has been proved to enhance the solubility of free phase tce in solution and improve the efficiency of remediation mao et al 2015 paria 2008 as a result the tce average saturation in the column decreased with time during the remediation process the overall remediation efficiency firstly decreased and then increased with the increase of the flow rate this was probably due to the competitive mechanism existing in the surfactant enhanced remediation for one thing as the flow rate increased there was more surfactant solution passing through the contaminated soil per unit time and the hydrodynamic shear stress increased as well this resulted in an enhancement of the solubility of tce in pore water for another thing under the condition of low flow rate surfactant solution was able to fully contact with the residual tce in the column resulting in a more thorough desorption of tce due to the joint influences of these two mechanisms the order of remediation efficiency under different flow rates was as follows 1 ml min 0 2 ml min 0 5 ml min the temporal complex conductivity spectra measured during the tce remediation process at different flow rates were presented in fig 6 compared to the uncontaminated soil the in phase conductivity decreased and the phase increased right after the addition of tce which were consistent with the results shown by schmutz et al 2010 the decrease in in phase conductivity was mainly caused by the replacement of conductive pore water with insulating contaminant free phase tce in pore space the mechanism for the increase in magnitude of phase perhaps are two fold for one as explained in the work of jougnot et al 2010 the presence of insulating fluid like tce here has an influence on the maxwell wagner polarization which can not be entirely negligible at low frequency where stern layer polarization occurs for another the membrane polarization which is also saturation dependent probably has a contribution to the effect of tce addition upon magnitude of phase schmutz et al 2010 during the continuous surfactant flushing the overall in phase conductivity increased and the phase decreased with time fig 7 to quantify the efficiency of sip method for characterizing the surfactant enhanced remediation process a comparison between the tce average saturation calculated from sip data and that measured by hs gc was drawn fig 8 the results showed that the tce average saturation estimated by sip method all decreased with time with an order of 0 5 ml min 0 2 ml min 1 0 ml min which were consistent with chemical results fig 8a and b when the flow rate was low 0 2 ml min the saturation trend estimated by the sip method was very close to the measured hs gc results with a minor error of 0 0200 rmse s as the flow rate increased the deviation between the estimated saturation and the measured saturation increased and rmse s was 0 15 the remediation efficiency of surfactant flushing was further calculated based on the estimated tce saturation as shown in fig 9 the trend of remediation efficiency estimated by sip method was in good agreement with the chemical data both sip and hs gc measurements showed a highest remediation efficiency at 1 0 ml min followed by 0 2 ml min and 0 5 ml min at low flow rate 0 2 ml min the difference between the remediation efficiency estimated by sip method and that by hs gc method was minimal with a rmse r of 5 2269 this difference increased to 83 5285 as the flow rate increased to 1 0 ml min 4 2 sip responses to tce removal under varying surfactant concentration the variation of tce saturation and cumulative remediation efficiency with time under different surfactant concentrations using hs gc was shown in fig 10 as surfactant concentration increased the efficiency for tce remediation enhanced accordingly compared with the concentration of 5000 mg l and 10 000 mg l the time for tce removal reduced substantially when the surfactant concentration was 20 000 mg l this was due to the fact that the surfactant could enhance the solubility of organic contaminant in water when the concentration was over its cmc value west and harwell 1992 in this experiment the surfactant concentration used was much higher than its cmc value 13 mg l see in table 1 which was 385 769 and 1538 times of the cmc value respectively thus with the increase of the surfactant concentration the solubility of tce in pore water increased and the remediation efficiency improved correspondingly the time variant in phase conductivity and phase spectra under different surfactant concentrations were displayed in fig s6 in the supplementary data based on the spectral responses the change of the in phase conductivity and the phase at peak frequency during the remediation process were drawn in fig 11 similarly the in phase conductivity increased with time while the phase decreased with time it should be noticed that the in phase conductivity only showed a slight increase with time under the condition of high surfactant concentration 20 000 mg l fig 12 showed the tce average saturation in the column as a function of time measured by sip and hs gc methods at different surfactant concentrations the average saturation of tce estimated by sip method exhibited a decreasing trend with time which was consistent with the hs gc measurement at surfactant concentration of 5000 mg l the average saturation estimated by sip method was the closest to hs gc results with a tiny deviation of 0 01 as the surfactant concentration increased from 5000 to 100 000 mg l the deviation between the sip and hs gc results increased with the rmse s increasing from 0 0200 to 0 2181 the cumulative remediation efficiency at varying surfactant concentration was shown in fig 13 compared with the high concentration case 20 000 mg l the remediation efficiency estimated by sip method was close to the hs gc measurements at the concentration of 5000 and 10 000 mg l and the rmse r were 5 2269 and 8 0228 respectively however at concentration of 20 000 mg l the efficiency estimated by sip method was significantly lower than hs gc results leading to a rmse r of 56 5462 4 3 sip responses to tce removal under varying fluid salinity the temporal variations of tce average saturation and remediation efficiency under different fluid salinities obtained by hs gc measurements were shown in fig 14 the results showed that the order of the remediation efficiency was as follows 1 0 s m 0 1 s m 0 05 s m as demonstrated in previous studies the addition of salt could enhance the solubility of organic contaminants in water paria 2008 with the increase of salt concentration the apparent solubility of organic contaminants increased correspondingly therefore as the salinity of surfactant solution increased from 0 05 s m to 1 0 s m the concentration of dissolved tce in pore water increased improving the efficiency for tce remediation the time variant complex conductivity responses to tce remediation under different salinities were shown in fig s7 in the supplementary data under the condition of low salinity 0 05 s m the phase spectrum showed significant peaks in low frequencies 1 10 hz as the fluid salinity increased the phase spectrum tended to be more smoothing with the frequency when the salinity increased to 1 0 s m the peak disappeared in the phase spectrum this phenomenon was also observed in previous works weller and slater 2012 the in phase conductivity and phase as a function of time were shown in fig 15 on the whole the in phase conductivity increased as salinity increased which indicated that the in phase conductivity mainly depended on the conductivity of the pore water in this case the magnitude of the phase displayed a decreasing trend with salinity which was consistent with most of the cases in practice joseph et al 2015 revil and skold 2011 it was inferred that the thickness of the diffusion layer was inversely proportional to the square root of salinity as the salinity increased the diffusion layer became thinner and thus the polarizability diminished hördt et al 2016 the comparison between the tce saturation estimated by sip method and that obtained by hs gc analysis under different fluid salinities was displayed in fig 16 the average saturation of tce in the column estimated by sip method was in an order as below 0 05 s m 0 1 s m 1 0 s m and decreased with time during continuous flushing which was in accordance with the chemical results as the salinity increased the difference between the saturation estimated by sip and that by hs gc decreased with the rmse s decreasing from 0 2029 to 0 0809 the remediation efficiency under varying salinities was further calculated with tce saturation as shown in fig 17 the sip results showed that the remediation for tce contaminant was most efficient at salinity of 1 0 s m followed by 0 1 s m and 0 05 s m this was in good agreement with the hs gc results however compared with the case of relatively high salinity 1 0 s m the estimated remediation efficiency at 0 05 s m deviated significantly from the chemical result with a rmse r of 31 8750 5 discussion 5 1 sip responses associated with tce remediation process chemical measurements showed that the mass of tce remaining in the columns was reduced due to the surfactant flushing the sip monitoring of the contaminated columns showed a strong response to the tce remediation process a continuous increase in in phase conductivity and decrease in phase were observed during ongoing tce remediation in contrast in the control columns without any tce the sip responses showed essentially no change during same surfactant flushing figs s3 s5 this suggested that the observed sip signatures in contaminated columns were related to the tce removal not the surfactant flushing as shown in previous works the in phase conductivity and phase were associated with the conduction and polarization of the electrical double layer edl at the grain water interface where the grain was coated by the continuous water film abdel aal and atekwana 2014 revil and florsch 2010 schmutz et al 2010 in this study the experiments were designed to investigate the remediation process of a residual tce within the water wetted porous media the distribution of water phase was thus supposed to be continuous during the remediation process thus it was suggested that the increase in in phase conductivity and decrease in phase was most likely explained by the edl conduction and polarization however the increase of water phase continuity might also have a contribution to the increase of in phase conductivity 5 2 effect of flow rate and fluid chemistry under the condition of varying flow rate surfactant concentrations and fluid salinity the efficiency for tce removal by surfactant enhanced remediation was different resulting in different sip responses while the sip measurements were able to characterize the difference of tce average saturation and remediation efficiency under different conditions the discrepancy between the sip and chemical results still exist as flow rate increased a general increase in the deviation of estimation of average tce saturation and remediation efficiency by sip method was observed with the rmse s and rmse r increased from 0 02 to 0 16 and 5 226 to 83 5 respectively since the control column showed essentially no change with time under different flow rates it should not be caused by the alteration of pore space geometry due to relatively large flow rate fig s3 in the supplementary data it was thus speculated that it would take longer time for the experimental system to reach a steady state for each sip measurement with increasing flow rate however in order to improve the efficiency of data acquisition the time for the system into a steady state was not considered in our experiments the sip measurements were performed right after each temporary stop of the surfactant flushing in this study this might be responsible for the increased deviation with increasing flow rate the sip performance was also affected by surfactant concentration the reported tce average saturation and remediation efficiency estimated from sip responses at 5000 mg l surfactant concentration exhibited a good agreement with the hs gc analysis while the estimations at 10 000 mg l and 20 000 mg l surfactant concentrations showed an increasing deviation from hs gc analysis the control experiments showed that there was essentially no change in sip signature with time at 10 000 mg l and 20 000 mg l during ongoing flushing fig s4 in the supplementary data studies by chieng et al 1995 and pérez et al 2002 showed that the size of droplet in pore water decreased with increasing surfactant concentration and the microemulsion was formed at a high concentration in the surfactant oil water system thus the formation of microemulsion at high surfactant concentration might had an effect on the sip responses changing the fluid salinity had an effect on the sip behavior as well with increase of fluid salinity the tce average saturation and remediation efficiency estimated from sip data set showed an increasing agreement with chemical results with rmse s decreasing from 0 2 to 0 08 argaud et al 1989 explored the salinity effect on the performance of commonly used conductivity models based on laboratory data their results suggested that all of the tested models fitted well with the data at high salinities however at low salinities when surface conductivity was dominant commonly used models had difficulty predicting the saturation without accounting for the geometrical effects of the surface conductor consequently salinity effects on the conductivity model we used might be responsible for the increasing deviations with decreasing fluid salinity 5 3 implications for monitoring long term organic contaminant remediation the sip method was able to monitor the tce remediation process by surfactant flushing and reflect remediation efficiency differences under variant conditions the reduction of tce induced continuous changes in the measured sip signals which were reflected in the temporal changes of the in phase conductivity and phase although the results presented here were associated with the surfactant enhanced remediation sip monitoring can also be extended to other chemical remediation techniques recent studies have demonstrated that sip technique is emerging as a potential tool for monitoring bioremediation heenan et al 2013 personna et al 2013 and zerovalent iron remediation flores orozco et al 2015 of organic contaminants our experiments were conducted in the laboratory however the encouraging results suggested that sip measurements might be feasible for tracking the remediation process and assessing remediation efficiency in field especially combining with other types of data such as hydrochemical data the works of flores orozco et al 2012 and orozco et al 2013 have evidenced the ability of field sip for delineating hydrocarbon contamination and uranium bioremediation it should be expected that the presented sip measurement protocol will be useful for the quantitative assessment of efficiency of remediation techniques and decision making for remediation professionals however limitations also exist in the application of sip method to field investigations environmental factors such as flow rate may have an impact on the sip measurements which probably result in the misjudgment of the remediation efficiency in order to provide a more accurate prediction additional study is required to determine how the environmental factors would affect the sip signatures 6 conclusions a series of column flushing experiments were conducted to assess the ability of sip method for monitoring dnapl remediation process to quantify the performance of sip method under different conditions sip data sets and chemical data were simultaneously collected during the remediation process the results suggest that the spectral induced polarization method can be used as a real time monitoring tool to spatially and temporally track the remediation process of dnapl by surfactant flushing as well as to estimate remediation efficiency during the continuous flushing the in phase conductivity increased with time while the phase decreased over time indicating a high sensitivity of sip signals to dnapl removal factors that affected the efficiency of surfactant enhanced remediation including flow rate surfactant concentration and fluid salinity also had an impact on sip measurements during remediation process as flow rate increased the average tce saturation estimated by sip method firstly increased then decreased and remediation efficiency firstly decreased then increased with flow rate which were in accordance with the results from hs gc the difference of results estimated from sip method and that from hs gc measurements increased with the increase of flow rate with the rmse s increasing from 0 02 to 0 16 the column flushing experiments also showed that the tce average saturation and remediation efficiency estimated by sip method were close to that calculated with hs gc method when the surfactant concentration was low as the surfactant concentration increased to 20 000 mg l the rmse s and rmse r increased to 0 22 and 56 55 respectively under different fluid salinities there was a fair agreement between the experimental results estimated from sip measurements and that obtained with hs gc analysis with the decrease of fluid salinity the deviation between the sip and hs gc results decreased as well with the rmse s decreasing from 0 20 to 0 08 our results demonstrate the great potential of the sip method to track the dnapl remediation process and predict remediation efficiency which provides an efficient tool for field remediation professionals to make remediation strategic

1530,the widespread presence of entrapped dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl in the subsurface poses a continuing challenge to groundwater remediation cost effective and high resolution subsurface characterization is a critical issue for further dnapl recovery due to the complexity of dnapl source zone architecture sza geophysical techniques provide a noninvasive spatially continuous and cost effective way for monitoring the dnapl remediation process in particular the spectral induced polarization sip method has shown great potential in environmental problems in this study we performed real time sip measurements on dnapl contaminated soil in columns to quantitatively assess the ability of sip method for monitoring surfactant enhanced dnapl remediation process chemical data was simultaneously collected during the remediation process to verify the results obtained by sip method taking account into the variations of subsurface environment we conducted a series of column flushing experiments under different flow rate surfactant concentrations and fluid salinities the results highlight that sip method is able to effectively monitor the dnapl remediation process as well as to evaluate the remediation efficiency under different conditions the variations in the flow rate the concentration of surfactant and the salinity of pore water not only affect remediation effectiveness but also have an impact on the sip signatures this study shows that sip performs better for monitoring dnapl remediation at a relatively low flow rate of 0 4 m d low surfactant concentration of 5000 mg l and high salinity of 1 0 s m with an error of saturation estimation rmse s 0 1 keywords spectral induced polarization dnapl surfactant enhanced remediation groundwater hydrogeophysics 1 introduction contamination of soils and groundwater system by dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl such as trichloroethylene tce and tetrachloroethylene pce is considered as a common environmental problem essaid et al 2015 pankow and cherry 1996 after release into the subsurface dnapl can migrate rapidly through the water table and saturated zone under the influence of gravity until trapped along the pathways or reaching a low permeable layer mackay and cherry 1989 pankow and cherry 1996 due to their toxicity nature the entrapped dnapl in subsurface will become an enormous threat for drinking water and human health consequently the remediation of dnapl contaminated sites is urgently required successful implementation of remediation strategies relies on the high resolution characterization of the dnapl contaminated sites chambers et al 2010 kavanaugh and rao 2003 although traditional site investigations like borehole sampling could offer precise measurements of groundwater and soil samples they can only provide discrete information in vertical profiles and probably expand the contamination zone through the intrusive drilling griffin and watson 2002 peter et al 2008 in order to overcome the limitations of the traditional methods geophysical techniques are emerging as promising tools for dnapl detection noel et al 2016 sparrenbom et al 2017 tildy et al 2017 these non invasive methods will not damage the contaminated site or cause secondary contamination during geophysical surveys due to its sensitivity to the water content chemistry of pore water and pore geometry the spectral induced polarization sip method has shown great potential in environmental problems breede and kemna 2012 koch et al 2011 lesmes and frye 2001 since 1980s sip has been used to recognize oil contamination in soils vanhala 1997 vinegar and waxman 1984 a large number of laboratory results have verified the feasibility of sip method for monitoring dnapl contamination schmutz et al 2012 schwartz and furman 2012 however there are only few studies on the application of sip method to characterize and monitor dnapl remediation process previous works have shown that biogeochemical processes including microbial growth chi et al 2014 davis et al 2006 microbial mineral transformations personna et al 2015 slater et al 2007 and mineral dissolution placencia gómez et al 2013 can arouse significant sip responses therefore electrical methods in particular sip method are increasingly applied in the study of dnapl biodegradation process aal et al 2006 cassidy et al 2001 mellage et al 2018b heenan et al 2013 performed an investigation showing the sensitivity of sip method to microbial enhanced oil recovery processes their study reported an obvious increase in the magnitude of phase and imaginary conductivity a few researchers have also tried to explore the applicability of sip method in monitoring the chemical remediation process of organic contaminants including chemical oxidation and zerovalent iron remediation flores orozco et al 2015 hort et al 2014 qualitative evaluations reveal that sip method is able to track the temporal changes of complex conductivity during dnapl remediation process e g heenan et al 2013 however it is unable to quantify the performance of sip method for monitoring dnapl remediation therefore it is necessary to develop quantitative assessment of sip method for characterizing dnapl remediation process numerous studies have shown that the addition of surfactants in flushing solution can significantly enhance the apparent solubility of dnapl thereby improving its remediation efficiency paria 2008 trellu et al 2016 compared to bioremediation technique surfactant enhanced remediation has been one of the most widely used techniques for its high efficiency and cost effectiveness mao et al 2015 in this study we use sip method as the tool to monitor the surfactant enhanced dnapl remediation process the remediation effectiveness for dnapl contaminant have been demonstrated to be affected by the surfactant concentration flow rate and ionic strength kim et al 2005 malliaris et al 1986 these factors probably also have an influence on the sip performance for monitoring dnapl remediation process we thus conducted a series of column flushing experiments on dnapl contaminated soil with consideration of flow rate surfactant concentration and fluid salinity both spectral complex conductivity and dissolved contaminant concentration data were collected during the remediation process by comparing the dnapl saturation and remediation efficiency estimated by sip and chemical methods we aim to quantitatively evaluate the ability of sip method for characterizing dnapl remediation process under different conditions the work of this paper will provide a new monitoring method for field remediation professionals not only limited to chemical remediation 2 spectral induced polarization the spectral induced polarization sip method has been demonstrated to be sensitive to the changes of physical and chemical properties in pore scale such as pore geometry johansson et al 2019 pore fluid chemistry lesmes and frye 2001 revil and skold 2011 schwartz et al 2014 and interface chemistry mellage et al 2018a which may be a potential tool for the evaluation of remediation techniques the sip measurements are generally carried out using a four electrode configuration two of electrodes are used for current injection and another two are served as potential electrodes the measurements are repeated over a range of frequencies as a result the spectral impedance magnitude σ and phase shift φ between injected current and received potential are obtained the measured sip response is generally expressed as complex conductivity σ consisting of in phase conductivity σ and imaginary conductivity σ vinegar and waxman 1984 1 σ σ exp iφ σ i σ where i 1 σ represents the conduction term electromigration and σ represents the reversible energy storage term charge polarization the presence of oil contaminant in soil is found to have significant influence on its sip responses schmutz et

dependency on water saturation 0 s w 1 this power law relationship can be expressed as revil 2013 vinegar and waxman 1984 2 σ 1 f s w n σ w s w n 1 σ s 3 σ σ s w 1 0 s w p where f is the formation factor s w is the water saturation in pores n is the saturation exponent for in phase conductivity σ w is the pore water conductivity σ s is the surface conductivity σ s w 1 0 denotes the imaginary conductivity in fully water saturated condition p is the saturation exponent for imaginary conductivity in order to provide a quantitative evaluation of the sip method for monitoring remediation process eqs 2 and 3 are used in this study to predict the dnapl saturations from sip measurements 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials the soil used in this study was extracted from xinjiang china 85 34 e 44 54 n its physicochemical properties are provided in table 1 the cation exchange capacity cec measurement was obtained with the hexamminecobalt trichloride solution spectrophotometric method as suggested in the environmental protection standards of the people s republic of china hj 889 2017 the soil organic matter som percentage was determined by multiplying the organic carbon concentration by a constant factor 1 724 tabatabai 1996 the organic carbon concentration of this soil was acquired by an element analyzer variomacro chns germany zhang et al 2018 the soil composition was performed using the x ray fluorescence system xrf arl 9800 switzerland the specific surface area data was obtained by the automatic static chemical absorber asap 2020 hd88 micromeritics trichloroethylene tce a representative of the typical hydrocarbon contaminant was chosen in this study which is commonly existing in organic contaminated sites rothmel et al 1998 since tce is carcinogenic to human beings it should be cautioned with the uses of tce in laboratory experiments as remediation agent we used the nonionic surfactant tween 80 an effective surfactant for the remediation of contaminated soil cheng et al 2017 pennell et al 1993 surfactant refers to a heterogeneous long chain molecule including hydrophilic group head group which tends to enter into aqueous phase and hydrophobic group tail group which prefers to combine with soil or contaminant e g dnapl at low concentration surfactant existing in the solution is in the form of monomers with the increase of surfactant concentration the micelles begin to form above a certain critical value this specific surfactant concentration is called critical micelle concentration cmc vishnyakov et al 2013 these micelles could easily disperse the contaminant and remarkably improve its solubility in aqueous phase tween 80 was selected in this study for the following two reasons for one thing it is of strong solubilization capacity and little toxicity on soil microorganisms fernando bautista et al 2009 yang et al 2010 for another thing as a nonionic surfactant it hardly ionizes in water mao et al 2015 thus it should not interfere with the sip measurements during surfactant enhanced remediation of contaminated soil the fluids properties are also summarized in table 1 3 2 experimental column set up the experimental column was constructed from a polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe tube which features excellent chemical stability corrosion resistance and electric insulation it had an inner diameter of 30 mm length of 230 mm and wall thickness of 3 mm fig 1 two stainless steel filters with a pore diameter of 0 074 mm were placed at both ends of the column avoiding the loss of soil with outflow as well as serving as the current electrodes the column was instrumented with two lateral ports for potential electrode emplacement 60 mm apart in order to reduce the polarization error the distance between the current electrode and potential electrode is expected to be at least twice the sample width zimmermann et al 2008 as a result the potential electrode was placed 85 mm from the current electrode the column was sealed at either end by the ptfe caps 3 3 column flushing experiments the column was wet packed with soil to ensure the sample fully water saturated specifically the column was filled by stepwise adding a few mm of solution followed by a small amount of soil and then using a rubber hammer to achieve a compact pack a water surface was always kept above the soil during the whole compaction this step was repeated until the entire column was filled after packing the column was flushed for 10 pore volume pvs with background solution at a constant flux to achieve the equilibrium for further experiment as a result the measured electrical conductivity ec of collected effluent samples showed essentially unchangeable after 10 pvs fig 1 ① after pre flush the columns were residually saturated with tce following the experimental methodology of powers et al 1992 and park and bielefeldt 2005 this experimental methodology was developed to obtain a homogeneous distribution of tce in column the dyed tce was injected into the bottom of the column at a rate of 0 4 ml min using a harvard apparatus syringe pump sigma aldrich corp st louis missouri usa this upward mode was applied for a relatively stable displacement kueper and frind 1988 tce was injected until it came out from the top cap this step was to displace the water in pores and saturate with tce fig 1 ② next the background solution was pumped into the top of the column at 4 ml min to displace the mobile tce and obtain a minimum residual tce saturation the solution was continuously pumped until tce was no longer flushed out meanwhile the effluent was collected from the bottom to calculate the volume of displaced tce the volume of residual tce in column was obtained by making a difference of volume between tce injected and tce displaced fig 1 ③ after tce injection the contaminated column was subjected to a long term flush of surfactant solution effluent samples were taken at intervals using an automatic collector these effluent samples were collected for ec and tce concentration measurements fig 1 ④ approximately 20 30 pore volumes of surfactant flushing were required for the remediation process properties of the column flushing experiments are summarized in table 2 3 4 control column control columns were also performed to separate the influence of surfactant on sip signature the preparations of control columns were identical to the columns that used in the column flushing experiments but were not contaminated with tce after pre flushing of the columns same surfactant solutions used in the columns contaminated with tce were pumped through the control columns effluent samples were analyzed for ec measurements properties of the control columns are summarized in table s1 in the supplementary data 3 5 spectral induced polarization measurements sip measurements were made with a four electrode configuration using a portable spectral induced polarization psip unit ontash ermac inc nj u s a two current electrodes made of stainless steel filter mesh were placed at either end of the column allowing for a homogeneous current distribution across the whole sample two custom made ag agcl potential electrodes were encased in a ptfe tube with a diameter of 5 mm and length of 100 mm consisting of a silver stick with a diameter of 1 5 mm and 15 g l agar gel containing 1 m kcl the phase shift and impedance were measured at 40 frequency intervals between 0 01 hz 20 khz the geometric factor of the column set up k m 1 was determined by k l a where l was the distance between the two potential electrodes in m a in m2 denoted the surface area of the cross section of the column the calculated geometrical factor was 84 88 m 1 in this study the accuracy and the stability of this sip measurement system was verified by conducting two duplicate column tests and measuring the complex conductivity on a salted water 0 1 s m nacl see fig s1 in the supplementary data the phase error was much smaller than 0 1 mrad within frequencies ranging from 0 01 hz to 100 hz the in phase conductivity is almost constant at the whole frequency range with an error smaller than 0 01 s m the phase and conductivity were found to be nearly invariant with time to provide a quantitative assessment for applying sip method to monitor dnapl remediation process the tce saturation remaining in the column needs to be obtained from sip measurements according to revil 2013 and vinegar and waxman 1984 the in phase and quadrature conductivity can be expressed as a function of water saturation eqs 2 and 3 in section 2 in order to predict the average water saturation remaining in the column the parameters including the formation factor f the surface conductivity σ s the in phase conductivity saturation exponent n and the quadrature conductivity saturation exponent p must be acquired for the experiment the formation factor f and the surface conductivity σ s were determined by measuring the in phase conductivity of fully water saturated samples with water salinities ranging from 0 01 s m to 10 s m the in phase conductivity data versus the pore water conductivities was then plotted the data were fitted with eq 2 to determine the values of f and σ s s w 1 0 the obtained f and σ s were 5 1023 and 0 005 s m respectively further the saturation exponents n and p were obtained by measuring the in phase and quadrature conductivities at varying water saturations fig 2 we followed similar experimental procedures as presented in section 3 3 to determine exponents n and p 1 the column was wet packed with natural soil and keep fully water saturated 2 the column was flushed for 10 pvs with background solution at a constant flux after that the initial in phase conductivity and phase were recorded by the sip measurement system 3 the dyed tce was injected from the bottom into the column at a rate of 0 4 ml min using a syringe pump this injection was not stopped until it came out from the top cap 4 the background solution was pumped from the top into column at 4 ml min to intermittently displace the mobile tce in pores the pump was stopped at intervals to control the volume of tce displaced allowing for the determinations of water saturations at different stages of tce displacement at each stage the displaced tce volume and the complex conductivity in phase conductivity and phase were measured the in phase conductivity and quadrature conductivity versus water saturation at the peak frequency was then plotted the values of n and p were determined by fitting the data 1 33 and 0 43 respectively it should be noted that we assumed the tce geometry and distribution within contaminated soil would not change during each temporary stop for sip measurements since the column was fully liquid saturated the tce average saturation s o remaining in the column should be s o 1 s w based on this established power law relationship concerning water saturation and complex conductivity the tce average saturation could be acquired from real time sip measurements 3 6 chemical measurements the collected effluent samples would be used for electrical conductivity ec and tce concentration measurements the ec values of effluent samples were measured by a conductivity meter it should be noted that the electrical conductivity here refers to the mobile fluid conductivity not bulk conductivity consisting of pore fluids and solid material fig 3 displays the temporal variations of ec during remediation process under different flushing conditions during the first 5 pore volumes a significant decreasing trend of ec is observed for all cases this decrease is due to the replacement of original pore water with the fresh surfactant solution in later time the ec values tends to be stable which indicates that the change of complex conductivity including in phase conductivity and phase during the remediation process was mainly caused by tce removal not by other factors like release of soil colloids to characterize the change of tce content in the column the effluent samples were analyzed with headspace gas chromatography hs gc teledyne tekmar ht3tm agilent 6890 n gc system u s a prior to effluent samples measurements a linear relationship between the peak area and the tce concentration was determined by measuring the peak areas of seven standard samples at known tce concentrations using hs gc analysis see fig s2 in the supplementary data based on this established linear relationship the tce concentration in effluent samples can be calculated by measuring its actual peak area the tce volume collected in the effluent samples was thus obtained by making a mathematical integration of measured tce concentration using matlab next the difference of tce volume between the injected and collected in the effluent samples was made this difference value represented the volume of tce remaining in the column finally the tce average saturation was determined by the ratio of tce volume remaining in the column to the pore volume of the soil fig 4 shows an example of the tce average saturation as a function of pore volumes the error bar indicates the uncertainties in saturation calculations the upper and lower bounder of the error bars present the maximum and minimum values of the calculated tce saturation respectively 3 7 data analysis to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the sip measurement system for monitoring dnapl contaminated soil remediation the root mean square error rmse was selected as an error index for data analysis it was used to characterize the difference of tce saturation and remediation efficiency between that estimated by sip method and that calculated by hs gc analysis 4 rmse s 1 n g i 1 n g s sip s hs gc 2 5 rmse r 1 n g i 1 n g r sip r hs gc 2 where rmse s denotes the rmse for tce saturation rmse r represents the rmse for remediation efficiency n g is the number of points s sip and s hs gc denote the estimated tce saturation from sip measurement and the measured tce saturation by hs gc analysis respectively r sip and r hs gc denote the estimated remediation efficiency from sip measurement and the measured remediation efficiency by hs gc analysis respectively 4 results since there was no significant change in in phase conductivity and phase with time in control columns the results of control columns were not shown here details can be seen in figs s3 s5 in the supplementary data these results indicated that the surfactant alone almost had no influence on the sip response during surfactant flushing in order to make it clear the organization of this part for each scenario was shown as follows first the chemical results in terms of tce average saturation and cumulative remediation efficiency during the surfactant flushing were presented this was followed by the temporal complex conductivity spectra measured during the tce remediation process next commonly used petrophysical relationships eqs 2 and 3 in this paper were applied to estimate the tce saturation and remediation efficiency from sip measurements these results were then compared with the chemical results to quantitatively evaluate the ability of sip method for long term monitoring of tce remediation and estimation of tce remediation efficiency 4 1 sip responses to tce removal under varying flow rate fig 5 presented the chemical results in terms of tce average saturation and cumulative remediation efficiency during the surfactant flushing under different flow rates the addition of surfactant has been proved to enhance the solubility of free phase tce in solution and improve the efficiency of remediation mao et al 2015 paria 2008 as a result the tce average saturation in the column decreased with time during the remediation process the overall remediation efficiency firstly decreased and then increased with the increase of the flow rate this was probably due to the competitive mechanism existing in the surfactant enhanced remediation for one thing as the flow rate increased there was more surfactant solution passing through the contaminated soil per unit time and the hydrodynamic shear stress increased as well this resulted in an enhancement of the solubility of tce in pore water for another thing under the condition of low flow rate surfactant solution was able to fully contact with the residual tce in the column resulting in a more thorough desorption of tce due to the joint influences of these two mechanisms the order of remediation efficiency under different flow rates was as follows 1 ml min 0 2 ml min 0 5 ml min the temporal complex conductivity spectra measured during the tce remediation process at different flow rates were presented in fig 6 compared to the uncontaminated soil the in phase conductivity decreased and the phase increased right after the addition of tce which were consistent with the results shown by schmutz et al 2010 the decrease in in phase conductivity was mainly caused by the replacement of conductive pore water with insulating contaminant free phase tce in pore space the mechanism for the increase in magnitude of phase perhaps are two fold for one as explained in the work of jougnot et al 2010 the presence of insulating fluid like tce here has an influence on the maxwell wagner polarization which can not be entirely negligible at low frequency where stern layer polarization occurs for another the membrane polarization which is also saturation dependent probably has a contribution to the effect of tce addition upon magnitude of phase schmutz et al 2010 during the continuous surfactant flushing the overall in phase conductivity increased and the phase decreased with time fig 7 to quantify the efficiency of sip method for characterizing the surfactant enhanced remediation process a comparison between the tce average saturation calculated from sip data and that measured by hs gc was drawn fig 8 the results showed that the tce average saturation estimated by sip method all decreased with time with an order of 0 5 ml min 0 2 ml min 1 0 ml min which were consistent with chemical results fig 8a and b when the flow rate was low 0 2 ml min the saturation trend estimated by the sip method was very close to the measured hs gc results with a minor error of 0 0200 rmse s as the flow rate increased the deviation between the estimated saturation and the measured saturation increased and rmse s was 0 15 the remediation efficiency of surfactant flushing was further calculated based on the estimated tce saturation as shown in fig 9 the trend of remediation efficiency estimated by sip method was in good agreement with the chemical data both sip and hs gc measurements showed a highest remediation efficiency at 1 0 ml min followed by 0 2 ml min and 0 5 ml min at low flow rate 0 2 ml min the difference between the remediation efficiency estimated by sip method and that by hs gc method was minimal with a rmse r of 5 2269 this difference increased to 83 5285 as the flow rate increased to 1 0 ml min 4 2 sip responses to tce removal under varying surfactant concentration the variation of tce saturation and cumulative remediation efficiency with time under different surfactant concentrations using hs gc was shown in fig 10 as surfactant concentration increased the efficiency for tce remediation enhanced accordingly compared with the concentration of 5000 mg l and 10 000 mg l the time for tce removal reduced substantially when the surfactant concentration was 20 000 mg l this was due to the fact that the surfactant could enhance the solubility of organic contaminant in water when the concentration was over its cmc value west and harwell 1992 in this experiment the surfactant concentration used was much higher than its cmc value 13 mg l see in table 1 which was 385 769 and 1538 times of the cmc value respectively thus with the increase of the surfactant concentration the solubility of tce in pore water increased and the remediation efficiency improved correspondingly the time variant in phase conductivity and phase spectra under different surfactant concentrations were displayed in fig s6 in the supplementary data based on the spectral responses the change of the in phase conductivity and the phase at peak frequency during the remediation process were drawn in fig 11 similarly the in phase conductivity increased with time while the phase decreased with time it should be noticed that the in phase conductivity only showed a slight increase with time under the condition of high surfactant concentration 20 000 mg l fig 12 showed the tce average saturation in the column as a function of time measured by sip and hs gc methods at different surfactant concentrations the average saturation of tce estimated by sip method exhibited a decreasing trend with time which was consistent with the hs gc measurement at surfactant concentration of 5000 mg l the average saturation estimated by sip method was the closest to hs gc results with a tiny deviation of 0 01 as the surfactant concentration increased from 5000 to 100 000 mg l the deviation between the sip and hs gc results increased with the rmse s increasing from 0 0200 to 0 2181 the cumulative remediation efficiency at varying surfactant concentration was shown in fig 13 compared with the high concentration case 20 000 mg l the remediation efficiency estimated by sip method was close to the hs gc measurements at the concentration of 5000 and 10 000 mg l and the rmse r were 5 2269 and 8 0228 respectively however at concentration of 20 000 mg l the efficiency estimated by sip method was significantly lower than hs gc results leading to a rmse r of 56 5462 4 3 sip responses to tce removal under varying fluid salinity the temporal variations of tce average saturation and remediation efficiency under different fluid salinities obtained by hs gc measurements were shown in fig 14 the results showed that the order of the remediation efficiency was as follows 1 0 s m 0 1 s m 0 05 s m as demonstrated in previous studies the addition of salt could enhance the solubility of organic contaminants in water paria 2008 with the increase of salt concentration the apparent solubility of organic contaminants increased correspondingly therefore as the salinity of surfactant solution increased from 0 05 s m to 1 0 s m the concentration of dissolved tce in pore water increased improving the efficiency for tce remediation the time variant complex conductivity responses to tce remediation under different salinities were shown in fig s7 in the supplementary data under the condition of low salinity 0 05 s m the phase spectrum showed significant peaks in low frequencies 1 10 hz as the fluid salinity increased the phase spectrum tended to be more smoothing with the frequency when the salinity increased to 1 0 s m the peak disappeared in the phase spectrum this phenomenon was also observed in previous works weller and slater 2012 the in phase conductivity and phase as a function of time were shown in fig 15 on the whole the in phase conductivity increased as salinity increased which indicated that the in phase conductivity mainly depended on the conductivity of the pore water in this case the magnitude of the phase displayed a decreasing trend with salinity which was consistent with most of the cases in practice joseph et al 2015 revil and skold 2011 it was inferred that the thickness of the diffusion layer was inversely proportional to the square root of salinity as the salinity increased the diffusion layer became thinner and thus the polarizability diminished hördt et al 2016 the comparison between the tce saturation estimated by sip method and that obtained by hs gc analysis under different fluid salinities was displayed in fig 16 the average saturation of tce in the column estimated by sip method was in an order as below 0 05 s m 0 1 s m 1 0 s m and decreased with time during continuous flushing which was in accordance with the chemical results as the salinity increased the difference between the saturation estimated by sip and that by hs gc decreased with the rmse s decreasing from 0 2029 to 0 0809 the remediation efficiency under varying salinities was further calculated with tce saturation as shown in fig 17 the sip results showed that the remediation for tce contaminant was most efficient at salinity of 1 0 s m followed by 0 1 s m and 0 05 s m this was in good agreement with the hs gc results however compared with the case of relatively high salinity 1 0 s m the estimated remediation efficiency at 0 05 s m deviated significantly from the chemical result with a rmse r of 31 8750 5 discussion 5 1 sip responses associated with tce remediation process chemical measurements showed that the mass of tce remaining in the columns was reduced due to the surfactant flushing the sip monitoring of the contaminated columns showed a strong response to the tce remediation process a continuous increase in in phase conductivity and decrease in phase were observed during ongoing tce remediation in contrast in the control columns without any tce the sip responses showed essentially no change during same surfactant flushing figs s3 s5 this suggested that the observed sip signatures in contaminated columns were related to the tce removal not the surfactant flushing as shown in previous works the in phase conductivity and phase were associated with the conduction and polarization of the electrical double layer edl at the grain water interface where the grain was coated by the continuous water film abdel aal and atekwana 2014 revil and florsch 2010 schmutz et al 2010 in this study the experiments were designed to investigate the remediation process of a residual tce within the water wetted porous media the distribution of water phase was thus supposed to be continuous during the remediation process thus it was suggested that the increase in in phase conductivity and decrease in phase was most likely explained by the edl conduction and polarization however the increase of water phase continuity might also have a contribution to the increase of in phase conductivity 5 2 effect of flow rate and fluid chemistry under the condition of varying flow rate surfactant concentrations and fluid salinity the efficiency for tce removal by surfactant enhanced remediation was different resulting in different sip responses while the sip measurements were able to characterize the difference of tce average saturation and remediation efficiency under different conditions the discrepancy between the sip and chemical results still exist as flow rate increased a general increase in the deviation of estimation of average tce saturation and remediation efficiency by sip method was observed with the rmse s and rmse r increased from 0 02 to 0 16 and 5 226 to 83 5 respectively since the control column showed essentially no change with time under different flow rates it should not be caused by the alteration of pore space geometry due to relatively large flow rate fig s3 in the supplementary data it was thus speculated that it would take longer time for the experimental system to reach a steady state for each sip measurement with increasing flow rate however in order to improve the efficiency of data acquisition the time for the system into a steady state was not considered in our experiments the sip measurements were performed right after each temporary stop of the surfactant flushing in this study this might be responsible for the increased deviation with increasing flow rate the sip performance was also affected by surfactant concentration the reported tce average saturation and remediation efficiency estimated from sip responses at 5000 mg l surfactant concentration exhibited a good agreement with the hs gc analysis while the estimations at 10 000 mg l and 20 000 mg l surfactant concentrations showed an increasing deviation from hs gc analysis the control experiments showed that there was essentially no change in sip signature with time at 10 000 mg l and 20 000 mg l during ongoing flushing fig s4 in the supplementary data studies by chieng et al 1995 and pérez et al 2002 showed that the size of droplet in pore water decreased with increasing surfactant concentration and the microemulsion was formed at a high concentration in the surfactant oil water system thus the formation of microemulsion at high surfactant concentration might had an effect on the sip responses changing the fluid salinity had an effect on the sip behavior as well with increase of fluid salinity the tce average saturation and remediation efficiency estimated from sip data set showed an increasing agreement with chemical results with rmse s decreasing from 0 2 to 0 08 argaud et al 1989 explored the salinity effect on the performance of commonly used conductivity models based on laboratory data their results suggested that all of the tested models fitted well with the data at high salinities however at low salinities when surface conductivity was dominant commonly used models had difficulty predicting the saturation without accounting for the geometrical effects of the surface conductor consequently salinity effects on the conductivity model we used might be responsible for the increasing deviations with decreasing fluid salinity 5 3 implications for monitoring long term organic contaminant remediation the sip method was able to monitor the tce remediation process by surfactant flushing and reflect remediation efficiency differences under variant conditions the reduction of tce induced continuous changes in the measured sip signals which were reflected in the temporal changes of the in phase conductivity and phase although the results presented here were associated with the surfactant enhanced remediation sip monitoring can also be extended to other chemical remediation techniques recent studies have demonstrated that sip technique is emerging as a potential tool for monitoring bioremediation heenan et al 2013 personna et al 2013 and zerovalent iron remediation flores orozco et al 2015 of organic contaminants our experiments were conducted in the laboratory however the encouraging results suggested that sip measurements might be feasible for tracking the remediation process and assessing remediation efficiency in field especially combining with other types of data such as hydrochemical data the works of flores orozco et al 2012 and orozco et al 2013 have evidenced the ability of field sip for delineating hydrocarbon contamination and uranium bioremediation it should be expected that the presented sip measurement protocol will be useful for the quantitative assessment of efficiency of remediation techniques and decision making for remediation professionals however limitations also exist in the application of sip method to field investigations environmental factors such as flow rate may have an impact on the sip measurements which probably result in the misjudgment of the remediation efficiency in order to provide a more accurate prediction additional study is required to determine how the environmental factors would affect the sip signatures 6 conclusions a series of column flushing experiments were conducted to assess the ability of sip method for monitoring dnapl remediation process to quantify the performance of sip method under different conditions sip data sets and chemical data were simultaneously collected during the remediation process the results suggest that the spectral induced polarization method can be used as a real time monitoring tool to spatially and temporally track the remediation process of dnapl by surfactant flushing as well as to estimate remediation efficiency during the continuous flushing the in phase conductivity increased with time while the phase decreased over time indicating a high sensitivity of sip signals to dnapl removal factors that affected the efficiency of surfactant enhanced remediation including flow rate surfactant concentration and fluid salinity also had an impact on sip measurements during remediation process as flow rate increased the average tce saturation estimated by sip method firstly increased then decreased and remediation efficiency firstly decreased then increased with flow rate which were in accordance with the results from hs gc the difference of results estimated from sip method and that from hs gc measurements increased with the increase of flow rate with the rmse s increasing from 0 02 to 0 16 the column flushing experiments also showed that the tce average saturation and remediation efficiency estimated by sip method were close to that calculated with hs gc method when the surfactant concentration was low as the surfactant concentration increased to 20 000 mg l the rmse s and rmse r increased to 0 22 and 56 55 respectively under different fluid salinities there was a fair agreement between the experimental results estimated from sip measurements and that obtained with hs gc analysis with the decrease of fluid salinity the deviation between the sip and hs gc results decreased as well with the rmse s decreasing from 0 20 to 0 08 our results demonstrate the great potential of the sip method to track the dnapl remediation process and predict remediation efficiency which provides an efficient tool for field remediation professionals to make remediation strategic

1531,non aqueous phase liquid napl remediation techniques using surfactants such as enhanced pump and treat also known as surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation sear and micellar flooding provide a faster and more efficient way to recover napl from the subsurface micellar flooding is a recovery technique that relies on the ability of surfactants to mobilize the napl phase by reducing the interfacial tension between the aqueous phase and the napl the application of micellar flooding for napl recovery has been limited to laboratory studies and some pilot scale field applications primarily due to concerns that the technology might lead to uncontrolled movement of napl this paper presents results from a full scale field application of the micellar flood process designed to mobilize and recover an lnapl jet fuel from a surficial sandy aquifer located at a tank facility in western jutland denmark phase behavior and flow experiments were conducted with field samples to identify suitable surfactant formulations a field scale simulation model was developed that indicated that a line drive pattern with hydraulic control wells would be optimal for napl recovery in addition to monitoring during the field implementation monitoring was conducted immediately after and for a period of 1 year the field implementation resulted in 90 recovery approximately 36 000 kg of lnapl based on the mass balance using laser induced fluorescence lif and chemical soil analysis total petroleum hydrocarbon or tph and btex data post surfactant flood site monitoring consisted of sampling water from multi levels and from recovery wells groundwater samples were analyzed for total petroleum hydrocarbon tph and benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene btex the pre treatment and post treatment mass discharges were also monitored which led to a relationship between mass discharge with the mass reduction in the source zone also the mass discharge γ model commonly used for dnapl modeling was successfully implemented for lnapl remediation studies of field applications of surfactant remediation processes are not readily available it is especially rare to present a study of micellar flooding implementation for full scale remediation processes 1 introduction non aqueous phase liquids napl contamination of soil is a significant problem which leads to contamination of groundwater bodies adverse impact on ecosystems and posing risk to human health napl is classified as light lnapl and dense dnapl based on their density with respect to water jet fuel is characterized as an lnapl and is primarily a fuel source for aviation industry jet fuel contamination is very common in areas near airport fuel storage tanks due to leaks in pipelines or tanks surfactant assisted remediation techniques have been discussed in detail in the literature mulligan et al 2001 mao et al 2015 surfactant assisted remediation can be classified based on the mechanism of recovery surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation sear relies on increasing the solubilization of napl into the aqueous phase acting as an enhancement to conventional pump and treat p t methods while micellar flooding relies on reducing the interfacial tension between the napl and aqueous phase in order to mobilize the napl micellar flooding has been studied in detail as a chemical enhanced oil recovery method in the petroleum engineering field at the pilot scale with limited full scale applications for crude oil recovery lake et al 2014 sheng 2010 hirasaki et al 2011 sear methods have been well researched and applied in many pilot field scale remediation applications for napl recovery dwarakanath et al 1999 childs et al 2006 gallego et al 2011 kostarelos et al 2013 navfac 2002 fountain et al 1996 khalladi et al 2009 paria 2008 ghosh et al 2019 babaei and copty 2019 while sear can reduce the time required to recover napl when compared to p t methods the mobilization approach micellar flooding could recover contaminants in a shorter time and with less surfactant injection compared to sear significantly reducing the cost of remediation the concern however is that the micellar flooding approach can lead to migration of contaminants into deeper formation especially if contaminants are a dnapl however there are examples in literature to eliminate the downward migration kostarelos et al 1998 currently to our knowledge no studies of full scale field application of micellar flooding for lnapl remediation have been found in peer reviewed journals thus this paper presents the first known full scale field application of micellar flooding for lnapl recovery from the subsurface the steps taken to design the flood such as lab studies and simulation work are also summarized in this paper the primary aim of the micellar flood was the recovery of lnapl jet a fuel from a surficial sandy aquifer located at a tank facility in western jutland denmark the spill was observed in 2003 from a leaking pipeline near the northern end of the manifold building the location of the leak and extent of the lnapl area are shown in fig 1 the amount of lnapl released was not recorded approximately 24 m3 of lnapl was recovered using a process known as skimming of the groundwater table until the flow of lnapl to skimmer wells was reduced to an insignificant rate attempts to recovery the remaining mobile lnapl using water injection yielded no lnapl indicating lnapl at residual saturation however in 2010 an oil film was observed in the wells located near the area subsequent studies were conducted to investigate the extent of lnapl contamination the lnapl zone was delineated using laser induced fluorescence lif measurements in fig 2a the location of the lif measurements and the fluorescence intensity signal re measured is plotted with respect to the elevation and clearly indicates the presence of lnapl below the groundwater level based on these measurements the areal extent of the contamination was estimated to be approximately 1000 m2 see fig 3 a central area of 65 m2 as depicted by dark red in the heat map see fig 3 had the strongest indications of contamination the subsurface extent of the contamination was in the smear zone from 3 to 4 m below ground level bgl and from top of the aquifer to a depth of 5 5 m bgl based on the studies and analyses the amount of lnapl remaining in the subsurface was estimated to be approximately 44 m3 most of which was present at residual saturation thus the lnapl was within a surficial aquifer so that two points should be made the aquifer was used for agriculture prior to the accidental jet fuel release and was a significant motivation behind the work to recover the lnapl and the water table fluctuated greatly that led to a smear zone of trapped lnapl below the water table indicated as gwl in fig 2b no lnapl mass was found above the water table likely due to the effect of vaporization 2 field implementation design success of surfactant based remediation processes for a field scenario requires extensive laboratory studies such as phase behavior studies and flow experiments these laboratory studies provide key information for generating numerical simulations and preliminary modeling assessments which is critical for scale up to the field level findings of these tests and models are discussed briefly below phase behavior studies and 1 d flow experiments phase behavior studies were conducted to identify suitable surfactant formulations for jet a fuel the experiments are discussed in detail by kostarelos et al kostarelos et al 2016 in a previous publication the selected surfactant formulation was a 4 wt 1 1 mixture of sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate ot 75 sodium di hexyl sulfosuccinate ma 80 and 4 wt sec butanol at 22 000 mg l optimum salinity at the aquifer temperature 10 c the surfactants utilized for the formulation were provided by cytec industries inc now cytec solvay and were formulated at concentrations above the critical micelle concentration cmc a ternary phase diagram was also developed for the selected surfactant formulation that is used as input data for the simulation studies below after selecting the surfactant formulation two column experiments were conducted at the design salinity properties of sandpacks using sand collected from the aquifer were measured then flooded with jet a fuel and water to measure endpoint relative permeabilities the surfactant flood of these sandpacks confirmed the compatibility of the selected surfactant formulation with the soil since a the pressure measured during the experiment remained low indicating that no viscous phases formed in situ and b the recovery of the residual lnapl was over 90 the surfactant flood was performed with a horizontal orientation to observe the oil bank formed during the experiment and it matched the calculated bank angle simulation studies the simulation model utchem is a 3d multi component multi phase compositional model of chemical flooding processes that has been used for contaminant transport and surfactant flooding simulations delshad et al 1996 2002 the model accounts for complex phase behavior chemical and physical transformations and heterogeneous porous media properties the flow and mass transport equations are solved for any number of user specified chemical components water oil surfactant alcohols polymer chloride calcium other electrolytes tracers cross linkers etc these components can form up to four fluid phases air water oil and microemulsion and any number of solid minerals depending upon the overall composition the phase behavior model is critical to obtaining a wide range of the commonly observed micellar and microemulsion behavior relevant to surfactant flooding and sear surfactant related properties such as adsorption interfacial tension capillary pressure capillary number and microemulsion viscosity are all dependent on an accurate phase behavior model the laboratory studies provided essential information that was used for modeling the field application scenarios a multi phase simulation model was developed in utchem using laboratory measurements the utchem model phase behavior was then run and compared with calibrated the column experiment results prior to implementing the model for full scale simulations parameters such as hydraulic conductivity porosity and lnapl saturations were determined in the field by means of a tracer test from cone penetrometer cpt laser induced fluorescence lif measurements and from in situ water pressure measurements the simulation studies were then used to determine well spacing screened intervals injection extraction rates salt concentrations and injection extraction time periods for maximum lnapl recovery based on the simulation studies it was decided to employ a line drive pattern consisting of 15 injection wells and 15 extraction wells in two rows 5 m apart fig 4 the modeling studies also indicated that hydraulic control wells hcws injecting water up gradient of the injection wells and recovering water downgradient of the extraction wells would keep the injected fluids at a shallow depth within the formation where the targeted lnapl was located the final simulation model consisted of a 100 80 horizontal grid with 29 layers of different hydraulic conductivity the model was run on a pc with an intel core i7 processor and 16 gb of ram details of the simulation studies are discussed by de blanc et al 2016 and some details are presented here for the reader the field data together with data from pumping and slug tests were used to determine preliminary conservative estimates of horizontal hydraulic conductivity kh of approximately 8 6 m d 10 2 cm s this value of kh was used in a simulation of the tracer test in order to ascertain a more accurate value and determine the degree of aquifer heterogeneity in the field pumping was initiated and once steady draw down achieved a measured volume of sodium chloride solution was injected up gradient while samples were collected down gradient the samples were analyzed for chloride and result used for numerical simulation the tracer simulations suggested that the value of kh was closer to 15 m d and that the aquifer appeared to be isotropic with respect to hydraulic conductivity therefore a value of 15 m d was used in the hydraulic design simulations for both horizontal and vertical kv hydraulic conductivities other parameter values used in the simulations are listed in table 1 monitoring during the remediation monitoring of the site and flood performance was conducted during each stage to evaluate the performance of the process so that adjustments could be made if necessary water samples from monitoring and recovery wells were analyzed for electrical conductivity to understand the distribution of the injected brine in the aquifer these samples were also titrated for chloride and surfactant concentration electrical conductivity data loggers were installed in the recovery wells to detect breakthrough and to adjust the brine dosage laser induced fluorescence a lif high resolution probe using an ultra violet optical screening tool uvost was utilized to adjust and optimize various remediation stages lif is a real time in situ field screening method for residual and napl contaminants within subsurface soils capable of probing to depths up to 30 m the technology is useful for obtaining qualitative to semi quantitative information about subsurface contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in the simplest terms pahs will fluoresce when excited by ultra violet uv light contaminants containing pahs are excited by a uv laser fluoresce with an intensity that is quantifiable and related to the amount of pah this approach is employed by using a sapphire crystal window mounted on the side of a direct push probe which are constrained to use in unconsolidated media to depths of 50 to 100 ft depending on soil strength in this way a light source and detector can be installed on one side of the sapphire window allowing for detection of pahs on the other while the probe is pushed down through the subsurface and the data logged pah monitoring was important to measure the flood performance there are two methods available for deployment of the lif sensors cone penetrometer and percussion direct push rigs germain 2011 in this study the direct push method was utilized fuels and oils contain various amount of monoaromatic hydrocarbons mahs pahs and aliphatic hydrocarbons electrons in the aromatic molecules absorbs energy at a certain wavelength and emit fluorescence this spectrum is unique to each molecule and make it possible to discern the molecule from the fluorescence spectrum however because napls are usually mixtures that emit overlapping spectra it can be difficult to identify individual compounds from lif data lif is useful in determination of relative concentrations and type of product present in the subsurface germain 2011 mass discharge model the dissolution of napl into groundwater is a complicated process that is affected by subsurface properties heterogeneity napl properties and napl distribution due to these complexities remediation processes for napls fail to completely remove all the contaminants from the ground therefore relating partial mass removal to the reduction in contaminant mass flux reduction is of utmost importance to evaluate the performance of remediation effort contaminant mass flux mass discharge relationship to mass removal processes have been discussed in detail in literature fried et al 1979 mass removal and mass discharge relationship is significantly impacted by the napl distribution in subsurface and heterogeneity of the formation zhu and sykes 2000 difilippo and brusseau 2008 difilippo et al 2010 brusseau et al 2007 brown et al 2012 in heterogeneous aquifers a general approach is to approximate source strength by a power function of the remaining mass of napl in the source zone rao and jawitz 2003 rao et al 2001 as shown in the so called γ model eq 1 1 j t j o m t m o γ where j o is the initial mass discharge resulting from the initial mass m o in place and j t is the mass discharge resulting from the mass m t at time t and γ is an empirical factor that is dependent upon geology and properties of the napl contaminants falta et al 2005a the value of γ is strongly correlated to the heterogeneity of the field and dnapl architecture distribution of dnapl within the subsurface the γ factor often varies between 0 5 and 2 0 for dnapl sites for cases where γ 1 a significant mass reduction mt mo does not result in a corresponding reduction in mass flux jt jo conversely observing a small reduction in mass flux jt jo following a remediation effort should not be misinterpreted as an indication of failure likewise for γ 1 cases a large reduction in mass flux could be misconstrued as a large mass reduction the point is that measuring the post remediation mass flux at a site is not meaningful unless the γ factor is known falta et al 2005b if the γ factor is known the degree of mass reduction can be estimated by means of the mass flux measurements jt jo alkali hydrolysis treatment of the produced fluids was essential for the re use of the water separation of the produced fluids was also critical to determine the amount of lnapl recovered this was complicated by the presence of the surfactant in the produced fluids which created an emulsion and microemulsion that required 1 week to separate a treatment step was added to remove the surfactant alkaline hydrolysis is the reaction of esters with sodium hydroxide to create a carboxylate salt and alcohol alkaline hydrolysis of esters is also known as saponification r coor naoh rcoona roh ester base carboxylate soap alcohol the surfactants utilized in this field application are both sulfosuccinates i e sodium salts of alkyl esters of sulfosuccinic acid sulfosuccinates are very sensitive to hydrolysis under both acidic and basic conditions due to the presence of the ester linkage deepika and tyagi 2006 under basic conditions the oh group acts as a nucleophile and attacks the ester group which leads to formation of salt of sulfosuccinic acid and an alcohol according to batchu et al the hydrolysis of di octyl sulfosuccinate occurs under both acidic and basic conditions but the hydrolysis is more effective in the presence of strong base batchu et al 2014 testing in our laboratory confirmed that alkaline hydrolysis of the surfactant occurred and the time required for hydrolysis was also determined at the groundwater temperature at the site hence in this field application alkaline hydrolysis naoh was utilized to degrade the surfactant in the produced microemulsion so that the jet fuel and water could be separated after which the jet fuel was sold and the water treated for re use 3 field implementation execution based on the dimensions of the site and the well spacing field implementation was planned to be conducted in eight stages moving from up gradient to down gradient north to south although the simulation studies recommended 15 injection per row and 15 extraction wells per row to create a line drive pattern the last 5 rows down gradient of the site could only accommodate 13 wells fig 4 shows the pattern and location of the wells for stage 1 the progression of the field implementation would then proceed to the next row or stage after assessing the performance and instituting modifications if deemed necessary the direction of the hydraulically induced flow was from north to south which was parallel to the overall groundwater flow direction thus a similar pattern was followed for 7 stages although for stage 8 the direction of flow was reversed south to north as shown in fig 5 the hydraulic control injection and extraction wells were interchanged for stage 8 this was done to ensure that napl would not move out of the contaminated body in addition earlier studies indicated that the presence of fine sediment in the southern part of the field which could have prevented achieving sufficient pumping rates in the last stage the injection was started with a 54 m3 pre flush of brine solution followed by a 185 m3 of surfactant formulation flush the surfactant flush was chased with 305 m3 post flush of brine to continue pushing the mobilized lnapl to the extraction wells and to recover remaining microemulsion in the system the volumes used were calculated to be approximately 0 5 pore volume pv pre flush 3 pv surfactant flood and 3 5 pv post surfactant flood i e brine post flush since the swept pore volume in the field varies depending upon flow rates and on the size of a particular stage the volumes used are presented in the results section table 3 pressure flow rates and amount of lnapl recovered were recorded for each stage produced samples from the extraction wells were analyzed for chloride and surfactant concentration using titration electrical conductivity was measured to determine the breakthrough curves and estimate swept pore volume total recovery from a stage was calculated by measuring mobilized lnapl produced mobilized and the amount of lnapl separated from microemulsion using alkali hydrolysis as a method of confirming results i e for consistency and validation of the methods herein the soil was analyzed with lif after every stage which also served to properly optimize the next remediation stage after eight stages total recovery was confirmed using additional lif and chemical soil analysis soil analysis consisted of soil sample collection preservation and laboratory chemical analysis by a contract lab effectiveness of the remediation was also quantified based on the reduction of mass discharge hydrocarbons the transect method was utilized to measure mass discharge before and after the remediation the transect placed down gradient from the remediation body was 45 m wide and contained 6 wells with 35 total sampling points as depicted in fig 6 samples acquired from these points were analyzed for tph and btex the groundwater gradient was estimated by hydraulic heads in the wells and the hydraulic conductivity was estimated from slug tests and a geo probe hydraulic profiling tool hpt logs the mass discharge was estimated using the gsi mass flux tool kit baseline mass discharge was calculated based on 3 sampling events done from november 2014 to march 2015 the baseline measurement for gradient tph benzene and btex is tabulated in table 2 4 results and discussion total amount of surfactant co solvent sec butanol and brine injected in each stage of the remediation process are listed in table 3 because the aquifer was much deeper than the treated napl layer it is possible that some of the injected surfactant solution may have underrun below the napl layer before it contacted napl because of the difficulty in determining swept pore volume all of the reported volumes are in cubic meters instead of pore volumes in the field produced water was treated by an on site treatment plant which consisted of oil water separators a combined stripper bioreactor sand filters and two granular activated carbon gac filters initially surfactant and oil were detected in the treated water which was linked to the presence of surfactants in the produced water to address this problem alkaline hydrolysis was implemented as a pre treatment stage before the on site treatment plant laboratory studies tested alkaline hydrolysis of the surfactant formulation and demonstrated that the reaction time reaction temperature and ph of the solution were the controlling factors for the reaction it was determined that the relatively low groundwater temperature required longer reaction times so the produced groundwater was collected in large tanks for hydrolysis so that adequate reaction time could be maintained which was more economical than heating the produced water the ph was used as a control for hydrolysis and was always maintained higher than 12 on average 526 kg of the caustic solution naoh was added to the 50 000 l capacity treatment tank these treatment tanks were equipped with recirculation pumps to provide sufficient mixing of the solution the mass removal of napl was calculated using the mass recovered in the solubilized microemulsion from the extraction wells and hydraulic control wells and was separated in the hydrolysis tanks and also from the napl mass which was directly mobilized and captured from the oil water separator the amount of napl recovered from each stage is tabulated in table 4 the recovery from stage 5 6 and 7 were highest which was expected based on the fact that these stages were located in the zones of highest lif intensity the mobilized napl contributed to the majority of the recovery 93 of the total napl recovered highlighting the effectiveness of micellar flooding and is depicted graphically in fig 7 figs 8 and 9 report the mass removal and mass removal rates for stage 2 of the project comparing the recovery from the extraction wells fig 8 to the hydraulic control wells fig 9 a total of 40 m3 32 700 kg lnapl was recovered during the remediation the mass recovery rates are on the order of 25 and 45 g h in the hydraulic control wells fig 9 and showed little change as a result of the surfactant flush the recovery rates at the extraction wells were at a similar level as the hydraulic control wells and increased to levels between 10 000 g h and 37 000 g h as a result of the surfactant flush the fact that the mass of hydrocarbon arriving at the hydraulic control wells remained low when compared to the extraction wells which increased 3 orders of magnitude indicates good hydraulic control of the injected surfactant solution mass balance analyses were performed based on actual production data during remediation and on pre and post remedial investigation data including lif and chemical soil analysis both analyses showed that approximately 90 of the contamination was recovered from the source zone the remaining amount of lnapl on the site was estimated to be approximately 4 m3 2700 kg the average lif comparison of the pre remediation and post remediation heat maps based on lif measurements demonstrates the effectiveness of the remediation process fig 10 additionally the concentration of tph benzene and btex were measured at a downgradient transect after remediation see fig 6 for location of six wells each of these six wells are actually clusters that have a screened interval at different depths identified on the transect in fig 11 the well locations and number of screened intervals are labelled as a 3 screens b 5 screens c 5 screens d 5 screens e 3 screens and f 3 screens in addition to these samples we also sampled from wells locations slightly up and downgradient of the transect for comparison but we did not use the data for estimation of the mass discharge these data from six wells are compared to measurements made prior to remediation in fig 11 the contours shown in fig 11 were made using ordinary kriging method and measured concentrations of nearest neighbors flux measurements of hydrocarbons were also made in order to compute the mass flux after remediation and compare with the baseline measurements transect measurements document hydrocarbon concentration reductions up to 99 the flux calculations were made using the gsi mass flux toolkit freeware https www gsi net com en software free software mass flux toolkit html the reduction in mass flux is tabulated in table 5 and show a significant reduction after remediation for the btex compounds of 97 99 the tph mass flux was also reduced significantly of over 64 based on the conservative values in table 5 pre and post flush mass discharge measurements were utilized to correlate a γ factor based on the reduction in mass discharge according to the γ model based on the tph data and mass removal from the source zone the γ factor is estimated to range from 0 41 to 0 85 depending on the indicator tph benzene or btex the γ factor is in the range 0 51 0 69 if the groundwater gradient is considered steady at 1 during post monitoring the gradient varied from 0 5 2 0 and was more unstable than during the baseline monitoring when the gradient was stable around 1 therefore the variation of the gradient has had greater influence on the mass discharge than the measured concentration levels thus a steady gradient of 1 was used to estimate mass discharge instead of using the varying gradient in order to compare the mass discharge before and after remediation the mass flux for both the varying and steady gradient conditions were computed and the results for tph are compared in fig 12 to the baseline conditions which show reduction in mass flux of 93 2 for a varying gradient and 98 5 assuming a steady gradient 5 conclusion it is important to note several points regarding this project first that the surfactant flood used to mobilize and recover the lnapl was completed in a relatively short period of time the entire field project took less than six months including down time used to make measurements and confirm the design second the monitoring confirmed that the lnapl movement was hydraulically controlled and captured post surfactant flood analyses aqueous sampling lif measurements soil sampling of the site indicate over 90 of lnapl mass recovered the reduction in mass flux from the site 1 year after treatment is over 98 with respect to btex compounds with respect to total petroleum hydrocarbons the mass flux reduction is 64 assuming a varying gradient or 88 if a steady gradient is assumed the significance of the field work is important to consider in light of publications presenting laboratory work that cautioned against this approach for napl recovery after a period of interest from the early 1990s to early 2000s field implementation of surfactants declined although some publications presented the use of surfactants to increase solubility and recovery of napl by way of enhancing the conventional pump and treat approach this paper presents the first known full scale field application of micellar flooding to lnapl recovery from the subsurface by means of mobilization declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

recovery the remaining mobile lnapl using water injection yielded no lnapl indicating lnapl at residual saturation however in 2010 an oil film was observed in the wells located near the area subsequent studies were conducted to investigate the extent of lnapl contamination the lnapl zone was delineated using laser induced fluorescence lif measurements in fig 2a the location of the lif measurements and the fluorescence intensity signal re measured is plotted with respect to the elevation and clearly indicates the presence of lnapl below the groundwater level based on these measurements the areal extent of the contamination was estimated to be approximately 1000 m2 see fig 3 a central area of 65 m2 as depicted by dark red in the heat map see fig 3 had the strongest indications of contamination the subsurface extent of the contamination was in the smear zone from 3 to 4 m below ground level bgl and from top of the aquifer to a depth of 5 5 m bgl based on the studies and analyses the amount of lnapl remaining in the subsurface was estimated to be approximately 44 m3 most of which was present at residual saturation thus the lnapl was within a surficial aquifer so that two points should be made the aquifer was used for agriculture prior to the accidental jet fuel release and was a significant motivation behind the work to recover the lnapl and the water table fluctuated greatly that led to a smear zone of trapped lnapl below the water table indicated as gwl in fig 2b no lnapl mass was found above the water table likely due to the effect of vaporization 2 field implementation design success of surfactant based remediation processes for a field scenario requires extensive laboratory studies such as phase behavior studies and flow experiments these laboratory studies provide key information for generating numerical simulations and preliminary modeling assessments which is critical for scale up to the field level findings of these tests and models are discussed briefly below phase behavior studies and 1 d flow experiments phase behavior studies were conducted to identify suitable surfactant formulations for jet a fuel the experiments are discussed in detail by kostarelos et al kostarelos et al 2016 in a previous publication the selected surfactant formulation was a 4 wt 1 1 mixture of sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate ot 75 sodium di hexyl sulfosuccinate ma 80 and 4 wt sec butanol at 22 000 mg l optimum salinity at the aquifer temperature 10 c the surfactants utilized for the formulation were provided by cytec industries inc now cytec solvay and were formulated at concentrations above the critical micelle concentration cmc a ternary phase diagram was also developed for the selected surfactant formulation that is used as input data for the simulation studies below after selecting the surfactant formulation two column experiments were conducted at the design salinity properties of sandpacks using sand collected from the aquifer were measured then flooded with jet a fuel and water to measure endpoint relative permeabilities the surfactant flood of these sandpacks confirmed the compatibility of the selected surfactant formulation with the soil since a the pressure measured during the experiment remained low indicating that no viscous phases formed in situ and b the recovery of the residual lnapl was over 90 the surfactant flood was performed with a horizontal orientation to observe the oil bank formed during the experiment and it matched the calculated bank angle simulation studies the simulation model utchem is a 3d multi component multi phase compositional model of chemical flooding processes that has been used for contaminant transport and surfactant flooding simulations delshad et al 1996 2002 the model accounts for complex phase behavior chemical and physical transformations and heterogeneous porous media properties the flow and mass transport equations are solved for any number of user specified chemical components water oil surfactant alcohols polymer chloride calcium other electrolytes tracers cross linkers etc these components can form up to four fluid phases air water oil and microemulsion and any number of solid minerals depending upon the overall composition the phase behavior model is critical to obtaining a wide range of the commonly observed micellar and microemulsion behavior relevant to surfactant flooding and sear surfactant related properties such as adsorption interfacial tension capillary pressure capillary number and microemulsion viscosity are all dependent on an accurate phase behavior model the laboratory studies provided essential information that was used for modeling the field application scenarios a multi phase simulation model was developed in utchem using laboratory measurements the utchem model phase behavior was then run and compared with calibrated the column experiment results prior to implementing the model for full scale simulations parameters such as hydraulic conductivity porosity and lnapl saturations were determined in the field by means of a tracer test from cone penetrometer cpt laser induced fluorescence lif measurements and from in situ water pressure measurements the simulation studies were then used to determine well spacing screened intervals injection extraction rates salt concentrations and injection extraction time periods for maximum lnapl recovery based on the simulation studies it was decided to employ a line drive pattern consisting of 15 injection wells and 15 extraction wells in two rows 5 m apart fig 4 the modeling studies also indicated that hydraulic control wells hcws injecting water up gradient of the injection wells and recovering water downgradient of the extraction wells would keep the injected fluids at a shallow depth within the formation where the targeted lnapl was located the final simulation model consisted of a 100 80 horizontal grid with 29 layers of different hydraulic conductivity the model was run on a pc with an intel core i7 processor and 16 gb of ram details of the simulation studies are discussed by de blanc et al 2016 and some details are presented here for the reader the field data together with data from pumping and slug tests were used to determine preliminary conservative estimates of horizontal hydraulic conductivity kh of approximately 8 6 m d 10 2 cm s this value of kh was used in a simulation of the tracer test in order to ascertain a more accurate value and determine the degree of aquifer heterogeneity in the field pumping was initiated and once steady draw down achieved a measured volume of sodium chloride solution was injected up gradient while samples were collected down gradient the samples were analyzed for chloride and result used for numerical simulation the tracer simulations suggested that the value of kh was closer to 15 m d and that the aquifer appeared to be isotropic with respect to hydraulic conductivity therefore a value of 15 m d was used in the hydraulic design simulations for both horizontal and vertical kv hydraulic conductivities other parameter values used in the simulations are listed in table 1 monitoring during the remediation monitoring of the site and flood performance was conducted during each stage to evaluate the performance of the process so that adjustments could be made if necessary water samples from monitoring and recovery wells were analyzed for electrical conductivity to understand the distribution of the injected brine in the aquifer these samples were also titrated for chloride and surfactant concentration electrical conductivity data loggers were installed in the recovery wells to detect breakthrough and to adjust the brine dosage laser induced fluorescence a lif high resolution probe using an ultra violet optical screening tool uvost was utilized to adjust and optimize various remediation stages lif is a real time in situ field screening method for residual and napl contaminants within subsurface soils capable of probing to depths up to 30 m the technology is useful for obtaining qualitative to semi quantitative information about subsurface contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in the simplest terms pahs will fluoresce when excited by ultra violet uv light contaminants containing pahs are excited by a uv laser fluoresce with an intensity that is quantifiable and related to the amount of pah this approach is employed by using a sapphire crystal window mounted on the side of a direct push probe which are constrained to use in unconsolidated media to depths of 50 to 100 ft depending on soil strength in this way a light source and detector can be installed on one side of the sapphire window allowing for detection of pahs on the other while the probe is pushed down through the subsurface and the data logged pah monitoring was important to measure the flood performance there are two methods available for deployment of the lif sensors cone penetrometer and percussion direct push rigs germain 2011 in this study the direct push method was utilized fuels and oils contain various amount of monoaromatic hydrocarbons mahs pahs and aliphatic hydrocarbons electrons in the aromatic molecules absorbs energy at a certain wavelength and emit fluorescence this spectrum is unique to each molecule and make it possible to discern the molecule from the fluorescence spectrum however because napls are usually mixtures that emit overlapping spectra it can be difficult to identify individual compounds from lif data lif is useful in determination of relative concentrations and type of product present in the subsurface germain 2011 mass discharge model the dissolution of napl into groundwater is a complicated process that is affected by subsurface properties heterogeneity napl properties and napl distribution due to these complexities remediation processes for napls fail to completely remove all the contaminants from the ground therefore relating partial mass removal to the reduction in contaminant mass flux reduction is of utmost importance to evaluate the performance of remediation effort contaminant mass flux mass discharge relationship to mass removal processes have been discussed in detail in literature fried et al 1979 mass removal and mass discharge relationship is significantly impacted by the napl distribution in subsurface and heterogeneity of the formation zhu and sykes 2000 difilippo and brusseau 2008 difilippo et al 2010 brusseau et al 2007 brown et al 2012 in heterogeneous aquifers a general approach is to approximate source strength by a power function of the remaining mass of napl in the source zone rao and jawitz 2003 rao et al 2001 as shown in the so called γ model eq 1 1 j t j o m t m o γ where j o is the initial mass discharge resulting from the initial mass m o in place and j t is the mass discharge resulting from the mass m t at time t and γ is an empirical factor that is dependent upon geology and properties of the napl contaminants falta et al 2005a the value of γ is strongly correlated to the heterogeneity of the field and dnapl architecture distribution of dnapl within the subsurface the γ factor often varies between 0 5 and 2 0 for dnapl sites for cases where γ 1 a significant mass reduction mt mo does not result in a corresponding reduction in mass flux jt jo conversely observing a small reduction in mass flux jt jo following a remediation effort should not be misinterpreted as an indication of failure likewise for γ 1 cases a large reduction in mass flux could be misconstrued as a large mass reduction the point is that measuring the post remediation mass flux at a site is not meaningful unless the γ factor is known falta et al 2005b if the γ factor is known the degree of mass reduction can be estimated by means of the mass flux measurements jt jo alkali hydrolysis treatment of the produced fluids was essential for the re use of the water separation of the produced fluids was also critical to determine the amount of lnapl recovered this was complicated by the presence of the surfactant in the produced fluids which created an emulsion and microemulsion that required 1 week to separate a treatment step was added to remove the surfactant alkaline hydrolysis is the reaction of esters with sodium hydroxide to create a carboxylate salt and alcohol alkaline hydrolysis of esters is also known as saponification r coor naoh rcoona roh ester base carboxylate soap alcohol the surfactants utilized in this field application are both sulfosuccinates i e sodium salts of alkyl esters of sulfosuccinic acid sulfosuccinates are very sensitive to hydrolysis under both acidic and basic conditions due to the presence of the ester linkage deepika and tyagi 2006 under basic conditions the oh group acts as a nucleophile and attacks the ester group which leads to formation of salt of sulfosuccinic acid and an alcohol according to batchu et al the hydrolysis of di octyl sulfosuccinate occurs under both acidic and basic conditions but the hydrolysis is more effective in the presence of strong base batchu et al 2014 testing in our laboratory confirmed that alkaline hydrolysis of the surfactant occurred and the time required for hydrolysis was also determined at the groundwater temperature at the site hence in this field application alkaline hydrolysis naoh was utilized to degrade the surfactant in the produced microemulsion so that the jet fuel and water could be separated after which the jet fuel was sold and the water treated for re use 3 field implementation execution based on the dimensions of the site and the well spacing field implementation was planned to be conducted in eight stages moving from up gradient to down gradient north to south although the simulation studies recommended 15 injection per row and 15 extraction wells per row to create a line drive pattern the last 5 rows down gradient of the site could only accommodate 13 wells fig 4 shows the pattern and location of the wells for stage 1 the progression of the field implementation would then proceed to the next row or stage after assessing the performance and instituting modifications if deemed necessary the direction of the hydraulically induced flow was from north to south which was parallel to the overall groundwater flow direction thus a similar pattern was followed for 7 stages although for stage 8 the direction of flow was reversed south to north as shown in fig 5 the hydraulic control injection and extraction wells were interchanged for stage 8 this was done to ensure that napl would not move out of the contaminated body in addition earlier studies indicated that the presence of fine sediment in the southern part of the field which could have prevented achieving sufficient pumping rates in the last stage the injection was started with a 54 m3 pre flush of brine solution followed by a 185 m3 of surfactant formulation flush the surfactant flush was chased with 305 m3 post flush of brine to continue pushing the mobilized lnapl to the extraction wells and to recover remaining microemulsion in the system the volumes used were calculated to be approximately 0 5 pore volume pv pre flush 3 pv surfactant flood and 3 5 pv post surfactant flood i e brine post flush since the swept pore volume in the field varies depending upon flow rates and on the size of a particular stage the volumes used are presented in the results section table 3 pressure flow rates and amount of lnapl recovered were recorded for each stage produced samples from the extraction wells were analyzed for chloride and surfactant concentration using titration electrical conductivity was measured to determine the breakthrough curves and estimate swept pore volume total recovery from a stage was calculated by measuring mobilized lnapl produced mobilized and the amount of lnapl separated from microemulsion using alkali hydrolysis as a method of confirming results i e for consistency and validation of the methods herein the soil was analyzed with lif after every stage which also served to properly optimize the next remediation stage after eight stages total recovery was confirmed using additional lif and chemical soil analysis soil analysis consisted of soil sample collection preservation and laboratory chemical analysis by a contract lab effectiveness of the remediation was also quantified based on the reduction of mass discharge hydrocarbons the transect method was utilized to measure mass discharge before and after the remediation the transect placed down gradient from the remediation body was 45 m wide and contained 6 wells with 35 total sampling points as depicted in fig 6 samples acquired from these points were analyzed for tph and btex the groundwater gradient was estimated by hydraulic heads in the wells and the hydraulic conductivity was estimated from slug tests and a geo probe hydraulic profiling tool hpt logs the mass discharge was estimated using the gsi mass flux tool kit baseline mass discharge was calculated based on 3 sampling events done from november 2014 to march 2015 the baseline measurement for gradient tph benzene and btex is tabulated in table 2 4 results and discussion total amount of surfactant co solvent sec butanol and brine injected in each stage of the remediation process are listed in table 3 because the aquifer was much deeper than the treated napl layer it is possible that some of the injected surfactant solution may have underrun below the napl layer before it contacted napl because of the difficulty in determining swept pore volume all of the reported volumes are in cubic meters instead of pore volumes in the field produced water was treated by an on site treatment plant which consisted of oil water separators a combined stripper bioreactor sand filters and two granular activated carbon gac filters initially surfactant and oil were detected in the treated water which was linked to the presence of surfactants in the produced water to address this problem alkaline hydrolysis was implemented as a pre treatment stage before the on site treatment plant laboratory studies tested alkaline hydrolysis of the surfactant formulation and demonstrated that the reaction time reaction temperature and ph of the solution were the controlling factors for the reaction it was determined that the relatively low groundwater temperature required longer reaction times so the produced groundwater was collected in large tanks for hydrolysis so that adequate reaction time could be maintained which was more economical than heating the produced water the ph was used as a control for hydrolysis and was always maintained higher than 12 on average 526 kg of the caustic solution naoh was added to the 50 000 l capacity treatment tank these treatment tanks were equipped with recirculation pumps to provide sufficient mixing of the solution the mass removal of napl was calculated using the mass recovered in the solubilized microemulsion from the extraction wells and hydraulic control wells and was separated in the hydrolysis tanks and also from the napl mass which was directly mobilized and captured from the oil water separator the amount of napl recovered from each stage is tabulated in table 4 the recovery from stage 5 6 and 7 were highest which was expected based on the fact that these stages were located in the zones of highest lif intensity the mobilized napl contributed to the majority of the recovery 93 of the total napl recovered highlighting the effectiveness of micellar flooding and is depicted graphically in fig 7 figs 8 and 9 report the mass removal and mass removal rates for stage 2 of the project comparing the recovery from the extraction wells fig 8 to the hydraulic control wells fig 9 a total of 40 m3 32 700 kg lnapl was recovered during the remediation the mass recovery rates are on the order of 25 and 45 g h in the hydraulic control wells fig 9 and showed little change as a result of the surfactant flush the recovery rates at the extraction wells were at a similar level as the hydraulic control wells and increased to levels between 10 000 g h and 37 000 g h as a result of the surfactant flush the fact that the mass of hydrocarbon arriving at the hydraulic control wells remained low when compared to the extraction wells which increased 3 orders of magnitude indicates good hydraulic control of the injected surfactant solution mass balance analyses were performed based on actual production data during remediation and on pre and post remedial investigation data including lif and chemical soil analysis both analyses showed that approximately 90 of the contamination was recovered from the source zone the remaining amount of lnapl on the site was estimated to be approximately 4 m3 2700 kg the average lif comparison of the pre remediation and post remediation heat maps based on lif measurements demonstrates the effectiveness of the remediation process fig 10 additionally the concentration of tph benzene and btex were measured at a downgradient transect after remediation see fig 6 for location of six wells each of these six wells are actually clusters that have a screened interval at different depths identified on the transect in fig 11 the well locations and number of screened intervals are labelled as a 3 screens b 5 screens c 5 screens d 5 screens e 3 screens and f 3 screens in addition to these samples we also sampled from wells locations slightly up and downgradient of the transect for comparison but we did not use the data for estimation of the mass discharge these data from six wells are compared to measurements made prior to remediation in fig 11 the contours shown in fig 11 were made using ordinary kriging method and measured concentrations of nearest neighbors flux measurements of hydrocarbons were also made in order to compute the mass flux after remediation and compare with the baseline measurements transect measurements document hydrocarbon concentration reductions up to 99 the flux calculations were made using the gsi mass flux toolkit freeware https www gsi net com en software free software mass flux toolkit html the reduction in mass flux is tabulated in table 5 and show a significant reduction after remediation for the btex compounds of 97 99 the tph mass flux was also reduced significantly of over 64 based on the conservative values in table 5 pre and post flush mass discharge measurements were utilized to correlate a γ factor based on the reduction in mass discharge according to the γ model based on the tph data and mass removal from the source zone the γ factor is estimated to range from 0 41 to 0 85 depending on the indicator tph benzene or btex the γ factor is in the range 0 51 0 69 if the groundwater gradient is considered steady at 1 during post monitoring the gradient varied from 0 5 2 0 and was more unstable than during the baseline monitoring when the gradient was stable around 1 therefore the variation of the gradient has had greater influence on the mass discharge than the measured concentration levels thus a steady gradient of 1 was used to estimate mass discharge instead of using the varying gradient in order to compare the mass discharge before and after remediation the mass flux for both the varying and steady gradient conditions were computed and the results for tph are compared in fig 12 to the baseline conditions which show reduction in mass flux of 93 2 for a varying gradient and 98 5 assuming a steady gradient 5 conclusion it is important to note several points regarding this project first that the surfactant flood used to mobilize and recover the lnapl was completed in a relatively short period of time the entire field project took less than six months including down time used to make measurements and confirm the design second the monitoring confirmed that the lnapl movement was hydraulically controlled and captured post surfactant flood analyses aqueous sampling lif measurements soil sampling of the site indicate over 90 of lnapl mass recovered the reduction in mass flux from the site 1 year after treatment is over 98 with respect to btex compounds with respect to total petroleum hydrocarbons the mass flux reduction is 64 assuming a varying gradient or 88 if a steady gradient is assumed the significance of the field work is important to consider in light of publications presenting laboratory work that cautioned against this approach for napl recovery after a period of interest from the early 1990s to early 2000s field implementation of surfactants declined although some publications presented the use of surfactants to increase solubility and recovery of napl by way of enhancing the conventional pump and treat approach this paper presents the first known full scale field application of micellar flooding to lnapl recovery from the subsurface by means of mobilization declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
1532,adsorption is a well known phenomenon that causes the remediation of btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene zeolite is typically useful for the removal of btex from groundwater in this study the migration of the btex plume was investigated in a bench scale tank model as a shallow aquifer the objective of this research was to analyze the performance of a natural zeolite in situ prb remediation technique natural zeolite was applied as a physical permeable reactive barrier in the first part of the experiment 40 ml of btex as a contaminant was injected at the injection point bi into the sand tank samples were taken periodically via 14 boreholes for btex test for 23 days and analyzed using a gc fid instrument the results indicated high removal rates of btex by passing through the zeolite barrier zeolite barrier reduced the btex concentration up to 90 of the initial value however the barrier efficiency started to decrease after 132 h since pollution injection reached a minimum amount 53 of the initial value due to occupying the free space and grain pore where btex was adsorbed onto the surface of zeolite thereby decreasing the barrier efficiency keywords 3d sand tank btex plume adsorption natural zeolite continuous flow 1 introduction there are a variety of methods for remediation of soils and groundwater media which have been classified into two main types 1 ex situ approaches where contaminated soils or groundwater or both are extracted and treated on site or off site and 2 in situ approaches in which polluted sites are directly remediated in subsurface sharma and reddy 2004 using in situ treatment technologies is often preferred because of the significant technical and economic advantages karn et al 2011 thomé et al 2015 as well as less impacts posed to the environment permeable reactive barriers prbs are in situ passive treatments for groundwater remediation careghini et al 2015 this technology can be an alternative method for contaminated sites instead of conventional pump and treat methods vignola et al 2011 phillips 2009 the prbs firstly reported by mcmurtry and elton 1985 as hydraulically permeable which react with groundwater and remove dissolved contaminants through sorption or biodegradation the first pilot test of a prb was conducted by the university of waterloo in ontario canada naidu and birke 2015 in the last decade prbs were an effective remediation technology primarily in the united states europe and australia thus research on prms has increased for continued development and implementation examples of prb

plume using the time domain reflectometry tdr method in a laboratory three dimensional sand tank model various materials such as zero valent iron activated carbon zeolites iron oxides oxyhydrates phosphates clay minerals and so on were used as the barrier in prbs agency 2012 agency 1995 zeolites have a three dimensional skeleton of aluminosilicates composed of water alkali metals and alkaline earth metals adebajo et al 2003 due to their particular characteristics such as ion exchange ability extensive surface area more than 150 m2 g high safety for non flammable quality high adsorption capacity and relatively affordable price zeolites have a suitable potential to clean up the environment from various materials such as oxyanions menhaje bena et al 2004 and organic molecules for example btex and mtbe torabian et al 2010 ghadiri et al 2010 clinoptilolite is a type of zeolite that is able to adsorb a variety of ions because of its high cation exchange and sorption capacities

reported the adsorption of aromatics and organic substances in the channel intersections and zigzag channels of zeolite bai et al 2014 song et al 2004 flow and mass transport modeling is an essential step to predict contaminant migration select clean up methods and prevent plume distribution physical modeling provides a better understanding about the behavior of pollutants in medium and is used to determine the optimal remediation method depending on various scenarios for scaling up tests the control of laboratory conditions is necessary to apply in the field nevertheless the experimental settings are difference from field conditions lópez vizcaíno et al 2016 several parameters are considered for the remediation process to predict and optimize the scale up from laboratory bench scale to field scale hansen et al 1999 the scale up of laboratory experiments was investigated by many researchers lim and lynch 2011 montero et al 1996 the influence of the scale change scale up on btex removal has been investigated for ph conductivity optimal velocity flow rate temperature btex removal time surface area adsorption thickness and the size of zeolite barrier therefore the predictions of real treatment efficiency were obtained by extrapolating the results of bench scale tests the experimental process at the pilot scale is similar to the laboratory procedure lagadec et al 2000 on the other hand the variation of the results is higher than the laboratory scale janin et al 2012 this research aims to study the processes of petroleum hydrocarbon remediation using prbs evaluate natural zeolite efficiency to adsorb hydrocarbon pollutants btex and assess the performance of a physical model to simulate the efficiency of prbs for this purpose a lab scale model sand tank was developed to simulate groundwater flow and movement of contaminants to assess the adsorption efficiency of the clinoptilolite type of zeolite as a prb 2 materials and methods to evaluate the ability of zeolite to reduce the btex concentration a bench scale model was employed in dynamic mode this model is used to simulate the shallow aquifer where the horizontal flow enters at the upstream dissolves the pollutant passes through the barrier and finally flows out through downstream boundary the sand tank was constructed with dimensions of 140 70 50 cm with a glassy framework and a sandy aquifer body of 0 25 to 0 35 mm the plan and cross sectional views of the model are shown in fig 1 an aluminum framework was used to increase the model strength and stability to control the flow and water level a float was used at the left boundary and a valve in the right boundary of the model boreholes made by stainless steel a diameter of 5 2 mm and a height of 1 m was used to observe water level and sampling aeolian sand was used as the aquifer body material after sieving and sorting to particle size ranging between 0 25 and 0 35 mm a very well sorted sand was employed with uniform grain size and high permeability the sand grains was composed of silica material to have the least amount of organic material and minimize sorption the clinoptilolite type of zeolite was utilized for the prb from garmsar city north of iran the optimum diameter of zeolite grains was obtained based on some experiments on the flow rate and water velocity using a primitive bench scale model in this model various grain sizes of zeolite were subjected to water flow along with measuring the flow rate and velocity an optimum grain size 125 250 μm established a reasonable flow velocity through the barrier the chemical composition of clinoptilolite was determined using x ray fluorescence xrf measurements including wt sio2 62 67 al2o3 10 12 fe2o3 0 5 1 0 cao 1 3 na2o 1 3 k2o 1 3 h2o 8 10 kazemian

shows sorption isotherm of btex with a 10 mg l solution the results represent that benzene o xylene ethylbenzene p xylene m xylene and toluene were adsorbed in the amounts of 1 26 0 91 1 26 4 91 5 51 and 1 29 mg g respectively an optimized arrangement of boreholes was considered within the model with minimum number of boreholes that could be located uniformly throughout the tank to know the situation of the contamination plume in the model therefore 14 boreholes were installed in the model for collecting samples the injection point of contaminants was assigned between rows a and c of boreholes 23 cm far from the upstream boundary of the model fig 3 the mounted wells were fixed at the specified location in the model then sand and zeolite were filled into the model simultaneously and compressed slowly to prevent channeling problem which may be caused by groundwater flow before the injection of the pollutant freshwater was released into the model and then upstream and downstream water levels were monitored to ensure a constant gradient and optimum level over the model set in the designing process therefore the water level was stabled in up and downstream of the aquifer at levels of 20 and 19 3 cm from the datum table 2 shows the times when groundwater reaches various sectors of the model and also presents the calculated flow velocity using darcy s law k q ia

barrier on the thickness of the saturated zone inside the model the discharge of water released from the model outlet was recorded several times before the oil injection furthermore the water acidity and salinity were measured by a ph meter and ec meter respectively at the up and downstream of the barrier ten ml of each btex compound with 99 purity were mixed 40 ml in total and injected below the water table in the saturated zone head of water 16 17 cm using a pipe fig 5 the contaminants were injected at the upstream of the model in the centerline 23 cm far from the right boundary the injection was carried out as a pulse with rapid and steady velocity by placing a cylindrical tube around the injection point the tube was not removed until the end of the injection to assess the quality control qc and the error decrease of analysis two rounds of sampling were carried out through the up and downward of the zeolite barrier as background samples to record the initial amount of btex both in the water and the model body then a number of duplicates at a2 c5 d8 d9 e12 and e13 boreholes were sampled three times totally 20 duplicate samples for each borehole a duplicate set of sampling tools was employed to avoid cross contamination sampling was performed from c5 and c8 boreholes because they were the closest boreholes to the injection point and located in the flow path every 10 min at the beginning of the experiment then the sampling intervals were 15 and 20 min hourly and daily following spreading the contamination plume sampling continued until the concentration of btex was higher at the downstream of the filter meaning that the zeolite had lost the ability of adsorption an almost logarithmic interval of sampling was scheduled according to plume distribution

poisoned by adding 1 8 ml of 10 sodium azide nan3 solution to prevent hydrocarbon biodegradation the collected samples were sealed by a tight teflon screw cap to prevent volatilization and gas escape and then transferred to the laboratory in cool conditions below 4 c to extract btex from the samples the teflon screw cap of the vial was removed quickly and 5 ml of the sample was crept with a glass stainless syringe then 8 mg of sodium chloride was added immediately the vial was placed inside an oven at 100 c to evaporate organic compounds to the space above the container and the phases were allowed to separate for 30 min the headspace gas was injected directly into the inlet of an hp5890 gc hewlett packard ca usa with a 30 m 0 250 mm i d 0 25 μm coated db 5ms column the carrier gas was helium with a flow rate of 0 7 ml min the chromatographic conditions were injection port temperature 250 c initial column temperature 45 c for 2 min and heating rate 5 c min to a final temperature of 105 c after 15 min hydrocarbons with retention times less than 15 min approximately n c5 to n c13 were detected by a fid detector hewlett packard california usa many site conditions including high hydraulic gradient high hydraulic conductivity long contaminant half life wide treatment zone and thick aquifer impact the prb hou et al 2014 in some studies the sorption rate coefficient increased with increasing pore water velocity and the barrier performance decreased with increasing travel time and flow velocity lim and lynch 2011 flow velocity and column boundary conditions influence the rate and long term prb performance the reduction in the hydraulic conductivity of field scale observed due to the precipitation the plugging in laboratory column and the accumulation of irons led to reduced reactivity permeability of zvi beds and treatment efficiency johnson et al 2008 an increase in groundwater velocity enhances source depletion the geometry of low permeability zones retardation factor and groundwater velocity influenced the remediation time tatti et al 2018 hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer was calculated by the measurement of discharge rate in the outlet and the groundwater head at the up and downstream of the model the discharge rate was measured six times every day for 23 days which ranged from 0 058 l min on the first day to 0 039 l min on the last day of the experiment the rate decrease can caused by the clay clogging or the saturation of the zeolite barrier using the contaminant sorption an average hydraulic gradient of 0 0063 was obtained for the water level at the upper and lower boundaries of the model therefore the hydraulic conductivity calculated as 94 6 m d at the beginning of the experiment decreased to 63 6 m d in the end day electrical conductivity increased from 605 to 3210 μs cm after flowing through prb fig 6 because of the partial releases dissolution of cl so4 2 na and ca 2 from the zeolite prb over time bus et al 2019 also the increase of ph is likely due to ca oh 2 formed as a result of interaction between ca in the zeolite structure and the oxygen of the air infiltration liu et al 2019 this range of ph 7 3 8 1 is suitable for zeolite absorption shengpin li et al 2014 moreover the production of acidic metabolites in the contaminant degradation process is responsible for ph depletion mosmeri et al 2019 gholami et al 2018 thus to inhibit the disadvantage of zeolite prb a combination of bacteria and zeolite barrier can be used to balance ph and improve the efficient performance of the barrier 3 results and discussion to prepare a sampling plan the boreholes were prioritized according to their position relative to the pollution migration route therefore a2 c5 d8 d9 e12 and e13 boreholes in the flow path located at up and upstream of prb were sampled frequently fig 7 concentration changes versus time in borehole a2 at the upstream of the injection point showed that the concentrations increased after 36 h of injection which could be due to mechanical dispersion the concentration of benzene is expected to be higher because of its higher solubility and mobility the concentration in borehole a2 near the injection point was also higher than two adjacent boreholes a1 and a2 with the highest concentrations of btex detected as 943 μg l at the 36th hour benzene plume reached the borehole c5 at the 4th hour with a concentration of 1800 μg l which increased up to a maximum value of 15 000 μg l at the 8th hour and then gradually decreased to 115 μg l at the end of the experiment figs 7a2 and 7c5 the boreholes d7 d8 d9 and d10 were located in the third row at a distance of 5 cm from the zeolite barrier benzene reached the third row of boreholes and maximized at 28th hour with a concentration of 10 879 μg l in borehole d9 this extra concentration was due to the low permeability of zeolite barrier the concentration of which increased only in upstream of the barrier after this stage the btex concentration gradually reduced to 76 33 and 22 22 μg l in the boreholes d8 and d9 respectively due to adsorption by the zeolite barrier figs 7d8 and 7d9 the last row of boreholes e11 e12 e13 and e14 in the model was located at 7 5 cm from the zeolite barrier in the downstream and 79 5 cm from the injection point figs 7e12 and 7e13 these boreholes were installed to monitor the pollutant transport across the reactive barrier and determine the amount of pollutant adsorption by the barrier time concentration curves of boreholes e12 and e13 show that the concentration had a minimum value at the 132nd hour implying that the barrier worked with high efficiency over time btex concentration increased in these boreholes due to reduced barrier efficiency as a result of feeding up possible zeolite adsorption sites this phenomenon resulted in increased concentrations up to 2353 and 1955 μg l in the boreholes e12 and e13 respectively at 249 h after the injection fig 8 shows isoconcentration curves of the contaminants and the concentration distance diagrams at different times by moving towards downstream the spreading of contamination in the direction of the water flow longitudinal spreading was higher than the transverse direction as the pollution spread downwards btex concentration reduced gradually monitoring of the contamination plume continued for 23 days after the start of the experiment leading to reduced barrier performance which caused an increase in the downstream concentration of the barrier after 240 h of the injection the plan view of the plume distribution revealed the process of plume extension and shrinkage during the experiment fig 8 at the 18th hour the concentrations of the two boreholes d8 and d9 were almost 2000 μg l approximately equal to half that of the c5 borehole a very low concentration 500 μg l was recorded in the other boreholes along the boundary of the model and downstream of the barrier after 32 h of the injection there was a significant movement of the plume from the injection point toward the reactive barrier and the boreholes d8 and d9 the concentration at the injection point decreased significantly from initial value and that behind the zeolite barrier reached 8000 μg l concentrations in these boreholes were approximately equal to that of borehole c5 after 42 h of the injection fig 8c until the last stage of the sampling the concentration reduced gradually due to the btex adsorption by the reactive barrier with uniform concentration changes at the same time plume dispersion in the middle and downstream of the model was more than the upstream and injection point btex concentrations at wells d8 and d9 approximately 3520 μg l and at well c5 2540 μg l were higher than the upstream 1500 μg l at the 52nd hours fig 8d at the 80th hour btex concentration reached below 1500 μg l at the middle of the model at the 240th hour however the concentration reduced at upstream of the barrier while it increased in the downstream fig 8e and f the last sampling at 533 h demonstrated that the plume relatively passed across the barrier and discharged from the model through the outlet the concentration in the downstream of the barrier was comparatively higher than the upstream due to the gradual release of residual contaminants in the reactive barrier residual concentrations were also observed in the main boreholes due to some adsorption of btex by the aquifer body to analyze the btex behavior along the flow direction the concentration data were plotted relative to the location of five main boreholes during the experimental time intervals changes of btex concentrations and the movement of the components can be interpreted based on processes affecting the reduction of hydrocarbons including dissolution evaporation adsorption and biological degradation btex compounds have high solubility in water compared with other hydrocarbons among these compounds benzene has the highest solubility of about 1780 mg l and other components including toluene xylene and ethylbenzene had values of 500 150 and 150 mg l respectively other than dissolution advection dispersion and sorption the volatility and adsorption were the other processes that influenced the movement of hydrocarbons in this research the adsorption of organic compounds especially inside the barrier is the most important process of controlling the spread of contamination because of the same conditions in the aquifer body the volatilization and biodegradation were ignored in this research furthermore the concentrations at the up and downstream of the barrier are the key parameter to evaluate the zeolite barrier efficiency to omit the effects of other parameters except the adsorption a row of boreholes was assigned at the upstream and very close to the barrier this means that the concentration of the contaminants can be measured exactly before entering and after flowing through the barrier due to the fine texture of the zeolite barrier the volatilization can also be ignored during plume passing through the tank besides industrial zeolite was used here to minimize the microbial colonization and ensure a minimum biodegradation process according to fig 9 benzene has a high concentration because of high solubility and it is the first component of the btex plume that spread in the aquifer after 44 h at this time the concentrations of benzene in boreholes d8 and d9 are much higher than the other btex components the concentrations of xylenes and ethylbenzene increased whereas that of toluene decreased from 60 to 132nd hours because of low solubility and less mobility of xylenes and ethylbenzene this caused a delay in movement and therefore they reached boreholes following benzene and toluene plumes at the last time the 533rd hour the lowest and the highest concentrations in borehole d8 belonged to benzene and xylene among the other members of btex a comparison of the contaminant concentrations at both sides of the barrier revealed that the treatment efficiency was up to 99 8 at the mean time of the experiment a similar result was reported by torabian et al 2010 in which the btex removal efficiency 95 85 decreased with increasing the ph 3 0 10 0 torabian et al 2010 also results of btex adsorption on the modified zeolite showed that the sorption capacity of the adsorbent decreased 97 75 by rising ph 3 11 torabian et al 2010 removal efficiencies of a funnel and gate barrier were in the range of 63 96 for toluene ethylbenzene and xylene guerin et al 2002 the removal efficiencies of smectite organoclay for btex multi solute system ranged between 30 and 90 at a ph of 9 carvalho et al 2012 after modifying zeolite adsorption efficiencies of btex increased to greater than 80 vidal et al 2012b clinoptilolite capacity in fixed beds is approximately 50 of those in equivalent batch systems woinarski et al 2006 vignola et al 2011 reported excellent efficiency 96 of btex removal for zsm 5 prb vignola et al 2011 table 4 shows an increase of 34 94 5 in the barrier efficiency for 2 h which continues to remove btex until 44 h after the injection at the132nd hour of the injection the barrier efficiency started to decrease and reached a minimum value the treatment efficiency of the barrier was calculated after 23 days of the experiment table 4 it initiated with 33 in the first day and gained a maximum value of 99 6 in the third day the decreased barrier efficiency in the fifth day of the experiment showed that the filter reached the maximum potential of adsorption and needed replacement 4 conclusion in the boreholes located at the upstream of the injection point contaminant concentrations increased up to 9600 μg l due to mechanical dispersion the initial concentrations of btex were almost 250 and 10 000 μg l at 0 2 and 6 h respectively the concentrations of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene were approximately 130 46 40 and 30 μg l at 0 2 h and 5700 2900 770 and 600 μg l at 6 h respectively the average flow velocity in the model was equal to 2 6 cm min and the plume reached the zeolite barrier at 23 h after pollution injection the results showed a high efficiency of btex removal with maximum adsorption of benzene 90 61 followed by toluene 88 02 xylene 84 29 and ethylbenzene 82 21 respectively during passing through zeolite barrier therefore the clinoptilolite type of zeolite with a grain size of 0 1 0 25 μm was able to adsorb btex pollutants a comparison of the contaminant concentrations at both sides of the barrier revealed that a 25 cm barrier of zeolite could reduce the btex concentration by up to 98 although the model results need to be scaled up for field scale applications however the barrier efficiency started to decrease at 132 h after pollution injection and reached a minimum value 53 of initial value despite the high efficiency of the prb to remove btex from groundwater increasing water salinity by the zeolite barrier is a side effect that needs further treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

1532,adsorption is a well known phenomenon that causes the remediation of btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene zeolite is typically useful for the removal of btex from groundwater in this study the migration of the btex plume was investigated in a bench scale tank model as a shallow aquifer the objective of this research was to analyze the performance of a natural zeolite in situ prb remediation technique natural zeolite was applied as a physical permeable reactive barrier in the first part of the experiment 40 ml of btex as a contaminant was injected at the injection point bi into the sand tank samples were taken periodically via 14 boreholes for btex test for 23 days and analyzed using a gc fid instrument the results indicated high removal rates of btex by passing through the zeolite barrier zeolite barrier reduced the btex concentration up to 90 of the initial value however the barrier efficiency started to decrease after 132 h since pollution injection reached a minimum amount 53 of the initial value due to occupying the free space and grain pore where btex was adsorbed onto the surface of zeolite thereby decreasing the barrier efficiency keywords 3d sand tank btex plume adsorption natural zeolite continuous flow 1 introduction there are a variety of methods for remediation of soils and groundwater media which have been classified into two main types 1 ex situ approaches where contaminated soils or groundwater or both are extracted and treated on site or off site and 2 in situ approaches in which polluted sites are directly remediated in subsurface sharma and reddy 2004 using in situ treatment technologies is often preferred because of the significant technical and economic advantages karn et al 2011 thomé et al 2015 as well as less impacts posed to the environment permeable reactive barriers prbs are in situ passive treatments for groundwater remediation careghini et al 2015 this technology can be an alternative method for contaminated sites instead of conventional pump and treat methods vignola et al 2011 phillips 2009 the prbs firstly reported by mcmurtry and elton 1985 as hydraulically permeable which react with groundwater and remove dissolved contaminants through sorption or biodegradation the first pilot test of a prb was conducted by the university of waterloo in ontario canada naidu and birke 2015 in the last decade prbs were an effective remediation technology primarily in the united states europe and australia thus research on prms has increased for continued development and implementation examples of prb

plume using the time domain reflectometry tdr method in a laboratory three dimensional sand tank model various materials such as zero valent iron activated carbon zeolites iron oxides oxyhydrates phosphates clay minerals and so on were used as the barrier in prbs agency 2012 agency 1995 zeolites have a three dimensional skeleton of aluminosilicates composed of water alkali metals and alkaline earth metals adebajo et al 2003 due to their particular characteristics such as ion exchange ability extensive surface area more than 150 m2 g high safety for non flammable quality high adsorption capacity and relatively affordable price zeolites have a suitable potential to clean up the environment from various materials such as oxyanions menhaje bena et al 2004 and organic molecules for example btex and mtbe torabian et al 2010 ghadiri et al 2010 clinoptilolite is a type of zeolite that is able to adsorb a variety of ions because of its high cation exchange and sorption capacities

reported the adsorption of aromatics and organic substances in the channel intersections and zigzag channels of zeolite bai et al 2014 song et al 2004 flow and mass transport modeling is an essential step to predict contaminant migration select clean up methods and prevent plume distribution physical modeling provides a better understanding about the behavior of pollutants in medium and is used to determine the optimal remediation method depending on various scenarios for scaling up tests the control of laboratory conditions is necessary to apply in the field nevertheless the experimental settings are difference from field conditions lópez vizcaíno et al 2016 several parameters are considered for the remediation process to predict and optimize the scale up from laboratory bench scale to field scale hansen et al 1999 the scale up of laboratory experiments was investigated by many researchers lim and lynch 2011 montero et al 1996 the influence of the scale change scale up on btex removal has been investigated for ph conductivity optimal velocity flow rate temperature btex removal time surface area adsorption thickness and the size of zeolite barrier therefore the predictions of real treatment efficiency were obtained by extrapolating the results of bench scale tests the experimental process at the pilot scale is similar to the laboratory procedure lagadec et al 2000 on the other hand the variation of the results is higher than the laboratory scale janin et al 2012 this research aims to study the processes of petroleum hydrocarbon remediation using prbs evaluate natural zeolite efficiency to adsorb hydrocarbon pollutants btex and assess the performance of a physical model to simulate the efficiency of prbs for this purpose a lab scale model sand tank was developed to simulate groundwater flow and movement of contaminants to assess the adsorption efficiency of the clinoptilolite type of zeolite as a prb 2 materials and methods to evaluate the ability of zeolite to reduce the btex concentration a bench scale model was employed in dynamic mode this model is used to simulate the shallow aquifer where the horizontal flow enters at the upstream dissolves the pollutant passes through the barrier and finally flows out through downstream boundary the sand tank was constructed with dimensions of 140 70 50 cm with a glassy framework and a sandy aquifer body of 0 25 to 0 35 mm the plan and cross sectional views of the model are shown in fig 1 an aluminum framework was used to increase the model strength and stability to control the flow and water level a float was used at the left boundary and a valve in the right boundary of the model boreholes made by stainless steel a diameter of 5 2 mm and a height of 1 m was used to observe water level and sampling aeolian sand was used as the aquifer body material after sieving and sorting to particle size ranging between 0 25 and 0 35 mm a very well sorted sand was employed with uniform grain size and high permeability the sand grains was composed of silica material to have the least amount of organic material and minimize sorption the clinoptilolite type of zeolite was utilized for the prb from garmsar city north of iran the optimum diameter of zeolite grains was obtained based on some experiments on the flow rate and water velocity using a primitive bench scale model in this model various grain sizes of zeolite were subjected to water flow along with measuring the flow rate and velocity an optimum grain size 125 250 μm established a reasonable flow velocity through the barrier the chemical composition of clinoptilolite was determined using x ray fluorescence xrf measurements including wt sio2 62 67 al2o3 10 12 fe2o3 0 5 1 0 cao 1 3 na2o 1 3 k2o 1 3 h2o 8 10 kazemian

shows sorption isotherm of btex with a 10 mg l solution the results represent that benzene o xylene ethylbenzene p xylene m xylene and toluene were adsorbed in the amounts of 1 26 0 91 1 26 4 91 5 51 and 1 29 mg g respectively an optimized arrangement of boreholes was considered within the model with minimum number of boreholes that could be located uniformly throughout the tank to know the situation of the contamination plume in the model therefore 14 boreholes were installed in the model for collecting samples the injection point of contaminants was assigned between rows a and c of boreholes 23 cm far from the upstream boundary of the model fig 3 the mounted wells were fixed at the specified location in the model then sand and zeolite were filled into the model simultaneously and compressed slowly to prevent channeling problem which may be caused by groundwater flow before the injection of the pollutant freshwater was released into the model and then upstream and downstream water levels were monitored to ensure a constant gradient and optimum level over the model set in the designing process therefore the water level was stabled in up and downstream of the aquifer at levels of 20 and 19 3 cm from the datum table 2 shows the times when groundwater reaches various sectors of the model and also presents the calculated flow velocity using darcy s law k q ia in this model a fixed head was considered at the left and right boundaries kb 1 2 1 and the rest of the faces profits to a default no flow impermeable condition table 3 for mass transport conditions a

barrier on the thickness of the saturated zone inside the model the discharge of water released from the model outlet was recorded several times before the oil injection furthermore the water acidity and salinity were measured by a ph meter and ec meter respectively at the up and downstream of the barrier ten ml of each btex compound with 99 purity were mixed 40 ml in total and injected below the water table in the saturated zone head of water 16 17 cm using a pipe fig 5 the contaminants were injected at the upstream of the model in the centerline 23 cm far from the right boundary the injection was carried out as a pulse with rapid and steady velocity by placing a cylindrical tube around the injection point the tube was not removed until the end of the injection to assess the quality control qc and the error decrease of analysis two rounds of sampling were carried out through the up and downward of the zeolite barrier as background samples to record the initial amount of btex both in the water and the model body then a number of duplicates at a2 c5 d8 d9 e12 and e13 boreholes were sampled three times totally 20 duplicate samples for each borehole a duplicate set of sampling tools was employed to avoid cross contamination sampling was performed from c5 and c8 boreholes because they were the closest boreholes to the injection point and located in the flow path every 10 min at the beginning of the experiment then the sampling intervals were 15 and 20 min hourly and daily following spreading the contamination plume sampling continued until the concentration of btex was higher at the downstream of the filter meaning that the zeolite had lost the ability of adsorption an almost logarithmic interval of sampling was scheduled according to plume distribution

and then transferred to the laboratory in cool conditions below 4 c to extract btex from the samples the teflon screw cap of the vial was removed quickly and 5 ml of the sample was crept with a glass stainless syringe then 8 mg of sodium chloride was added immediately the vial was placed inside an oven at 100 c to evaporate organic compounds to the space above the container and the phases were allowed to separate for 30 min the headspace gas was injected directly into the inlet of an hp5890 gc hewlett packard ca usa with a 30 m 0 250 mm i d 0 25 μm coated db 5ms column the carrier gas was

factor and groundwater velocity influenced the remediation time tatti et al 2018 hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer was calculated by the measurement of discharge rate in the outlet and the groundwater head at the up and downstream of the model the discharge rate was measured six times every day for 23 days which ranged from 0 058 l min on the first day to 0 039 l min on the last day of the experiment the rate decrease can caused by the clay clogging or the saturation of the zeolite barrier using the contaminant sorption an average hydraulic gradient of 0 0063 was obtained for the water level at the upper and lower boundaries of the model therefore the hydraulic conductivity calculated as 94 6 m d at the beginning of the experiment decreased to 63 6 m d in the end day electrical conductivity increased from 605 to 3210 μs cm after flowing through prb fig 6 because of the partial releases dissolution of cl so4 2 na and ca 2 from the zeolite prb over time bus et al

gholami et al 2018 thus to inhibit the disadvantage of zeolite prb a combination of bacteria and zeolite barrier can be used to balance ph and improve the efficient performance of the barrier 3 results and discussion to prepare a sampling plan the boreholes were prioritized according to their position relative to the pollution migration route therefore a2 c5 d8 d9 e12 and e13 boreholes in the flow path located at up and upstream of prb were sampled frequently fig 7 concentration changes versus time in borehole a2 at the upstream of the injection point showed that the concentrations increased after 36 h of injection which could be due to mechanical dispersion the concentration of benzene is expected to be higher because of its higher solubility and mobility the concentration in borehole a2 near the injection point was also higher than two adjacent boreholes a1 and a2 with the highest concentrations of btex detected as 943 μg l at the 36th hour benzene plume reached the borehole c5 at the 4th hour with a concentration of 1800 μg l which increased up to a maximum value of 15 000 μg l at the 8th hour and then gradually decreased to 115 μg l at the end of the experiment figs 7a2 and 7c5 the boreholes d7 d8 d9 and d10 were located in the third row at a distance of 5 cm from the zeolite barrier benzene reached the third row of boreholes and maximized at 28th hour with a concentration of 10 879 μg l in borehole d9 this extra concentration was due to the low permeability of zeolite barrier the concentration of which increased only in upstream of the barrier after this stage the btex concentration gradually reduced to 76 33 and 22 22 μg l in the boreholes d8 and d9 respectively due to adsorption by the zeolite barrier figs 7d8 and 7d9 the last row of boreholes e11 e12 e13 and e14 in the model was located at 7 5 cm from the zeolite barrier in the downstream and 79 5 cm from the injection point figs 7e12 and 7e13 these boreholes were installed to monitor the pollutant transport across the reactive barrier and determine the amount of pollutant adsorption by the barrier time concentration curves of boreholes e12 and e13 show that the concentration had a minimum value at the 132nd hour implying that the barrier worked with high efficiency over time btex concentration increased in these boreholes due to reduced barrier efficiency as a result of feeding up possible zeolite adsorption sites this phenomenon resulted in increased concentrations up to 2353 and 1955 μg l in the boreholes e12 and e13 respectively at 249 h after the injection fig 8 shows isoconcentration curves of the contaminants and the concentration distance diagrams at different times by moving towards downstream the spreading of contamination in the direction of the water flow longitudinal spreading was higher than the transverse direction as the pollution spread downwards btex concentration reduced gradually monitoring of the contamination plume continued for 23 days after the start of the experiment leading to reduced barrier performance which caused an increase in the downstream concentration of the barrier after 240 h of the injection the plan view of the plume distribution revealed the process of plume extension and shrinkage during the experiment fig 8 at the 18th hour the concentrations of the two boreholes d8 and d9 were almost 2000 μg l approximately equal to half that of the c5 borehole a very low concentration 500 μg l was recorded in the other boreholes along the boundary of the model and downstream of the barrier after 32 h of the injection there was a significant movement of the plume from the injection point toward the reactive barrier and the boreholes d8 and d9 the concentration at the injection point decreased significantly from initial value and that behind the zeolite barrier reached 8000 μg l concentrations in these boreholes were approximately equal to that of borehole c5 after 42 h of the injection fig 8c until the last stage of the sampling the concentration reduced gradually due to the btex adsorption by the reactive barrier with uniform concentration changes at the same time plume dispersion in the middle and downstream of the model was more than the upstream and injection point btex concentrations at wells d8 and d9 approximately 3520 μg l and at well c5 2540 μg l were higher than the upstream 1500 μg l at the 52nd hours fig 8d at the 80th hour btex concentration reached below 1500 μg l at the middle of the model at the 240th hour however the concentration reduced at upstream of the barrier while it increased in the downstream fig 8e and f the last sampling at 533 h demonstrated that the plume relatively passed across the barrier and discharged from the model through the outlet the concentration in the downstream of the barrier was comparatively higher than the upstream due to the gradual release of residual contaminants in the reactive barrier residual concentrations were also observed in the main boreholes due to some adsorption of btex by the aquifer body to analyze the btex behavior along the flow direction the concentration data were plotted relative to the location of five main boreholes during the experimental time intervals changes of btex concentrations and the movement of the components can be interpreted based on processes affecting the reduction of hydrocarbons including dissolution evaporation adsorption and biological degradation btex compounds have high solubility in water compared with other hydrocarbons among these compounds benzene has the highest solubility of about 1780 mg l and other components including toluene xylene and ethylbenzene had values of 500 150 and 150 mg l respectively other than dissolution advection dispersion and sorption the volatility and adsorption were the other processes that influenced the movement of hydrocarbons in this research the adsorption of organic compounds especially inside the barrier is the most important process of controlling the spread of contamination because of the same conditions in the aquifer body the volatilization and biodegradation were ignored in this research furthermore the concentrations at the up and downstream of the barrier are the key parameter to evaluate the zeolite barrier efficiency to omit the effects of other parameters except the adsorption a row of boreholes was assigned at the upstream and very close to the barrier this means that the concentration of the contaminants can be measured exactly before entering and after flowing through the barrier due to the fine texture of the zeolite barrier the volatilization can also be ignored during plume passing through the tank besides industrial zeolite was used here to minimize the microbial colonization and ensure a minimum biodegradation process according to fig 9 benzene has a high concentration because of high solubility and it is the first component of the btex plume that spread in the aquifer after 44 h at this time the concentrations of benzene in boreholes d8 and d9 are much higher than the other btex components the concentrations of xylenes and ethylbenzene increased whereas that of toluene decreased from 60 to 132nd hours because of low solubility and less mobility of xylenes and ethylbenzene this caused a delay in movement and therefore they reached boreholes following benzene and toluene plumes at the last time the 533rd hour the lowest and the highest concentrations in borehole d8 belonged to benzene and xylene among the other members of btex a comparison of the contaminant concentrations at both sides of the barrier revealed that the treatment efficiency was up to 99 8 at the mean time of the experiment a similar result was reported by torabian et al 2010 in which the btex removal efficiency 95 85 decreased with increasing the ph 3 0 10 0 torabian et al 2010 also results of btex adsorption on the modified zeolite showed that the sorption capacity of the adsorbent decreased 97 75 by rising ph 3 11 torabian et al 2010 removal efficiencies of a funnel and gate barrier were in the range of 63 96 for toluene ethylbenzene and xylene guerin et al 2002 the removal efficiencies of smectite organoclay for btex multi solute system ranged between 30 and 90 at a ph of 9 carvalho et al 2012 after modifying zeolite adsorption efficiencies of btex increased to greater than 80 vidal et al 2012b clinoptilolite capacity in fixed beds is approximately 50 of those in equivalent batch systems woinarski et al 2006 vignola et al 2011 reported excellent efficiency 96 of btex removal for zsm 5 prb vignola et al 2011 table 4 shows an increase of 34 94 5 in the barrier efficiency for 2 h which continues to remove btex until 44 h after the injection at the132nd hour of the injection the barrier efficiency started to decrease and reached a minimum value the treatment efficiency of the barrier was calculated after 23 days of the experiment table 4 it initiated with 33 in the first day and gained a maximum value of 99 6 in the third day the decreased barrier efficiency in the fifth day of the experiment showed that the filter reached the maximum potential of adsorption and needed replacement 4 conclusion in the boreholes located at the upstream of the injection point contaminant concentrations increased up to 9600 μg l due to mechanical dispersion the initial concentrations of btex were almost 250 and 10 000 μg l at 0 2 and 6 h respectively the concentrations of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene were approximately 130 46 40 and 30 μg l at 0 2 h and 5700 2900 770 and 600 μg l at 6 h respectively the average flow velocity in the model was equal to 2 6 cm min and the plume reached the zeolite barrier at 23 h after pollution injection the results showed a high efficiency of btex removal with maximum adsorption of benzene 90 61 followed by toluene 88 02 xylene 84 29 and ethylbenzene 82 21 respectively during passing through zeolite barrier therefore the clinoptilolite type of zeolite with a grain size of 0 1 0 25 μm was able to adsorb btex pollutants a comparison of the contaminant concentrations at both sides of the barrier revealed that a 25 cm barrier of zeolite could reduce the btex concentration by up to 98 although the model results need to be scaled up for field scale applications however the barrier efficiency started to decrease at 132 h after pollution injection and reached a minimum value 53 of initial value despite the high efficiency of the prb to remove btex from groundwater increasing water salinity

1533,during the long term operation of a disposal repository gas will be inevitably generated determination of gas permeability of compacted bentonite is of great importance for the safety assessment of the engineered barrier system in the present work the steady state and residual pressure methods were employed to determine the gas permeability of gaomiaozi gmz bentonite with consideration of variations in liquid saturation dry density and confining pressure results show that gas migration in saturated gmz bentonite was mainly controlled by diffusion with an effective gas permeability of 1e 23 m2 1e 25 m2 while in unsaturated gmz bentonite significant gas flow rates could be observed which increased stably with the increase of gas injection pressure klinkenberg effect was significant when gas flow through gmz bentonite the klinkenberg corrected gas permeability decreased by 3 5 5 5 orders of magnitude as the liquid saturation increased from 10 to 70 a decreasing magnitude of 1 2 orders in klinkenberg corrected gas permeability was presented with the dry density increased from 1 5 mg m3 and 1 7 mg m3 the klinkenberg corrected gas permeability decreased by 0 1 orders of magnitude as the confining pressure increased from 3 mpa to 7 mpa by using the accessible porosity gas measured intrinsic permeability could be determined with values ranged between 1e 15 m2 to 4e 15 m2 which was higher than the water measured one by 5 orders of magnitude additionally a generalized power law was successfully adopted in this study to describe the evolution of gas relative permeability with the liquid saturation overall the effective gas permeability klinkenberg corrected gas permeability intrinsic and relative permeability determined in this study provided a comprehensive perspective to assess the buffering property of gmz bentonite in multi physical field coupling environment the parameters obtained can be adopted in further simulation works for long term safety analysis of the disposal repository from the viewpoint of gas migration keywords gas permeability gmz bentonite diffusion klinkenberg effect intrinsic permeability 1 introduction for disposal of high level radioactive wastes deep geological disposal is a widely accepted technology which relies on a multi barrier system that typically includes a metal waste canister buffer backfill materials and natural geological formations to isolate the radioactive nuclides from the biosphere fig 1 bentonite has been chosen by several countries for using as buffering materials due to its high swelling capacity low permeability and high absorption capacity yong et al 1986 komine 2004 ye et al 2009 tang et al 2011a zhang et al 2012 sellin and leupin 2013 zhang et al 2016 investigations confirmed that during the long term operation of the multi barrier repository gas could be generated due to corrosion of the metallic waste canister radiolysis of water and degradation of organic materials etc liu et al 2015 xu et al 2017 mon et al 2017 then the gas generated would be accumulated to form high gas pressure or escape through the bentonite based buffering materials by diffusion visco capillary or even dilatant pathway flow to the living environment resulting in losing efficacy or even failure of the barrier system more importantly in the repository environment the coupling effects of geo stress and groundwater infiltration from the surrounding geological formations play important roles in gas migration in the bentonite based buffering materials dossier 2005 liu et al 2014 2015 therefore a thorough understanding of gas permeability of the compacted bentonite with consideration of variations in liquid saturation dry density and confining pressure is worthy of in depth investigations pusch et al 1985 harrington et al 2012 liu et al 2014 vardon et al 2013 in the previous researches performed on bentonite based buffering materials the liquid saturation was proved to be one of the most important factors in determining gas permeability when the bentonite specimen approached being saturated 99 gas permeability could only be measured until gas breakthrough occurred at a high gas pressure due to its excellent capillary sealing capacity in this scenario a discrete gas flow was normally characterized which resulted in an extremely low and fluctuated gas permeability pusch et al 1985 harrington and horseman 2003 marschall et al 2005 tanai and yui 2011 based on the tests performed on saturated compacted mx80 bentonite with a dry density around 1 7 mg m3 pusch et al 1985 and horseman et al 1999 suggested that an effective gas permeability ranging between 1e 21 m2 to 1e 20 m2 could be recognized as the typical values as the liquid saturation of the bentonite decreased and fallen below the critical value around 90 a stable and significant evolution in effective gas permeability could be observed gallé 1998 liu et al 2015 2018 wei et al 2019 for specimens with given dry densities ranging between 1 5 mg m3 to 1 9 mg m3 the effective gas permeability normally decreased from 1e 18 m2 to 1e 21 m2 with the liquid saturation increased from 70 to 100 or from 1e 14 m2 to 1e 19 m2 with that increased from 45 to 85 gallé 1998 wei et al 2019 meanwhile the effective gas permeability of compacted bentonite was significantly influenced by dry density as dry density increased from 1 6 mg m3 to 1 9 mg m3 gas permeability normally decreased from 1e 15 m2 to 1e 18 m2 or from 1e 16 m2 to 1e 19 m2 for a specific liquid saturation of 70 and 80 respectively that is to say a 0 1 variation in density led to 1 order of magnitude changes in effective gas permeability gallé 1998 the mechanical effects on gas permeability of compacted bentonite had also been studied by liu et al 2015 2018 wei et al 2019 etc common conclusions could be reached that the effective gas permeability of the materials were sensitive to changes in the confining pressure a 2 order of magnitude decrease in effective gas permeability was commonly observed with confining pressure increasing from 1 mpa to 8 mpa the effective gas permeability changes in a wide range of 1e 16 m2 to 1e 20 m2 depending on the dry density and liquid saturation of the compacted bentonite gmz bentonite which was extracted from gaomiaozi county in the inner mongolia autonomous region 300 km northwest from beijing is selected preferentially as the buffering materials for construction of engineering barrier in the deep geological repository in china ye et al 2009 wei et al 2019 conducted gas permeability tests on unsaturated gmz bentonite and found that increases in liquid saturation or confining stress could induce almost 3 orders of magnitude in decreasing gas permeability higher degree of saturation and lower initial dry density led to faster decreases of gas permeability during loading process more importantly gas migration in the low medially saturated compacted bentonite was dominated by single phase advection in the connected gas filled pores which was different from that in saturated bentonite therefore a thorough understanding of gas migration behavior in gmz bentonite should be reached by performing comprehensive analyses in various gas flow parameters including the effective gas permeability intrinsic permeability and relative permeability in a multi physical fields coupled environment however according to the conventional two phase flow theory changes in dry density confining pressure or liquid saturation will lead to variations in intrinsic permeability and relative permeability furthermore microstructure of bentonite will change with the water uptake loss process leading to enlarge the difficulties in measurement and analysis of intrinsic or relative permeability of bentonite ye et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 chen et al 2014 xu et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 up to now previous studies have mainly focused on evolution of the effective gas permeability while investigations on intrinsic or relative permeability were rarely reported in this study a series of gas permeability tests on gmz bentonite specimens were performed influences of liquid saturation dry density and confining pressure on gas migration were comprehensively investigated relevant parameters were analyzed and determined results obtained can provide a solid basis for the future gas migration simulations which are of great importance to the safety assessment of the geological repository 2 experimental investigations 2 1 materials and specimen preparation the gmz bentonite tested in this work was a grey powder the fundamental properties of the bentonite were reported in wen 2006 table 1 in which a high cation exchange capacity and adsorption ability as well as a large proportion of montmorillonite 75 4 in mass can be identified in this study all the gas permeability tests conducted on unsaturated and saturated gmz bentonite specimens were listed in fig 2 for specimen preparation gmz bentonite powder was sealed in chambers with suction control using the vapour phase technique saturated saline solutions kno3 nacl and k2co3 were employed for suction control corresponding to an initial water content of 18 12 14 12 and 10 13 respectively tang and cui 2005 meanwhile for preparation of relatively dry specimens the bentonite powder was oven dried at 60 c for 3 days to achieve a water content of 3 50 then according to the target cylindrical specimen with a height of 10 mm diameter of 50 mm and a dry density of 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 or 1 7 mg m3 the bentonite powder prepared was weighed and put into a compaction mould static compaction was performed at a displacement rate of 0 1 mm min after the target vertical displacement reached the maximum compaction load was kept for 60 mins for homogenization of the specimen it should be noted that the liquid saturation of the specimen can be easily calculated according to the water content controlled and the designed dry density of the specimen compacted e g for specimens with a dry density of 1 5 mg m3 an initial water content 18 12 corresponds to a liquid saturation 58 0 for a dry density of 1 7 mg m3 an initial water content of 18 12 corresponds to a liquid saturation 72 5 etc 2 2 apparatus and test procedures 2 2 1 gas permeability tests on saturated gmz bentonite specimens the residual pressure method wollenweber et al 2010 hildenbrand et al 2012 busch and hildenbrand 2013 was employed for determining gas permeability of saturated gmz bentonite specimens in this study apparatus presented in fig 3 was designed which is composed of test cells manufactured using 316 l stainless steel gas liquid volume pressure controllers with an accuracy of 1 mm3 in volume and 1 kpa in pressure a helium gas cylinder some pressure regulators an inlet buffer tank a digital pressure gauge 20 mpa and a data acquisition unit etc for conducting gas permeability tests under constant volume conditions an as prepared specimen was assembled into the apparatus as shown in fig 3 a then using the liquid volume pressure controller a constant injection pressure of 1 mpa was applied at the top of the specimen with an outlet at the bottom of the specimen opened to the atmosphere the water infiltrated was recorded using the liquid volume pressure controller when a continuous water outflow was observed at the downstream and the variation of the water injected was getting stabilized may after 10 days infiltration the specimen was recognized as being saturated s w 0 99 finally the water measured intrinsic permeability could be determined using darcy s law horseman et al 1999 xu et al 2017 subsequently the outlet at the top of the specimen was connected to a volume pressure controller with an initial pressure of 0 kpa while the inlet at the bottom of the specimen was connected to the gas volume pressure controller with a fixed inner volume and target gas pressure then the gas permeability test was started with gas infiltrated from the bottom of the specimen and gas pressures in both controllers were recorded until the difference between the two pressures was stabilized which was identified by the change of the pressure difference lower than 0 03 mpa 24 h hildenbrand et al 2012 wollenweber et al 2010 the gas permeability test was stopped with the evolutions of gas pressures measured at both ends of the specimen the effective gas permeability k geff of the specimen was determined using eq 1 wollenweber et al 2010 hildenbrand et al 2012 1 k geff v o μ g 2 l a p o 2 p i 2 d p o dt where k geff is effective gas permeability m2 v o is the volume of the downstream controller m3 a is the cross section area of the specimen m2 μ g is the gas dynamic viscosity pa s l is the length of the specimen m p i and p o is the pressure at the upstream and downstream controllers respectively pa for conducting gas permeability tests under constant confining pressure conditions an as prepared specimen was covered with a rubber membrane and assembled in the test cell fig 3 b then a constant confining pressure 3 mpa 5 mpa or 7 mpa was applied using the liquid volume pressure controller with consideration of the design depth of the repository similar to that of the test conducted under constant volume conditions water permeability test was firstly performed which was generally lasted for almost 10 days to obtain the water measured intrinsic permeability and to saturate the specimen after that instead of the volume pressure controller in fig 3 a the gas injection unit including the helium booster pump and the inlet buffer tank in fig 3 b was used to perform the gas permeability test then the gas permeability test was started with gas injected from the bottom to the top of the specimen the pressure evolutions at the upstream and downstream controllers were monitored and the effective gas permeability was eventually determined using eq 1 2 2 2 gas permeability tests for unsaturated gmz bentonite specimens the apparatus in fig 4 was employed to determine the gas permeability of unsaturated gmz bentonite specimens using the steady state method the apparatus is composed of a test cell a liquid volume pressure controller a helium cylinder a pressure regulator an inlet buffer tank and digital pressure gauge multi gas flowmeters with a measurement range of 5 100 or 1000 ml min and a data acquisition unit for conducting the gas permeability tests under constant volume conditions an unsaturated specimen was prepared and assembled into the apparatus in fig 4 a the gas injection unit was connected to the bottom of the specimen and a multi gas mass flowmeter was connected to the top of the specimen through a bottle employed for separating the mixed water gas phases the helium gas was step wisely injected into the specimen the gas injection pressure and gas flow rate were monitored when the gas flow rate reached stable gas injection test under current gas pressure was finished and the gas permeability was determined using eq 2 then next injection pressure was applied and the test procedures mentioned were repeated until all the gas injection pressures designed on the current specimen were tested a new specimen was tested until all the specimens with different dry densities were tested gas permeability tests under constant volume conditions fig 2 were finished 2 k g 2 q μ g l p go a p gi 2 p go 2 where q is the measured gas flow rate m3 s p gi and p go is the gas pressure at the upstream and downstream of the specimen respectively pa for conducting gas permeability tests under constant confining pressure conditions an as prepared specimen was covered with a rubber membrane and assembled in the test cell fig 4 b a target confining pressure 3 mpa 5 mpa or 7 mpa was applied using the liquid volume pressure controller the gas injection pressure was applied and gas flow rate was monitored until the gas flow rate recorded was stabilized gas permeability was determined using eq 2 until all the injection pressures designed on the specimen were tested gas permeability test under current confining pressure was finished a new specimen was installed and all the test procedures mentioned above were repeated under another confining pressure until all the tests designed on unsaturated specimens fig 2 were performed gas permeability test was finished all the tests are perfomred at an ambient temperature of 20 0 1 c it should be noted that calibration test was performed for checking the gas tightness of the apparatus a decrease of gas pressure inside the pipelines less than 0 1 kpa min indicated a reasonable gas tightness of the apparatus liu et al 2010 3 experimental results and discussion 3 1 gas permeability of saturated gmz bentonite specimen using the residual pressure method evolutions of gas pressures at the upstream and downstream controllers were recorded and presented in fig 5 curves in fig 5 show that with gas migrating in saturated gmz bentonite specimen gas pressures at the upstream and downstream controllers decrease and increase respectively significant difference between the two pressures sustained for a long period until the nearly equilibrium state was reached which was indicated by an extremely small change of the pressure difference below 0 03 mpa 24 h according to the typical four types of evolution curves controlled by different migration mechanisms fig 6 hildenbrand et al 2012 the pressure evolutions in fig 5 could be attributed to the diffusion controlled one as shown in fig 6 c in this scenario gas water interface slowly moved from the pipeline or porous discs to the specimen surface driven by the pressure gradient the pressure difference between the upstream and downstream of the specimen was too low to trigger the visco capillary flow due to the extremely high capillary sealing of saturated gmz bentonite specimen as a result only diffusional transport occurs and controls the gas migration process which was also supported by marschall et al 2005 and harrington et al 2012 with eq 1 and results shown in fig 5 effective gas permeability of the saturated gmz bentonite specimen was calculated and presented in fig 7 results in fig 7 a show that during the diffusion controlled gas migration stage effective gas permeability of saturated gmz bentonite specimen tested under constant volume condition mainly ranges between 1e 23 m2 to 1e 24 m2 gas permeability almost keeps constant when the dry density increases from 1 3 mg m3 to 1 6 mg m3 however it decreases by one order of magnitude with dry density increases from 1 6 mg m3 to 1 7 mg m3 results in fig 7 b show that effective gas permeability of saturated gmz bentonite specimen tested under constant confining pressure conditions varies within a range of 1e 23 m2 to 1e 25 m2 fig 7 b it decreases almost 1 5 orders of magnitude as the confining pressure increases from 3 mpa to 5 mpa while limited effects of confining pressure on gas permeability could be observed for higher confining pressures 3 2 gas permeability of unsaturated gmz bentonite specimen evolutions of gas flow rate with time for unsaturated gmz bentonite specimen measured using the steady state method were presented in fig 8 curves in fig 8 show that gas flow rate consistently and stably increases with the increase of gas injection pressure this observation is completely different from that observed on the saturated specimen tested using the same steady state method in which almost no gas outflow can be detected at such low gas pressures xu et al 2017 2019 in further analysis gas permeability of the specimen can be determined using eq 2 then evolutions of gas permeability with gas injection pressure for specimens tested under constant volume and confining pressure conditions can be presented in figs 9 and 10 as shown in fig 9 changes in dry density have a significant effect on gas permeability of the unsaturated gmz bentonite specimen for the specimen with an initial water content of 3 50 gas permeability decreases by 1 order of magnitude as its dry density increases from 1 5 mg m3 to 1 7 mg m3 for the specimen with an initial water content of 18 12 gas permeability decreases by 2 3 orders of magnitude as its dry density increases from 1 5 mg m3 to 1 7 mg m3 curves in fig 10 also show that gas permeability notably decreases by 0 2 1 5 orders of magnitude with increasing confining pressure it should be noted that gas permeability of unsaturated gmz bentonite specimen decreases with increasing gas injection pressure this is because that for a porous medium with a low permeability as the specimen tested in this study the comparable size between the mean free path of molecules and the pore flow pathways will lead to a possible overestimation in the permeability known as gas slippage or klinkenberg effect eq 3 3 k g k g cor 1 b p mean where k g is the measured effective gas permeability m2 b is the klinkenberg coefficient p mean is the average of pressures at the upstream and downstream of the specimen k gcor is the klinkenberg corrected gas permeability which theoretically equals to the intrinsic permeability of the material javadpour et al 2007 michel et al 2011 swami and settari 2012 according to eq 3 as the gas injection pressure increases the klinkenberg effect becomes insignificant for determination of gas permeability of gmz bentonite specimen without klinkenberg effect the effective gas permeability was plotted against the reciprocal of the mean pressure in fig 11 results in fig 11 show that a straight line can be identified between gas permeability and the reciprocal of the mean pressure with an intersection of y axis representing the gas permeability without the klinkenberg effect klinkenberg corrected gas permeability villar and shaw 2013 furthermore with the klinkenberg corrected gas permeability the effects of liquid saturation dry density and confining pressure on gas permeability of unsaturated gmz bentonite specimen can be comprehensively obtained and presented in fig 12 results in fig 12 clearly show that klinkenberg corrected gas permeability decreases by 1 5 orders of magnitude as the liquid saturation increases from 10 to 70 regardless of the initial and boundary conditions of the unsaturated gmz bentonite specimen this significant effect of liquid saturation on klinkenberg corrected gas permeability especially for that of the specimen at high degree of saturation is consistent with the result obtained by gallé 1998 this phenomenon could be attributed to the occupation of the flow channels by the liquid phase and the microstructural changes due to the existence of expansive clay minerals during hydration deng et al 2011 2019 zhang et al 2019 tang et al 2011b 2019 comparison between the results in figs 12 a and 12 b presents a 1 2 orders of magnitude decrease in klinkenberg corrected gas permeability with the dry density increases from 1 5 mg m3 to 1 7 mg m3 similar results were reported by gallé 1998 on fo ca clay that gas permeability decreased by 1 order of magnitude for specimens with a fixed liquid saturation as dry density increased from 1 6 mg m3 to 1 9 mg m3 meanwhile depending on the liquid saturation the klinkenberg corrected gas permeability decreases by 0 1 orders of magnitude as the confining pressure increases from 3 mpa to 7 mpa such relatively limited effect of confining pressure on gas permeability could be attributed to the limited deformation capacity of flow pathways in the extremely dense material tested under such low confining pressures according to the klinkenberg corrected gas permeability determined for gmz bentonite specimen fig 12 common conclusions could be reached that within the repository environment changes in the geo stress will not significantly influence the sealing capacity of the buffering material however existence of construction gaps in the repository will lead to the decrease of dry density of the bentonite blocks eventually the deterioration of the buffering capacity of engineering barrier system therefore sufficient high dry density should be guaranteed during the preparation of gmz bentonite blocks from the perspective of gas migration meanwhile due to the notable effect of liquid saturation on gas permeability the long term infiltration of groundwater may significantly change the sealing capacity of the compacted bentonite 3 3 intrinsic permeability and gas relative permeability of gmz bentonite specimen for further analyses of the gas flow behavior in the deep geological repository the gas measured intrinsic permeability and gas relative permeability of bentonite are two key parameters which are difficult to be directly measured due to the microstructural changes of the bentonite during the water uptake loss processes in this regard the accessible porosity e 1 s r proposed by delage et al 1998 and villar and shaw 2013 was introduced in the present work based on the liquid saturation and dry density of the bentonite specimens designed in this study the accessible porosity of the specimen under different test conditions can be determined accordingly then the corresponding gas permeability shown in fig 12 was introduced to establish the relationship between the gas permeability and the accessible porosity fig 13 result shows that the gas permeability increases significantly with the enhanced accessible porosity and in line with the power growth function which is supported by previous researches performed by delage et al 1998 therefore by using the least square method a power law was adopted to describe the relationship between the gas permeability and the accessible porosity for gmz bentonite specimen as shown in fig 13 and eq 4 perfect results can be guaranteed with fitting goodness larger than 0 92 4 k g 8 60 e 15 e 1 s r 4 20 where e is the void ratio determined in gas permeability test under constant volume condition s r is the liquid saturation of the specimen as previously mentioned gas measured intrinsic permeability of an expansive soil e g gmz bentonite cannot be directly measured due to the possible modification of its microstructure when gas entered specimen villar 2002 villar and lloret 2001 tang et al 2011b 2019 however by using eq 4 the gas measured intrinsic permeability of the specimen can be obtained with the degree of saturation being assigned to 0 then evolution of gas measured intrinsic permeability k in g with dry density void ratio could be presented in eq 5 and fig 14 5 k in g 8 60 e 15 e 4 20 combined with the water measured intrinsic permeability determined in water permeability test curves in fig 14 show that both of the gas water measured intrinsic permeability decrease with the increase of dry density however the gas measured intrinsic permeability mainly ranges between 1e 15 m2 to 4e 15 m2 which is higher than the water measured one by 5 orders of magnitude this observation is consistent with the test results performed on kunigel vi by tanai et al 1997 based on investigations conducted on the gas permeability of febex bentonite villar 2002 and villar and lloret 2001 also found that gas measured intrinsic permeability was much higher up to 8 orders of magnitude than the water measured one due to the microstructure changes in the expansive clay during hydration deng et al 2011 2019 zhang et al 2019 gas relative permeability is defined as the ratio of the gas permeability to the corresponding intrinsic permeability of the geo material tested according to the klinkenberg corrected gas permeability shown in fig 12 and the gas measured intrinsic permeability determined in eq 4 the gas relative permeabilities of the gmz bentonite specimens were obtained and presented in fig 15 results show that the gas relative permeability decreases significantly as the liquid saturation increases the higher dry density of the specimen the lower gas relative permeability at a given degree of saturation previous investigations validated that the generalized power law eq 6 for the relationship between the gas relative permeability and degree of saturation was extensively confirmed and adopted in researches for its simple and practical features delahaye and alonso 2002 thereby the generalized power law was adopted in this study to fit the results based on the least square method the original results accompanied with the fitting results were presented in fig 15 evidently the validation of the generalized power law for gmz bentonite was confirmed with fitting goodness larger than 0 98 the fitting

viewpoint of gas migration 4 conclusion in the present work systematic experiments were performed to determine the gas permeability of compacted gmz bentonite specimen with consideration of influences of liquid saturation dry density and confining pressure some main conclusions were summarized as follows 1 gas migration in saturated gmz bentonite specimen was mainly controlled by diffusion with effective gas permeability ranging between 1e 23 m2 to 1e 25 m2 for unsaturated gmz bentonite specimen gas flow rates stably and consistently increased with the increase of gas injection pressure both of dry density and confining pressure played notable roles on evolution of gas permeability 2 klinkenberg effect is significant for gmz bentonite the klinkenberg corrected gas permeability decreases by 3 5 5 5 orders of magnitude as the liquid saturation increases from 10 to 70 depending on the liquid saturation the klinkenberg corrected gas permeability decreases by a 1 2 orders of magnitude as the dry density increases from 1 5 mg m3 and 1 7 mg m3 and decreases by 0 1 orders of magnitude as the confining pressure increases from 3 mpa to 7 mpa 3 gas water measured intrinsic permeability of the gmz bentonite specimen decreases with increasing dry density the gas measured intrinsic permeability mainly varies within a range of 1e 15 m2 4e 15 m2 which is higher than the water measured one by 5 orders of magnitude the generalized power law was successfully adopted to establish the relationship between the gas relative permeability and the degree of saturation 4 within the repository operation environment changes in the geo stress will not significantly influence the sealing capacity of the buffering material while the long term infiltration of groundwater will significantly

1533,during the long term operation of a disposal repository gas will be inevitably generated determination of gas permeability of compacted bentonite is of great importance for the safety assessment of the engineered barrier system in the present work the steady state and residual pressure methods were employed to determine the gas permeability of gaomiaozi gmz bentonite with consideration of variations in liquid saturation dry density and confining pressure results show that gas migration in saturated gmz bentonite was mainly controlled by diffusion with an effective gas permeability of 1e 23 m2 1e 25 m2 while in unsaturated gmz bentonite significant gas flow rates could be observed which increased stably with the increase of gas injection pressure klinkenberg effect was significant when gas flow through gmz bentonite the klinkenberg corrected gas permeability decreased by 3 5 5 5 orders of magnitude as the liquid saturation increased from 10 to 70 a decreasing magnitude of 1 2 orders in klinkenberg corrected gas permeability was presented with the dry density increased from 1 5 mg m3 and 1 7 mg m3 the klinkenberg corrected gas permeability decreased by 0 1 orders of magnitude as the confining pressure increased from 3 mpa to 7 mpa by using the accessible porosity gas measured intrinsic permeability could be determined with values ranged between 1e 15 m2 to 4e 15 m2 which was higher than the water measured one by 5 orders of magnitude additionally a generalized power law was successfully adopted in this study to describe the evolution of gas relative permeability with the liquid saturation overall the effective gas permeability klinkenberg corrected gas permeability intrinsic and relative permeability determined in this study provided a comprehensive perspective to assess the buffering property of gmz bentonite in multi physical field coupling environment the parameters obtained can be adopted in further simulation works for long term safety analysis of the disposal repository from the viewpoint of gas migration keywords gas permeability gmz bentonite diffusion klinkenberg effect intrinsic permeability 1 introduction for disposal of high level radioactive wastes deep geological disposal is a widely accepted technology which relies on a multi barrier system that typically includes a metal waste canister buffer backfill materials and natural geological formations to isolate the radioactive nuclides from the biosphere fig 1 bentonite has been chosen by several countries for using as buffering materials due to its high swelling capacity low permeability and high absorption capacity yong et al 1986 komine 2004 ye et al 2009 tang et al 2011a zhang et al 2012 sellin and leupin 2013 zhang et al 2016 investigations confirmed that during the long term operation of the multi barrier repository gas could be generated due to corrosion of the metallic waste canister radiolysis of water and degradation of organic materials etc liu et al 2015 xu et al 2017 mon et al 2017 then the gas generated would be accumulated to form high gas pressure or escape through the bentonite based buffering materials by diffusion visco capillary or even dilatant pathway flow to the living environment resulting in losing efficacy or even failure of the barrier system more importantly in the repository environment the coupling effects of geo stress and groundwater infiltration from the surrounding geological formations play important roles in gas migration in the bentonite based buffering materials dossier 2005 liu et al 2014 2015 therefore a thorough understanding of gas permeability of the compacted bentonite with consideration of variations in liquid saturation dry density and confining pressure is worthy of in depth investigations pusch et al 1985 harrington et al 2012 liu et al 2014 vardon et al 2013 in the previous researches performed on bentonite based buffering materials the liquid saturation was proved to be one of the most important factors in determining gas permeability when the bentonite specimen approached being saturated 99 gas permeability could only be measured until gas breakthrough occurred at a high gas pressure due to its excellent capillary sealing capacity in this scenario a discrete gas flow was normally characterized which resulted in an extremely low and fluctuated gas permeability pusch et al 1985 harrington and horseman 2003 marschall et al 2005 tanai and yui 2011 based on the tests performed on saturated compacted mx80 bentonite with a dry density around 1 7 mg m3 pusch et al 1985 and horseman et al 1999 suggested that an effective gas permeability ranging between 1e 21 m2 to 1e 20 m2 could be recognized as the typical values as the liquid saturation of the bentonite decreased and fallen below the critical value around 90 a stable and significant evolution in effective gas permeability could be observed gallé 1998 liu et al 2015 2018 wei et al 2019 for specimens with given dry densities ranging between 1 5 mg m3 to 1 9 mg m3 the effective gas permeability normally decreased from 1e 18 m2 to 1e 21 m2 with the liquid saturation increased from 70 to 100 or from 1e 14 m2 to 1e 19 m2 with that increased from 45 to 85 gallé 1998 wei et al 2019 meanwhile the effective gas permeability of compacted bentonite was significantly influenced by dry density as dry density increased from 1 6 mg m3 to 1 9 mg m3 gas permeability normally decreased from 1e 15 m2 to 1e 18 m2 or from 1e 16 m2 to 1e 19 m2 for a specific liquid saturation of 70 and 80 respectively that is to say a 0 1 variation in density led to 1 order of magnitude changes in effective gas permeability gallé 1998 the mechanical effects on gas permeability of compacted bentonite had also been studied by liu et al 2015 2018 wei et al 2019 etc common conclusions could be reached that the effective gas permeability of the materials were sensitive to changes in the confining pressure a 2 order of magnitude decrease in effective gas permeability was commonly observed with confining pressure increasing from 1 mpa to 8 mpa the effective gas permeability changes in a wide range of 1e 16 m2 to 1e 20 m2 depending on the dry density and liquid saturation of the compacted bentonite gmz bentonite which was extracted from gaomiaozi county in the inner mongolia autonomous region 300 km northwest from beijing is selected preferentially as the buffering materials for construction of engineering barrier in the deep geological repository in china ye et al 2009 wei et al 2019 conducted gas permeability tests on unsaturated gmz bentonite and found that increases in liquid saturation or confining stress could induce almost 3 orders of magnitude in decreasing gas permeability higher degree of saturation and lower initial dry density led to faster decreases of gas permeability during loading process more importantly gas migration in the low medially saturated compacted bentonite was dominated by single phase advection in the connected gas filled pores which was different from that in saturated bentonite therefore a thorough understanding of gas migration behavior in gmz bentonite should be reached by performing comprehensive analyses in various gas flow parameters including the effective gas permeability intrinsic permeability and relative permeability in a multi physical fields coupled environment however according to the conventional two phase flow theory changes in dry density confining pressure or liquid saturation will lead to variations in intrinsic permeability and relative permeability furthermore microstructure of bentonite will change with the water uptake loss process leading to enlarge the difficulties in measurement and analysis of intrinsic or relative permeability of bentonite ye et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 chen et al 2014 xu et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 up to now previous studies have mainly focused on evolution of the effective gas permeability while investigations on intrinsic or relative permeability were rarely reported in this study a series of gas permeability tests on gmz bentonite specimens were performed influences of liquid saturation dry density and confining pressure on gas migration were comprehensively investigated relevant parameters were analyzed and determined results obtained can provide a solid basis for the future gas migration simulations which are of great importance to the safety assessment of the geological repository 2 experimental investigations 2 1 materials and specimen preparation the gmz bentonite tested in this work was a grey powder the fundamental properties of the bentonite were reported in wen 2006 table 1 in which a high cation exchange capacity and adsorption ability as well as a large proportion of montmorillonite 75 4 in mass can be identified in this study all the gas permeability tests conducted on unsaturated and saturated gmz bentonite specimens were listed in fig 2 for specimen preparation gmz bentonite powder was sealed in chambers with suction control using the vapour phase technique saturated saline solutions kno3 nacl and k2co3 were employed for suction control corresponding to an initial water content of 18 12 14 12 and 10 13 respectively tang and cui 2005 meanwhile for preparation of relatively dry specimens the bentonite powder was oven dried at 60 c for 3 days to achieve a water content of 3 50 then according to the target cylindrical specimen with a height of 10 mm diameter of 50 mm and a dry density of 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 or 1 7 mg m3 the bentonite powder prepared was weighed and put into a compaction mould static compaction was performed at a displacement rate of 0 1 mm min after the target vertical displacement reached the maximum compaction load was kept for 60 mins for homogenization of the specimen it should be noted that the liquid saturation of the specimen can be easily calculated according to the water content controlled and the designed dry density of the specimen compacted e g for specimens with a dry density of 1 5 mg m3 an initial water content 18 12 corresponds to a liquid saturation 58 0 for a dry density of 1 7 mg m3 an initial water content of 18 12 corresponds to a liquid saturation 72 5 etc 2 2 apparatus and test procedures 2 2 1 gas permeability tests on saturated gmz bentonite specimens the residual pressure method wollenweber et al 2010 hildenbrand et al 2012 busch and hildenbrand 2013 was employed for determining gas permeability of saturated gmz bentonite specimens in this study apparatus presented in fig 3 was designed which is composed of test cells manufactured using 316 l stainless steel gas liquid volume pressure controllers with an accuracy of 1 mm3 in volume and 1 kpa in pressure a helium gas cylinder some pressure regulators an inlet buffer tank a digital pressure gauge 20 mpa and a data acquisition unit etc for conducting gas permeability tests under constant volume conditions an as prepared specimen was assembled into the apparatus as shown in fig 3 a then using the liquid volume pressure controller a constant injection pressure of 1 mpa was applied at the top of the specimen with an outlet at the bottom of the specimen opened to the atmosphere the water infiltrated was recorded using the liquid volume pressure controller when a continuous water outflow was observed at the downstream and the variation of the water injected was getting stabilized may after 10 days infiltration the specimen was recognized as being saturated s w 0 99 finally the water measured intrinsic permeability could be determined using darcy s law horseman et al 1999 xu et al 2017 subsequently the outlet at the top of the specimen was connected to a volume pressure controller with an initial pressure of 0 kpa while the inlet at the bottom of the specimen was connected to the gas volume pressure controller with a fixed inner volume and target gas pressure then the gas permeability test was started with gas infiltrated from the bottom of the specimen and gas pressures in both controllers were recorded until the difference between the two pressures was stabilized which was identified by the change of the pressure difference lower than 0 03 mpa 24 h hildenbrand et al 2012 wollenweber et al 2010 the gas permeability test was stopped with the evolutions of gas pressures measured at both ends of the specimen the effective gas permeability k geff of the specimen was determined using eq 1 wollenweber et al 2010 hildenbrand et al 2012 1 k geff v o μ g 2 l a p o 2 p i 2 d p o dt where k geff is effective gas permeability m2 v o is the volume of the downstream controller m3 a is the cross section area of the specimen m2 μ g is the gas dynamic viscosity pa s l is the length of the specimen m p i and p o is the pressure at the upstream and downstream controllers respectively pa for conducting gas permeability tests under constant confining pressure conditions an as prepared specimen was covered with a rubber membrane and assembled in the test cell fig 3 b then a constant confining pressure 3 mpa 5 mpa or 7 mpa was applied using the liquid volume pressure controller with consideration of the design depth of the repository similar to that of the test conducted under constant volume conditions water permeability test was firstly performed which was generally lasted for almost 10 days to obtain the water measured intrinsic permeability and to saturate the specimen after that instead of the volume pressure controller in fig 3 a the gas injection unit including the helium booster pump and the inlet buffer tank in fig 3 b was used to perform the gas permeability test then the gas permeability test was started with gas injected from the bottom to the top of the specimen the pressure evolutions at the upstream and downstream controllers were monitored and the effective gas permeability was eventually determined using eq 1 2 2 2 gas permeability tests for unsaturated gmz bentonite specimens the apparatus in fig 4 was employed to determine the gas permeability of unsaturated gmz bentonite specimens using the steady state method the apparatus is composed of a test cell a liquid volume pressure controller a helium cylinder a pressure regulator an inlet buffer tank and digital pressure gauge multi gas flowmeters with a measurement range of 5 100 or 1000 ml min and a data acquisition unit for conducting the gas permeability tests under constant volume conditions an unsaturated specimen was prepared and assembled into the apparatus in fig 4 a the gas injection unit was connected to the bottom of the specimen and a multi gas mass flowmeter was connected to the top of the specimen through a bottle employed for separating the mixed water gas phases the helium gas was step wisely injected into the specimen the gas injection pressure and gas flow rate were monitored when the gas flow rate reached stable gas injection test under current gas pressure was finished and the gas permeability was determined using eq 2 then next injection pressure was applied and the test procedures mentioned were repeated until all the gas injection pressures designed on the current specimen were tested a new specimen was tested until all the specimens with different dry densities were tested gas permeability tests under constant volume conditions fig 2 were finished 2 k g 2 q μ g l p go a p gi 2 p go 2 where q is the measured gas flow rate m3 s p gi and p go is the gas pressure at the upstream and downstream of the specimen respectively pa for conducting gas permeability tests under constant confining pressure conditions an as prepared specimen was covered with a rubber membrane and assembled in the test cell fig 4 b a target confining pressure 3 mpa 5 mpa or 7 mpa was applied using the liquid volume pressure controller the gas injection pressure was applied and gas flow rate was monitored until the gas flow rate recorded was stabilized gas permeability was determined using eq 2 until all the injection pressures designed on the specimen were tested gas permeability test under current confining pressure was finished a new specimen was installed and all the test procedures mentioned above were repeated under another confining pressure until all the tests designed on unsaturated specimens fig 2 were performed gas permeability test was finished all the tests are perfomred at an ambient temperature of 20 0 1 c it should be noted that calibration test was performed for checking the gas tightness of the apparatus a decrease of gas pressure inside the pipelines less than 0 1 kpa min indicated a reasonable gas tightness of the apparatus liu et al 2010 3 experimental results and discussion 3 1 gas permeability of saturated gmz bentonite specimen using the residual pressure method evolutions of gas pressures at the upstream and downstream controllers were recorded and presented in fig 5 curves in fig 5 show that with gas migrating in saturated gmz bentonite specimen gas pressures at the upstream and downstream controllers decrease and increase respectively significant difference between the two pressures sustained for a long period until the nearly equilibrium state was reached which was indicated by an extremely small change of the pressure difference below 0 03 mpa 24 h according to the typical four types of evolution curves controlled by different migration mechanisms fig 6 hildenbrand et al 2012 the pressure evolutions in fig 5 could be attributed to the diffusion controlled one as shown in fig 6 c in this scenario gas water interface slowly moved from the pipeline or porous discs to the specimen surface driven by the pressure gradient the pressure difference between the upstream and downstream of the specimen was too low to trigger the visco capillary flow due to the extremely high capillary sealing of saturated gmz bentonite specimen as a result only diffusional transport occurs and controls the gas migration process which was also supported by marschall et al 2005 and harrington et al 2012 with eq 1 and results shown in fig 5 effective gas permeability of the saturated gmz bentonite specimen was calculated and presented in fig 7 results in fig 7 a show that during the diffusion controlled gas migration stage effective gas permeability of saturated gmz bentonite specimen tested under constant volume condition mainly ranges between 1e 23 m2 to 1e 24 m2 gas permeability almost keeps constant when the dry density increases from 1 3 mg m3 to 1 6 mg m3 however it decreases by one order of magnitude with dry density increases from 1 6 mg m3 to 1 7 mg m3 results in fig 7 b show that effective gas permeability of saturated gmz bentonite specimen tested under constant confining pressure conditions varies within a range of 1e 23 m2 to 1e 25 m2 fig 7 b it decreases almost 1 5 orders of magnitude as the confining pressure increases from 3 mpa to 5 mpa while limited effects of confining pressure on gas permeability could be observed for higher confining pressures 3 2 gas permeability of unsaturated gmz bentonite specimen evolutions of gas flow rate with time for unsaturated gmz bentonite specimen measured using the steady state method were presented in fig 8 curves in fig 8 show that gas flow rate consistently and stably increases with the increase of gas injection pressure this observation is completely different from that observed on the saturated specimen tested using the same steady state method in which almost no gas outflow can be detected at such low gas pressures xu et al 2017 2019 in further analysis gas permeability of the specimen can be determined using eq 2 then evolutions of gas permeability with gas injection pressure for specimens tested under constant volume and confining pressure conditions can be presented in figs 9 and 10 as shown in fig 9 changes in dry density have a significant effect on gas permeability of the unsaturated gmz bentonite specimen for the specimen with an initial water content of 3 50 gas permeability decreases by 1 order of magnitude as its dry density increases from 1 5 mg m3 to 1 7 mg m3 for the specimen with an initial water content of 18 12 gas permeability decreases by 2 3 orders of magnitude as its dry density increases from 1 5 mg m3 to 1 7 mg m3 curves in fig 10 also show that gas permeability notably decreases by 0 2 1 5 orders of magnitude with increasing confining pressure it should be noted that gas permeability of unsaturated gmz bentonite specimen decreases with increasing gas injection pressure this is because that for a porous medium with a low permeability as the specimen tested in this study the comparable size between the mean free path of molecules and the pore flow pathways will lead to a possible overestimation in the permeability known as gas slippage or klinkenberg effect eq 3 3 k g k g cor 1 b p mean where k g is the measured effective gas permeability m2 b is the klinkenberg coefficient p mean is the average of pressures at the upstream and downstream of the specimen k gcor is the klinkenberg corrected gas permeability which theoretically equals to the intrinsic permeability of the material javadpour et al 2007 michel et al 2011 swami and settari 2012 according to eq 3 as the gas injection pressure increases the klinkenberg effect becomes insignificant for determination of gas permeability of gmz bentonite specimen without klinkenberg effect the effective gas permeability was plotted against the reciprocal of the mean pressure in fig 11 results in fig 11 show that a straight line can be identified between gas permeability and the reciprocal of the mean pressure with an intersection of y axis representing the gas permeability without the klinkenberg effect klinkenberg corrected gas permeability villar and shaw 2013 furthermore with the klinkenberg corrected gas permeability the effects of liquid saturation dry density and confining pressure on gas permeability of unsaturated gmz bentonite specimen can be comprehensively obtained and presented in fig 12 results in fig 12 clearly show that klinkenberg corrected gas permeability decreases by 1 5 orders of magnitude as the liquid saturation increases from 10 to 70 regardless of the initial and boundary conditions of the unsaturated gmz bentonite specimen this significant effect of liquid saturation on klinkenberg corrected gas permeability especially for that of the specimen at high degree of saturation is consistent with the result obtained by gallé 1998 this phenomenon could be attributed to the occupation of the flow channels by the liquid phase and the microstructural changes due to the existence of expansive clay minerals during hydration deng et al 2011 2019 zhang et al 2019 tang et al 2011b 2019 comparison between the results in figs 12 a and 12 b presents a 1 2 orders of magnitude decrease in klinkenberg corrected gas permeability with the dry density increases from 1 5 mg m3 to 1 7 mg m3 similar results were reported by gallé 1998 on fo ca clay that gas permeability decreased by 1 order of magnitude for specimens with a fixed liquid saturation as dry density increased from 1 6 mg m3 to 1 9 mg m3 meanwhile depending on the liquid saturation the klinkenberg corrected gas permeability decreases by 0 1 orders of magnitude as the confining pressure increases from 3 mpa to 7 mpa such relatively limited effect of confining pressure on gas permeability could be attributed to the limited deformation capacity of flow pathways in the extremely dense material tested under such low confining pressures according to the klinkenberg corrected gas permeability determined for gmz bentonite specimen fig 12 common conclusions could be reached that within the repository environment changes in the geo stress will not significantly influence the sealing capacity of the buffering material however existence of construction gaps in the repository will lead to the decrease of dry density of the bentonite blocks eventually the deterioration of the buffering capacity of engineering barrier system therefore sufficient high dry density should be guaranteed during the preparation of gmz bentonite blocks from the perspective of gas migration meanwhile due to the notable effect of liquid saturation on gas permeability the long term infiltration of groundwater may significantly change the sealing capacity of the compacted bentonite 3 3 intrinsic permeability and gas relative permeability of gmz bentonite specimen for further analyses of the gas flow behavior in the deep geological repository the gas measured intrinsic permeability and gas relative permeability of bentonite are two key parameters which are difficult to be directly measured due to the microstructural changes of the bentonite during the water uptake loss processes in this regard the accessible porosity e 1 s r proposed by delage et al 1998 and villar and shaw 2013 was introduced in the present work based on the liquid saturation and dry density of the bentonite specimens designed in this study the accessible porosity of the specimen under different test conditions can be determined accordingly then the corresponding gas permeability shown in fig 12 was introduced to establish the relationship between the gas permeability and the accessible porosity fig 13 result shows that the gas permeability increases significantly with the enhanced accessible porosity and in line with the power growth function which is supported by previous researches performed by delage et al 1998 therefore by using the least square method a power law was adopted to describe the relationship between the gas permeability and the accessible porosity for gmz bentonite specimen as shown in fig 13 and eq 4 perfect results can be guaranteed with fitting goodness larger than 0 92 4 k g 8 60 e 15 e 1 s r 4 20 where e is the void ratio determined in gas permeability test under constant volume condition s r is the liquid saturation of the specimen as previously mentioned gas measured intrinsic permeability of an expansive soil e g gmz bentonite cannot be directly measured due to the possible modification of its microstructure when gas entered specimen villar 2002 villar and lloret 2001 tang et al 2011b 2019 however by using eq 4 the gas measured intrinsic permeability of the specimen can be obtained with the degree of saturation being assigned to 0 then evolution of gas measured intrinsic permeability k in g with dry density void ratio could be presented in eq 5 and fig 14 5 k in g 8 60 e 15 e 4 20 combined with the water measured intrinsic permeability determined in water permeability test curves in fig 14 show that both of the gas water measured intrinsic permeability decrease with the increase of dry density however the gas measured intrinsic permeability mainly ranges between 1e 15 m2 to 4e 15 m2 which is higher than the water measured one by 5 orders of magnitude this observation is consistent with the test results performed on kunigel vi by tanai et al 1997 based on investigations conducted on the gas permeability of febex bentonite villar 2002 and villar and lloret 2001 also found that gas measured intrinsic permeability was much higher up to 8 orders of magnitude than the water measured one due to the microstructure changes in the expansive clay during hydration deng et al 2011 2019 zhang et al 2019 gas relative permeability is defined as the ratio of the gas permeability to the corresponding intrinsic permeability of the geo material tested according to the klinkenberg corrected gas permeability shown in fig 12 and the gas measured intrinsic permeability determined in eq 4 the gas relative permeabilities of the gmz bentonite specimens were obtained and presented in fig 15 results show that the gas relative permeability decreases significantly as the liquid saturation increases the higher dry density of the specimen the lower gas relative permeability at a given degree of saturation previous investigations validated that the generalized power law eq 6 for the relationship between the gas relative permeability and degree of saturation was extensively confirmed and adopted in researches for its simple and practical features delahaye and alonso 2002 thereby the generalized power law was adopted in this study to fit the results based on the least square method the original results accompanied with the fitting results were presented in fig 15 evidently the validation of the generalized power law for gmz bentonite was confirmed with fitting goodness larger than 0 98 the fitting parameter a can be determined as 3 32 5 17 and 7 00 for specimens with dry density of 1 5 1 6 and 1 7 mg m3 respectively 6 k r g 1 s r a where k r g is the gas relative permeability and a is the parameter to be fitted in this section the relationship between gas measured intrinsic permeability and void ratio of the gmz bentonite specimen was established as shown in fig 14 and eq 5 relationship between the gas relative permeability and the liquid saturation of gmz bentonite was established as shown in fig 15 and eq 6 the significant difference between the water and gas measured intrinsic permeabilities was also confirmed as shown in fig 14 based on these the influencing mechanism of hydro mechanical coupling effect on gas flow behavior was quantitatively revealed and the microstructural changes effect on bentonite during the water uptake loss processes was obtained more importantly these models and parameters determined provide a chance to investigate the long term gas flow behavior under more complicated conditions by performing further simulation works which is of great importance to the safety assessment of the geological disposal repository from the viewpoint of gas migration 4 conclusion in the present work systematic experiments were performed to determine the gas permeability of compacted gmz bentonite specimen with consideration of influences of liquid saturation dry density and confining pressure some main conclusions were summarized as follows 1 gas migration in saturated gmz bentonite specimen was mainly controlled by diffusion with effective gas permeability ranging between 1e 23 m2 to 1e 25 m2 for unsaturated gmz bentonite specimen gas flow rates stably and consistently increased with the increase of gas injection pressure both of dry density and confining pressure played notable roles on evolution of gas permeability 2 klinkenberg effect is significant for gmz bentonite the klinkenberg corrected gas permeability decreases by 3 5 5 5 orders of magnitude as the liquid saturation increases from 10 to 70 depending on the liquid saturation the klinkenberg corrected gas permeability decreases by a 1 2 orders of magnitude as the dry density increases from 1 5 mg m3 and 1 7 mg m3 and decreases by 0 1 orders of magnitude as the confining pressure increases from 3 mpa to 7 mpa 3 gas water measured intrinsic permeability of the gmz bentonite specimen decreases with increasing dry density the gas measured intrinsic permeability mainly varies within a range of 1e 15 m2 4e 15 m2 which is higher than the water measured one by 5 orders of magnitude the generalized power law was successfully adopted to establish the relationship between the gas relative permeability and the degree of saturation 4 within the repository operation environment changes in the geo stress will not significantly influence the sealing capacity of the buffering material while the long term infiltration of groundwater will significantly change the sealing capacity of the compacted bentonite from the perspective of gas migration high dry density should be guaranteed for preparation of the gmz bentonite blocks 5 the influencing mechanisms of hydro mechanical coupling effect on intrinsic and relative permeabilities as well as the effect of the microstructural changes of the bentonite was quantitatively revealed based on the obtained models and parameters further simulation works could be performed to investigate the long term gas flow behavior in complicated environments which is of great importance to the safety

1534,methane leaking at depth from hydrocarbon wells poses an environmental and safety hazard however determining the occurrence and magnitude of gas migration at ground surface is challenging as part of the leaking gas is retained during upward migration we investigated migration through unconsolidated sedimentary aquifers using a two phase two component water and methane flow and transport model constructed in dumux a sensitivity analysis for migration through a 60 m thick sandy aquifer showed that retention by dissolution can be significant even with low groundwater darcy velocities of 1 m yr 1 retention was negligible in the absence of groundwater flow besides groundwater velocity both hydrogeological permeability entry pressure pore size distribution and residual gas saturation and leakage conditions depth magnitude and spatial dimensions determined model outcomes additional simulations with interbedded finer grained sediments resulted in substantial lateral spreading of migrating gas this delayed upward migration and enhanced retention in overlying sandy units where groundwater velocities are highest overall the results of this study show that for unconsolidated aquifer systems and the most commonly observed leakage rates 0 1 10 m3 d 1 significant amounts of migrating methane can be retained due to dissolution into laterally flowing groundwater consequently resulting atmospheric methane emissions above such leaks may be delayed with decades after the onset of leakage significantly reduced or prevented entirely 1 introduction the reliance on fossil fuel resources for the majority of the world s energy supply has resulted in a large number of onshore hydrocarbon wells conservatively estimated at over 4 million davies et al 2014 in spite of efforts to maintain the vertically isolating function of geological formations that are penetrated when installing and operating such wells failure of the wellbore system is a commonly observed problem davies et al 2014 and can lead to leakage of hazardous liquids and gases furthermore research has shown that this risk continues or may develop even after the active life time of wells and their abandonment kang et al 2014 townsend small et al 2016 particularly upward leakage of methane through anthropogenically opened unintended connections between hydrocarbon reservoirs and the shallow subsurface has become a growing concern worldwide as it may contribute to greenhouse gas emissions kang et al 2014 deteriorate water quality vengosh et al 2014 and form an explosion hazard chilingar and endres 2005 on top of that leaky wells could serve as pathways for the migration of other fluids when the downhole conditions are actively changed for example when hydraulic fracturing is carried out brownlow et al 2016 or co2 is stored gasda et al 2004 in nearby wells thus their presence may also hamper the safe implementation of future uses of the subsurface to be able to quantify and mitigate these risks the accurate detection of gas leakage is vital this is typically achieved by measurements of either sustained casing pressure scp or surface casing vent flow scvf at the wellhead king and king 2013 however these measurements may only reflect a part of the total leakage flux as a significant fraction of leaking gas can escape the wellbore system entirely and enter the surrounding geology forde et al 2019 which is also referred to as gas migration lackey and rajaram 2018 identified three main mechanisms that may lead to gas migration 1 gas circumvention when gas migrates through a cemented outer annulus and a section of low quality cement is overlain by a section of higher quality cement causing the gas to migrate outwards 2 groundwater crossflow when gas leaks through an uncemented outer annulus and is transported into the surrounding formation by lateral groundwater flow and 3 scp induced gas migration when the gas pressure at the bottom of the surface casing exceeds the hydrostatic pressure leading to gas overflow as gas migrating outside the wellbore may become trapped dissolved or degraded cahill et al 2018 surficial or shallow groundwater wells may only detect leakage after long periods of time or possibly never measurements of soil gas migration are typically carried out using surface flux chambers erno and schmitz 1996 in the vadose zone oxidation and dispersion of methane has indeed been shown to be capable of masking leaking wells from being detected at the surface entirely mcmahon et al 2018 schout et al 2019 furthermore a recent field experiment where methane was released in a shallow aquifer showed that the combined effects of trapping and dissolution of leaking gas in the saturated zone significantly reduced the amount of gas that reached the surface cahill et al 2018 lastly several field based studies have shown that anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to either sulphate reduction van stempvoort et al 2005 wolfe and wilkin 2017 and or reduction of iron and manganese oxides schout et al 2018 woda et al 2018 can lead to attenuation of a migrating methane plume with increasing depth and longer migrating pathways leaking gas can become more severely affected by these attenuation and retention processes and in turn surficial or shallow subsurface measurements become increasingly less reliable tools for detecting gas migration indeed the fate of methane from leaks occurring at depths greater than 10 m was identified as a key knowledge gap in studying gas migration cahill et al 2019 given the complexity and related costs of measuring gas leakage in field or experimental settings methane migration has also been assessed by means of multiphase numerical flow and transport simulations several studies have aimed to determine ranges of possible gas migration flow rates from the reservoir depth to shallow aquifers through high permeability pathways such as faults or improperly cemented annuli kissinger et al 2013 nowamooz et al 2015 reagan et al 2015 schwartz 2015 tatomir et al 2018 simulated migration of methane at great depth 1500 m into an inclined regional aquifer breakthrough times of gaseous methane at various offset distances from the leak origin were calculated that could for example correspond to conductive faults connecting the deep aquifer with an overlying freshwater aquifer rice et al 2018 investigated scp induced gas migration through a shale formation present at the bottom end of the surface casing into an overlying shallow aquifer they showed that for given source zone pressures the permeability distribution and the parametrization of the capillary pressure saturation and relative permeability functions of the shale formation controlled the flow rate of methane into the overlying aquifer depending on these properties flow rates at the base of the aquifer can be slow which may allow methane contamination to go undetected other studies assumed leakage to a shallow aquifer system occurred and focused on the migration and attenuation of methane therein roy et al 2016 coupled their multiphase model to a reactive transport simulator and showed that in confined aquifers anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to sulphate reduction could attenuate a migrating dissolved methane plume significantly this attenuating effect was even larger in unconfined aquifers where aerobic methane oxidation was also possible moortgat et al 2018 simulated gas phase methane migration through an aquifer system characterized by the presence of highly permeable pathways such as fractures and fluvial channels they showed that rapid lateral gas migration over distances of several kilometers is possible through these features but that migration is much less rapid in unfractured media d aniello et al 2019 simulated leakage of methane from a geothermal well into a 2 m thick surficial unconsolidated aquifer given the limited thickness and because mass transfer of methane to the aqueous phase was ignored retention of methane in this aquifer was limited klazinga et al 2019 carried out 2d simulations imitating the field experiments by cahill et al 2017 where methane gas was injected up to 10 m depth in a sandy aquifer lateral migration of the gas phase was shown to be significant even over such a relatively shallow interval as a result of anisotropic sediments and the presence of low permeability layers furthermore wider plumes and larger groundwater flow velocities resulted in larger amounts of methane that were retained in the aquifer the effect of methane retention by dissolution into laterally flowing groundwater has not been considered in detail in previous studies of gas migration in spite of the relatively low solubility of methane dissolutive retention could be important in the shallow part of unconsolidated groundwater systems where groundwater velocities are generally higher methane migration through unconsolidated aquifers is also less likely to be dominated by quick gas phase flow through preferential flow paths which reduces the potential for dissolutive retention other factors also possibly play a role such as the increase in methane aqueous solubility with increasing hydrostatic pressure i e depth and the lateral spreading of the methane plume as a result of anisotropy and low permeable layers the interaction of these transport processes and their influences on gas migration were studied in a parameter sensitivity analysis based on 3d two phase two component numerical simulations across a range of realistic conditions the impacts of horizontally layered unconsolidated aquifer systems on methane migration and retention were illustrated by simulation of a number of additional scenarios based on the geology encountered at two recently identified leaking wellbore sites in the netherlands the overall aim of this study was to determine whether and if so to what extent subsurface methane migration through laterally flowing groundwater is impacted by methane dissolution 2 material and methods 2 1 governing equations and constitutive relations numerical modelling was carried out using the open source multiphysics simulation package dumux ackermann et al 2017 flemisch et al 2011 dumux is capable of calculating multiphase multicomponent flow and transport at the continuum scale also referred to as miscible two phase flow or compositional flow for this study two phases α liquid and gas and two components k h2o and ch4 were considered the model accounts for mass transfer between the two phases as well as the compressibility of both phases phase velocities are calculated using darcy s law furthermore binary diffusion is assumed and the diffusive fluxes in each phase are calculated according to fick s law the fully coupled mass balance equation is then formulated as follows 1 α ϕ ρ α x α k s α t α ρ α x α k κ k rα μ α p α ρ α g α ρ α d eff α x α k q k where φ is the porosity ρ is the density x is the mass fraction s is the saturation κ is the intrinsic permeability tensor k r is the relative permeability μ is the dynamic viscosity p is the pressure g is the gravity vector d eff is the effective diffusion coefficient and q is a source or sink term a number of constitutive relationships are needed to close this system of equations firstly the sum of the saturations and that of the mass fractions of the two components in each phase must equal 1 2 s g s l 1 k x g k 1 k x l k 1 where the subscripts g and w represent the gaseous and liquid phase respectively the phase pressures are related by the capillary pressure p c as given by 3 p g p l p c s g the formulations by brooks and corey 1964 were used for the capillary pressure saturation relationship and relative permeabilities 4 p c s g p e s e 1 λ 5 k rl s e 2 λ 3 k rg 1 s e 2 1 s e 2 λ 1 where p e is the capillary entry pressure s e is the effective saturation and λ is the pore size distribution index s e is defined as 6 s e s l s lr 1 s gr s lr where s lr and s gr are the residual or irreducible liquid and gaseous saturation respectively according to these formulations the relative permeability of the gas phase is 0 as long as s g s gr hence the residual saturations in each cell have to reach at least up to the threshold residual gas saturation before a neighboring cell can be invaded by the gas phase fig s1 a regularization of the brooks corey p c s g relationship was used for s e 1 and s e 0 01 to avoid numerical issues with having an infinite gradient of the p c s g curve the slope of the curve when approaching these limits was extended up to s l 1 and s l 0 respectively fig s1 both water and methane components can be present in either phase concentrations in each phase are assumed to be at thermodynamic equilibrium meaning that mass transfer between the two phases occurs instantaneously at every time step in each control volume methane solubility is determined according to henry s law and is temperature and pressure dependent with the henry s coefficient based on the iapws formulations fernández prini et al 2003 a freshwater aquifer is assumed and therefore the effects of variable salinities on methane solubility are not considered the solubility of methane also determines the phase state of the model with a gas phase appearing once the mole fraction of methane x l ch4 exceeds that of the equilibrium solubility mole fraction and vice versa phase appearance and disappearance are accompanied by a primary variable switch from p l and s g when both phases are present to p l and x l ch4 when only the liquid phase is present energy transport is not simulated and the model is considered to be in thermal equilibrium for the spatial discretization a vertex centered finite volume method box method is used and a fully implicit backward euler method for the temporal discretization helmig 1997 the density of the gaseous phase follows the ideal gas law viscosity is calculated as described in reid et al 1987 in the range of temperature and pressure relevant for this study the density and viscosity of methane gas calculated in this manner were shown to be nearly equal to more complex equations of state kissinger et al 2013 the density and viscosity of the liquid phase are both pressure and temperature dependent according to the iapws definitions wagner and pruss 2002 the influence of the phase composition on the liquid phase properties is not taken into account since even at the greatest depth considered in this study 480 m of water column the maximum ch4 mass concentration is negligible compared to the aqueous phase density 0 1 the diffusion coefficient of water in the gaseous phase is determined according to the method in fuller et al 1966 and the diffusion coefficient of methane in the aqueous phase according to reid et al 1987 mechanical dispersion was not implemented in the model in multiphase systems the dispersion coefficient is saturation dependent which would result in a much more complex system of equations helmig 1997 and excessive runtimes computations were performed on a workstation and parallelized over 16 processors resulting in runtimes of up to 2 days for the sensitivity analysis and 4 days for the layered scenarios 2 2 geological context and conceptual model the range of hydrogeological conditions for which gas migration was studied are representative for unconsolidated sedimentary groundwater systems globally but were inspired by the conditions that prevail in the subsurface of the netherlands the netherlands is one of the major oil and gas producing nations in europe with around 2500 onshore oil and gas wells schout et al 2019 a survey of 986 gas wells by the state supervision of mines sodm revealed some form of well barrier failure at 227 23 of these wells sodm 2019 observations of gas bubbles in flooded well cellars showed that leakage of thermogenic gas occurred at at least 13 wells 1 3 hydrogeologically the country is characterized by the presence of shallow sandy aquifer units of plio pleistocene age these aquifers can be either phreatic or in the northern and western part of the country can be confined by overlying holocene deposits fig s2 a succession of thick marine clays of neogene and paleogene age form the bedrock below the aquifer units in nearly the entire country de vries 2007 typically the surface casing of oil and gas wells would at least extend down into these clays the depths of which can be up to around 500 m below surface in the oil and gas producing areas kombrink et al 2012 the modelled domain is a hypothetical rectangular block of a sandy aquifer within such a unconsolidated sedimentary sequence fig 1a gas migration into the base of the model is assumed conceptually it could be caused by a number of possible failure scenarios occurring below the simulated part of the aquifer including scp induced gas migration or gas circumvention 2 3 domain discretization boundary and initial conditions the dimensions of the simulated aquifer were set to 100 60 60 m xyz sufficiently large so that no boundary effects on gas migration occurred owing to symmetry in the y axis only half of this domain is simulated initial numerical testing showed that model outcomes stabilized when using a grid size smaller than 1x1x1 m hence a grid size of 0 5 0 5 0 5 m was used resulting in a total of 1 440 000 cells the simulation time is 20 years during which injection of ch4 is continuous for the ch4 flux at the inlet mol m 2 s 1 a neumann type boundary was used over 8 cells from x 40 to 42 m 2 1 m2 or what would be 2 2 m2 area when accounting for the half of the domain that is not modelled fig 1b the remainder of the bottom face of the model and the two lateral faces parallel to the direction of groundwater flow are treated as no flow boundaries for both components the two lateral faces perpendicular to groundwater flow are assigned dirichlet conditions with a pressure equal to the hydrostatic pressure albeit with a minor increase in pressure on one side to induce groundwater flow lastly the top face of the model is assigned a no flow condition for h2o and an outflow condition for ch4 this allows methane to escape the model freely through the top boundary but keeps water flowing strictly horizontally conceptually this corresponds to cases where the gas either escapes to the atmosphere or continues to migrate upwards to overlying layers depending on the depth of the top of the domain the model is initially fully water saturated sg 0 and no dissolved methane is present anywhere a thermal gradient of 31 3 c km 1 is imposed in all simulations equivalent to the average thermal gradient found in the netherlands verweij et al 2018 on top of the yearly average ambient air temperature of 10 c the density and viscosity of water inside the model and at its lateral boundaries are determined during an initialization phase that precedes the actual model run 2 4 parameter space sensitivity analysis a total of 17 simulations were run together encompassing a parameter space representative of the expected conditions for gas migration through unconsolidated sandy aquifers table 1 groundwater flow velocities up to 100 m yr 1 were considered as observed for regional groundwater flow in the netherlands bloemendal and hartog 2018 the thickness of the model is 60 m for the base case a depth of 60 m was chosen for the bottom of the model domain with depths of 240 and 480 m also considered preliminary simulations showed that model outcomes are insensitive to the temperature gradient however as simulations ran with a constant temperature of 10 c yielded virtually equal outcomes hence variations in the geothermal gradient were not considered methane flow rates at the inlet were varied between 0 1 and 10 m3 ch4 atm d 1 i e the volumetric ch4 flow rate at atmospheric pressure and 10 c as the majority of reported scvf rates fall within this range for example 68 of wells with scvf in british columbia canada had flow rates below 1 m3 d 1 and 25 between 1 and 10 m3 d wisen et al 2019 similarly the vast majority of reported scvf rates in alberta canada are also below 10 m3 d 1 dusseault et al 2014 it should be noted that very large scvf rates exceeding 1000 m3 d 1 have also been reported e g nowamooz et al 2015 but were not considered in this study imposed leakage rates were sustained for the full 20 year simulation period the assumption of a constant leakage rate over long time periods was also made by rice et al 2018 field measurements of leakage from abandoned wells in pennsylvania that remained virtually constant over a 3 year time period support this assumption kang et al 2016 as do measured scps that sustained over measurements periods up to nearly 10 years lackey and rajaram 2018 while properties of sandy aquifers are well known for single phase problems experimental studies where multiphase properties are determined are sparse to reduce the number of possible scenarios three sets of experimentally determined values for an air water system were used for the porosity permeability entry pressure and pore size distribution clayton 1999 as a base case assumption the properties of a coarse grained fluvial sand d50 of 0 61 mm were taken table 1 the effect of migration through finer grained sands was considered by implementing the values determined for a hydraulic fill d50 of 0 16 mm and a clayey alluvium d50 of 0 09 mm hereafter we refer to these as a fine sand and very fine sand respectively according to the wentworth scale of grain size classifications wentworth 1922 given that the transverse permeability is not known an anisotropy factor kh kv of 5 was assumed in all simulations variations in anisotropy with a kh kv of 1 and 10 were simulated in scenarios 14 and 15 respectively table 1 a residual gas saturation of 1 was assumed the sensitivity of model outcomes to the residual gas saturation was investigated in scenarios 12 and 13 with values of 0 and 15 respectively the residual wetting phase saturation was set to 10 for all simulations in scenarios 16 and 17 the inlet boundary size was changed to 1 1 m2 and 4 4 m2 while maintaining the total gas flow rate over the boundary 2 5 setup of two layered case studies based on real sites for the sensitivity analysis a simplified homogeneous sandy aquifer was considered however in unconsolidated sedimentary basins these aquifers are typically alternated by layers of both coarser and finer grained sediments ranging from gravel to clay to investigate the effect of such stratification on gas migration additional simulations were carried out based on the hydrogeology observed at two locations where methane leakage was recently shown to occur at the first location near the village of sleen in the east of the netherlands gas migration resulted from a blowout that occurred in 1965 schout et al 2018 at the second location in a village called monster in the west of the netherlands gas migration was detected above a fully decommissioned cut and buried gas well schout et al 2019 this leak was more recently closed off by the responsible operator in accordance with dutch law hydrogeologically these two locations are quite different as they are situated at opposite ends of the netherlands fig s2 hence they serve as two distinct case studies used to investigate the effects of horizontal layering on gas migration however it is important to note here that the goal is not to reproduce exactly the leakage conditions at these sites as required information about the depth and magnitude of the leaks is not known lithological and permeability data were retrieved from the publicly available national hydrogeological model regis ii vernes and doorn 2005 regis ii divides the subsurface into sandy complex and clayey layers complex layers typically consist of successions of more and less permeable sediments that are taken together as one regional layer as a result they often have a large anisotropy with a much lower vertical than horizontal permeability where not given anisotropy was assumed to be 5 for sandy layers and 10 for clay layers porosities were assumed to be 30 for sandy layers 35 for complex layers and 40 for clay layers the brooks corey pore size distribution index was assumed to be 1 5 for sandy layers following the experimentally determined value for the sand used in the base case scenario accordingly a smaller pore size distribution index was chosen for the clayey 0 75 and for complex 0 5 layers reflecting the larger variation in pore sizes that may be expected for such lithologies the leverett j function eq 7 was used to scale the entry pressure based on the ratio between porosity and permeability separate reference values were used for the complex sandy and clayey units table s1 7 j s w p c s w k ϕ the bedrock at the sleen site can be considered the top of the breda formation at 126 m depth the case study modelled after this site was therefore constructed from this interface up to the surface at the monster location the thick clay unit below the base of the maassluis formation at 231 m depth was considered as the bedrock furthermore the surficial holocene deposits 55 m thick are not included in the model as regis ii does not provide data on them the modelled section is therefore 176 m thick the resulting hydrogeological input data used for both case studies is shown in fig 2 for each case two simulations were carried out one with a groundwater head gradient of 25 cm km 1 and one with 100 cm km 1 on top of the hydrostatic pressure a flow rate of 10 m3 ch4 atm d was assumed for all simulations otherwise the boundary and initial conditions were kept equal to those used in the sensitivity analysis the width of the model was extended to 80 m to avoid gas phase pools below interfaces of entry pressure or permeability reaching the boundaries of the model given the extended size of these models and the more complex hydrogeology grid refinement was slightly reduced to 1 1 1 m to improve run times 3 results first an assessment of the potential for methane retention in the subsurface is briefly presented and the relative magnitude of forces relevant to methane migration for the unconsolidated aquifers under study then the results of the sensitivity analysis are presented followed by the results of hydrogeologically layered case studies 3 1 dimensional analysis of methane retention and migration within the range of temperature and pressure considered in this study that result from a maximum depth of 480 m below water table methane aqueous solubility and gas phase density increase from 31 to 1112 mg l 1 and 0 69 to 32 3 kg m 3 respectively fig s3 while methane mass density as a gas phase is much greater than its solubility at equal depths the mass stored in the aqueous phase is roughly equal at gas phase saturations of 4 fig 3 for gas saturations exceeding 4 retention in the gas phase starts to rapidly exceed aqueous retention at a gas saturation of 4 and a depth of 60 m below the water table the cumulative storage in both phases is 0 2 kg m 3 fig 3 in comparison the flow rate in our base case scenario is 0 1 m3 ch4 atm d 1 equal to a methane mass flow rate of 0 07 kg d 1 or flux of 0 02 kg m 2 d 1 given the inlet area of 4 m2 therefore at this depth it would require 10 days to saturate 1 m3 of aquifer with methane assuming a gas saturation of 4 although this is just a first approximation which notably does not take into account the replenishment of available groundwater for methane to dissolve in due to groundwater flow it confirms that there is indeed potential for subsurface methane retention to significantly affect the monitorability of gas migration originating at depth following the definitions in kopp 2009 a dimensional analysis of the balance of forces in the system was carried out preliminary testing showed that for the gas migration velocities encountered in our sensitivity analysis viscous forces were insignificant compared to both gravity and capillary forces hence the system is characterized by the dimensionless bond number 8 bo capillary forces gravitational forces p cr ρ w ρ g g l cr where pcr and lcr are the critical pressure and length respectively and g is the gravity constant 9 81 m s 2 the critical pressure is defined as the capillary pressure drop over the saturation front length and is therefore roughly equal to entry pressure typically for advection driven flow systems the critical length is taken to be equal to the length of the saturation front width kopp 2009 when assuming a critical length equal to the discretization length 0 5 m capillary forces equal gravitational forces for entry pressure values of 5 kpa fig s4 this shows that for the three sands considered in the sensitivity analysis which have a maximum entry pressure of 3 9 kpa table 1 gravitational forces likely dominate however the complex and clayey layers in the hydrogeologically layered case studies have a maximum entry pressure of 7 8 kpa fig 2 depending on the actual width of the saturation front capillary forces likely exceed gravitational forces for these clayey sediments 3 2 sensitivity analysis 3 2 1 retention by ch4 dissolution in the base case scenario table 1 the upward buoyancy driven migration of the gas plume from the base of the simulated aquifer to its top 60 m interval takes 1 65 years fig 4a and table 2 due to the coarse grain size and relatively low methane flux migration is mostly vertical and the gas phase stays within the column overlying the inlet boundary this observation is in line with the findings of the dimensional analysis and confirms that gravitational forces indeed dominate in this case maximum gas phase saturations remain low at only 2 4 as the gas phase migrates the surrounding water column is saturated throughout and methane saturated groundwater is advectively transported away from the gas phase plume allowing more gaseous methane to be dissolved fig 5 migration time reduces to 1 14 years when the darcy velocity in the aquifer is reduced to zero scenario 2 and just 0 35 years if in addition the initial concentration of methane throughout the aquifer is raised from 0 to 95 of the solubility scenario 3 therefore methane dissolution from the bottom to the top of a 60 m thick sandy aquifer with a groundwater darcy velocity of only 1 m yr 1 causes the migration of a 0 1 m3 ch4 atm d 1 leak to occur 1 3 years more slowly than it would have without dissolution the difference in results of the first three scenarios is more pronounced when looking at the percentage of inflowing methane that exits the model through the top boundary qout qin for scenario 3 qout qin reaches 82 in a year and goes to 100 after approximately 5 years fig 4a ultimately this fraction even slightly exceeds 100 as some of the initially dissolved methane also passes through the top boundary fig 4a for scenario 2 when both the initial methane concentration and groundwater velocity are zero qout qin increases gradually with time to 91 after 20 years the remaining 9 is trapped in the aquifer by dissolution and subsequent diffusion away from the gas phase plume with time this fraction would steadily increase further as the aquifer saturates with methane and the rate of diffusion slows down however for the base case scenario these outcomes are entirely different as qout qin stabilizes after 4 years when just 10 of the imposed methane flow rate migrates on through the top boundary this shows that dissolution in combination with advective transport exerts a much stronger control on gas migration than dissolution with diffusive transport even for groundwater with a darcy velocity of only 1 m yr 1 3 2 2 impact of methane flow rate the relative impact of dissolutive retention is significantly reduced when increasing the methane flow rate through the inlet by a factor of 10 from 0 1 to 1 m3 ch4 atm d 1 scenario 4 while maximum gas phase saturations increased to 4 6 migration is still primarily vertical and migration time reduced from 1 65 year in the base case scenario to just 0 16 year table 2 therefore a smaller fraction of migration methane can be dissolved and retained in the aquifer given that the groundwater velocity was kept equal and qout qin stabilizes after just 2 years at 85 compared to 4 years and 10 in the base case scenario fig 4a 3 2 3 impact of sand properties due to the smaller permeability larger entry pressure and smaller pore size distributions of the finer grained sands simulated in scenarios 5 and 6 table 1 gas phase propagation patterns are changed considerably with respect to the base case fig 5 particularly for the case of a very fine sand scenario 6 with a 10 times smaller pore size distribution index 0 15 versus 1 5 in the base case the gaseous plume becomes more rounded fig 5a this also leads to some minor upstream migration of the gas phase and is the result of an increase in capillary force which acts in all directions equally relative to the gravitational force which acts only vertically upwards in the fine sand case scenario 5 both vertical and horizontal permeabilities are 7 times lower than in the base case due to this increased resistance to flow the maximum gas phase saturation becomes higher than in the base case 3 0 versus 2 4 the gas phase can be seen to migrate slightly along with groundwater flow in both scenarios with finer average grain sizes fig 5b ultimately the change in shape and decreased speed of upward propagation allows more methane to be dissolved in both cases given that darcy velocities were kept equal this causes the gas phase propagation to stagnate at 6 5 m and 18 5 m below the top of the model domain for the fine sand and the very fine sand cases respectively table 2 hence qout qin remains 0 the distance with which methane has been transported at the base of the model is 28 m in the base case scenario 24 m in scenario 5 and 34 m in scenario 6 calculated from the inlet at x 42 m to where the concentration equals half that of the solubility at 60 m depth 204 mg l 1 the difference between these distances is caused by the differences in porosity resulting in varying effective groundwater velocities it should be noted that due to diffusion the distance where methane concentrations are sufficiently large to be readily detected in groundwater samples 0 1 mg l 1 is almost twice as large fig 5b 3 2 4 impact of groundwater flow velocity gas migration resulting from a 1 m3 ch4 atm d 1 flow rate is not impacted greatly when raising groundwater velocity from 1 to 10 m yr 1 scenarios 4 and 7 migration time increases from 0 16 to 0 25 year and qout qin is reduced from 85 to 76 table 2 however when groundwater velocity is further increased to 100 m yr 1 scenario 8 the gas plume movement is severely impacted and migration stagnates at 53 5 m below the top of the aquifer having moved up just 6 5 m fig 4b the impact of a 100 m yr 1 groundwater flow velocity was also assessed for an even higher methane flow rate of 10 m3 ch4 atm d 1 scenario 10 the higher flow rate results in larger maximum gas saturations 6 2 and much more rapid gas phase migration as the top of the aquifer was reached in 0 06 years however qout qin stabilized at just 2 this shows that even large gaseous flow rates can be severely impacted by dissolutive retention in spite of a very rapid upward migration of the gas phase 3 2 5 impact of aquifer depth the depth of the aquifer was increased 4 and 8 times in scenarios 11 and 12 respectively resulting in an increased depth of the base of the aquifer of 240 m and 480 m depth aquifer thickness remains 60 m simulations were run with a methane flow rate of 1 m3 ch4 atm d 1 and are thus compared to that of scenario 4 table 1 the average methane solubility over the resulting depth intervals is 4 8 and 8 6 times higher than in the base case scenario and the average gas phase density increases 5 3 and 10 9 times fig s3 both aqueous and gaseous retention capacity is therefore greatly increased at these depths and model outcomes are indeed significantly changed as migration time to the top of the aquifer increased from 0 16 year to 0 7 year at 240 m depth and 1 45 year at 480 m depth table 2 by extension qout qin stabilized later and decreased from 85 to 45 at 240 m depth and to 16 at 480 m depth fig 4 3 2 6 impact of the residual gas saturation in scenario 12 the residual gas saturation was lowered to 0 migration time to the top of the aquifer decreased to 1 09 years compared to 1 65 years in the base case scenario qout qin increased from 10 to 16 this shows that even very small variations in residual gas saturation impact gas retention and migration in scenario 13 the residual gas saturation was raised to 15 as the residual gas saturation acts as a sort of threshold value below which flow cannot start this causes gas phase saturations to become much larger than in the base case scenario and thus more gas is stored in the porous medium migration of the gas phase plume slows down considerably and had nearly stagnated after 20 years of simulation at a depth of 4 m below the top of the aquifer table 2 3 2 7 impact of anisotropy variations in anisotropy were modelled by raising the vertical permeability to equal the horizontal permeability in scenario 14 kh kv 1 and lowering it to 1 10th of the horizontal permeability in scenario 15 kh kv 10 table 1 the expected higher and lower gas migration speed results in the gas reaching the top of the aquifer in only 0 80 years for the lower anisotropy case and in 3 19 years in the higher anisotropy case compared to 1 65 in the base case scenario table 2 in turn the change in gas migration velocity affects the amount of methane that is dissolved and qout qin after 20 years of leakage changes to 24 and 2 for scenarios 14 and 15 respectively 3 2 8 impact of the area over which the influx occurs the results of earlier simulations and the dimensional analysis demonstrate that for the flow rates considered in this study and parameter values typical of sandy aquifers buoyancy driven vertical gas migration dominates as a consequence the degree of dissolutive retention is not only related to the groundwater velocity flow rate and sediment properties but also depends on the area of the inlet this determines the leakage flux l3 l 2 d 1 and hence the amount of water that is available for methane to dissolve in to investigate the importance of this effect the inlet boundary size was reduced from 2 2 m2 to 1 1 m2 in scenario 16 while keeping qin equal upward migration velocity increased considerably and gas reached to the top of the aquifer in 1 12 years while qout qin after 20 years increased to 20 compared 1 65 years and 10 in the base case when increasing the inlet area to 4 4 m2 scenario 17 migration velocity was significantly reduced such that stagnation occurred at 17 m below the top of the aquifer table 2 3 3 layered case studies based on real sites 3 3 1 case study 1 sleen site the modelling domain of the first case study consists of a simplified hydrogeology with 7 main layers cumulatively 126 m thick fig 2 the lowest layer is characterized by a high anisotropy factor of 125 kh kv and low vertical permeability of 4 2 10 14 m2 this complex layer is overlain by 5 sandy sections with slightly varying permeabilities notably the third layer from the bottom is a coarse sand and has the highest horizontal permeability of 1 1 10 10 m2 the sandy units are only interbedded by a 1 m thick complex layer with a low vertical permeability from 1 to 2 m depth two scenarios were carried out using this parametrization one with a constant head gradient of 0 25 m km 1 and the other with 1 m km 1 given the constant head gradient groundwater velocities in the coarse sandy layer are highest with darcy velocities of 8 6 and 34 2 m yr 1 in the first and second scenario respectively fig 2 the low kv in the highly anisotropic bottom layer causes significant lateral spreading of the methane plume to occur with gas phase saturations greater than 6 close to the inlet in the 0 25 m km 1 head gradient scenario this spreading occurs more or less symmetrically in each direction fig 6 in the 1 00 m km 1 scenario the plume is tilted more strongly in the direction of groundwater flow gas migration through this 49 m thick layer takes roughly 3 2 years in both scenarios in comparison migration through the remaining 77 m thick modelling domain occurs in only 1 9 years in the first scenario table s2 dissolution of gaseous methane in the horizontally flowing groundwater is highly significant as evidenced by the stagnation of the gas phase plume in the high permeability coarse sand layer in the 1 00 m km 1 scenario fig 6 the high groundwater velocities here combined with the lateral spreading of the methane plume that occurs in the underlying layers causes the 10 m3 ch4 atm d 1 flow rate to be completely dissolved once the plume reaches a depth of around 52 m in the 0 25 m km 1 scenario qout qin stabilizes after 20 years at 41 table s2 the radius of the gaseous plume at the top of the simulated section which in this case represents the groundwater table reaches a maximum value of around 20 m and is slightly elongated in the direction of groundwater flow 3 3 2 case study 2 monster site similar to the first case study the lowest layer of the second case study consists of a complex unit with a low vertical permeability and high anisotropy however the overlying stratigraphy is notably different than in the first case study and is characterized by the presence of 5 low permeability high entry pressure clay layers that alternate the sandy aquifers fig 2 particularly the first and second clay layers from the bottom at depths of 155 143 m and 119 110 m have much lower vertical permeabilities 4 10 15 m2 accordingly they are also assigned higher entry pressures 7 8 kpa than the sandy units and the values considered in the sensitivity analysis the sandy aquifers are also slightly less permeable than in the first case study resulting in darcy velocities of 0 7 m yr 1 and 2 7 m yr 1 for the low and high head gradient scenario s respectively the modelled section is 176 m thick and the top of the model is at 55 m depth gas migrating through the top boundary would enter the overlying holocene deposits which were not considered in our simulations as in the first case study the complex unit at the base of the model causes substantial lateral spreading fig 7 after around 3 years the migrating gas phase encounters the first clay layer which results in significant gas phase pooling invasion of the clay layer only occurs after gaseous saturations exceed 6 at that saturation the combined capillary and gravitational forces were large enough to overcome the entry pressure barrier in the low head gradient scenario this gaseous pool grows to saturations exceeding 10 and a diameter of roughly 70 m in the high head gradient scenario less pooling occurs due to the larger amount of methane that is already dissolved in the underlying units however the pool is more extensive in the direction of groundwater flow similar behavior is observed at the 2nd clay layer but entry pressures assigned to the remaining three clay layers were not sufficient to cause significant pooling in the low head gradient scenario the gas phase plume reaches the top of the modelled domain after 16 2 years even at the end of the 50 year simulation time qout qin had not fully stabilized reaching a value of 46 3 table s2 due to the relatively slow upward migration pooling of gas below the clay layers and low groundwater velocities in the clay layers the dissolved methane plume takes on a pine tree like shape fig 7 in the high head gradient scenario gas phase migration stagnates at 103 m depth or 48 m below the top of the modelling domain notably the center of the gaseous plume at that depth can be seen to have shifted by roughly 30 m in the direction of groundwater flow this is caused by the imposed hydraulic gradient which results in slightly lower water pressures downstream given that the entry pressure is defined as p e p g p l the migrating gas will preferentially invade cells those cells and the plume shifts in the direction of groundwater flow 4 discussion 4 1 upward migration and retention of methane gas for the simulated homogeneous sandy aquifers and leakage flow rates up to 1 m3 ch4 atm d 1 gas migration was shown to be primarily buoyancy driven and vertical fig 5 as expected based on an analysis of the relative magnitude of gravitational and capillary forces fig s4 and as observed by other researchers for weakly isotopic sandy porous media klazinga et al 2019 a limited amount of up or down gradient flow of gas only occurred for two simulations with more fine grained sediment properties fig 5 due to their lower vertical permeability and an increase in capillary forces gas phase saturations remained low and reached up to around 5 depending on the imposed flow rate and permeability at these saturations the potential mass storage of methane in the aqueous phase is either larger than or equal to the storage in the gaseous phase fig 3 even without considering the additional dissolution capacity with groundwater flow gaseous retention has been shown to be significant in simulations of methane migrating from gas reservoirs towards shallow aquifers when assuming large residual gas saturations of up to 30 kissinger et al 2013 however there is little consensus on appropriate values to use for simulating gas migration through unconsolidated aquifers while klazinga et al 2019 used a single value of 10 rice et al 2018 chose a negligibly small value arguing that gas cannot be trapped during processes with strictly increasing gaseous saturations i e drainage which is the case in our numerical simulations however gas migration through real world heterogeneous sediments is likely to be a more dynamic process as a result intermittent periods of imbibition may still occur particularly when leakage at the leakage point is not entirely continuous in spite of this uncertainty model outcomes showed relatively little sensitivity to a change in residual gas saturation from 1 to 0 scenario 12 table 2 because gas migration is more strongly controlled by retention in the aqueous phase at those concentrations on the contrary an imposed residual saturation of 15 exerted a strong control on upward gas migration leading to a much more slowly developing gas plume scenario 13 table 2 4 2 retention of methane by dissolution the sensitivity analysis showed that dissolutive retention of methane in unconsolidated sedimentary aquifers can play a major role in limiting upward gas migration even low groundwater flow velocities 1 m yr 1 resulted in significant methane retention fig 4a on the contrary retention was negligible in the absence of groundwater flow this shows that it is primarily driven by advective transport of dissolved methane away from the gas phase plume rather than diffusive transport hence retention is proportional to the groundwater velocity and methane solubility the effect of retention on methane migration was therefore also much less significant for a simulation where the initial aqueous ch4 concentration was raised to 95 solubility in this scenario migration time through the 60 m thick aquifer was just 0 35 years compared to 1 65 years in the base case with fully unsaturated groundwater fig 4a this also highlights that upward methane gas migration can be more rapid in areas with pre occurring concentrations of dissolved methane however natural methane concentrations near solubility are rarely found in shallow groundwater as an example the methane solubility at just 60 m depth below the water table 200 mg l 1 fig s3 already exceeds the maximum concentration ever observed in dutch shallow groundwater 120 mg l 1 cirkel et al 2015 hence dissolutive retention can still be significant even for locations with relatively high methane concentrations besides groundwater velocity and initial methane concentrations model outcomes indicate a strong control of the sediment properties and the magnitude of the leak as they determine the velocity and dimensions of the upward migrating gas phase for a given groundwater velocity a more dilute or more slowly migrating gas plume allows for a larger fraction of the total flux to dissolve sediment properties that limit upward migration include the vertical permeability the residual gas saturation and the capillary pressure saturation and relative permeability relations using the brooks corey model the latter two are defined by the capillary entry pressure and the pore size distribution index indeed for two simulated scenarios with sediment properties associated with more finely grained sediments d50 0 16 and 0 09 mm compared to 0 61 mm in the base case methane migration resulting from a 0 1 m3 ch4 atm d 1 flow rate stagnated entirely due to the complete dissolution of the migrating gas plume at depth fig 5 model outcomes also show that the dimension of the inlet over which the leakage is imposed also has a strong influence here we assumed that gas migrated into the model domain over a 2 2 m2 area and that the origin of the leak was somewhere below the bottom of the model domain for example caused by gas circumvention or scp induced leakage fig 1 this also explains why retention was greatly enhanced in two simulated case studies where the sandy aquifers where alternated by sediment beds of lower permeability fig 2 besides their greater thickness and depth such layers cause significant spreading of the gaseous plume to occur which in turn enhances dissolutive retention significantly figs 6 and 7 flow rates of 10 m3 ch4 atm d 1 were either completely dissolved causing migration to stagnate well below the top of the modelled domain or took several decades to fully develop table s2 significant lateral spreading of migrating methane was also shown to occur for scp induced leakage originating in a low permeable shale below a shallow aquifer rice et al 2018 in such conditions our results show that more permeable overlying layers can become strong barriers to upward migration due to dissolutive retention conversely the impact of dissolutive retention would be much smaller when methane migration is focused through high permeable pathways such as faults or fractures as methane solubility is strongly depth dependent fig s3 dissolutive retention is likely to be even more significant when gas migration occurs at greater depths than those considered in this study however the effect of increasing solubility due to increasing pressures may be counteracted somewhat by increasing salinities which decrease methane solubility also groundwater is generally more stagnant at depth than in surficial aquifers as shown in this work dissolutive retention is limited in the absence of groundwater flow the complex interaction of these processes and their effect on the fate of gas migration occurring at depths greater than those considered in this study up to 480 mbgl would be a relevant subject for further research 4 3 gaseous pooling and permeability clay layers to gas migration while significant gas phase pooling occurred below the low permeable clay layers k v up to minimum of 4 10 15 m2 p e up to 7 8 kpa in the 2nd case study they were ultimately permeable to the migrating gas fig 7 invasion of a higher entry pressure layer requires a large enough gas accumulation in the underlying layer such that the combined capillary and gravitational forces exceed the entry pressure barrier for large enough entry pressure values and horizontal barriers such conditions would not be obtained as the accumulating gas pool spreads out laterally into a thin pancake like shape high resolution permeability measurements have shown that thin low permeability clay lenses can be present within larger clayey formations with permeabilities that are orders of magnitude lower than the average permeability of the unit rogiers et al 2014 given their low permeability and presumably higher entry pressure these lenses would likely act as impermeable barriers to gas phase flow essentially turning the entire formation into a cap rock however the ubiquity and lateral extent of these lenses is poorly understood therefore further research into how heterogeneity of clay deposits impacts gas migration would be required 4 4 continuum modelling of gas migration the low observed saturations call into question whether the injected gas actually forms a continuous phase and hence whether the widely used darcy s law approach is applicable for modelling gas migration through unconsolidated aquifers air sparging experiments have shown that for unconsolidated sediments the injected gas phase migrates as continuous gaseous channels when grain sizes are 1 mm for larger grain sizes the flow pattern gradually changes to discontinuous bubble flow brooks et al 1999 the grain sizes considered in this study fall in the former category and hence channel flow may be expected to dominate although the flow type is also dependent on the flux size furthermore whether such migration takes the form of a dendritic network of small channels or a smaller amount of larger gas channels is poorly understood brooks et al 1999 continuous dewatered channels through which the gas phase dominantly migrates also occurred in the field experiments of gas migration by cahill et al 2018 observed dissolved methane concentrations below theoretical solubility were attributed to this flow pattern as the available contact area over which mass transfer between phases can occur is smaller and the collected groundwater samples aggregate both water that has been in contact with a gas channel and water that has not as this process is not captured in our simulations the resulting amount of dissolution may be overestimated on the other hand mechanical dispersion was not included in our simulations excluding dispersion actually leads to an underestimation of the dissolutive capacity as dispersion would spread out both the gas phase and the dissolved methane more rapidly allowing for more contact with the water and quicker transport of dissolved methane away from the gas phase plume ultimately the suitability of continuum models for modelling gas migration should be further analyzed through reproduction of experimental results a promising experimental method which could be employed for this purpose was recently published by van de ven and mumford 2018 who injected gaseous co2 at the bottom of a 2d flow cell and used ph as a proxy to visually track dissolved co2 concentrations reproducing such experiments with numerical simulation would be a good model validation strategy 4 5 implications for methane monitoring from this study a number of important implications for monitoring of gas migration and leakages in the vicinity of oil and gas wells can be derived notably surficial expressions of gas leakage originating at depth in unconsolidated sedimentary basins may take several years to manifest in settings dominated by relatively coarse grained sands and may take at least up to several decades when migrating gas also encounters interbedded low permeable layers surficial detection of leaking oil and gas wellbores may therefore only become possible long after the onset of leakage and potentially after wells have already been abandoned this is particularly relevant as in many oil and gas jurisdictions decommissioned wells are cut and buried below the ground surface davies et al 2014 schout et al 2019 in which case direct measurements of well integrity failure at the wellhead are no longer possible furthermore for example in the netherlands there are currently no regulations in place that require operators to monitor the locations of gas wells for extensive periods post decommissioning relying on surficial flux measurements or near surface groundwater wells may lead to the underestimation of the actual occurrence and magnitude of gas leakage and groundwater contamination at depth may remain unnoticed hence measuring dissolved gas molecular and isotopic compositions in groundwater wells in close proximity to potential leakage points is likely a more reliable method when surface expressions do occur the dissolution of methane may still be such that measured fluxes at the surface only represent a fraction of the flow rate at the leakage point lastly our simulations show that regional groundwater flow may cause the center of a migrating gas plume to be transported several tens of meters downstream from the well before reaching the surface recent field studies have employed search radii of 15 m schout et al 2019 and 20 m forde et al 2019 from the coordinates of gas wells when carrying out surficial flux measurements while likely suitable in most cases widening the investigated area in the direction of groundwater flow may need to be considered depending on the conditions 5 conclusions oil and gas well failure leading to gas migration in the subsurface poses both an environmental and safety hazard effective mitigation of these hazards and the proper assessment of their impact is reliant on the successful detection and quantification of leaks in this study upward methane migration through unconsolidated aquifers was analyzed using two phase two component h2o and ch4 numerical simulations in dumux results show that the retention of migrating methane due to dissolution into laterally flowing groundwater can become significant at groundwater darcy velocities as low as 1 m yr 1 retention was shown to be dependent on a complex interaction between the lateral groundwater velocity the depth of the leak and the velocity and shape of the upwardly migrating gas plume the latter is in turn a function of the leakage flux and sediment properties permeability capillary pressure saturation and relative permeability relations and residual gas saturation across a range of conditions representative of unconsolidated aquifers and leak sizes up to 1 m3 ch4 atm d 1 the time it took before the gas plume propagated through to the top of the modelled domain varied from less than 2 months to 5 years in some scenarios the total methane leakage rate was dissolved and transported laterally causing the gas plume to stagnate at depth subsurface methane retention was even more pronounced in additional simulations of migration through stratified sequences based on the hydrogeological conditions at two leaking gas wells in the netherlands consisting of a number of alternating sedimentary units ranging in grain size from clays to coarse sands under such conditions depending on the imposed groundwater head gradient flow rates of up to 10 m3 ch4 atm d 1 were either entirely retained in subsurface or took several decades to fully develop not only the presence of fine grained and low permeable layers formed barriers to upward gas migration but also high permeable sands with large groundwater velocities these allow for a larger dissolutive capacity particularly when the migrating gas phase has been spread out laterally by underlying low permeability units overall the results of this study show that for the most commonly observed methane leakage rates 0 1 10 m3 d 1 unconsolidated aquifer systems with lateral groundwater flow can retain significant amounts of migrating methane due to dissolution consequently resulting atmospheric methane emissions above such leaks may be delayed with decades after the onset of leakage significantly reduced or prevented

1534,methane leaking at depth from hydrocarbon wells poses an environmental and safety hazard however determining the occurrence and magnitude of gas migration at ground surface is challenging as part of the leaking gas is retained during upward migration we investigated migration through unconsolidated sedimentary aquifers using a two phase two component water and methane flow and transport model constructed in dumux a sensitivity analysis for migration through a 60 m thick sandy aquifer showed that retention by dissolution can be significant even with low groundwater darcy velocities of 1 m yr 1 retention was negligible in the absence of groundwater flow besides groundwater velocity both hydrogeological permeability entry pressure pore size distribution and residual gas saturation and leakage conditions depth magnitude and spatial dimensions determined model outcomes additional simulations with interbedded finer grained sediments resulted in substantial lateral spreading of migrating gas this delayed upward migration and enhanced retention in overlying sandy units where groundwater velocities are highest overall the results of this study show that for unconsolidated aquifer systems and the most commonly observed leakage rates 0 1 10 m3 d 1 significant amounts of migrating methane can be retained due to dissolution into laterally flowing groundwater consequently resulting atmospheric methane emissions above such leaks may be delayed with decades after the onset of leakage significantly reduced or prevented entirely 1 introduction the reliance on fossil fuel resources for the majority of the world s energy supply has resulted in a large number of onshore hydrocarbon wells conservatively estimated at over 4 million davies et al 2014 in spite of efforts to maintain the vertically isolating function of geological formations that are penetrated when installing and operating such wells failure of the wellbore system is a commonly observed problem davies et al 2014 and can lead to leakage of hazardous liquids and gases furthermore research has shown that this risk continues or may develop even after the active life time of wells and their abandonment kang et al 2014 townsend small et al 2016 particularly upward leakage of methane through anthropogenically opened unintended connections between hydrocarbon reservoirs and the shallow subsurface has become a growing concern worldwide as it may contribute to greenhouse gas emissions kang et al 2014 deteriorate water quality vengosh et al 2014 and form an explosion hazard chilingar and endres 2005 on top of that leaky wells could serve as pathways for the migration of other fluids when the downhole conditions are actively changed for example when hydraulic fracturing is carried out brownlow et al 2016 or co2 is stored gasda et al 2004 in nearby wells thus their presence may also hamper the safe implementation of future uses of the subsurface to be able to quantify and mitigate these risks the accurate detection of gas leakage is vital this is typically achieved by measurements of either sustained casing pressure scp or surface casing vent flow scvf at the wellhead king and king 2013 however these measurements may only reflect a part of the total leakage flux as a significant fraction of leaking gas can escape the wellbore system entirely and enter the surrounding geology forde et al 2019 which is also referred to as gas migration lackey and rajaram 2018 identified three main mechanisms that may lead to gas migration 1 gas circumvention when gas migrates through a cemented outer annulus and a section of low quality cement is overlain by a section of higher quality cement causing the gas to migrate outwards 2 groundwater crossflow when gas leaks through an uncemented outer annulus and is transported into the surrounding formation by lateral groundwater flow and 3 scp induced gas migration when the gas pressure at the bottom of the surface casing exceeds the hydrostatic pressure leading to gas overflow as gas migrating outside the wellbore may become trapped dissolved or degraded cahill et al 2018 surficial or shallow groundwater wells may only detect leakage after long periods of time or possibly never measurements of soil gas migration are typically carried out using surface flux chambers erno and schmitz 1996 in the vadose zone oxidation and dispersion of methane has indeed been shown to be capable of masking leaking wells from being detected at the surface entirely mcmahon et al 2018 schout et al 2019 furthermore a recent field experiment where methane was released in a shallow aquifer showed that the combined effects of trapping and dissolution of leaking gas in the saturated zone significantly reduced the amount of gas that reached the surface cahill et al 2018 lastly several field based studies have shown that anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to either sulphate reduction van stempvoort et al 2005 wolfe and wilkin 2017 and or reduction of iron and manganese oxides schout et al 2018 woda et al 2018 can lead to attenuation of a migrating methane plume with increasing depth and longer migrating pathways leaking gas can become more severely affected by these attenuation and retention processes and in turn surficial or shallow subsurface measurements become increasingly less reliable tools for detecting gas migration indeed the fate of methane from leaks occurring at depths greater than 10 m was identified as a key knowledge gap in studying gas migration cahill et al 2019 given the complexity and related costs of measuring gas leakage in field or experimental settings methane migration has also been assessed by means of multiphase numerical flow and transport simulations several studies have aimed to determine ranges of possible gas migration flow rates from the reservoir depth to shallow aquifers through high permeability pathways such as faults or improperly cemented annuli kissinger et al 2013 nowamooz et al 2015 reagan et al 2015 schwartz 2015 tatomir et al 2018 simulated migration of methane at great depth 1500 m into an inclined regional aquifer breakthrough times of gaseous methane at various offset distances from the leak origin were calculated that could for example correspond to conductive faults connecting the deep aquifer with an overlying freshwater aquifer rice et al 2018 investigated scp induced gas migration through a shale formation present at the bottom end of the surface casing into an overlying shallow aquifer they showed that for given source zone pressures the permeability distribution and the parametrization of the capillary pressure saturation and relative permeability functions of the shale formation controlled the flow rate of methane into the overlying aquifer depending on these properties flow rates at the base of the aquifer can be slow which may allow methane contamination to go undetected other studies assumed leakage to a shallow aquifer system occurred and focused on the migration and attenuation of methane therein roy et al 2016 coupled their multiphase model to a reactive transport simulator and showed that in confined aquifers anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to sulphate reduction could attenuate a migrating dissolved methane plume significantly this attenuating effect was even larger in unconfined aquifers where aerobic methane oxidation was also possible moortgat et al 2018 simulated gas phase methane migration through an aquifer system characterized by the presence of highly permeable pathways such as fractures and fluvial channels they showed that rapid lateral gas migration over distances of several kilometers is possible through these features but that migration is much less rapid in unfractured media d aniello et al 2019 simulated leakage of methane from a geothermal well into a 2 m thick surficial unconsolidated aquifer given the limited thickness and because mass transfer of methane to the aqueous phase was ignored retention of methane in this aquifer was limited klazinga et al 2019 carried out 2d simulations imitating the field experiments by cahill et al 2017 where methane gas was injected up to 10 m depth in a sandy aquifer lateral migration of the gas phase was shown to be significant even over such a relatively shallow interval as a result of anisotropic sediments and the presence of low permeability layers furthermore wider plumes and larger groundwater flow velocities resulted in larger amounts of methane that were retained in the aquifer the effect of methane retention by dissolution into laterally flowing groundwater has not been considered in detail in previous studies of gas migration in spite of the relatively low solubility of methane dissolutive retention could be important in the shallow part of unconsolidated groundwater systems where groundwater velocities are generally higher methane migration through unconsolidated aquifers is also less likely to be dominated by quick gas phase flow through preferential flow paths which reduces the potential for dissolutive retention other factors also possibly play a role such as the increase in methane aqueous solubility with increasing hydrostatic pressure i e depth and the lateral spreading of the methane plume as a result of anisotropy and low permeable layers the interaction of these transport processes and their influences on gas migration were studied in a parameter sensitivity analysis based on 3d two phase two component numerical simulations across a range of realistic conditions the impacts of horizontally layered unconsolidated aquifer systems on methane migration and retention were illustrated by simulation of a number of additional scenarios based on the geology encountered at two recently identified leaking wellbore sites in the netherlands the overall aim of this study was to determine whether and if so to what extent subsurface methane migration through laterally flowing groundwater is impacted by methane dissolution 2 material and methods 2 1 governing equations and constitutive relations numerical modelling was carried out using the open source multiphysics simulation package dumux ackermann et al 2017 flemisch et al 2011 dumux is capable of calculating multiphase multicomponent flow and transport at the continuum scale also referred to as miscible two phase flow or compositional flow for this study two phases α liquid and gas and two components k h2o and ch4 were considered the model accounts for mass transfer between the two phases as well as the compressibility of both phases phase velocities are calculated using darcy s law furthermore binary diffusion is assumed and the diffusive fluxes in each phase are calculated according to fick s law the fully coupled mass balance equation is then formulated as follows 1 α ϕ ρ α x α k s α t α ρ α x α k κ k rα μ α p α ρ α g α ρ α d eff α x α k q k where φ is the porosity ρ is the density x is the mass fraction s is the saturation κ is the intrinsic permeability tensor k r is the relative permeability μ is the dynamic viscosity p is the pressure g is the gravity vector d eff is the effective diffusion coefficient and q is a source or sink term a number of constitutive relationships are needed to close this system of equations firstly the sum of the saturations and that of the mass fractions of the two components in each phase must equal 1 2 s g s l 1 k x g k 1 k x l k 1 where the subscripts g and w represent the gaseous and liquid phase respectively the phase pressures are related by the capillary pressure p c as given by 3 p g p l p c s g the formulations by brooks and corey 1964 were used for the capillary pressure saturation relationship and relative permeabilities 4 p c s g p e s e 1 λ 5 k rl s e 2 λ 3 k rg 1 s e 2 1 s e 2 λ 1 where p e is the capillary entry pressure s e is the effective saturation and λ is the pore size distribution index s e is defined as 6 s e s l s lr 1 s gr s lr where s lr and s gr are the residual or irreducible liquid and gaseous saturation respectively according to these formulations the relative permeability of the gas phase is 0 as long as s g s gr hence the residual saturations in each cell have to reach at least up to the threshold residual gas saturation before a neighboring cell can be invaded by the gas phase fig s1 a regularization of the brooks corey p c s g relationship was used for s e 1 and s e 0 01 to avoid numerical issues with having an infinite gradient of the p c s g curve the slope of the curve when approaching these limits was extended up to s l 1 and s l 0 respectively fig s1 both water and methane components can be present in either phase concentrations in each phase are assumed to be at thermodynamic equilibrium meaning that mass transfer between the two phases occurs instantaneously at every time step in each control volume methane solubility is determined according to henry s law and is temperature and pressure dependent with the henry s coefficient based on the iapws formulations fernández prini et al 2003 a freshwater aquifer is assumed and therefore the effects of variable salinities on methane solubility are not considered the solubility of methane also determines the phase state of the model with a gas phase appearing once the mole fraction of methane x l ch4 exceeds that of the equilibrium solubility mole fraction and vice versa phase appearance and disappearance are accompanied by a primary variable switch from p l and s g when both phases are present to p l and x l ch4 when only the liquid phase is present energy transport is not simulated and the model is considered to be in thermal equilibrium for the spatial discretization a vertex centered finite volume method box method is used and a fully implicit backward euler method for the temporal discretization helmig 1997 the density of the gaseous phase follows the ideal gas law viscosity is calculated as described in reid et al 1987 in the range of temperature and pressure relevant for this study the density and viscosity of methane gas calculated in this manner were shown to be nearly equal to more complex equations of state kissinger et al 2013 the density and viscosity of the liquid phase are both pressure and temperature dependent according to the iapws definitions wagner and pruss 2002 the influence of the phase composition on the liquid phase properties is not taken into account since even at the greatest depth considered in this study 480 m of water column the maximum ch4 mass concentration is negligible compared to the aqueous phase density 0 1 the diffusion coefficient of water in the gaseous phase is determined according to the method in fuller et al 1966 and the diffusion coefficient of methane in the aqueous phase according to reid et al 1987 mechanical dispersion was not implemented in the model in multiphase systems the dispersion coefficient is saturation dependent which would result in a much more complex system of equations helmig 1997 and excessive runtimes computations were performed on a workstation and parallelized over 16 processors resulting in runtimes of up to 2 days for the sensitivity analysis and 4 days for the layered scenarios 2 2 geological context and conceptual model the range of hydrogeological conditions for which gas migration was studied are representative for unconsolidated sedimentary groundwater systems globally but were inspired by the conditions that prevail in the subsurface of the netherlands the netherlands is one of the major oil and gas producing nations in europe with around 2500 onshore oil and gas wells schout et al 2019 a survey of 986 gas wells by the state supervision of mines sodm revealed some form of well barrier failure at 227 23 of these wells sodm 2019 observations of gas bubbles in flooded well cellars showed that leakage of thermogenic gas occurred at at least 13 wells 1 3 hydrogeologically the country is characterized by the presence of shallow sandy aquifer units of plio pleistocene age these aquifers can be either phreatic or in the northern and western part of the country can be confined by overlying holocene deposits fig s2 a succession of thick marine clays of neogene and paleogene age form the bedrock below the aquifer units in nearly the entire country de vries 2007 typically the surface casing of oil and gas wells would at least extend down into these clays the depths of which can be up to around 500 m below surface in the oil and gas producing areas kombrink et al 2012 the modelled domain is a hypothetical rectangular block of a sandy aquifer within such a unconsolidated sedimentary sequence fig 1a gas migration into the base of the model is assumed conceptually it could be caused by a number of possible failure scenarios occurring below the simulated part of the aquifer including scp induced gas migration or gas circumvention 2 3 domain discretization boundary and initial conditions the dimensions of the simulated aquifer were set to 100 60 60 m xyz sufficiently large so that no boundary effects on gas migration occurred owing to symmetry in the y axis only half of this domain is simulated initial numerical testing showed that model outcomes stabilized when using a grid size smaller than 1x1x1 m hence a grid size of 0 5 0 5 0 5 m was used resulting in a total of 1 440 000 cells the simulation time is 20 years during which injection of ch4 is continuous for the ch4 flux at the inlet mol m 2 s 1 a neumann type boundary was used over 8 cells from x 40 to 42 m 2 1 m2 or what would be 2 2 m2 area when accounting for the half of the domain that is not modelled fig 1b the remainder of the bottom face of the model and the two lateral faces parallel to the direction of groundwater flow are treated as no flow boundaries for both components the two lateral faces perpendicular to groundwater flow are assigned dirichlet conditions with a pressure equal to the hydrostatic pressure albeit with a minor increase in pressure on one side to induce groundwater flow lastly the top face of the model is assigned a no flow condition for h2o and an outflow condition for ch4 this allows methane to escape the model freely through the top boundary but keeps water flowing strictly horizontally conceptually this corresponds to cases where the gas either escapes to the atmosphere or continues to migrate upwards to overlying layers depending on the depth of the top of the domain the model is initially fully water saturated sg 0 and no dissolved methane is present anywhere a thermal gradient of 31 3 c km 1 is imposed in all simulations equivalent to the average thermal gradient found in the netherlands verweij et al 2018 on top of the yearly average ambient air temperature of 10 c the density and viscosity of water inside the model and at its lateral boundaries are determined during an initialization phase that precedes the actual model run 2 4 parameter space sensitivity analysis a total of 17 simulations were run together encompassing a parameter space representative of the expected conditions for gas migration through unconsolidated sandy aquifers table 1 groundwater flow velocities up to 100 m yr 1 were considered as observed for regional groundwater flow in the netherlands bloemendal and hartog 2018 the thickness of the model is 60 m for the base case a depth of 60 m was chosen for the bottom of the model domain with depths of 240 and 480 m also considered preliminary simulations showed that model outcomes are insensitive to the temperature gradient however as simulations ran with a constant temperature of 10 c yielded virtually equal outcomes hence variations in the geothermal gradient were not considered methane flow rates at the inlet were varied between 0 1 and 10 m3 ch4 atm d 1 i e the volumetric ch4 flow rate at atmospheric pressure and 10 c as the majority of reported scvf rates fall within this range for example 68 of wells with scvf in british columbia canada had flow rates below 1 m3 d 1 and 25 between 1 and 10 m3 d wisen et al 2019 similarly the vast majority of reported scvf rates in alberta canada are also below 10 m3 d 1 dusseault et al 2014 it should be noted that very large scvf rates exceeding 1000 m3 d 1 have also been reported e g nowamooz et al 2015 but were not considered in this study imposed leakage rates were sustained for the full 20 year simulation period the assumption of a constant leakage rate over long time periods was also made by rice et al 2018 field measurements of leakage from abandoned wells in pennsylvania that remained virtually constant over a 3 year time period support this assumption kang et al 2016 as do measured scps that sustained over measurements periods up to nearly 10 years lackey and rajaram 2018 while properties of sandy aquifers are well known for single phase problems experimental studies where multiphase properties are determined are sparse to reduce the number of possible scenarios three sets of experimentally determined values for an air water system were used for the porosity permeability entry pressure and pore size distribution clayton 1999 as a base case assumption the properties of a coarse grained fluvial sand d50 of 0 61 mm were taken table 1 the effect of migration through finer grained sands was considered by implementing the values determined for a hydraulic fill d50 of 0 16 mm and a clayey alluvium d50 of 0 09 mm hereafter we refer to these as a fine sand and very fine sand respectively according to the wentworth scale of grain size classifications wentworth 1922 given that the transverse permeability is not known an anisotropy factor kh kv of 5 was assumed in all simulations variations in anisotropy with a kh kv of 1 and 10 were simulated in scenarios 14 and 15 respectively table 1 a residual gas saturation of 1 was assumed the sensitivity of model outcomes to the residual gas saturation was investigated in scenarios 12 and 13 with values of 0 and 15 respectively the residual wetting phase saturation was set to 10 for all simulations in scenarios 16 and 17 the inlet boundary size was changed to 1 1 m2 and 4 4 m2 while maintaining the total gas flow rate over the boundary 2 5 setup of two layered case studies based on real sites for the sensitivity analysis a simplified homogeneous sandy aquifer was considered however in unconsolidated sedimentary basins these aquifers are typically alternated by layers of both coarser and finer grained sediments ranging from gravel to clay to investigate the effect of such stratification on gas migration additional simulations were carried out based on the hydrogeology observed at two locations where methane leakage was recently shown to occur at the first location near the village of sleen in the east of the netherlands gas migration resulted from a blowout that occurred in 1965 schout et al 2018 at the second location in a village called monster in the west of the netherlands gas migration was detected above a fully decommissioned cut and buried gas well schout et al 2019 this leak was more recently closed off by the responsible operator in accordance with dutch law hydrogeologically these two locations are quite different as they are situated at opposite ends of the netherlands fig s2 hence they serve as two distinct case studies used to investigate the effects of horizontal layering on gas migration however it is important to note here that the goal is not to reproduce exactly the leakage conditions at these sites as required information about the depth and magnitude of the leaks is not known lithological and permeability data were retrieved from the publicly available national hydrogeological model regis ii vernes and doorn 2005 regis ii divides the subsurface into sandy complex and clayey layers complex layers typically consist of successions of more and less permeable sediments that are taken together as one regional layer as a result they often have a large anisotropy with a much lower vertical than horizontal permeability where not given anisotropy was assumed to be 5 for sandy layers and 10 for clay layers porosities were assumed to be 30 for sandy layers 35 for complex layers and 40 for clay layers the brooks corey pore size distribution index was assumed to be 1 5 for sandy layers following the experimentally determined value for the sand used in the base case scenario accordingly a smaller pore size distribution index was chosen for the clayey 0 75 and for complex 0 5 layers reflecting the larger variation in pore sizes that may be expected for such lithologies the leverett j function eq 7 was used to scale the entry pressure based on the ratio between porosity and permeability separate reference values were used for the complex sandy and clayey units table s1 7 j s w p c s w k ϕ the bedrock at the sleen site can be considered the top of the breda formation at 126 m depth the case study modelled after this site was therefore constructed from this interface up to the surface at the monster location the thick clay unit below the base of the maassluis formation at 231 m depth was considered as the bedrock furthermore the surficial holocene deposits 55 m thick are not included in the model as regis ii does not provide data on them the modelled section is therefore 176 m thick the resulting hydrogeological input data used for both case studies is shown in fig 2 for each case two simulations were carried out one with a groundwater head gradient of 25 cm km 1 and one with 100 cm km 1 on top of the hydrostatic pressure a flow rate of 10 m3 ch4 atm d was assumed for all simulations otherwise the boundary and initial conditions were kept equal to those used in the sensitivity analysis the width of the model was extended to 80 m to avoid gas phase pools below interfaces of entry pressure or permeability reaching the boundaries of the model given the extended size of these models and the more complex hydrogeology grid refinement was slightly reduced to 1 1 1 m to improve run times 3 results first an assessment of the potential for methane retention in the subsurface is briefly presented and the relative magnitude of forces relevant to methane migration for the unconsolidated aquifers under study then the results of the sensitivity analysis are presented followed by the results of hydrogeologically layered case studies 3 1 dimensional analysis of methane retention and migration within the range of temperature and pressure considered in this study that result from a maximum depth of 480 m below water table methane aqueous solubility and gas phase density increase from 31 to 1112 mg l 1 and 0 69 to 32 3 kg m 3 respectively fig s3 while methane mass density as a gas phase is much greater than its solubility at equal depths the mass stored in the aqueous phase is roughly equal at gas phase saturations of 4 fig 3 for gas saturations exceeding 4 retention in the gas phase starts to rapidly exceed aqueous retention at a gas saturation of 4 and a depth of 60 m below the water table the cumulative storage in both phases is 0 2 kg m 3 fig 3 in comparison the flow rate in our base case scenario is 0 1 m3 ch4 atm d 1 equal to a methane mass flow rate of 0 07 kg d 1 or flux of 0 02 kg m 2 d 1 given the inlet area of 4 m2 therefore at this depth it would require 10 days to saturate 1 m3 of aquifer with methane assuming a gas saturation of 4 although this is just a first approximation which notably does not take into account the replenishment of available groundwater for methane to dissolve in due to groundwater flow it confirms that there is indeed potential for subsurface methane retention to significantly affect the monitorability of gas migration originating at depth following the definitions in kopp 2009 a dimensional analysis of the balance of forces in the system was carried out preliminary testing showed that for the gas migration velocities encountered in our sensitivity analysis viscous forces were insignificant compared to both gravity and capillary forces hence the system is characterized by the dimensionless bond number 8 bo capillary forces gravitational forces p cr ρ w ρ g g l cr where pcr and lcr are the critical pressure and length respectively and g is the gravity constant 9 81 m s 2 the critical pressure is defined as the capillary pressure drop over the saturation front length and is therefore roughly equal to entry pressure typically for advection driven flow systems the critical length is taken to be equal to the length of the saturation front width kopp 2009 when assuming a critical length equal to the discretization length 0 5 m capillary forces equal gravitational forces for entry pressure values of 5 kpa fig s4 this shows that for the three sands considered in the sensitivity analysis which have a maximum entry pressure of 3 9 kpa table 1 gravitational forces likely dominate however the complex and clayey layers in the hydrogeologically layered case studies have a maximum entry pressure of 7 8 kpa fig 2 depending on the actual width of the saturation front capillary forces likely exceed gravitational forces for these clayey sediments 3 2 sensitivity analysis 3 2 1 retention by ch4 dissolution in the base case scenario table 1 the upward buoyancy driven migration of the gas plume from the base of the simulated aquifer to its top 60 m interval takes 1 65 years fig 4a and table 2 due to the coarse grain size and relatively low methane flux migration is mostly vertical and the gas phase stays within the column overlying the inlet boundary this observation is in line with the findings of the dimensional analysis and confirms that gravitational forces indeed dominate in this case maximum gas phase saturations remain low at only 2 4 as the gas phase migrates the surrounding water column is saturated throughout and methane saturated groundwater is advectively transported away from the gas phase plume allowing more gaseous methane to be dissolved fig 5 migration time reduces to 1 14 years when the darcy velocity in the aquifer is reduced to zero scenario 2 and just 0 35 years if in addition the initial concentration of methane throughout the aquifer is raised from 0 to 95 of the solubility scenario 3 therefore methane dissolution from the bottom to the top of a 60 m thick sandy aquifer with a groundwater darcy velocity of only 1 m yr 1 causes the migration of a 0 1 m3 ch4 atm d 1 leak to occur 1 3 years more slowly than it would have without dissolution the difference in results of the first three scenarios is more pronounced when looking at the percentage of inflowing methane that exits the model through the top boundary qout qin for scenario 3 qout qin reaches 82 in a year and goes to 100 after approximately 5 years fig 4a ultimately this fraction even slightly exceeds 100 as some of the initially dissolved methane also passes through the top boundary fig 4a for scenario 2 when both the initial methane concentration and groundwater velocity are zero qout qin increases gradually with time to 91 after 20 years the remaining 9 is trapped in the aquifer by dissolution and subsequent diffusion away from the gas phase plume with time this fraction would steadily increase further as the aquifer saturates with methane and the rate of diffusion slows down however for the base case scenario these outcomes are entirely different as qout qin stabilizes after 4 years when just 10 of the imposed methane flow rate migrates on through the top boundary this shows that dissolution in combination with advective transport exerts a much stronger control on gas migration than dissolution with diffusive transport even for groundwater with a darcy velocity of only 1 m yr 1 3 2 2 impact of methane flow rate the relative impact of dissolutive retention is significantly reduced when increasing the methane flow rate through the inlet by a factor of 10 from 0 1 to 1 m3 ch4 atm d 1 scenario 4 while maximum gas phase saturations increased to 4 6 migration is still primarily vertical and migration time reduced from 1 65 year in the base case scenario to just 0 16 year table 2 therefore a smaller fraction of migration methane can be dissolved and retained in the aquifer given that the groundwater velocity was kept equal and qout qin stabilizes after just 2 years at 85 compared to 4 years and 10 in the base case scenario fig 4a 3 2 3 impact of sand properties due to the smaller permeability larger entry pressure and smaller pore size distributions of the finer grained sands simulated in scenarios 5 and 6 table 1 gas phase propagation patterns are changed considerably with respect to the base case fig 5 particularly for the case of a very fine sand scenario 6 with a 10 times smaller pore size distribution index 0 15 versus 1 5 in the base case the gaseous plume becomes more rounded fig 5a this also leads to some minor upstream migration of the gas phase and is the result of an increase in capillary force which acts in all directions equally relative to the gravitational force which acts only vertically upwards in the fine sand case scenario 5 both vertical and horizontal permeabilities are 7 times lower than in the base case due to this increased resistance to flow the maximum gas phase saturation becomes higher than in the base case 3 0 versus 2 4 the gas phase can be seen to migrate slightly along with groundwater flow in both scenarios with finer average grain sizes fig 5b ultimately the change in shape and decreased speed of upward propagation allows more methane to be dissolved in both cases given that darcy velocities were kept equal this causes the gas phase propagation to stagnate at 6 5 m and 18 5 m below the top of the model domain for the fine sand and the very fine sand cases respectively table 2 hence qout qin remains 0 the distance with which methane has been transported at the base of the model is 28 m in the base case scenario 24 m in scenario 5 and 34 m in scenario 6 calculated from the inlet at x 42 m to where the concentration equals half that of the solubility at 60 m depth 204 mg l 1 the difference between these distances is caused by the differences in porosity resulting in varying effective groundwater velocities it should be noted that due to diffusion the distance where methane concentrations are sufficiently large to be readily detected in groundwater samples 0 1 mg l 1 is almost twice as large fig 5b 3 2 4 impact of groundwater flow velocity gas migration resulting from a 1 m3 ch4 atm d 1 flow rate is not impacted greatly when raising groundwater velocity from 1 to 10 m yr 1 scenarios 4 and 7 migration time increases from 0 16 to 0 25 year and qout qin is reduced from 85 to 76 table 2 however when groundwater velocity is further increased to 100 m yr 1 scenario 8 the gas plume movement is severely impacted and migration stagnates at 53 5 m below the top of the aquifer having moved up just 6 5 m fig 4b the impact of a 100 m yr 1 groundwater flow velocity was also assessed for an even higher methane flow rate of 10 m3 ch4 atm d 1 scenario 10 the higher flow rate results in larger maximum gas saturations 6 2 and much more rapid gas phase migration as the top of the aquifer was reached in 0 06 years however qout qin stabilized at just 2 this shows that even large gaseous flow rates can be severely impacted by dissolutive retention in spite of a very rapid upward migration of the gas phase 3 2 5 impact of aquifer depth the depth of the aquifer was increased 4 and 8 times in scenarios 11 and 12 respectively resulting in an increased depth of the base of the aquifer of 240 m and 480 m depth aquifer thickness remains 60 m simulations were run with a methane flow rate of 1 m3 ch4 atm d 1 and are thus compared to that of scenario 4 table 1 the average methane solubility over the resulting depth intervals is 4 8 and 8 6 times higher than in the base case scenario and the average gas phase density increases 5 3 and 10 9 times fig s3 both aqueous and gaseous retention capacity is therefore greatly increased at these depths and model outcomes are indeed significantly changed as migration time to the top of the aquifer increased from 0 16 year to 0 7 year at 240 m depth and 1 45 year at 480 m depth table 2 by extension qout qin stabilized later and decreased from 85 to 45 at 240 m depth and to 16 at 480 m depth fig 4 3 2 6 impact of the residual gas saturation in scenario 12 the residual gas saturation was lowered to 0 migration time to the top of the aquifer decreased to 1 09 years compared to 1 65 years in the base case scenario qout qin increased from 10 to 16 this shows that even very small variations in residual gas saturation impact gas retention and migration in scenario 13 the residual gas saturation was raised to 15 as the residual gas saturation acts as a sort of threshold value below which flow cannot start this causes gas phase saturations to become much larger than in the base case scenario and thus more gas is stored in the porous medium migration of the gas phase plume slows down considerably and had nearly stagnated after 20 years of simulation at a depth of 4 m below the top of the aquifer table 2 3 2 7 impact of anisotropy variations in anisotropy were modelled by raising the vertical permeability to equal the horizontal permeability in scenario 14 kh kv 1 and lowering it to 1 10th of the horizontal permeability in scenario 15 kh kv 10 table 1 the expected higher and lower gas migration speed results in the gas reaching the top of the aquifer in only 0 80 years for the lower anisotropy case and in 3 19 years in the higher anisotropy case compared to 1 65 in the base case scenario table 2 in turn the change in gas migration velocity affects the amount of methane that is dissolved and qout qin after 20 years of leakage changes to 24 and 2 for scenarios 14 and 15 respectively 3 2 8 impact of the area over which the influx occurs the results of earlier simulations and the dimensional analysis demonstrate that for the flow rates considered in this study and parameter values typical of sandy aquifers buoyancy driven vertical gas migration dominates as a consequence the degree of dissolutive retention is not only related to the groundwater velocity flow rate and sediment properties but also depends on the area of the inlet this determines the leakage flux l3 l 2 d 1 and hence the amount of water that is available for methane to dissolve in to investigate the importance of this effect the inlet boundary size was reduced from 2 2 m2 to 1 1 m2 in scenario 16 while keeping qin equal upward migration velocity increased considerably and gas reached to the top of the aquifer in 1 12 years while qout qin after 20 years increased to 20 compared 1 65 years and 10 in the base case when increasing the inlet area to 4 4 m2 scenario 17 migration velocity was significantly reduced such that stagnation occurred at 17 m below the top of the aquifer table 2 3 3 layered case studies based on real sites 3 3 1 case study 1 sleen site the modelling domain of the first case study consists of a simplified hydrogeology with 7 main layers cumulatively 126 m thick fig 2 the lowest layer is characterized by a high anisotropy factor of 125 kh kv and low vertical permeability of 4 2 10 14 m2 this complex layer is overlain by 5 sandy sections with slightly varying permeabilities notably the third layer from the bottom is a coarse sand and has the highest horizontal permeability of 1 1 10 10 m2 the sandy units are only interbedded by a 1 m thick complex layer with a low vertical permeability from 1 to 2 m depth two scenarios were carried out using this parametrization one with a constant head gradient of 0 25 m km 1 and the other with 1 m km 1 given the constant head gradient groundwater velocities in the coarse sandy layer are highest with darcy velocities of 8 6 and 34 2 m yr 1 in the first and second scenario respectively fig 2 the low kv in the highly anisotropic bottom layer causes significant lateral spreading of the methane plume to occur with gas phase saturations greater than 6 close to the inlet in the 0 25 m km 1 head gradient scenario this spreading occurs more or less symmetrically in each direction fig 6 in the 1 00 m km 1 scenario the plume is tilted more strongly in the direction of groundwater flow gas migration through this 49 m thick layer takes roughly 3 2 years in both scenarios in comparison migration through the remaining 77 m thick modelling domain occurs in only 1 9 years in the first scenario table s2 dissolution of gaseous methane in the horizontally flowing groundwater is highly significant as evidenced by the stagnation of the gas phase plume in the high permeability coarse sand layer in the 1 00 m km 1 scenario fig 6 the high groundwater velocities here combined with the lateral spreading of the methane plume that occurs in the underlying layers causes the 10 m3 ch4 atm d 1 flow rate to be completely dissolved once the plume reaches a depth of around 52 m in the 0 25 m km 1 scenario qout qin stabilizes after 20 years at 41 table s2 the radius of the gaseous plume at the top of the simulated section which in this case represents the groundwater table reaches a maximum value of around 20 m and is slightly elongated in the direction of groundwater flow 3 3 2 case study 2 monster site similar to the first case study the lowest layer of the second case study consists of a complex unit with a low vertical permeability and high anisotropy however the overlying stratigraphy is notably different than in the first case study and is characterized by the presence of 5 low permeability high entry pressure clay layers that alternate the sandy aquifers fig 2 particularly the first and second clay layers from the bottom at depths of 155 143 m and 119 110 m have much lower vertical permeabilities 4 10 15 m2 accordingly they are also assigned higher entry pressures 7 8 kpa than the sandy units and the values considered in the sensitivity analysis the sandy aquifers are also slightly less permeable than in the first case study resulting in darcy velocities of 0 7 m yr 1 and 2 7 m yr 1 for the low and high head gradient scenario s respectively the modelled section is 176 m thick and the top of the model is at 55 m depth gas migrating through the top boundary would enter the overlying holocene deposits which were not considered in our simulations as in the first case study the complex unit at the base of the model causes substantial lateral spreading fig 7 after around 3 years the migrating gas phase encounters the first clay layer which results in significant gas phase pooling invasion of the clay layer only occurs after gaseous saturations exceed 6 at that saturation the combined capillary and gravitational forces were large enough to overcome the entry pressure barrier in the low head gradient scenario this gaseous pool grows to saturations exceeding 10 and a diameter of roughly 70 m in the high head gradient scenario less pooling occurs due to the larger amount of methane that is already dissolved in the underlying units however the pool is more extensive in the direction of groundwater flow similar behavior is observed at the 2nd clay layer but entry pressures assigned to the remaining three clay layers were not sufficient to cause significant pooling in the low head gradient scenario the gas phase plume reaches the top of the modelled domain after 16 2 years even at the end of the 50 year simulation time qout qin had not fully stabilized reaching a value of 46 3 table s2 due to the relatively slow upward migration pooling of gas below the clay layers and low groundwater velocities in the clay layers the dissolved methane plume takes on a pine tree like shape fig 7 in the high head gradient scenario gas phase migration stagnates at 103 m depth or 48 m below the top of the modelling domain notably the center of the gaseous plume at that depth can be seen to have shifted by roughly 30 m in the direction of groundwater flow this is caused by the imposed hydraulic gradient which results in slightly lower water pressures downstream given that the entry pressure is defined as p e p g p l the migrating gas will preferentially invade cells those cells and the plume shifts in the direction of groundwater flow 4 discussion 4 1 upward migration and retention of methane gas for the simulated homogeneous sandy aquifers and leakage flow rates up to 1 m3 ch4 atm d 1 gas migration was shown to be primarily buoyancy driven and vertical fig 5 as expected based on an analysis of the relative magnitude of gravitational and capillary forces fig s4 and as observed by other researchers for weakly isotopic sandy porous media klazinga et al 2019 a limited amount of up or down gradient flow of gas only occurred for two simulations with more fine grained sediment properties fig 5 due to their lower vertical permeability and an increase in capillary forces gas phase saturations remained low and reached up to around 5 depending on the imposed flow rate and permeability at these saturations the potential mass storage of methane in the aqueous phase is either larger than or equal to the storage in the gaseous phase fig 3 even without considering the additional dissolution capacity with groundwater flow gaseous retention has been shown to be significant in simulations of methane migrating from gas reservoirs towards shallow aquifers when assuming large residual gas saturations of up to 30 kissinger et al 2013 however there is little consensus on appropriate values to use for simulating gas migration through unconsolidated aquifers while klazinga et al 2019 used a single value of 10 rice et al 2018 chose a negligibly small value arguing that gas cannot be trapped during processes with strictly increasing gaseous saturations i e drainage which is the case in our numerical simulations however gas migration through real world heterogeneous sediments is likely to be a more dynamic process as a result intermittent periods of imbibition may still occur particularly when leakage at the leakage point is not entirely continuous in spite of this uncertainty model outcomes showed relatively little sensitivity to a change in residual gas saturation from 1 to 0 scenario 12 table 2 because gas migration is more strongly controlled by retention in the aqueous phase at those concentrations on the contrary an imposed residual saturation of 15 exerted a strong control on upward gas migration leading to a much more slowly developing gas plume scenario 13 table 2 4 2 retention of methane by dissolution the sensitivity analysis showed that dissolutive retention of methane in unconsolidated sedimentary aquifers can play a major role in limiting upward gas migration even low groundwater flow velocities 1 m yr 1 resulted in significant methane retention fig 4a on the contrary retention was negligible in the absence of groundwater flow this shows that it is primarily driven by advective transport of dissolved methane away from the gas phase plume rather than diffusive transport hence retention is proportional to the groundwater velocity and methane solubility the effect of retention on methane migration was therefore also much less significant for a simulation where the initial aqueous ch4 concentration was raised to 95 solubility in this scenario migration time through the 60 m thick aquifer was just 0 35 years compared to 1 65 years in the base case with fully unsaturated groundwater fig 4a this also highlights that upward methane gas migration can be more rapid in areas with pre occurring concentrations of dissolved methane however natural methane concentrations near solubility are rarely found in shallow groundwater as an example the methane solubility at just 60 m depth below the water table 200 mg l 1 fig s3 already exceeds the maximum concentration ever observed in dutch shallow groundwater 120 mg l 1 cirkel et al 2015 hence dissolutive retention can still be significant even for locations with relatively high methane concentrations besides groundwater velocity and initial methane concentrations model outcomes indicate a strong control of the sediment properties and the magnitude of the leak as they determine the velocity and dimensions of the upward migrating gas phase for a given groundwater velocity a more dilute or more slowly migrating gas plume allows for a larger fraction of the total flux to dissolve sediment properties that limit upward migration include the vertical permeability the residual gas saturation and the capillary pressure saturation and relative permeability relations using the brooks corey model the latter two are defined by the capillary entry pressure and the pore size distribution index indeed for two simulated scenarios with sediment properties associated with more finely grained sediments d50 0 16 and 0 09 mm compared to 0 61 mm in the base case methane migration resulting from a 0 1 m3 ch4 atm d 1 flow rate stagnated entirely due to the complete dissolution of the migrating gas plume at depth fig 5 model outcomes also show that the dimension of the inlet over which the leakage is imposed also has a strong influence here we assumed that gas migrated into the model domain over a 2 2 m2 area and that the origin of the leak was somewhere below the bottom of the model domain for example caused by gas circumvention or scp induced leakage fig 1 this also explains why retention was greatly enhanced in two simulated case studies where the sandy aquifers where alternated by sediment beds of lower permeability fig 2 besides their greater thickness and depth such layers cause significant spreading of the gaseous plume to occur which in turn enhances dissolutive retention significantly figs 6 and 7 flow rates of 10 m3 ch4 atm d 1 were either completely dissolved causing migration to stagnate well below the top of the modelled domain or took several decades to fully develop table s2 significant lateral spreading of migrating methane was also shown to occur for scp induced leakage originating in a low permeable shale below a shallow aquifer rice et al 2018 in such conditions our results show that more permeable overlying layers can become strong barriers to upward migration due to dissolutive retention conversely the impact of dissolutive retention would be much smaller when methane migration is focused through high permeable pathways such as faults or fractures as methane solubility is strongly depth dependent fig s3 dissolutive retention is likely to be even more significant when gas migration occurs at greater depths than those considered in this study however the effect of increasing solubility due to increasing pressures may be counteracted somewhat by increasing salinities which decrease methane solubility also groundwater is generally more stagnant at depth than in surficial aquifers as shown in this work dissolutive retention is limited in the absence of groundwater flow the complex interaction of these processes and their effect on the fate of gas migration occurring at depths greater than those considered in this study up to 480 mbgl would be a relevant subject for further research 4 3 gaseous pooling and permeability clay layers to gas migration while significant gas phase pooling occurred below the low permeable clay layers k v up to minimum of 4 10 15 m2 p e up to 7 8 kpa in the 2nd case study they were ultimately permeable to the migrating gas fig 7 invasion of a higher entry pressure layer requires a large enough gas accumulation in the underlying layer such that the combined capillary and gravitational forces exceed the entry pressure barrier for large enough entry pressure values and horizontal barriers such conditions would not be obtained as the accumulating gas pool spreads out laterally into a thin pancake like shape high resolution permeability measurements have shown that thin low permeability clay lenses can be present within larger clayey formations with permeabilities that are orders of magnitude lower than the average permeability of the unit rogiers et al 2014 given their low permeability and presumably higher entry pressure these lenses would likely act as impermeable barriers to gas phase flow essentially turning the entire formation into a cap rock however the ubiquity and lateral extent of these lenses is poorly understood therefore further research into how heterogeneity of clay deposits impacts gas migration would be required 4 4 continuum modelling of gas migration the low observed saturations call into question whether the injected gas actually forms a continuous phase and hence whether the widely used darcy s law approach is applicable for modelling gas migration through unconsolidated aquifers air sparging experiments have shown that for unconsolidated sediments the injected gas phase migrates as continuous gaseous channels when grain sizes are 1 mm for larger grain sizes the flow pattern gradually changes to discontinuous bubble flow brooks et al 1999 the grain sizes considered in this study fall in the former category and hence channel flow may be expected to dominate although the flow type is also dependent on the flux size furthermore whether such migration takes the form of a dendritic network of small channels or a smaller amount of larger gas channels is poorly understood brooks et al 1999 continuous dewatered channels through which the gas phase dominantly migrates also occurred in the field experiments of gas migration by cahill et al 2018 observed dissolved methane concentrations below theoretical solubility were attributed to this flow pattern as the available contact area over which mass transfer between phases can occur is smaller and the collected groundwater samples aggregate both water that has been in contact with a gas channel and water that has not as this process is not captured in our simulations the resulting amount of dissolution may be overestimated on the other hand mechanical dispersion was not included in our simulations excluding dispersion actually leads to an underestimation of the dissolutive capacity as dispersion would spread out both the gas phase and the dissolved methane more rapidly allowing for more contact with the water and quicker transport of dissolved methane away from the gas phase plume ultimately the suitability of continuum models for modelling gas migration should be further analyzed through reproduction of experimental results a promising experimental method which could be employed for this purpose was recently published by van de ven and mumford 2018 who injected gaseous co2 at the bottom of a 2d flow cell and used ph as a proxy to visually track dissolved co2 concentrations reproducing such experiments with numerical simulation would be a good model validation strategy 4 5 implications for methane monitoring from this study a number of important implications for monitoring of gas migration and leakages in the vicinity of oil and gas wells can be derived notably surficial expressions of gas leakage originating at depth in unconsolidated sedimentary basins may take several years to manifest in settings dominated by relatively coarse grained sands and may take at least up to several decades when migrating gas also encounters interbedded low permeable layers surficial detection of leaking oil and gas wellbores may therefore only become possible long after the onset of leakage and potentially after wells have already been abandoned this is particularly relevant as in many oil and gas jurisdictions decommissioned wells are cut and buried below the ground surface davies et al 2014 schout et al 2019 in which case direct measurements of well integrity failure at the wellhead are no longer possible furthermore for example in the netherlands there are currently no regulations in place that require operators to monitor the locations of gas wells for extensive periods post decommissioning relying on surficial flux measurements or near surface groundwater wells may lead to the underestimation of the actual occurrence and magnitude of gas leakage and groundwater contamination at depth may remain unnoticed hence measuring dissolved gas molecular and isotopic compositions in groundwater wells in close proximity to potential leakage points is likely a more reliable method when surface expressions do occur the dissolution of methane may still be such that measured fluxes at the surface only represent a fraction of the flow rate at the leakage point lastly our simulations show that regional groundwater flow may cause the center of a migrating gas plume to be transported several tens of meters downstream from the well before reaching the surface recent field studies have employed search radii of 15 m schout et al 2019 and 20 m forde et al 2019 from the coordinates of gas wells when carrying out surficial flux measurements while likely suitable in most cases widening the investigated area in the direction of groundwater flow may need to be considered depending on the conditions 5 conclusions oil and gas well failure leading to gas migration in the subsurface poses both an environmental and safety hazard effective mitigation of these hazards and the proper assessment of their impact is reliant on the successful detection and quantification of leaks in this study upward methane migration through unconsolidated aquifers was analyzed using two phase two component h2o and ch4 numerical simulations in dumux results show that the retention of migrating methane due to dissolution into laterally flowing groundwater can become significant at groundwater darcy velocities as low as 1 m yr 1 retention was shown to be dependent on a complex interaction between the lateral groundwater velocity the depth of the leak and the velocity and shape of the upwardly migrating gas plume the latter is in turn a function of the leakage flux and sediment properties permeability capillary pressure saturation and relative permeability relations and residual gas saturation across a range of conditions representative of unconsolidated aquifers and leak sizes up to 1 m3 ch4 atm d 1 the time it took before the gas plume propagated through to the top of the modelled domain varied from less than 2 months to 5 years in some scenarios the total methane leakage rate was dissolved and transported laterally causing the gas plume to stagnate at depth subsurface methane retention was even more pronounced in additional simulations of migration through stratified sequences based on the hydrogeological conditions at two leaking gas wells in the netherlands consisting of a number of alternating sedimentary units ranging in grain size from clays to coarse sands under such conditions depending on the imposed groundwater head gradient flow rates of up to 10 m3 ch4 atm d 1 were either entirely retained in subsurface or took several decades to fully develop not only the presence of fine grained and low permeable layers formed barriers to upward gas migration but also high permeable sands with large groundwater velocities these allow for a larger dissolutive capacity particularly when the migrating gas phase has been spread out laterally by underlying low permeability units overall the results of this study show that for the most commonly observed methane leakage rates 0 1 10 m3 d 1 unconsolidated aquifer systems with lateral groundwater flow can retain significant amounts of migrating methane due to dissolution consequently resulting atmospheric methane emissions above such leaks may be delayed with decades after the onset of leakage significantly reduced or prevented
