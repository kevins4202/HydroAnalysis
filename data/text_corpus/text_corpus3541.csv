17705,adsorption and redox reactions between organic matter and natural reactive surfaces have a significant impact on pollutant sequestration and transformation and on the effectivity of water and soil remediation practices herein the interactions between an organic phenolic acid gallic acid ga and clay coated with iron oxides feox mmt were explored adsorption and desorption experiments revealed that ga has a higher affinity for feox mmt than for native clay the adsorption to feox mmt was irreversible and only slightly affected by salinity suggesting strong inner sphere complexation the ga feox mmt complex was characterized using cyclic voltammetry uv vis spectroscopy ftir and xps measurements the results showed oxidation and transformation of ga on the surface and a considerable reduction of the surface iron the resulting ga feox mmt complex had increased catalytic properties enhancing hydrogen peroxide decomposition and creating significantly more radicals than feox mmt and raw clay this led to the destruction of ga on the surface of the clay iron complex resulting in loss of activity over time our findings suggest a correlation between overall ga adsorption consequent iron reduction and oxidant decomposition this means that in systems where such constituents are present these types of interactions need to be taken into consideration in terms of predicting the fate of pollutants in the environment and for properly evaluating soil and water chemical treatment processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords gallic acid montmorillonite clay iron

organic matter nom with soil particles and sediments is key in a variety of environmental processes related to transport and fate of pollutants in soils and water m vindedahl et al 2016 specht et al 2000 despite the large number of studies much remains unknown due to the complexity of nom chemistry soil solution chemistry and diversity of soil constituents relatedly the effects of nom on the efficiency of remediation technologies specifically the role of nom in oxidation reactions has also been an ongoing area of intensive study in the past years adusei gyamfi et al 2019 bissey et al 2006 romero et al 2011 2009 rusevova crincoli and huling 2020 tratnyek et al 2001 to gain a better understanding of such complex environmental processes it is necessary to look at the underlying mechanisms that drive them at a molecular level in this study we focused on the surface interactions between gallic acid a common nom model molecule and montmorillonite mmt coated with iron oxides and the effect these interactions have on the surface reactivity of the particles iron oxides and oxide hydroxides formed by external precipitation on mineral surfaces are common products of weathering and soil forming processes in oxidized soils carroll 1958 despite their ubiquity only a few studies have focused on the interactions of nom with clays coated or inter chelated with iron oxides and their environmental implications avneri katz et al 2017 karpov et al 2018 polubesova et al 2010 schwartz et al 2020 karpov et al 2018 examined the abiotic mechanisms of oxytetracycline interactions with a redox active fe iii saturated mmt oxytetracycline was completely adsorbed by the iron clay and partially degraded furthermore accumulation of reduced iron species on the surface was observed sun et al 2020 monitored the interactions between low mw thiols and fe bearing clays they discovered that the formation of hydroxyl radicals in the presence of h2o2 was enhanced after complexation of thiols with the clays the increase in radical formation was attributed to the reduction of the structural iron via proton coupled electron transfer from the thiol functional groups to the iron rich surface sun et al 2020 the studies suggest that nom iron clay interactions can significantly affect pollutant adsorption transformation and transport as well as impact in situ chemical oxidation technologies either by enhancing the production of radicals through heterogenous fenton reactions garrido ramírez et al 2010 he et al 2016 or by scavenging the oxidants rusevova crincoli and huling 2020 as such understanding the interactions of clays and oxides with nom is of high environmental importance gallic acid ga a low molecular weight phenolic acid found in a variety of common plants was chosen as a model nom compound ga and its derivatives are often used as model nom compounds due to their reactive functional groups including phenolic and carboxylic groups and an aromatic ring franklin et al 2019 haslam and cai 1994 lewis 2017 it has been identified as a building block in the formation of fulvic and humic acids and often used to synthesize these large molecular weight molecules tombácz et al 2004 tóth et al 2014 vione et al 2019 in addition ga is frequently used as a model contaminant in wastewater mostly representing polyphenols in food and agricultural wastewaters e g from wineries olive mills and cork production beltrán et al 1993 benitez et al 2005 guan et al 2017 luna et al 2016 martinez haya et al 2015 mera et al 2016 in recent years ga has also been applied as an additive in water remediation technologies mainly as a chelate for heavy metal remediation guan et al 2017 2016 and as a pro oxidant in fenton reactions christoforidis et al 2018 dong et al 2016 papoutsakis et al 2016 sousa and aguiar 2017 venny et al 2012 vicente et al 2011 zhang and zhou 2019 the ability to form bidentate chelates with metallic ions comes from the two phenolic oh groups in the ortho position catechol group in addition the chelation can result in reduced forms of the metal and quinone radicals which have been shown to help catalyze oxidation reactions dong et al 2016 for example observed that ga in solution could form complexes with fe3 and reduce it to fe2 which in turn prevented iron precipitation and accelerated the formation of ho radicals to promote dye oxidation dong et al 2016 sousa and aguiar 2017 reported that ga exhibited pro oxidant properties during dye removal increasing removal efficiency from 56 to 75 within 20 min knowledge on ga interactions with solid iron oxides and clays is more limited ahmat et al 2019 guan et al 2017 polubesova et al 2010 tóth et al 2014 tòth et al 2014 reported that binding of ga to the surface of magnetite nanoparticles via bidentate chelation resulted in oxidation radical formation and surface polymerization of ga similarly polubesova et al 2010 reported the formation of strong inner sphere complexation between other small phenolic acids ferulic p coumaric syringic and vanillic and iron rich mmt they noted that these interactions led to the release of fe ii into the solution and to polymerization of the phenolic acids on the smectite surface to the best of our knowledge the extent of ga interactions on iron oxide coated clays and their effect on surface redox reactivity has not been studied the following study aims to examine i the nature and extent of ga interactions with iron oxide coated montmorillonite clay feox mmt ii the ability of ga to reduce the surface bound iron and iii the effect of these interactions on surface redox reactivity a better understanding of this system could significantly contribute to the assessment of in situ fenton processes in soils and shed light on the natural attenuation of organic contaminants in subsurface environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials wyoming montmorillonite swy 2 mmt was obtained from the source clays repository clay minerals

separated by centrifugation and filtered and the remaining ga concentrations were measured by hplc the complexes for all subsequent experiments were prepared in the same ga to clay ratio as applied

transformation following adsorption ga was extracted from the l ga feox mmt and h ga feox mmt surfaces after 96 h of agitation using10 ml meoh at 37 c and the uv vis spectrum was compared to a control sample of 25 mg l ga in meoh a uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific evolution 300 waltham ma was used to analyze the absorbance spectra of ga 200 800 nm using quartz cuvettes the mw index e400 e600 ratio was also calculated using uv vis measurements chen et al 1977 ir spectra of the ga and the ga feox mmt were obtained by analyzing freeze dried complexes mixed with kbr 1 10 at room temperature in the range of 500 4000 cm 1 using an ftir spectrometer nicolet magna ir 550 madison wi the background spectra of feox mmt were subtracted to produce the spectra of ga after adsorption to feox mmt 2 5 quantification of iron reduction the amount of iron reduced as a function of ga adsorption was measured and characterized by the phenanthroline method herrera et al 1989 xps and cyclic voltammetry measurements for the phenanthroline method ga feox mmt complexes were prepared in 50 ml centrifuge tubes by mixing 10 ml of ga solutions 100 1000 mg l 1 with 5 ml of 6 g l 1 feox mmt the tubes were agitated for 24 h centrifuged and the supernatants were separated the amount of adsorbed ga was measured by hplc then 1 ml of h2so4 2 m was added to dissolve the structural iron into the solution next the samples were mixed with a sodium fluoride reagent to create a stable complex with fe3 a solution of 1 10 phenantroline monohydrate which forms a colored complex with the remaining fe2 ions and a buffer solution of ammonium acetate the absorbance of the fe ii phenanthroline complex was measured after 10 min at 510 nm by a uv vis spectrophotometer x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps measurements were carried out on the freeze dried complexes prepared for the kinetic experiment xps measurements were performed in an analysis chamber uhv 210 10 torr during analysis using a versaprobe iii phi instrument phi usa the sample was irradiated with a focused x ray alkα mono chromated x ray source 1486 6 ev using x ray beam size diameter 200 micron 25 w 15 kv survey spectra were collected with a pass energy of 140 ev from which the surface chemical composition was determined the core level binding energies of the different peaks were normalized by setting the binding energy for the c1s at 284 8 ev cyclic voltammetry experiments cv were carried out in a phosphoric acid buffer solution 0 1 m ph 7 at 5 mv s 1 using a saturated calomel electrode sce mmt feox mmt and l ga feox mmt were mixed with nafion and then precipitated and dried on the sce the solutions were saturated with n2 during the experiment to ensure low oxygen content 2 6 h2o2 decomposition by the ga clay complexes the vanadate method was used to determine the amount of h2o2 that reacts with the different clays nogueira et al 2005 briefly 7 5 ml of a 7 mm h2o2 solution ph 5 5 was added to the different clays mmt ga mmt feox mmt l ga feox mmt and h ga feox mmt complexes to reach a final concentration of 4 g l 1 the solutions were left to react for 60 min before the reaction was terminated for reactions that were carried out at ph 7 3 75 ml of dw was added to the different clays mmt ga mmt feox mmt l ga feox mmt and h ga feox mmt complexes then a diluted solution of naoh 0 1 m was added dropwise to adjust the ph finally 3 75 ml of the h2o2 solution 14 mm was added to the samples to stop the reaction 4 ml of sample was mixed with a vanadate solution cfinal 6 2 mmol l 1 resulting in a red orange color due to the formation of the peroxovanadium cation the solutions were then filtered with ptfe syringe filter 0 45 μm into cuvettes and the colored complex was analyzed by a uv vis spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 450 nm h2o2 decomposition rates 7 mm 300 ml by feox mmt l ga feox mmt and h ga feox mmt 4 g l 1 were measured over 60 min and modeled using the first order eq 1 and second order eq 2 equations simonin 2016 three consecutive reaction cycles were completed using the l ga feox mmt complex 4 g l 1 and h2o2 7 5 ml 7 mm each cycle continued for 60 min under agitation and was terminated using vanadate solution after the reaction with h2o2 the supernatants were separated and 10 ml of meoh was added to the treated and untreated samples to extract the remaining surface bound ga the samples were left to agitate for another 48 h at 37 c and then were centrifuged filtered and measured by hplc to assess whether the exchangeable fe ions participate in the fenton reaction feox mmt was washed 4 times with nacl 1 m solution then ga adsorption and h2o2 decomposition were measured and compared to the non washed samples the concentration of the minerals and complexes were kept constant at 4 g l 1 3 results 3 1 adsorption of ga on the mmt and feox mmt surfaces the adsorption behavior of ga onto two clays montmorillonite mmt and iron oxide coated montmorillonite feox mmt was measured modeled and characterized the adsorption of ga to mmt and feox mmt as a function of time is presented in fig 1 ga adsorption to native mmt was low compared to feox mmt yet rapidly reached equilibrium within the first few min in contrast the adsorption to feox mmt showed mixed trends during the first 10 min rapid adsorption to the feox mmt surface was observed 60 of the overall adsorbed amount suggesting a high adsorption affinity to the available external surfaces between 10 and 60 min the rate of adsorption decreased probably due to diffusion of the ga between the clay interlayers and an even slower rate was observed at longer times 60 240 min reaching a pseudo plateau the results from the long term incubation experiments show that full equilibrium was not reached even after 28 days of agitation fig 1b and the amount of the adsorbed ga continued to increase slowly the continual yet very slow adsorption of ga might be a result of further diffusion between the clay layers or the partitioning of ga to the initial monolayers adsorbed to the surface xrd measurement fig 1c showed that indeed ga diffuses into the clay interlayer and extends the interlamellar d spacing from 12 6 å to 13 1 å the kinetic data were fitted to several commonly applied models first order second order simple elovich parabolic diffusion and power function models and the calculated coefficients are presented in table 1 the reaction was best described by the parabolic diffusion equation which strengthens the hypothesis that the adsorption reaction is highly diffusion dependent the adsorption behavior of varying concentrations of ga to the two clays 1 g l 1 is presented in fig 2 adsorption isotherms of ga were constructed at pseudo equilibrium after 24 h the adsorption affinity of ga to mmt was very low and reached saturation at 0 03 mmol ga per g clay in contrast the adsorption affinity of ga to the surface of feox mmt was two orders of magnitude higher reaching 1 7 mmol ga g 1 clay under the conditions tested still the isotherm did not reach an apparent plateau fig 1a this increase in affinity is attributed to the iron oxide coating of the surface which creates new binding sites that allow for specific feox ga surface complexation such specific chemisorption through bidentate or bridging mechanisms has previously been reported for ga and other similar small phenolic acids on several different iron oxides ahmat et al 2019 chen et al 2017 fazary et al 2009 tóth et al 2014 however the adsorption capacity observed was generally lower than presented here possibly due to the lower surface area of the iron oxides compared to the feox mmt the ga adsorption isotherm showed two distinct trends an initial h type isotherm at low concentrations of ga fig 2b followed by a more linear trend at higher concentrations fig 1a this could suggest a bimodal mechanism an initial high affinity adsorption to specific sites followed by a partitioning mechanism after initial surface coverage the isotherm best fit the dual mode model dmm r2 0 94 rmse 0 06 which combines the langmuir and freundlich models table 1 fig s1 similar dual models have been used previously to describe sorption to soil organic matter where there are two types of behaviors derived from a partition mechanism and a specific site mechanism xing and pignatello 1996 such bimodal behavior was also observed for the adsorption of ga on magnetite particles tóth et al 2014 it should be noted that negligible iron leaching less than 3 was measured during the adsorption of ga fig s3 the effect of ionic strength on adsorption was examined to better understand the nature of ga interactions with the two surfaces fig 1c ga pka 4 5 and the two clays carry a net negative charge under the given experimental conditions the measured zeta potential of the two clays was 32 mv and 24 mv for mmt and feox mmt respectively the relatively negative net charge of the feox mmt has been reported previously and is a result of the size and morphology of the iron oxides guz et al 2014 schwartz et al 2020 nevertheless the increase in ionic strength did not increase the interactions between the clays and the ga molecule this is in agreement with specific inner sphere type interactions behavior where the high affinity of ga to the iron coated clay is not governed by the electrostatic forces tóth et al 2014 moreover desorption experiments fig s3 showed negligible desorption from the feox mmt surface in comparison to the raw mmt 3 vs 18 which also suggests high affinity specific binding to the iron oxide coating 3 2 transformation reactions of ga on the surface of feox mmt the adsorption of ga to the feox mmt surface initiated a change in the color of the complex the initial orange color indicative of oxidized iron oxides turned to a dark brown as seen in fig 3 a the change in color could be attributed to self polymerization reactions on the surface of the clay and or the reduction of the iron oxides the complexation of ga with the surface can create reactive oxidized and radical species that in turn interact with ga monomers in solution causing surface polymerization tóth et al 2014 these types of interactions are known to happen between quinones their derivatives and iron oxides and are a recognized mechanism in the formation of soil organic matter tombácz et al 1998 wang et al 2015 uv vis measurements of ga were compared to ga that was extracted from the surface of low and high concentration complexes to detect changes in the structure following adsorption fig 3b the sample extracted from l ga feox mmt exhibited a slight blue shift in both ga peaks from 272 nm to 269 nm and from 218 nm to 215 nm suggesting a possible change in structure this shift was not observed in the sample extracted from the high ga concentration complex which could be because the ga extracted was mainly adsorbed in the secondary partitioning phase fig 2a still the mw index or humification degree index e400 e600 of both extracted solutions was significantly higher than that of the control ga solution 0 5 vs 5 6 and 12 0 which suggests the formation of larger molecules due to polymerization li and hur 2017 further evidence of polymerization was observed by mass spectroscopy measurements of ga in the supernatant and of ga extracted from the surface table s1 higher molecular weight moieties were detected in the extracted solution pointing to the formation of dimers and trimers upon adsorption ftir measurements also point to changes in ga structure upon adsorption that could be a result of oxidation reactions fig 3c mainly the appearance of a new wide band at 1626 cm 1 which points to the presence of oxidized di carbonyl groups quinones and or conjugated ketones on the surface of the feox mmt and the disappearance of the carboxylic band that was present at 1540 cm 1 tóth et al 2014 in addition various changes in cc aromatic bands at 1600 1434 1320 and 1030 cm 1 are noticeable 3 3 fe reduction by ga adsorption as initially hypothesized the adsorption of ga was found to promote reduction of iron on the surface of the particles as the amount of adsorbed ga increased the amount of fe ii that was measured increased as well fig 4 a at higher ga concentrations in the range of the non specific interactions the amount of fe ii remained constant this implies that the reduction process is a result of direct and specific ga feox complexation on the surface kung and mcbride 1988 xps measurements also revealed that the amount of reduced iron increases as a function of incubation time with ga fig 4b the amount of fe ii and fe iii in the feox mmt before the addition of ga was 16 5 and 80 5 respectively after 24 h of mixing with ga the time allotted for the isotherms the concentration of the fe ii increased to 28 3 of the surface iron 1 7 times more than bare feox mmt seven days later the amount of the of fe ii on the surface rose to 38 8 2 3 times compared with feox mmt a following increase was not observed after 14 days of incubation these findings are in line with the kinetic measurements and further establish the importance of the diffusion effect it should be noted that the amount of fe ii measured by the phenanthroline method fig 4a cannot be directly compared to the amount measured by xps fig 4b this is because xps measures the nanometric layer at the external surface whereas the phenanthroline method measures speciation of the entire iron content of the sample therefore it is not surprising that the percentage of divalent iron measured by xps was higher still the correlation between ga concentration and iron reduction was apparent by both methods the surface reduction reaction was further investigated using cyclic voltammetry measurements this method allows to identify the active redox couple on the surface fe ii fe iii in fig 5 the voltammograms of mmt feox mmt and ga feox mmt are shown the bare mmt voltammogram showed no redox activity in contrast feox mmt exhibited two peaks representing the oxidation and reduction potential of the fe ii fe iii couple 0 584 v and 0 375 v respectively these peaks were also apparent in the feox mmt ga voltammogram fig 5c though shifted to 0 754 v and 0 336 v respectively this suggests that the adsorption of ga reduces the iron and protects it from being re oxidized 3 4 catalytic activation of hydrogen peroxide hydrogen peroxide decomposition activation was used as a way of probing the reactivity of the fe ii ga complexation on the surface of the clay this reaction is also of great significance with respect to heterogeneous fenton processes where solid iron rich minerals are used as catalysts to produce active radical species h2o2 decomposition is correlated to radical production and catalytic activity in fig 6 a the decomposition of h2o2 7 mm by the clays and ga clay complexes is shown at two ph values peroxide decomposition was similar at ph 4 and 7 for all clays as expected for systems with solid iron rich catalysts fontecha cámara et al 2016 he et al 2016 incubation of mmt and ga mmt no surface iron with h2o2 for an hour caused very little decomposition the iron oxides deposited on the surface of mmt feox mmt increased the activation capabilities slightly reaching 15 h2o2 decomposition in an hour in contrast the complexes with low and high loading of ga 0 18 mmol g 1 and 1 7 mmol g 1 named l ga feox mmt and h ga feox mmt respectively promoted significantly higher h2o2 decomposition due to faster and more efficient catalytic activity 32 and 50 respectively to understand whether the exchangeable ions participate in the redox reaction feox mmt clays have a cec of 35 meq 100 g 1 schwartz et al 2020 the redox reactivity of the surface was also tested following several washes with 1 m nacl to remove excess iron ions the reactivity remained high suggesting that exchangeable ions do not participate in the activation of h2o2 fig s4 it has been previously established that soluble fe ii catalyzes h2o2 decomposition at significantly higher rates than fe iii lin and gurol 1998 herein we observe that surface bound iron complexed with ga also catalyzes decomposition at much higher rates compared with the bare feox mmt moreover the reduction of the iron by ga complexation was positively correlated to the amount of hydrogen peroxide decomposition measured fig 6b the kinetics of h2o2 decomposition by feox mmt l ga feox mmt and h ga feox mmt are presented in fig 6c and the first and second order kinetic parameters are presented in table s2 the ga feox mmt show superior activation rates compared to the iron coated clay alone after 15 min the amount of h2o2 decomposed by the ga complex is 5 times greater than with feox mmt the advantage of higher ga loading can be seen after an hour where 60 of the h2o2 was decomposed compared to only 40 by the low concentration ga complex consecutive cycles of incubation with h2o2 were measured to assess the stability of the h ga feox mmt complex fig 6d the results show the advantage of the h ga feox mmt over feox mmt in the first cycle where h2o2 decomposition radical production by the minerals was 28 and 4 3 respectively this advantage diminishes in the second and third cycle along with discoloration of the surface this suggests degradation of the surface bound ga by the generated radicals in that respect the concentrations of ga that were extracted from the surface after oxidation were below the detection limit of hplc and uv vis measurements 4 conclusions this study focused on the interactions of ga with iron coated montmorillonite as a representation of nom interactions mainly quinone and phenolic compounds with iron oxide coated surfaces the findings point to high affinity non reversible interactions with the surface iron oxide coating through inner sphere complexation ga surface complexation resulted in iron reduction and some level of ga transformation creating higher molecular weight molecules the reactivity of the surface was also altered as probed by peroxide decomposition the rates of decomposition were significantly higher due to the reduced iron ga complex lastly fast and complete degradation of ga on the surface was observed which suggests iron oxide coated surfaces can promote both formation of large phenolic molecules and catalyze their decomposition these findings have significant implications especially for evaluating the efficiency of fenton type in situ chemical oxidation technologies the composition of the soil or sediment nom can have a pronounced effect on radical production and scavenging of oxidants in addition these results suggest that feox clays could be highly beneficial as sorbent catalysts in the removal and oxidation of polyphenols from industrial or agricultural wastewaters declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

17705,adsorption and redox reactions between organic matter and natural reactive surfaces have a significant impact on pollutant sequestration and transformation and on the effectivity of water and soil remediation practices herein the interactions between an organic phenolic acid gallic acid ga and clay coated with iron oxides feox mmt were explored adsorption and desorption experiments revealed that ga has a higher affinity for feox mmt than for native clay the adsorption to feox mmt was irreversible and only slightly affected by salinity suggesting strong inner sphere complexation the ga feox mmt complex was characterized using cyclic voltammetry uv vis spectroscopy ftir and xps measurements the results showed oxidation and transformation of ga on the surface and a considerable reduction of the surface iron the resulting ga feox mmt complex had increased catalytic properties enhancing hydrogen peroxide decomposition and creating significantly more radicals than feox mmt and raw clay this led to the destruction of ga on the surface of the clay iron complex resulting in loss of activity over time our findings suggest a correlation between overall ga adsorption consequent iron reduction and oxidant decomposition this means that in systems where such constituents are present these types of interactions need to be taken into consideration in terms of predicting the fate

organic matter nom with soil particles and sediments is key in a variety of environmental processes related to transport and fate of pollutants in soils and water m vindedahl et al 2016 specht et al 2000 despite the large number of studies much remains unknown due to the complexity of nom chemistry soil solution chemistry and diversity of soil constituents relatedly the effects of nom on the efficiency of remediation technologies specifically the role of nom in oxidation reactions has also been an ongoing area of intensive study in the past years adusei gyamfi et al 2019 bissey et al 2006 romero et al 2011 2009 rusevova crincoli and huling 2020 tratnyek et al 2001 to gain a better understanding of such complex environmental processes it is necessary to look at the underlying mechanisms that drive them at a molecular level in this study we focused on the surface interactions between gallic acid a common nom model molecule and montmorillonite mmt coated with iron oxides and the effect these interactions have on the surface reactivity of the particles iron oxides and oxide hydroxides formed by external precipitation on mineral surfaces are common products of weathering and soil forming processes in oxidized soils carroll 1958 despite their ubiquity only a few studies have focused on the interactions of nom with clays coated or inter chelated with iron oxides and their environmental implications avneri katz et al 2017 karpov et al 2018 polubesova et al 2010 schwartz et al 2020 karpov et al 2018 examined the abiotic mechanisms of oxytetracycline interactions with a redox active fe iii saturated mmt oxytetracycline was completely adsorbed by the iron clay and partially degraded furthermore accumulation of reduced iron species on the surface was observed sun et al 2020 monitored the interactions between low mw thiols and fe bearing clays they discovered that the formation of hydroxyl radicals in the presence of h2o2 was enhanced after complexation of thiols with the clays the increase in radical formation was attributed to the reduction of the structural iron via proton coupled electron transfer from the thiol functional groups to the iron rich surface sun et al 2020 the studies suggest that nom iron clay interactions can significantly affect pollutant adsorption transformation and transport as well as impact in situ chemical oxidation technologies either by enhancing the production of radicals through heterogenous fenton reactions garrido ramírez et al 2010 he et al 2016 or by scavenging the oxidants rusevova crincoli and huling 2020 as such understanding the interactions of clays and oxides with nom is of high environmental importance gallic acid ga a low molecular weight phenolic acid found in a variety of common plants was chosen as a model nom compound ga and its derivatives are often used as model nom compounds due to their reactive functional groups including phenolic and carboxylic groups and an aromatic ring franklin et al 2019 haslam and cai 1994 lewis 2017 it has been identified as a building block in the formation of fulvic and humic acids and often used to synthesize these large molecular weight molecules tombácz et al 2004 tóth et al 2014 vione et al 2019 in addition ga is frequently used as a model contaminant in wastewater mostly representing polyphenols in food and agricultural wastewaters e g from wineries olive mills and cork production beltrán et al 1993 benitez et al 2005 guan et al 2017 luna et al 2016 martinez haya et al 2015 mera et al 2016 in recent years ga has also been applied as an additive in water remediation technologies mainly as a chelate for heavy metal remediation guan et al 2017 2016 and as a pro oxidant in fenton reactions christoforidis et al 2018 dong et al 2016 papoutsakis et al 2016 sousa and aguiar 2017 venny et al 2012 vicente et al 2011 zhang and zhou 2019 the ability to form bidentate chelates with metallic ions comes from the two phenolic oh groups in the ortho position catechol group in addition the chelation can result in reduced forms of the metal and quinone radicals which have been shown to help catalyze oxidation reactions dong et al 2016 for example observed that ga in solution could form complexes with fe3 and reduce it to fe2 which in turn prevented iron precipitation and accelerated the formation of ho radicals to promote dye oxidation dong et al 2016 sousa and aguiar 2017 reported that ga exhibited pro oxidant properties during dye removal increasing removal efficiency from 56 to 75 within 20 min knowledge on ga interactions with solid iron oxides and clays is more limited ahmat et al 2019 guan et al 2017 polubesova et al 2010 tóth et al 2014 tòth et al 2014 reported that binding of ga to the surface of magnetite nanoparticles via bidentate chelation resulted in oxidation radical formation and surface polymerization of ga similarly polubesova et al 2010 reported the formation of strong inner sphere complexation between other small phenolic acids ferulic p coumaric syringic and vanillic and iron rich mmt they noted that these interactions led to the release of fe ii into the solution and to polymerization of the phenolic acids on the smectite surface to the best of our knowledge the extent of ga interactions on iron oxide coated clays and their effect on surface redox reactivity has not been studied the following study aims to examine i the nature and extent of ga interactions with iron oxide coated montmorillonite clay feox mmt ii the ability of ga to reduce the surface bound iron and iii the effect of these interactions on surface redox reactivity a better understanding of this system could significantly contribute to the assessment of in situ fenton processes in soils and shed light on the natural

sample of 25 mg l ga in meoh a uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific evolution 300 waltham ma was used to analyze the absorbance spectra of ga 200 800 nm using quartz cuvettes the mw index e400 e600 ratio was also calculated using uv vis measurements chen et al 1977 ir spectra of the ga and the ga feox mmt were obtained by analyzing freeze dried complexes mixed with kbr 1 10 at room temperature in the range of 500 4000 cm 1 using an ftir spectrometer nicolet magna ir 550 madison wi the background spectra of feox mmt were subtracted to produce the spectra of ga after adsorption to feox mmt 2 5 quantification of iron reduction the amount of iron reduced as a function of ga adsorption was measured and characterized by the phenanthroline method herrera et al 1989 xps and cyclic voltammetry measurements for the phenanthroline method ga feox mmt complexes were prepared in 50 ml centrifuge tubes by mixing 10 ml of ga solutions 100 1000 mg l 1 with 5 ml of 6 g l 1 feox mmt the tubes were agitated for 24 h centrifuged and the supernatants were separated the amount of adsorbed ga was measured by hplc then 1 ml of h2so4 2 m was added to dissolve the structural iron into the solution next the samples were mixed with a sodium fluoride reagent to create a stable complex with fe3 a solution of 1 10 phenantroline monohydrate which forms a colored complex with the remaining

feox mmt were mixed with nafion and then precipitated and dried on the sce the solutions were saturated with n2 during the experiment to ensure low oxygen content 2 6 h2o2 decomposition by the ga clay complexes the vanadate method was used to determine the amount of h2o2 that reacts with the different clays nogueira et al 2005 briefly 7 5 ml of a 7 mm h2o2 solution ph 5 5 was added to the different clays mmt ga mmt feox mmt l ga feox mmt and h ga feox mmt complexes to reach a final concentration of 4 g l 1 the solutions were left to react for 60 min before the reaction was terminated for reactions that were carried out at ph 7 3 75 ml of dw was added to the different clays mmt ga mmt feox mmt l ga feox mmt and h ga feox mmt complexes then a diluted solution of naoh 0 1 m was added dropwise to adjust the ph finally 3 75 ml of the h2o2 solution 14 mm was added to the samples to stop the reaction 4 ml of sample was mixed with a vanadate solution cfinal 6 2 mmol l 1 resulting in a red orange color due to the formation of the peroxovanadium cation the solutions were then filtered with ptfe syringe filter 0 45 μm into cuvettes and the colored complex was analyzed by a uv vis spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 450 nm h2o2 decomposition rates 7 mm 300 ml by feox mmt l ga feox mmt and h ga feox mmt 4 g l 1 were measured over 60 min and modeled using the first order eq 1 and second order eq 2 equations simonin 2016 three consecutive reaction cycles were completed using the l ga feox mmt complex 4 g l 1 and h2o2 7 5 ml 7 mm each cycle continued for 60 min under agitation and was terminated using vanadate solution after the reaction with h2o2 the supernatants were separated and 10 ml of meoh was added to the treated and untreated samples to extract the remaining surface bound ga the samples were left to agitate for another 48 h at 37 c and then were centrifuged filtered and measured by hplc to assess whether the exchangeable fe ions participate in the fenton reaction feox mmt was washed 4 times with nacl 1 m solution then ga adsorption and h2o2 decomposition were measured and compared to the non washed samples the concentration of the minerals and complexes were kept constant at 4 g l 1 3 results 3 1 adsorption of ga on the mmt and feox mmt surfaces the adsorption behavior of ga onto two clays montmorillonite mmt and iron oxide coated montmorillonite feox mmt was measured modeled and characterized the adsorption of ga to mmt and feox mmt as a function of time is presented in fig 1 ga adsorption to native mmt was low compared to feox mmt yet rapidly reached equilibrium within the first few min in contrast the adsorption to feox mmt showed mixed trends during the first 10 min rapid adsorption to the feox mmt surface was observed 60 of the overall adsorbed amount suggesting a high adsorption affinity to the available external surfaces between 10 and 60 min the rate of adsorption decreased probably due to diffusion of the ga between the clay interlayers and an even slower rate was observed at longer times 60 240 min reaching a pseudo plateau the results from the long term incubation experiments show that full equilibrium was not reached even after 28 days of agitation fig 1b and the amount of the adsorbed ga continued to increase slowly the continual yet very slow adsorption of ga might be a result of further diffusion between the clay layers or the partitioning of ga to the initial monolayers adsorbed to the surface xrd measurement fig 1c showed that indeed ga diffuses into the clay interlayer and extends the interlamellar d spacing from 12 6 å to 13 1 å the kinetic data were fitted to several commonly applied models first order second order simple elovich parabolic diffusion and power function models and the calculated coefficients are presented in table 1 the reaction was best described by the parabolic diffusion equation which strengthens the hypothesis that the adsorption reaction is highly diffusion dependent the adsorption behavior of varying concentrations of ga to the two clays 1 g l 1 is presented in fig 2 adsorption isotherms of ga were constructed at pseudo equilibrium after 24 h the adsorption affinity of ga to mmt was very low and reached saturation at 0 03 mmol ga per g clay in contrast the adsorption affinity of ga to the surface of feox mmt was two orders of magnitude higher reaching 1 7 mmol ga g 1 clay under the conditions tested still the isotherm did not reach an apparent plateau fig 1a this increase in affinity is attributed to the iron oxide coating of the surface which creates new binding sites that allow for specific feox ga surface complexation such specific chemisorption through bidentate or bridging mechanisms has previously been reported for ga and other similar small phenolic acids on several different iron oxides ahmat et al 2019 chen et al 2017 fazary et al 2009 tóth et al 2014 however the adsorption capacity observed was generally lower than presented here possibly due to the lower surface area of the iron oxides compared to the feox mmt the ga adsorption isotherm showed two distinct trends an initial h type isotherm at low concentrations of ga fig 2b followed by a more linear trend at higher concentrations fig 1a this could suggest a bimodal mechanism an initial high affinity adsorption to specific sites followed by a partitioning mechanism after initial surface coverage the isotherm best fit the dual mode model dmm r2 0 94 rmse 0 06 which combines the langmuir and freundlich models table 1 fig s1 similar dual models have been used previously to describe sorption to soil organic matter where there are two types of behaviors derived from a partition mechanism and a specific site mechanism xing and pignatello 1996 such bimodal behavior was also observed for the adsorption of ga on magnetite particles tóth et al 2014 it should be noted that negligible iron leaching less than 3 was measured during the adsorption of ga fig s3 the effect of ionic strength on adsorption was examined to better understand the nature of ga interactions with the two surfaces fig 1c ga pka 4 5 and the two clays carry a net negative charge under the given experimental conditions the measured zeta potential of the two clays was 32 mv and 24 mv for mmt and feox mmt respectively the relatively negative net charge of the feox mmt has been reported previously and is a result of the size and morphology of the iron oxides guz et al 2014 schwartz et al 2020 nevertheless the increase in ionic strength did not increase the interactions between the clays and the ga molecule this is in agreement with specific inner sphere type interactions behavior where the high affinity of ga to the iron coated clay is not governed by the electrostatic forces tóth et al 2014 moreover desorption experiments fig s3 showed negligible desorption from the feox mmt surface in comparison to the raw mmt 3 vs 18 which also suggests high affinity specific binding to the iron oxide coating 3 2 transformation reactions of ga on the surface of feox mmt the adsorption of ga to the feox mmt surface initiated a change in the color of the complex the initial orange color indicative of oxidized iron oxides turned to a dark brown as seen in fig 3 a the change in color could be attributed to self polymerization reactions on the surface of the clay and or the reduction of the iron oxides the complexation of ga with the surface can create reactive oxidized and radical species that in turn interact with ga monomers in solution causing surface polymerization tóth et al 2014 these types of interactions are known to happen between quinones their derivatives and iron oxides and are a recognized mechanism in the formation of soil organic matter tombácz et al 1998 wang et al 2015 uv vis measurements of ga were compared to ga that was extracted from the surface of low and high concentration complexes to detect changes in the structure following adsorption fig 3b the sample extracted from l ga feox mmt exhibited a slight blue shift in both ga peaks from 272 nm to 269 nm and from 218 nm to 215 nm suggesting a possible change in structure this shift was not observed in the sample extracted from the high ga concentration complex which could be because the ga extracted was mainly adsorbed in the secondary partitioning phase fig 2a still the mw index or humification degree index e400 e600 of both extracted solutions was significantly higher than that of the control ga solution 0 5 vs 5 6 and 12 0 which suggests the formation of larger molecules due to polymerization li and hur 2017 further evidence of polymerization was observed by mass spectroscopy measurements of ga in the supernatant and of ga extracted from the surface table s1 higher molecular weight moieties were detected in the extracted solution pointing to the formation of dimers and trimers upon adsorption ftir measurements also point to changes in ga structure upon adsorption that could be a result of oxidation reactions fig 3c mainly the appearance of a new wide band at 1626 cm 1 which points to the presence of oxidized di carbonyl groups quinones and or conjugated ketones on the surface of the feox mmt and the disappearance of the carboxylic band that was present at 1540 cm 1 tóth et al 2014 in addition various changes in cc aromatic bands at 1600 1434 1320 and 1030 cm 1 are noticeable 3 3 fe reduction by ga adsorption as initially hypothesized the adsorption of ga was found to promote reduction of iron on the surface of the particles as the amount of adsorbed ga increased the amount of fe ii that was measured increased as well fig 4 a at higher ga concentrations in the range of the non specific interactions the amount of fe ii remained constant this implies that the reduction process is a result of direct and specific ga feox complexation on the surface kung and mcbride 1988 xps measurements also revealed that the amount of reduced iron increases as a function of incubation time with ga fig 4b the amount of fe ii and fe iii in the feox mmt before the addition of ga was 16 5 and 80 5 respectively after 24 h of mixing with ga the time allotted for the isotherms the concentration of the fe ii increased to 28 3 of the surface iron 1 7 times more than bare feox mmt seven days later the amount of the of fe ii on the surface rose to 38 8 2 3 times compared with feox mmt a following increase was not observed after 14 days of incubation these findings are in line with the kinetic measurements and further establish the importance of the diffusion effect it should be noted that the amount of fe ii measured by the phenanthroline method fig 4a cannot be directly compared to the amount measured by xps fig 4b this is because xps measures the nanometric layer at the external surface whereas the phenanthroline method measures speciation of the entire iron content of the sample therefore it is not surprising that the percentage of divalent iron measured by xps was higher still the correlation between ga concentration and iron reduction was apparent by both methods the surface reduction reaction was further investigated using cyclic voltammetry measurements this method allows to identify the active redox couple on the surface fe ii fe iii in fig 5 the voltammograms of mmt feox mmt and ga feox mmt are shown the bare mmt voltammogram showed no redox activity in contrast feox mmt exhibited two peaks representing the oxidation and reduction potential of the fe ii fe iii couple 0 584 v and 0 375 v respectively these peaks were also apparent in the feox mmt ga voltammogram fig 5c though shifted to 0 754 v and 0 336 v respectively this suggests that the adsorption of ga reduces the iron and protects it from being re oxidized 3 4 catalytic activation of hydrogen peroxide hydrogen peroxide decomposition activation was used as a way of probing the reactivity of the fe ii ga complexation on the surface of the clay this reaction is also of great significance with respect to heterogeneous fenton processes where solid iron rich minerals are used as catalysts to produce active radical species h2o2 decomposition is correlated to radical production and catalytic activity in fig 6 a the decomposition of h2o2 7 mm by the clays and ga clay complexes is shown at two ph values peroxide decomposition was similar at ph 4 and 7 for all clays as expected for systems with solid iron rich catalysts fontecha cámara et al 2016 he et al 2016 incubation of mmt and ga mmt no surface iron with h2o2 for an hour caused very little decomposition the iron oxides deposited on the surface of mmt feox mmt increased the activation capabilities slightly reaching 15 h2o2 decomposition in an hour in contrast the complexes with low and high loading of ga 0 18 mmol g 1 and 1 7 mmol g 1 named l ga feox mmt and h ga feox mmt respectively promoted significantly higher h2o2 decomposition due to faster and more efficient catalytic activity 32 and 50 respectively to understand whether the exchangeable ions participate in the redox reaction feox mmt clays have a cec of 35 meq 100 g 1 schwartz et al 2020 the redox reactivity of the surface was also tested following several washes with 1 m nacl to remove excess iron ions the reactivity remained high suggesting that exchangeable ions do not participate in the activation of h2o2 fig s4 it has been previously established that soluble fe ii catalyzes h2o2 decomposition at significantly higher rates than fe iii lin and gurol 1998 herein we observe that surface bound iron complexed with ga also catalyzes decomposition at much higher rates compared with the bare feox mmt moreover the reduction of the iron by ga complexation was positively correlated to the amount of hydrogen peroxide decomposition measured fig 6b the kinetics of h2o2 decomposition by feox mmt l ga feox mmt and h ga feox mmt are presented in fig 6c and the first and second order kinetic parameters are presented in table s2 the ga feox mmt show superior activation rates compared to the iron coated clay alone after 15 min the amount of h2o2 decomposed by the ga complex is 5 times greater than with feox mmt the advantage of higher ga loading can be seen after an hour where 60 of the h2o2 was decomposed compared to only 40 by the low concentration ga complex consecutive cycles of incubation with h2o2 were measured to assess the stability of the h ga feox mmt complex fig 6d the results show the advantage of the h ga feox mmt over feox mmt in the first cycle where h2o2 decomposition radical production by the minerals was 28 and 4 3 respectively this advantage diminishes in the second and third cycle along with discoloration of the surface this suggests degradation of the surface bound ga by the generated radicals in that respect the concentrations of ga that were extracted from the surface after oxidation were below the detection limit of hplc and uv vis measurements 4 conclusions this study focused on the interactions of ga with iron coated montmorillonite as a representation of nom interactions mainly quinone and phenolic compounds with iron oxide coated surfaces the findings point to high affinity non reversible interactions with the surface iron oxide coating through inner sphere complexation ga surface complexation resulted in iron reduction and some level of ga transformation creating higher molecular weight molecules the reactivity of the surface was also altered as probed by peroxide decomposition the rates of decomposition were significantly higher due to the reduced iron ga complex lastly fast and complete degradation of ga on the surface was observed which suggests iron oxide coated surfaces can promote both formation of large phenolic molecules and catalyze their decomposition these findings have significant implications especially for evaluating the efficiency of fenton type in situ chemical oxidation technologies the composition of the soil or sediment nom can have a pronounced effect on radical production and scavenging of oxidants in addition these results suggest that feox clays could be highly beneficial as sorbent catalysts in the removal and oxidation of polyphenols from industrial or agricultural wastewaters declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

17706,investigating contamination pathways and hydraulic connections in complex hydrological systems will benefit greatly from multi tracer approaches the use of non toxic synthetic dna tracers is promising because unlimited numbers of tracers each with a unique dna identifier could be used concurrently and detected at extremely low concentrations this study aimed to develop multiple synthetic dna tracers as free molecules and encapsulated within microparticles of biocompatible and biodegradable alginate and chitosan and to validate their field utility in different systems experiments encompassing a wide range of conditions and flow rates 19 cm day 39 km day were conducted in a stream an alluvial gravel aquifer a fine coastal sand aquifer and in lysimeters containing undisturbed silt loam over gravels the dna tracers were identifiable in all field conditions investigated and they were directly detectable in the stream at a distance of at least 1 km the dna tracers showed promise at tracking fast flowing water in the stream gravel aquifer and permeable soils but were unsatisfactory at tracking slow moving groundwater in the fine sand aquifer in the surface water experiments the microencapsulated dna tracers concentrations and mass recoveries were 1 3 orders of magnitude greater than those of the free dna tracers because encapsulation protected them from environmental stressors and they were more negatively charged the opposite was observed in the gravel aquifer probably due to microparticle filtration by the aquifer media although these new dna tracers showed promise in proof of concept field validations further work is needed before they can be used for large scale investigations graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dna

reviewed in dahlke et al 2015 and recently this work has been extended to track effluent discharges georgakakos et al 2019 pang et al 2017 most studies have used short 100 bases single stranded dna ssdna sequences but pang et al 2017 used 302 base pair bp double stranded dna dsdna sequences because dsdna is structurally more stable than ssdna bustamante et al 2000 the potential drawbacks associated with the environmental application of synthetic dna tracers include biotic and abiotic degradation caused by ultraviolet radiation microbial activity enzymes and chemicals and adsorption to natural media such as clays oxides and organic matters indeed field studies have shown that compared with conservative solute tracers synthetic dna tracers undergo significant mass losses foppen et al 2011 2013 dahlke et al 2015 pang et al 2017 adsorption to colloids and solids may protect dna from environmental stressors and could inhibit dna degradation levy booth et al 2007 pietramellara et al 2009 kang et al 2010 hou et al 2014 this mechanism could be harnessed to protect dna tracers from degradation in recent years dna tracers encapsulated within polylactic acid particles that incorporate paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles sharma et al 2012 polylactic co glycolic acid plastic particles mcnew et al 2018 and silica nanoparticles mikutis et al 2018 have been developed for water tracking for use in ecologically sensitive freshwaters we aimed to develop a new class of microencapsulated dna tracers using alginate and chitosan which are naturally occurring biocompatible and biodegradable biopolymers rejinold et al 2011 dumitriu et al 2014 alginate is extracted from brown seaweed and chitosan originates from crustacean shells these biopolymers are widely used in drug delivery and food applications to track multiple contamination sources and pathways concurrently many dna tracers are required each with unique identifier thus 9 new dsdna 352 bp sequences were designed in this study and together with the 302 bp dsdna tracers we developed previously pang et al 2017 20 dsdna tracers are now available that can be used as free dna molecules or as microencapsulated dna this manuscript describes our development of these new dna tracers and proof of concept field validations in different systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 dna tracer sequences and analysis nine new dsdna tracers k1 k9 k tracers were designed in this study supplementary table s1 briefly 352 bp sequences containing random nucleotides were designed www faculty ucr edu mmaduro random htm and verified regarding their uniqueness blast ncbi nlm nih gov blast cgi the sequences were synthesised and cloned into the pbluescript plasmid at epoch life sciences missouri city tx usa primers designed to amplify a 200 bp internal region for tracer retrieval and quantitative detection were synthesised by thermo fisher scientific inc waltham ma usa the dna tracers were amplified from the plasmid using firepol dna polymerase solis biodyne tartu estonia according to the manufacturer s instructions with annealing at 50 c the resultant amplicons were purified using the genejet tm pcr purification kit thermo fisher scientific inc the k1 k9 tracers were quantified using the lightcycler 480 real time pcr system roche diagnostics gmbh mannheim germany and the luna universal qpcr master mix new england biolabs inc ipswich ma usa the thermal cycling conditions for k tracer quantification were 95 c for 10 min 1 cycle 95 c for 10 s 60 c for 30 s and 72 c for 12 s 45 cycles the individual tracers standard curves were established based on 6 7 triplicate samples at concentrations of 2 2 106 dna copies μl together with our previously developed dna tracers pang et al 2017 2014 20 different dna tracers were available for this study the earlier seq tracers were 302 bp dsdna fragments with internal amplicons of 198 bp for detection although the lengths of the internal regions used for detection were similar the seq tracers have shorter non amplified flanking regions 52 bp than the k tracers 76 bp which may affect their overall stability the seq tracers were quantified via the qpcr using the kapa sybr fast qpcr master mix kapa biosystems wilmington ma usa and their detection limits were 10 500 copies per 5 μl qpcr reaction for the field experiments the dna tracers were prepared free of any residual plasmid by using agarose gel extracted pcr products as the template dna for a second round of pcr amplification using firepol dna polymerase the products from the second pcr were purified using the genejet pcr purification kit and the purified dna tracer stocks were stored at 20 c until required the dna tracer concentrations within most of the water samples collected from the field experiments were determined directly however some samples with extremely low dna concentrations required concentration and the dna was extracted using the method described by bernhard and field 2000 briefly the water sample 100 1000 ml was filtered through a 0 2 µm supor 200 pes membrane filter pall corporation port washington ny usa the filter was removed and suspended in guanidinium isothiocyanate buffer containing 0 1 mm beads beaten for 3 min at 2500 rpm and centrifuged for 5 min at 3500 g the dna was then extracted from the sample using the dneasy powerwater kit qiagen gmbh hilden germany and a qiacube robot qiagen gmbh when analysing water samples from field experiments bovine serum albumin bsa 0 2 mg ml was incorporated into the qpcr master mix to prevent qpcr inhibition by biotic and abiotic environmental factors 2 2 dna chitosan alginate microparticle tracers 2 2 1 microparticle synthesis and characterisation the dna bound chitosan microparticles were synthesised by adapting the method described by özbaş turan and akbuğa 2011 briefly 1013 copies of a plasmid free dna tracer were mixed with 30 ml of 0 125 sodium tripolyphosphate sigma aldrich new zealand this mixture was added dropwise to 30 ml of a 0 5 50 190 kda chitosan solution sigma aldrich new zealand with gentle agitation at room temperature then the solution was stirred continuously for 30 min centrifuged at 20 000 g for 20 min and the pellet was washed 3 times with ultrapure water the dna chitosan microparticles were coated with alginate by adapting the method described by li et al 2008 briefly the dna chitosan microparticles 30 ml were added dropwise with mild agitation into 30 ml of a 1 low viscosity 250 centipoise sodium alginate solution sigma aldrich new zealand the mixture was stirred for 30 min centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min the pellet was then washed 3 times with ultrapure water and the harvested microparticles were stored in 0 25 mm cacl2 which was the cross linking agent at 4 c until required the sizes and concentrations of the microparticles were evaluated using a qnano analyzer izon science ltd christchurch new zealand and their zeta potentials were determined using a zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments malvern uk the morphologies of the microparticles were examined at the university of otago using a sigma vp scanning electron microscope carl zeiss inc oberkocken germany under an accelerating voltage of 5 10 kv 2 2 2 microencapsulated dna tracer sample analysis centrifugation was used to process samples from the surface water and soil lysimeter experiments because the samples dna concentrations were generally high the samples 1 ml or 10 ml were centrifuged at 9300 g for 10 min the pellets were re suspended in 300 µl of 2 chelex 100 bio rad and heated at 95 c for 5 min the tubes were left for 10 min to cool to room temperature and then centrifuged at 15 700 g for 5 min the supernatants were analysed using the qpcr a filtration method was used instead of centrifugation to process the samples obtained from the groundwater experiments because the samples dna concentrations were generally too low water samples 100 ml were filtered through 0 45 µm supor 200 membrane filters pall corporation the filters were collected into 2 ml microfuge tubes and 1 ml 2 chelex 100 bio rad laboratories inc hercules ca usa was added the filters were crushed and heated at 95 c for 5 min after cooling the mixture was centrifuged at 15 700 g for 5 min and the supernatant samples were analysed using the qpcr 2 2 3 stability of the microencapsulated dna tracers the microencapsulated dna tracers shelf lives in the 0 25 mm cacl2 storage buffer at 4 c were examined over 12 months by evaluating their zeta potentials and the dna concentrations released following chelex treatment the tracers short term stability was also examined in solutions with different ionic strengths including distilled water 0 mm stream water 1 77 mm and 5 raw dairy shed effluent 4 68 mm free dna tracers were used for comparisons in these tests and the samples were exposed to natural light dark cycles at room temperature 20 c nine replicate distilled water samples were evaluated on days 1 and 8 triplicate stream water section 2 3 1 and effluent samples were evaluated hourly for 0 7 h then twice daily until 96 h had elapsed the dna tracers were released from the microparticles and 3 technical replicates of the samples were analysed using the qpcr the stream water and effluent samples were analysed regarding their ph major cations and anions dissolved reactive phosphorus drp biochemical oxygen demand bod5 and total coliform and total bacterial heterotrophic plate counts using standard plate count agar medium merck kgaa darmstadt germany as the dna concentrations decreased exponentially with time a first order kinetic model was used to evaluate the time vs dna concentration data 1 c c 0 e λ t in which λ is the first order degradation rate c is the concentration at time t and c o is the initial concentration curve fitting was performed using the excel solver function by optimising the λ value while minimising the sum of the squared residuals between the observed and the predicted concentrations the time required for a 1 log10 or a 90 reduction t90 from the initial concentration was calculated from the formula 2 t 90 ln 0 1 λ 2 303 λ 2 3 field traceability validation 2 3 1 surface stream the surface water experimental site was the harris drain section of coldstream ashburton new zealand in an area dominated by agricultural land use the stream has a groundwater source and is rich in nutrients with a mean nitrate nitrogen concentration of 11 4 0 16 mg l 6 samples as measured in this study the stream is phosphorus limited despite considerable macrophyte and algal growth in some parts of the stream the stream reach used in the experiments was 1 km and it was 1 0 2 1 m wide and 0 09 0 28 m deep in order to validate the traceability of the new dna tracers in surface water 3 dna tracer experiments were conducted during early spring the downstream monitoring distances were extended with increasing confidence regarding tracer detection from 20 100 m in experiment 1 to 100 500 m in experiment 2 and to 600 1000 m in experiment 3 before each dna tracer experiment a salt tracer test was conducted on the same day to determine the dna tracers optimal sampling times for each salt tracer test 20 l of solution containing 1 kg or 2 kg nacl were injected instantaneously into a slow moving pool at the top of the reach distance x 0 m electrical conductivity was logged continuously during the test and the water quality parameters were measured using ysi pro plus and ysi prodss multi parameter meters table 1 the stream flow velocity was 14 27 m min 20 39 km day as determined from the peak nacl concentrations in the breakthrough curves btcs the dna tracer experiment was conducted after the salt tracer plume had passed to avoid potential aggregation of the dna tracers particularly the microencapsulated dna tracers under the influence of the salt tracer s high ionic strength for each dna tracer experiment 20 l of tracer solution table 1 were introduced instantaneously at x 0 m in experiments 1 and 2 4 free and 3 encapsulated dna tracers were applied while in experiment 3 9 free and 5 encapsulated dna tracers were introduced water samples were collected in 2 l plastic bottles at 5 downstream locations at 20 100 m 100 500 m and 600 1000 m in experiments 1 2 and 3 respectively the samples were kept cool inside chilly bins with ice packs transferred to the laboratory within 3 h and stored at 4 c the water samples were analysed using the qpcr within 2 weeks the experimental data were evaluated using the peak breakthrough attenuation log cmax c0 where cmax and c0 are the peak concentration and input concentration respectively and normalised mass recovery of dna tracer relative to nacl rb rb was determined by integrating the btcs of the reactive and nonreactive tracers harvey and garabedian 1991 as follows 3 r b c c 0 d t d n a c c 0 d t n a c l for unbiased mass recovery estimations the same duration was used for the numerical integrations of the dna and salt tracer btcs the rb value reflects the dna tracer s reactivity and an rb of 1 implies that it has the same mass recovery as the salt tracer 2 3 2 groundwater systems the utility of the new dna tracers was investigated in 2 common new zealand groundwater systems that have contrasting aquifer properties and contaminant attenuation capacities these were a coarse alluvial gravel aquifer at the burnham experimental site in the canterbury region of the south island and a well sorted fine coastal sand aquifer at the pauanui experimental site in the waikato region of the north island alluvial gravel aquifer the alluvial gravel aquifer experimental site at burnham is immediately up gradient of a sewage treatment plant the aquifer media are highly heterogeneous and poorly sorted comprising medium to coarse alluvial sandy gravels with silt and clay bands the groundwater s characteristics were na ca hco3 type ph 6 6 7 2 ionic strength 1 2 mm and main temperature 12 c pang et al 2005 there were 22 wells diameter 100 mm and screened at 12 18 m below ground level bgl the main flow line was previously determined and validated using conservative tracers pang et al 1998 and pumping tests dann et al 2008 the groundwater velocities ranged 30 85 m day pang et al 1998 two experiments were conducted at this site experiment 1 was designed to validate the traceability of 20 free dna tracers it was conducted in spring and involved applying groundwater 40 l spiked with the free dna tracers 105 106 copies μl when the encapsulated dna tracers became available experiment 2 was conducted to validate the utility of the encapsulated dna tracers in comparison with the free dna tracers it was performed in summer and involved applying groundwater 40 l spiked with 3 free dna tracers 109 1010 copies μl and 3 encapsulated dna tracers 107 108 copies μl the tracer solutions were injected into an injection well at 14 16 m bgl over 0 5 h using a well packer which was kept inflated throughout the experiments using submersible pumps samples were collected over 3 days from down gradient wells at 21 37 62 and 87 m along the flow line the sampling depths were at 16 m bgl in both experiments the water table was 11 55 m bgl in experiment 1 and 14 9 m bgl in experiment 2 the samples were collected in 0 2 1 l glass bottles chilled transferred to the laboratory within 6 h stored at 4 c and analysed using the qpcr within 2 weeks as numerous salt and dye tracer experiments had been conducted at this site previously neither salt nor dye tracers were used during the experiments to prevent potential negative impacts on the dna tracers to detect salt or dye tracers at 87 m they must be applied at extremely high concentrations for example cl at 44 230 mg l pang et al 1998 br at 6200 mg l and rhodamine wt at 1600 mg l dann et al 2008 these high tracer concentrations would promote aggregation and adsorption of the dna tracers particularly the microencapsulated dna tracers and inhibit their detection using the qpcr in the absence of a solute tracer for comparisons of the relative attenuations of the different dna tracers we used the mass recoveries in the samples relative to their input masses msamples which were calculated from the measured volumes and concentrations of the samples wi ci and the injection solutions w0 c0 as follows 4 m s a m p l e s w i c i w 0 c 0 coastal sand aquifer one experiment was conducted at the pauanui coastal sand aquifer experimental site in early autumn to validate the dna tracers utility in uniform fine coastal sand aquifer the groundwater table was 4 6 m bgl at a gradient of 0 06 towards the beach that was 100 m away monitoring wells groundwater flow velocity 0 19 m day and flow line had been previously established about 20 l of groundwater spiked with 4 free dna tracers 107 108 copies μl and rhodamine wt dye 260 μg l were injected over 0 5 h samples were taken using peristaltic pumps over 24 days from down gradient wells at 0 6 1 5 and 3 m along the flow line the samples were collected in 1 l glass bottles chilled and transferred to the laboratory in christchurch within 3 days and analysed using the qpcr the dye tracer samples were analysed by using a shimadzu rf 1501 spectrofluorimeter with a detection limit of 0 1 μg l 2 3 3 intact soil lysimeter experiments three experiments were conducted in lysimeters 0 7 m long 0 5 m internal diameter containing intact 0 3 m topsoil and 0 4 m sandy gravel vadose zone material the intact soil cores had a mean saturated hydraulic conductivity of 0 27 0 03 m day and a pore volume of 10 l the lysimeters were pre saturated until a steady flow of 100 ml min was achieved automatic irrigators and peristaltic pumps were used to distribute water uniformly over the surfaces experiment 1 was conducted to investigate the traceability of the 20 free dna tracers in soils it was conducted in winter and tap water 9 l spiked with 20 free dna tracers 105 106 copies μl and kbr 30 mg l was injected into a lysimeter the tap water comprised untreated groundwater sourced from an alluvial gravel aquifer the soil leachate s in situ characteristics were temperature 8 c ph 6 0 6 6 and dissolved oxygen do 7 11 mg l the br concentrations were analysed using an ion selective electrode with detection limit of 0 1 mg l experiment 2 was conducted in autumn to examine the reproducibility of the results from the free dna tracers from different lysimeters stream water 9 l lysimeter was applied simultaneously to 3 lysimeters that contained 10 dairy shed effluent 4 free dna tracers 106 107 copies μl and kbr 11 mg l the soil leachate s characteristics were temperature 12 20 c ph 6 2 6 9 do 9 11 mg l and specific conductance spc 101 233 μs cm background 101 131 μs cm to evaluate the reproducibility of the results from the encapsulated dna tracers in different lysimeters experiment 3 was conducted in summer when the encapsulated dna tracers became available stream water 9 l containing 1 encapsulated dna tracer 108 copies μl and nacl 250 mg l was applied to 2 lysimeters the soil leachate s characteristics were temperature 20 23 c ph 5 2 6 7 and spc 101 267 μs cm background 101 106 μs cm nacl concentrations were measured by using a conductivity metre in new zealand farmland soils are commonly irrigated using groundwater stream water and dairy shed effluent thus using different water types in the aforementioned experiments reflects reality during these experiments the solutions containing the tracers 9 l were applied over 1 5 h followed by flushing with tracer free water the leachate samples were collected in 1 l glass bottles for up to 7 h the chilled samples were transferred to the laboratory within 2 h where they were stored at 4 c and analysed within 1 week 3 results and discussion 3 1 dna tracer sequences the new k tracers designed in this study supplementary table s1 had satisfactory calibration curves r2 0 97 1 00 amplification efficiencies 96 110 and limits of detection 5 250 copies per 4 μl qpcr reaction the structures of the k tracers differed from those of the seq tracers pang et al 2017 that were designed using a method that labels the surfaces of protein coated silica nanoparticles to create virus surrogates pang et al 2014 we anticipated that the new 352 bp k tracers would be more stable than the 302 bp seq tracers because they are longer however the 2 sets of tracers had similar zeta potentials k tracers 14 3 1 1 mv 5 samples seq tracers 18 3 7 9 mv 7 samples 3 2 microencapsulated dna tracers and their stability the mean size of the dna chitosan alginate microparticles was on average 14 samples 312 132 nm and a typical yield from their synthesis was 6 11 108 5 9 108 particles ml as determined using the qnano scanning electron microscopy fig 1 showed that most of the microparticles measured a few hundred nanometres and that their morphology was similar to the bsa loaded chitosan alginate particles presented by wang and he 2010 the encapsulated dna tracers were negatively charged with mean 28 samples zeta potentials of 31 2 8 4 mv in 1 mm nacl ph 6 5 and 14 1 1 7 mv in the 0 25 mm cacl2 storage solution ph 5 3 the k and seq tracers had similar zeta potentials when microencapsulated chelex treatment and heating disrupted the dna chitosan alginate microparticles and released the dna tracers into solution for detection chelex treatment did not affect the qpcr analysis of the dna tracers this concurs with the findings of walsh et al 1991 and burkhart et al 2002 who showed that chelex effectively removes qpcr inhibitors during dna isolation procedures when stored in 0 25 mm cacl2 at 4 c the microencapsulated dna tracers were relatively stable regarding their zeta potentials over 11 months fig 2 a and the concentrations of dna able to be released by chelex treatment over 12 months fig 2b however compared with months 0 3 the concentrations of unbound dna in the storage solution during months 10 12 were over 2 orders of magnitude lower suggesting that the dna that had leached from the microparticles had degraded fig 2b the microencapsulated dna tracers were stable in distilled water over 8 days showing only 0 1 log reductions in concentrations but the free dna tracers concentrations reduced by 0 4 log the microencapsulated dna tracers concentrations did not decline fig 3 in stream water λ 0 000 h 1 supplementary table s2 during exposure to natural light dark cycles at 20 c for 96 h however a c c0 1 indicated that some dna tracers leached from the microparticles in contrast the free dna tracers degraded significantly λ 0 118 0 039 h 1 in stream water in the tests involving 5 dairy shed effluent microencapsulated dna tracers degraded more slowly λ 0 005 0 006 h 1 in comparison with the free dna tracers λ 0 241 0 437 h 1 we estimated that a t90 of 17 19 days would be required for a 1 log10 reduction of the microencapsulated dna tracers in 5 raw dairy shed effluent in contrast a t90 of only 0 81 2 47 days and a t90 of 0 22 0 40 days would be required for 1 log10 reductions of the free dna tracers in the stream water and dairy shed effluent respectively these results suggest that microencapsulation effectively protects the dna tracers from degradation by environmental stressors the greater reductions of the dna tracers observed in the effluent samples compared with those in the stream water samples could be explained by the water quality the dairy shed effluent s characteristics were heterotrophic plate count 150 000 colony forming units cfu ml ionic strength 4 7 mm nh3 n 13 9 mg l drp 2 8 mg l and bod5 15 mg l these parameters were much lower in the stream water samples as follows heterotrophic plate count 110 cfu ml ionic strength 1 8 mm nh3 n 0 01 mg l drp 2 8 mg l and bod5 2 mg l 3 3 field traceability 3 3 1 surface stream the free and microencapsulated dna tracers applied were directly detectable in all 3 experiments conducted in the surface stream fig 4 supplementary figs s1 s2 the dna tracers could be traced in the stream for at least 1 km despite pollution of the stream with nitrate and algae the similar peak concentration times observed for most of the salt and dna tracer btcs suggested the flow rates were relatively constant throughout each day of sampling compared with the free dna tracers the microencapsulated dna tracers showed 1 3 log lower reductions in their peak concentrations over the same distances travelled fig 5 and despite their input concentrations were lower than those of the free dna tracers table 1 their mass recoveries relative to nacl were 1 3 orders of magnitude higher especially at greater distances fig 6 hence microencapsulation may have protected the dna tracers from degradation in the surface water environment moreover the microencapsulated dna tracers were more negatively charged 31 2 8 4 mv than the free dna tracers 16 6 6 2 mv because of the presence of the alginate coating which may have reduced adsorption to stream sediments during their transport compared with the free dna tracers the encapsulated dna tracers displayed fewer concentration variations due to the higher concentrations detected fig 4 supplementary figs s1 s2 the btcs and mass recoveries of the microencapsulated k and seq tracers were similar in all 3 experiments fig 4 supplementary figs s1 s2 fig 6 which suggests their performances were primarily determined by the microparticles rather than the dna sequences the microencapsulated dna tracers had underwent little reaction compared with the free dna tracers and the microencapsulated k3 and k9 tracers displayed no reductions relative to nacl rb 1 at 20 60 m distances in experiment 2 fig 6 amongst the free dna tracers the k tracers showed significantly less removal than the seq tracers despite their similar zeta potentials k tracers 14 3 1 1 mv seq tracers 18 3 7 9 mv section 3 1 the mass recoveries of the k tracers were 1 4 orders of magnitude greater than those of the seq tracers fig 6 these differences could be explained by the greater length of the k tracers overall and or the sequence composition contributing to their overall stability or by the different lengths of the flanking regions as described in section 2 1 the non amplified flanking regions of the k tracers are 23 bp longer than those of the seq tracers which may protect the amplified regions from environmental degradation for longer the free seq4 tracer showed the greatest concentration reduction and the low mass recovery and it behaved differently compared with the other tracers fig 5 fig 6 the reasons for this are unclear the k tracers differed distinctly from the seq tracers regarding their environmental degradation profiles and adsorption to environmental matrices these properties will be described in a separate manuscript 3 3 2 groundwater alluvial gravel aquifer testing the dna tracers in an alluvial gravel aquifer demonstrated their potential utility in groundwater conditions that are most vulnerable to contamination the permeable alluvial gravel aquifer media has a poor attenuation capacity and a fast groundwater flow rate in experiment 1 all 20 free dna tracers were directly detectable in the well at 21 m down gradient of the injection well fig 7 in the wells at 37 m and 62 m down gradient some tracers were directly detectable but others were detectable only after concentrating the dna tracers from 300 ml this is not surprising given the low concentrations of the dna tracers injected mostly 105 106 copies μl in the most distant well at 87 m down gradient all the dna tracers except for the seq 4 tracer were detectable after concentrating the dna tracers from 1 l with the exception of the btcs obtained from the well at 21 m fig 7 the btcs obtained from the other wells were not clearly defined data not shown like the results from the surface water experiments the k tracers displayed greater concentration and mass recoveries than the seq tracers in the alluvial gravel groundwater fig 7 the mean peak concentration reductions were 2 0 0 14 log for the 9 k tracers and 2 6 0 19 log for the 11 seq tracers compared with the seq tracers the msamples of the k tracers were about 1 order of magnitude greater in experiment 2 the free dna tracers were directly detectable in all of the down gradient sampling wells at 21 37 62 and 87 m fig 7 shows the dna tracers btcs from the wells at 37 and 87 m the encapsulated dna tracers were only detectable after concentrating the samples from 100 ml and the encapsulated tracers msamples were about 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of the free dna tracers compared with the free dna tracers the larger encapsulated dna tracers are likely to undergo more removal by filtration during their transport in the aquifer media the lower input concentrations of the encapsulated dna tracers 107 108 copies μl compared with those of the free dna tracers 109 1010 copies μl could also explain the lower msamples values the encapsulated dna tracers concentration variations were larger and their btcs were not clearly defined data not shown except for those from the sampling well at 37 m fig 7 previous experiments at this site had been carried out using ms2 bacteriophages bacillus subtilis spores and e coli of which the spore size 0 85 μm wide 1 27 μm long is comparable with that of the encapsulated dna tracer microparticles interestingly at a transport distance of 37 m their concentration reductions log cmax c0 were similar encapsulated dna tracers 4 3 5 5 log b subtilis spores 4 1 4 7 log pang et al 2005 based on the findings from a study by pang et al 1998 and the stability test results section 3 2 neither the degradation of the encapsulated dna nor spore inactivation were expected during the experiments hence filtration was probably the predominant process underlying the removal of dna tracer microparticles and spores in the alluvial gravel aquifer investigated compared with experiment 1 the relative concentrations c c0 of the dna tracers tended to be lower in experiment 2 for the same transport distance the water table in experiment 2 was 3 m lower than that in experiment 1 therefore the aquifer segment tested was thinner this could affect the preferential flow paths and groundwater velocity and thus the attenuation and transport of the dna tracers coastal sand aquifer in contrast to the alluvial gravel aquifer the results from the fine coastal sand aquifer demonstrate the potential utility of the dna tracers in groundwater conditions that provide excellent protection from contamination the groundwater flow rate was extremely low at only 19 cm day at this site the sand media appeared to contain fragments of pumice dann et al 2011 which has a high adsorption capacity for negatively charged particles including dna the dna tracers were detectable supplementary fig s3 but only after they were concentrated from 1 l water samples this was likely due to the very slow flow rate enabling in situ degradation and dna adsorption to the aquifer media the k4 tracer s btcs at 0 5 m and 1 5 m had 2 peaks with higher concentrations in the first peaks which suggests that some of the dna tracer was transported through preferential flow paths again the k tracer concentration reductions were lower than those of the seq tracers and their relative concentrations and mass recoveries were in the order k4 k6 seq2 seq4 in all sampling wells supplementary fig s3 s4 like the results from the other field experiments the seq4 tracer had the lowest traceability 3 3 3 intact soil lysimeter experiments all the dna tracers applied to the intact soil lysimeters were directly detectable in the soil leachates like the surface water and groundwater experiments the k tracers showed lower concentration reductions and greater mass recoveries than the seq tracers fig 8 the k tracers mass recoveries rb were about 4 and 10 times greater than the seq tracers mass recoveries in experiments 1 and 2 respectively despite the physical heterogeneity of the soil lysimeters the results from the soil lysimeter experiments involving the free dna tracers experiment 2 supplementary fig s5 and the encapsulated dna tracers experiment 3 fig 8 were reproducible as expected the dna tracers mass recoveries were mostly 2 4 orders of magnitude lower than those of the salt tracers likely due to adsorption to the soil media and biodegradation compared with the salt tracers the dna tracers showed earlier breakthroughs with less dispersion fig 8 which was probably due to size exclusion associated with colloid transport in heterogeneous media this was observed in our previous lysimeter work pang et al 2017 3 4 dna tracer advantages and disadvantages and future work the findings from our proof of concept field studies demonstrate that numerous dna tracers can be applied concurrently as free molecules or encapsulated within microparticles and tracked in different hydrological environments unlimited numbers of dna tracers each with a unique identifier can be easily developed for this purpose thus dna tracers have a powerful capability to concurrently track multiple contamination sources and pathways and hydraulic connections providing spatially explicit information on complex natural and engineered hydrological systems the multiplexing capacity of dna tracers is many fold greater than that of commonly used traditional water tracers namely cl or br salts and fluorescent dyes which is a key advantage of this technology dna tracers can be detected at extremely low concentrations compared with solute tracers the detection limits of the dna tracers designed in this study were 5 250 copies per 4 μl qpcr reaction which is equivalent to 10 10 10 8 mg l after converting the copy numbers to nanograms http cels uri edu gsc cndna html this is 7 9 orders of magnitude lower than the detection limit of br 0 1 mg l using an ion selective electrode and ion chromatography and 4 6 orders of magnitude lower than the detection limit of rhodamine wt 0 1 μg l using a spectrofluorimeter the chloride tracer s effective detection limit will vary according to their background levels table 1 section 2 3 3 the dna tracers are non toxic and have no genetic functionality and our microencapsulated dna tracers were made of biocompatible and biodegradable biopolymer materials thus they can be used in ecologically sensitive freshwater environments conversely fluorescent dyes and br are toxic at high concentrations to humans and aquatic organisms who 2009 field 2005 a limit of 1 mg l has been proposed for br tracers flury and papritz 1993 and some fluorescent dye tracers field et al 1995 to protect aquatic organisms from their toxicities although cl salt tracers are safe to humans high salinity 1 g l can adversely affect aquatic biota nielsen et al 2003 dna tracers degrade naturally which is another important property thus they will have little environmental impact in contrast most artificial dyes are resistant to degradation in the environment flury and wai 2003 and they can persist for several years in some subsurface media wolkersdorfer and leblanc 2012 however dna tracer degradation as we encountered in the low flow groundwater in the fine coastal aquifer is a disadvantage when conducting long term experiments information on the dna tracers degradation rates will help the design of longer term experiments dna tracer analysis using the qpcr took under 3 h to process 90 samples i e 30 s sample by comparison 2 3 min were required to analyse a rhodamine wt sample using a spectrofluorimeter or a br sample using an ion selective electrode but nacl tracers can be measured rapidly in situ using an electrical conductivity metre successful tracer testing requires a priori hydrogeological knowledge of the site and preliminary information about the transport parameters divine and mcdonnell 2005 this also applies to dna tracer testing further work is needed before dna tracers can be used routinely in large scale field studies our future work will involve reducing the dna tracer preparation time automating sample processing and the pcr and refining tracer detectability in different hydrological matrices furthermore while samples can be collected from the field and analysed in laboratories the rapid detection of dna tracers in the field would be hugely beneficial this will be possible as portable pcr and qpcr devices become increasingly available and is an avenue we are investigating we believe these challenges will be overcome soon and that dna tracer technology has a bright future as new tool that can facilitate hydrological investigations in complex natural environments and engineered systems 4 conclusions our proof of concept studies demonstrated that the dna tracers showed promising results at water tracking in a surface stream a fast flow alluvial gravel aquifer and in permeable alluvial soils they could be tracked for at least 1 km in the stream and 87 m in the gravel aquifer however the results were unsatisfactory in the extremely slow groundwater 19 cm day in the fine coastal sand aquifer probably due to dna tracer degradation and adsorption in the aquifer media during the prolonged experiment 25 days this is the first study to develop microencapsulated dna tracers using alginate and chitosan these naturally occurring biopolymers are biodegradable and biocompatible therefore the microencapsulated dna tracers can be used in ecologically sensitive freshwater environments the microencapsulated dna tracers surface charges and concentrations remained stable during storage for 11 months in the surface water stream the microencapsulated dna tracers concentration reductions were 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of the free dna tracers at 1 km downstream our experimental results suggest that the alginate chitosan microencapsulated dna tracers would be suitable for use in surface water and wastewater environments but they will be subject to filtration removal in subsurface media in contrast the free dna tracers would be suitable for use in subsurface and fast flowing surface water environments but they will degrade rapidly in wastewater environments although dna tracer degradation is a drawback when water tracking is performed over long periods their degradation means that they will have little environmental impact understanding the hydrological environment and selecting appropriate dna tracers will be important when designing investigations involving these tools dna tracers have great potential as tools that can track multiple pollution sources and pathways concurrently in ecologically sensitive freshwater environments but further work is needed before they can be routinely used in large scale studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17706,investigating contamination pathways and hydraulic connections in complex hydrological systems will benefit greatly from multi tracer approaches the use of non toxic synthetic dna tracers is promising because unlimited numbers of tracers each with a unique dna identifier could be used concurrently and detected at extremely low concentrations this study aimed to develop multiple synthetic dna tracers as free molecules and encapsulated within microparticles of biocompatible and biodegradable alginate and chitosan and to validate their field utility in different systems experiments encompassing a wide range of conditions and flow rates 19 cm day 39 km day were conducted in a stream an alluvial gravel aquifer a fine coastal sand aquifer and in lysimeters containing undisturbed silt loam over gravels the dna tracers were identifiable in all field conditions investigated and they were directly detectable in the stream at a distance of at least 1 km the dna tracers showed promise at tracking fast flowing water in the stream gravel aquifer and permeable soils but were unsatisfactory at tracking slow moving groundwater in the fine sand aquifer in the surface water experiments the microencapsulated dna tracers concentrations and mass recoveries were 1 3 orders of magnitude greater than those of the free dna tracers because encapsulation protected them from environmental stressors and they were more negatively charged the opposite was observed in the gravel aquifer probably due to microparticle filtration by the aquifer media although these new dna tracers showed promise in proof of concept field validations further work is needed before they can be used for large scale investigations graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dna tracer surface water groundwater soil degradation water contamination 1 introduction the intensification of human activities has heavily polluted freshwater sources globally and current tools are limited with respect to tracking water contamination pathways and identifying their source locations which has hampered mitigation efforts investigating contamination pathways and hydraulic connections in complex natural and engineered hydrological systems using multi tracer approaches would greatly increase the effectiveness of mitigation traditionally chemical salts and dyes have been used as water tracers but only a few of these tracers can be applied concurrently magal et al 2010 progress in dna detection technology has enabled the use of synthetic dna tracers for water tracking ptak et al 2004 liao et al 2018 abbott et al 2016 unlimited numbers of dna sequences can be designed using random sequence generator software and their uniqueness can be verified by database matching dna tracers are amplified using the polymerase chain reaction pcr and they can be detected rapidly and sensitively at extremely low concentrations by using quantitative pcr qpcr this technology could enable the concurrent use of multiple dna tracers to obtain information about complex hydrological systems synthetic dna tracers have been used to track water flows in aquifers and surface streams as reviewed in dahlke et al 2015 and recently this work has been extended to track effluent discharges georgakakos et al 2019 pang et al 2017 most studies have used short 100 bases single stranded dna ssdna sequences but pang et al 2017 used 302 base pair bp double stranded dna dsdna sequences because dsdna is structurally more stable than ssdna bustamante et al 2000 the potential drawbacks associated with the environmental application of synthetic dna tracers include biotic and abiotic degradation caused by ultraviolet radiation microbial activity enzymes and chemicals and adsorption to natural media such as clays oxides and organic matters indeed field studies have shown that compared with conservative solute tracers synthetic dna tracers undergo significant mass losses foppen et al 2011 2013 dahlke et al 2015 pang et al 2017 adsorption to colloids and solids may protect dna from environmental stressors and could inhibit dna degradation levy booth et al 2007 pietramellara et al 2009 kang et al 2010 hou et al 2014 this mechanism could be harnessed to protect dna tracers from degradation in recent years dna tracers encapsulated within polylactic acid particles that incorporate paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles sharma et al 2012 polylactic co glycolic acid plastic particles mcnew et al 2018 and silica nanoparticles mikutis et al 2018 have been developed for water tracking for use in ecologically sensitive freshwaters we aimed to develop a new class of microencapsulated dna tracers using alginate and chitosan which are naturally occurring biocompatible and biodegradable biopolymers rejinold et al 2011 dumitriu et al 2014 alginate is extracted from brown seaweed and chitosan originates from crustacean shells these biopolymers are widely used in drug delivery and food applications to track multiple contamination sources and pathways concurrently many dna tracers are required each with unique identifier thus 9 new dsdna 352 bp sequences were designed in this study and together with the 302 bp dsdna tracers we developed previously pang et al 2017 20 dsdna tracers are now available that can be used as free dna molecules or as microencapsulated dna this manuscript describes our development of these new dna tracers and proof of concept field validations in different systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 dna tracer sequences and analysis nine new dsdna tracers k1 k9 k tracers were designed in this study supplementary table s1 briefly 352 bp sequences containing random nucleotides were designed www faculty ucr edu mmaduro random htm and verified regarding their uniqueness blast ncbi nlm nih gov blast cgi the sequences were synthesised and cloned into the pbluescript plasmid at epoch life sciences missouri city tx usa primers designed to amplify a 200 bp internal region for tracer retrieval and quantitative detection were synthesised by thermo fisher scientific inc waltham ma usa the dna tracers were amplified from the plasmid using firepol dna polymerase solis biodyne tartu estonia according to the manufacturer s instructions with annealing at 50 c the resultant amplicons were purified using the genejet tm pcr purification kit thermo fisher scientific inc the k1 k9 tracers were quantified using the lightcycler 480 real time pcr system roche diagnostics gmbh mannheim germany and the luna universal qpcr master mix new england biolabs inc ipswich ma usa the thermal cycling conditions for k tracer quantification were 95 c for 10 min 1 cycle 95 c for 10 s 60 c for 30 s and 72 c for 12 s 45 cycles the individual tracers standard curves were established based on 6 7 triplicate samples at concentrations of 2 2 106 dna copies μl together with our previously developed dna tracers pang et al 2017 2014 20 different dna tracers were available for this study the earlier seq tracers were 302 bp dsdna fragments with internal amplicons of 198 bp for detection although the lengths of the internal regions used for detection were similar the seq tracers have shorter non amplified flanking regions 52 bp than the k tracers 76 bp which may affect their overall stability the seq tracers were quantified via the qpcr using the kapa sybr fast qpcr master mix kapa biosystems wilmington ma usa and their detection limits were 10 500 copies per 5 μl qpcr reaction for the field experiments the dna tracers were prepared free of any residual plasmid by using agarose gel extracted pcr products as the template dna for a second round of pcr amplification using firepol dna polymerase the products from the second pcr were purified using the genejet pcr purification kit and the purified dna tracer stocks were stored at 20 c until required the dna tracer concentrations within most of the water samples collected from the field experiments were determined directly however some samples with extremely low dna concentrations required concentration and the dna was extracted using the method described by bernhard and field 2000 briefly the water sample 100 1000 ml was filtered through a 0 2 µm supor 200 pes membrane filter pall corporation port washington ny usa the filter was removed and suspended in guanidinium isothiocyanate buffer containing 0 1 mm beads beaten for 3 min at 2500 rpm and centrifuged for 5 min at 3500 g the dna was then extracted from the sample using the dneasy powerwater kit qiagen gmbh hilden germany and a qiacube robot qiagen gmbh when analysing water samples from field experiments bovine serum albumin bsa 0 2 mg ml was incorporated into the qpcr master mix to prevent qpcr inhibition by biotic and abiotic environmental factors 2 2 dna chitosan alginate microparticle tracers 2 2 1 microparticle synthesis and characterisation the dna bound chitosan microparticles were synthesised by adapting the method described by özbaş turan and akbuğa 2011 briefly 1013 copies of a plasmid free dna tracer were mixed with 30 ml of 0 125 sodium tripolyphosphate sigma aldrich new zealand this mixture was added dropwise to 30 ml of a 0 5 50 190 kda chitosan solution sigma aldrich new zealand with gentle agitation at room temperature then the solution was stirred continuously for 30 min centrifuged at 20 000 g for 20 min and the pellet was washed 3 times with ultrapure water the dna chitosan microparticles were coated with alginate by adapting the method described by li et al 2008 briefly the dna chitosan microparticles 30 ml were added dropwise with mild agitation into 30 ml of a 1 low viscosity 250 centipoise sodium alginate solution sigma aldrich new zealand the mixture was stirred for 30 min centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min the pellet was then washed 3 times with ultrapure water and the harvested microparticles were stored in 0 25 mm cacl2 which was the cross linking agent at 4 c until required the sizes and concentrations of the microparticles were evaluated using a qnano analyzer izon science ltd christchurch new zealand and their zeta potentials were determined using a zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments malvern uk the morphologies of the microparticles were examined at the university of otago using a sigma vp scanning electron microscope carl zeiss inc oberkocken germany under an accelerating voltage of 5 10 kv 2 2 2 microencapsulated dna tracer sample analysis centrifugation was used to process samples from the surface water and soil lysimeter experiments because the samples dna concentrations were generally high the samples 1 ml or 10 ml were centrifuged at 9300 g for 10 min the pellets were re suspended in 300 µl of 2 chelex 100 bio rad and heated at 95 c for 5 min the tubes were left for 10 min to cool to room temperature and then centrifuged at 15 700 g for 5 min the supernatants were analysed using the qpcr a filtration method was used instead of centrifugation to process the samples obtained from the groundwater experiments because the samples dna concentrations were generally too low water samples 100 ml were filtered through 0 45 µm supor 200 membrane filters pall corporation the filters were collected into 2 ml microfuge tubes and 1 ml 2 chelex 100 bio rad laboratories inc hercules ca usa was added the filters were crushed and heated at 95 c for 5 min after cooling the mixture was centrifuged at 15 700 g for 5 min and the supernatant samples were analysed using the qpcr 2 2 3 stability of the microencapsulated dna tracers the microencapsulated dna tracers shelf lives in the 0 25 mm cacl2 storage buffer at 4 c were examined over 12 months by evaluating their zeta potentials and the dna concentrations released following chelex treatment the tracers short term stability was also examined in solutions with different ionic strengths including distilled water 0 mm stream water 1 77 mm and 5 raw dairy shed effluent 4 68 mm free dna tracers were used for comparisons in these tests and the samples were exposed to natural light dark cycles at room temperature 20 c nine replicate distilled water samples were evaluated on days 1 and 8 triplicate stream water section 2 3 1 and effluent samples were evaluated hourly for 0 7 h then twice daily until 96 h had elapsed the dna tracers were released from the microparticles and 3 technical replicates of the samples were analysed using the qpcr the stream water and effluent samples were analysed regarding their ph major cations and anions dissolved reactive phosphorus drp biochemical oxygen demand bod5 and total coliform and total bacterial heterotrophic plate counts using standard plate count agar medium merck kgaa darmstadt germany as the dna concentrations decreased exponentially with time a first order kinetic model was used to evaluate the time vs dna concentration data 1 c c 0 e λ t in which λ is the first order degradation rate c is the concentration at time t and c o is the initial concentration curve fitting was performed using the excel solver function by optimising the λ value while minimising the sum of the squared residuals between the observed and the predicted concentrations the time required for a 1 log10 or a 90 reduction t90 from the initial concentration was calculated from the formula 2 t 90 ln 0 1 λ 2 303 λ 2 3 field traceability validation 2 3 1 surface stream the surface water experimental site was the harris drain section of coldstream ashburton new zealand in an area dominated by agricultural land use the stream has a groundwater source and is rich in nutrients with a mean nitrate nitrogen concentration of 11 4 0 16 mg l 6 samples as measured in this study the stream is phosphorus limited despite considerable macrophyte and algal growth in some parts of the stream the stream reach used in the experiments was 1 km and it was 1 0 2 1 m wide and 0 09 0 28 m deep in order to validate the traceability of the new dna tracers in surface water 3 dna tracer experiments were conducted during early spring the downstream monitoring distances were extended with increasing confidence regarding tracer detection from 20 100 m in experiment 1 to 100 500 m in experiment 2 and to 600 1000 m in experiment 3 before each dna tracer experiment a salt tracer test was conducted on the same day to determine the dna tracers optimal sampling times for each salt tracer test 20 l of solution containing 1 kg or 2 kg nacl were injected instantaneously into a slow moving pool at the top of the reach distance x 0 m electrical conductivity was logged continuously during the test and the water quality parameters were measured using ysi pro plus and ysi prodss multi parameter meters table 1 the stream flow velocity was 14 27 m min 20 39 km day as determined from the peak nacl concentrations in the breakthrough curves btcs the dna tracer experiment was conducted after the salt tracer plume had passed to avoid potential aggregation of the dna tracers particularly the microencapsulated dna tracers under the influence of the salt tracer s high ionic strength for each dna tracer experiment 20 l of tracer solution table 1 were introduced instantaneously at x 0 m in experiments 1 and 2 4 free and 3 encapsulated dna tracers were applied while in experiment 3 9 free and 5 encapsulated dna tracers were introduced water samples were collected in 2 l plastic bottles at 5 downstream locations at 20 100 m 100 500 m and 600 1000 m in experiments 1 2 and 3 respectively the samples were kept cool inside chilly bins with ice packs transferred to the laboratory within 3 h and stored at 4 c the water samples were analysed using the qpcr within 2 weeks the experimental data were evaluated using the peak breakthrough attenuation log cmax c0 where cmax and c0 are the peak concentration and input concentration respectively and normalised mass recovery of dna tracer relative to nacl rb rb was determined by integrating the btcs of the reactive and nonreactive tracers harvey and garabedian 1991 as follows 3 r b c c 0 d t d n a c c 0 d t n a c l for unbiased mass recovery estimations the same duration was used for the numerical integrations of the dna and salt tracer btcs the rb value reflects the dna tracer s reactivity and an rb of 1 implies that it has the same mass recovery as the salt tracer 2 3 2 groundwater systems the utility of the new dna tracers was investigated in 2 common new zealand groundwater systems that have contrasting aquifer properties and contaminant attenuation capacities these were a coarse alluvial gravel aquifer at the burnham experimental site in the canterbury region of the south island and a well sorted fine coastal sand aquifer at the pauanui experimental site in the waikato region of the north island alluvial gravel aquifer the alluvial gravel aquifer experimental site at burnham is immediately up gradient of a sewage treatment plant the aquifer media are highly heterogeneous and poorly sorted comprising medium to coarse alluvial sandy gravels with silt and clay bands the groundwater s characteristics were na ca hco3 type ph 6 6 7 2 ionic strength 1 2 mm and main temperature 12 c pang et al 2005 there were 22 wells diameter 100 mm and screened at 12 18 m below ground level bgl the main flow line was previously determined and validated using conservative tracers pang et al 1998 and pumping tests dann et al 2008 the groundwater velocities ranged 30 85 m day pang et al 1998 two experiments were conducted at this site experiment 1 was designed to validate the traceability of 20 free dna tracers it was conducted in spring and involved applying groundwater 40 l spiked with the free dna tracers 105 106 copies μl when the encapsulated dna tracers became available experiment 2 was conducted to validate the utility of the encapsulated dna tracers in comparison with the free dna tracers it was performed in summer and involved applying groundwater 40 l spiked with 3 free dna tracers 109 1010 copies μl and 3 encapsulated dna tracers 107 108 copies μl the tracer solutions were injected into an injection well at 14 16 m bgl over 0 5 h using a well packer which was kept inflated throughout the experiments using submersible pumps samples were collected over 3 days from down gradient wells at 21 37 62 and 87 m along the flow line the sampling depths were at 16 m bgl in both experiments the water table was 11 55 m bgl in experiment 1 and 14 9 m bgl in experiment 2 the samples were collected in 0 2 1 l glass bottles chilled transferred to the laboratory within 6 h stored at 4 c and analysed using the qpcr within 2 weeks as numerous salt and dye tracer experiments had been conducted at this site previously neither salt nor dye tracers were used during the experiments to prevent potential negative impacts on the dna tracers to detect salt or dye tracers at 87 m they must be applied at extremely high concentrations for example cl at 44 230 mg l pang et al 1998 br at 6200 mg l and rhodamine wt at 1600 mg l dann et al 2008 these high tracer concentrations would promote aggregation and adsorption of the dna tracers particularly the microencapsulated dna tracers and inhibit their detection using the qpcr in the absence of a solute tracer for comparisons of the relative attenuations of the different dna tracers we used the mass recoveries in the samples relative to their input masses msamples which were calculated from the measured volumes and concentrations of the samples wi ci and the injection solutions w0 c0 as follows 4 m s a m p l e s w i c i w 0 c 0 coastal sand aquifer one experiment was conducted at the pauanui coastal sand aquifer experimental site in early autumn to validate the dna tracers utility in uniform fine coastal sand aquifer the groundwater table was 4 6 m bgl at a gradient of 0 06 towards the beach that was 100 m away monitoring wells groundwater flow velocity 0 19 m day and flow line had been previously established about 20 l of groundwater spiked with 4 free dna tracers 107 108 copies μl and rhodamine wt dye 260 μg l were injected over 0 5 h samples were taken using peristaltic pumps over 24 days from down gradient wells at 0 6 1 5 and 3 m along the flow line the samples were collected in 1 l glass bottles chilled and transferred to the laboratory in christchurch within 3 days and analysed using the qpcr the dye tracer samples were analysed by using a shimadzu rf 1501 spectrofluorimeter with a detection limit of 0 1 μg l 2 3 3 intact soil lysimeter experiments three experiments were conducted in lysimeters 0 7 m long 0 5 m internal diameter containing intact 0 3 m topsoil and 0 4 m sandy gravel vadose zone material the intact soil cores had a mean saturated hydraulic conductivity of 0 27 0 03 m day and a pore volume of 10 l the lysimeters were pre saturated until a steady flow of 100 ml min was achieved automatic irrigators and peristaltic pumps were used to distribute water uniformly over the surfaces experiment 1 was conducted to investigate the traceability of the 20 free dna tracers in soils it was conducted in winter and tap water 9 l spiked with 20 free dna tracers 105 106 copies μl and kbr 30 mg l was injected into a lysimeter the tap water comprised untreated groundwater sourced from an alluvial gravel aquifer the soil leachate s in situ characteristics were temperature 8 c ph 6 0 6 6 and dissolved oxygen do 7 11 mg l the br concentrations were analysed using an ion selective electrode with detection limit of 0 1 mg l experiment 2 was conducted in autumn to examine the reproducibility of the results from the free dna tracers from different lysimeters stream water 9 l lysimeter was applied simultaneously to 3 lysimeters that contained 10 dairy shed effluent 4 free dna tracers 106 107 copies μl and kbr 11 mg l the soil leachate s characteristics were temperature 12 20 c ph 6 2 6 9 do 9 11 mg l and specific conductance spc 101 233 μs cm background 101 131 μs cm to evaluate the reproducibility of the results from the encapsulated dna tracers in different lysimeters experiment 3 was conducted in summer when the encapsulated dna tracers became available stream water 9 l containing 1 encapsulated dna tracer 108 copies μl and nacl 250 mg l was applied to 2 lysimeters the soil leachate s characteristics were temperature 20 23 c ph 5 2 6 7 and spc 101 267 μs cm background 101 106 μs cm nacl concentrations were measured by using a conductivity metre in new zealand farmland soils are commonly irrigated using groundwater stream water and dairy shed effluent thus using different water types in the aforementioned experiments reflects reality during these experiments the solutions containing the tracers 9 l were applied over 1 5 h followed by flushing with tracer free water the leachate samples were collected in 1 l glass bottles for up to 7 h the chilled samples were transferred to the laboratory within 2 h where they were stored at 4 c and analysed within 1 week 3 results and discussion 3 1 dna tracer sequences the new k tracers designed in this study supplementary table s1 had satisfactory calibration curves r2 0 97 1 00 amplification efficiencies 96 110 and limits of detection 5 250 copies per 4 μl qpcr reaction the structures of the k tracers differed from those of the seq tracers pang et al 2017 that were designed using a method that labels the surfaces of protein coated silica nanoparticles to create virus surrogates pang et al 2014 we anticipated that the new 352 bp k tracers would be more stable than the 302 bp seq tracers because they are longer however the 2 sets of tracers had similar zeta potentials k tracers 14 3 1 1 mv 5 samples seq tracers 18 3 7 9 mv 7 samples 3 2 microencapsulated dna tracers and their stability the mean size of the dna chitosan alginate microparticles was on average 14 samples 312 132 nm and a typical yield from their synthesis was 6 11 108 5 9 108 particles ml as determined using the qnano scanning electron microscopy fig 1 showed that most of the microparticles measured a few hundred nanometres and that their morphology was similar to the bsa loaded chitosan alginate particles presented by wang and he 2010 the encapsulated dna tracers were negatively charged with mean 28 samples zeta potentials of 31 2 8 4 mv in 1 mm nacl ph 6 5 and 14 1 1 7 mv in the 0 25 mm cacl2 storage solution ph 5 3 the k and seq tracers had similar zeta potentials when microencapsulated chelex treatment and heating disrupted the dna chitosan alginate microparticles and released the dna tracers into solution for detection chelex treatment did not affect the qpcr analysis of the dna tracers this concurs with the findings of walsh et al 1991 and burkhart et al 2002 who showed that chelex effectively removes qpcr inhibitors during dna isolation procedures when stored in 0 25 mm cacl2 at 4 c the microencapsulated dna tracers were relatively stable regarding their zeta potentials over 11 months fig 2 a and the concentrations of dna able to be released by chelex treatment over 12 months fig 2b however compared with months 0 3 the concentrations of unbound dna in the storage solution during months 10 12 were over 2 orders of magnitude lower suggesting that the dna that had leached from the microparticles had degraded fig 2b the microencapsulated dna tracers were stable in distilled water over 8 days showing only 0 1 log reductions in concentrations but the free dna tracers concentrations reduced by 0 4 log the microencapsulated dna tracers concentrations did not decline fig 3 in stream water λ 0 000 h 1 supplementary table s2 during exposure to natural light dark cycles at 20 c for 96 h however a c c0 1 indicated that some dna tracers leached from the microparticles in contrast the free dna tracers degraded significantly λ 0 118 0 039 h 1 in stream water in the tests involving 5 dairy shed effluent microencapsulated dna tracers degraded more slowly λ 0 005 0 006 h 1 in comparison with the free dna tracers λ 0 241 0 437 h 1 we estimated that a t90 of 17 19 days would be required for a 1 log10 reduction of the microencapsulated dna tracers in 5 raw dairy shed effluent in contrast a t90 of only 0 81 2 47 days and a t90 of 0 22 0 40 days would be required for 1 log10 reductions of the free dna tracers in the stream water and dairy shed effluent respectively these results suggest that microencapsulation effectively protects the dna tracers from degradation by environmental stressors the greater reductions of the dna tracers observed in the effluent samples compared with those in the stream water samples could be explained by the water quality the dairy shed effluent s characteristics were heterotrophic plate count 150 000 colony forming units cfu ml ionic strength 4 7 mm nh3 n 13 9 mg l drp 2 8 mg l and bod5 15 mg l these parameters were much lower in the stream water samples as follows heterotrophic plate count 110 cfu ml ionic strength 1 8 mm nh3 n 0 01 mg l drp 2 8 mg l and bod5 2 mg l 3 3 field traceability 3 3 1 surface stream the free and microencapsulated dna tracers applied were directly detectable in all 3 experiments conducted in the surface stream fig 4 supplementary figs s1 s2 the dna tracers could be traced in the stream for at least 1 km despite pollution of the stream with nitrate and algae the similar peak concentration times observed for most of the salt and dna tracer btcs suggested the flow rates were relatively constant throughout each day of sampling compared with the free dna tracers the microencapsulated dna tracers showed 1 3 log lower reductions in their peak concentrations over the same distances travelled fig 5 and despite their input concentrations were lower than those of the free dna tracers table 1 their mass recoveries relative to nacl were 1 3 orders of magnitude higher especially at greater distances fig 6 hence microencapsulation may have protected the dna tracers from degradation in the surface water environment moreover the microencapsulated dna tracers were more negatively charged 31 2 8 4 mv than the free dna tracers 16 6 6 2 mv because of the presence of the alginate coating which may have reduced adsorption to stream sediments during their transport compared with the free dna tracers the encapsulated dna tracers displayed fewer concentration variations due to the higher concentrations detected fig 4 supplementary figs s1 s2 the btcs and mass recoveries of the microencapsulated k and seq tracers were similar in all 3 experiments fig 4 supplementary figs s1 s2 fig 6 which suggests their performances were primarily determined by the microparticles rather than the dna sequences the microencapsulated dna tracers had underwent little reaction compared with the free dna tracers and the microencapsulated k3 and k9 tracers displayed no reductions relative to nacl rb 1 at 20 60 m distances in experiment 2 fig 6 amongst the free dna tracers the k tracers showed significantly less removal than the seq tracers despite their similar zeta potentials k tracers 14 3 1 1 mv seq tracers 18 3 7 9 mv section 3 1 the mass recoveries of the k tracers were 1 4 orders of magnitude greater than those of the seq tracers fig 6 these differences could be explained by the greater length of the k tracers overall and or the sequence composition contributing to their overall stability or by the different lengths of the flanking regions as described in section 2 1 the non amplified flanking regions of the k tracers are 23 bp longer than those of the seq tracers which may protect the amplified regions from environmental degradation for longer the free seq4 tracer showed the greatest concentration reduction and the low mass recovery and it behaved differently compared with the other tracers fig 5 fig 6 the reasons for this are unclear the k tracers differed distinctly from the seq tracers regarding their environmental degradation profiles and adsorption to environmental matrices these properties will be described in a separate manuscript 3 3 2 groundwater alluvial gravel aquifer testing the dna tracers in an alluvial gravel aquifer demonstrated their potential utility in groundwater conditions that are most vulnerable to contamination the permeable alluvial gravel aquifer media has a poor attenuation capacity and a fast groundwater flow rate in experiment 1 all 20 free dna tracers were directly detectable in the well at 21 m down gradient of the injection well fig 7 in the wells at 37 m and 62 m down gradient some tracers were directly detectable but others were detectable only after concentrating the dna tracers from 300 ml this is not surprising given the low concentrations of the dna tracers injected mostly 105 106 copies μl in the most distant well at 87 m down gradient all the dna tracers except for the seq 4 tracer were detectable after concentrating the dna tracers from 1 l with the exception of the btcs obtained from the well at 21 m fig 7 the btcs obtained from the other wells were not clearly defined data not shown like the results from the surface water experiments the k tracers displayed greater concentration and mass recoveries than the seq tracers in the alluvial gravel groundwater fig 7 the mean peak concentration reductions were 2 0 0 14 log for the 9 k tracers and 2 6 0 19 log for the 11 seq tracers compared with the seq tracers the msamples of the k tracers were about 1 order of magnitude greater in experiment 2 the free dna tracers were directly detectable in all of the down gradient sampling wells at 21 37 62 and 87 m fig 7 shows the dna tracers btcs from the wells at 37 and 87 m the encapsulated dna tracers were only detectable after concentrating the samples from 100 ml and the encapsulated tracers msamples were about 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of the free dna tracers compared with the free dna tracers the larger encapsulated dna tracers are likely to undergo more removal by filtration during their transport in the aquifer media the lower input concentrations of the encapsulated dna tracers 107 108 copies μl compared with those of the free dna tracers 109 1010 copies μl could also explain the lower msamples values the encapsulated dna tracers concentration variations were larger and their btcs were not clearly defined data not shown except for those from the sampling well at 37 m fig 7 previous experiments at this site had been carried out using ms2 bacteriophages bacillus subtilis spores and e coli of which the spore size 0 85 μm wide 1 27 μm long is comparable with that of the encapsulated dna tracer microparticles interestingly at a transport distance of 37 m their concentration reductions log cmax c0 were similar encapsulated dna tracers 4 3 5 5 log b subtilis spores 4 1 4 7 log pang et al 2005 based on the findings from a study by pang et al 1998 and the stability test results section 3 2 neither the degradation of the encapsulated dna nor spore inactivation were expected during the experiments hence filtration was probably the predominant process underlying the removal of dna tracer microparticles and spores in the alluvial gravel aquifer investigated compared with experiment 1 the relative concentrations c c0 of the dna tracers tended to be lower in experiment 2 for the same transport distance the water table in experiment 2 was 3 m lower than that in experiment 1 therefore the aquifer segment tested was thinner this could affect the preferential flow paths and groundwater velocity and thus the attenuation and transport of the dna tracers coastal sand aquifer in contrast to the alluvial gravel aquifer the results from the fine coastal sand aquifer demonstrate the potential utility of the dna tracers in groundwater conditions that provide excellent protection from contamination the groundwater flow rate was extremely low at only 19 cm day at this site the sand media appeared to contain fragments of pumice dann et al 2011 which has a high adsorption capacity for negatively charged particles including dna the dna tracers were detectable supplementary fig s3 but only after they were concentrated from 1 l water samples this was likely due to the very slow flow rate enabling in situ degradation and dna adsorption to the aquifer media the k4 tracer s btcs at 0 5 m and 1 5 m had 2 peaks with higher concentrations in the first peaks which suggests that some of the dna tracer was transported through preferential flow paths again the k tracer concentration reductions were lower than those of the seq tracers and their relative concentrations and mass recoveries were in the order k4 k6 seq2 seq4 in all sampling wells supplementary fig s3 s4 like the results from the other field experiments the seq4 tracer had the lowest traceability 3 3 3 intact soil lysimeter experiments all the dna tracers applied to the intact soil lysimeters were directly detectable in the soil leachates like the surface water and groundwater experiments the k tracers showed lower concentration reductions and greater mass recoveries than the seq tracers fig 8 the k tracers mass recoveries rb were about 4 and 10 times greater than the seq tracers mass recoveries in experiments 1 and 2 respectively despite the physical heterogeneity of the soil lysimeters the results from the soil lysimeter experiments involving the free dna tracers experiment 2 supplementary fig s5 and the encapsulated dna tracers experiment 3 fig 8 were reproducible as expected the dna tracers mass recoveries were mostly 2 4 orders of magnitude lower than those of the salt tracers likely due to adsorption to the soil media and biodegradation compared with the salt tracers the dna tracers showed earlier breakthroughs with less dispersion fig 8 which was probably due to size exclusion associated with colloid transport in heterogeneous media this was observed in our previous lysimeter work pang et al 2017 3 4 dna tracer advantages and disadvantages and future work the findings from our proof of concept field studies demonstrate that numerous dna tracers can be applied concurrently as free molecules or encapsulated within microparticles and tracked in different hydrological environments unlimited numbers of dna tracers each with a unique identifier can be easily developed for this purpose thus dna tracers have a powerful capability to concurrently track multiple contamination sources and pathways and hydraulic connections providing spatially explicit information on complex natural and engineered hydrological systems the multiplexing capacity of dna tracers is many fold greater than that of commonly used traditional water tracers namely cl or br salts and fluorescent dyes which is a key advantage of this technology dna tracers can be detected at extremely low concentrations compared with solute tracers the detection limits of the dna tracers designed in this study were 5 250 copies per 4 μl qpcr reaction which is equivalent to 10 10 10 8 mg l after converting the copy numbers to nanograms http cels uri edu gsc cndna html this is 7 9 orders of magnitude lower than the detection limit of br 0 1 mg l using an ion selective electrode and ion chromatography and 4 6 orders of magnitude lower than the detection limit of rhodamine wt 0 1 μg l using a spectrofluorimeter the chloride tracer s effective detection limit will vary according to their background levels table 1 section 2 3 3 the dna tracers are non toxic and have no genetic functionality and our microencapsulated dna tracers were made of biocompatible and biodegradable biopolymer materials thus they can be used in ecologically sensitive freshwater environments conversely fluorescent dyes and br are toxic at high concentrations to humans and aquatic organisms who 2009 field 2005 a limit of 1 mg l has been proposed for br tracers flury and papritz 1993 and some fluorescent dye tracers field et al 1995 to protect aquatic organisms from their toxicities although cl salt tracers are safe to humans high salinity 1 g l can adversely affect aquatic biota nielsen et al 2003 dna tracers degrade naturally which is another important property thus they will have little environmental impact in contrast most artificial dyes are resistant to degradation in the environment flury and wai 2003 and they can persist for several years in some subsurface media wolkersdorfer and leblanc 2012 however dna tracer degradation as we encountered in the low flow groundwater in the fine coastal aquifer is a disadvantage when conducting long term experiments information on the dna tracers degradation rates will help the design of longer term experiments dna tracer analysis using the qpcr took under 3 h to process 90 samples i e 30 s sample by comparison 2 3 min were required to analyse a rhodamine wt sample using a spectrofluorimeter or a br sample using an ion selective electrode but nacl tracers can be measured rapidly in situ using an electrical conductivity metre successful tracer testing requires a priori hydrogeological knowledge of the site and preliminary information about the transport parameters divine and mcdonnell 2005 this also applies to dna tracer testing further work is needed before dna tracers can be used routinely in large scale field studies our future work will involve reducing the dna tracer preparation time automating sample processing and the pcr and refining tracer detectability in different hydrological matrices furthermore while samples can be collected from the field and analysed in laboratories the rapid detection of dna tracers in the field would be hugely beneficial this will be possible as portable pcr and qpcr devices become increasingly available and is an avenue we are investigating we believe these challenges will be overcome soon and that dna tracer technology has a bright future as new tool that can facilitate hydrological investigations in complex natural environments and engineered systems 4 conclusions our proof of concept studies demonstrated that the dna tracers showed promising results at water tracking in a surface stream a fast flow alluvial gravel aquifer and in permeable alluvial soils they could be tracked for at least 1 km in the stream and 87 m in the gravel aquifer however the results were unsatisfactory in the extremely slow groundwater 19 cm day in the fine coastal sand aquifer probably due to dna tracer degradation and adsorption in the aquifer media during the prolonged experiment 25 days this is the first study to develop microencapsulated dna tracers using alginate and chitosan these naturally occurring biopolymers are biodegradable and biocompatible therefore the microencapsulated dna tracers can be used in ecologically sensitive freshwater environments the microencapsulated dna tracers surface charges and concentrations remained stable during storage for 11 months in the surface water stream the microencapsulated dna tracers concentration reductions were 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of the free dna tracers at 1 km downstream our experimental results suggest that the alginate chitosan microencapsulated dna tracers would be suitable for use in surface water and wastewater environments but they will be subject to filtration removal in subsurface media in contrast the free dna tracers would be suitable for use in subsurface and fast flowing surface water environments but they will degrade rapidly in wastewater environments although dna tracer degradation is a drawback when water tracking is performed over long periods their degradation means that they will have little environmental impact understanding the hydrological environment and selecting appropriate dna tracers will be important when designing investigations involving these tools dna tracers have great potential as tools that can track multiple pollution sources and pathways concurrently in ecologically sensitive freshwater environments but further work is needed before they can be routinely used in large scale studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17707,understanding the behaviour of particulate organic carbon poc with sediment transport allows for a more accurate estimation of global carbon cycling and the conditions of aquatic ecosystems river damming alters poc dynamics profoundly by the retention of sediments on which organic carbon oc is adsorbed in this study we developed a mechanism based approach to investigate organic carbon oc adsorption on river sediment integrating sediment particle properties particle size particle density surface site density and particle morphology and environmental factors dissolved oc concentration ph and suspended sediment concentration we used this approach to assess the poc concentration in the dammed upper yangtze river and to compare it with observed poc values in literature model results and observations correlated very well r2 0 89 nse 0 83 p 0 001 oc adsorption on sediment was found to correlate positively with dissolved organic carbon concentration and negatively with ph and suspended sediment concentration we found that hydroelectric cascade development contributed to a decrease in suspended sediment concentration with a significant increase in poc concentration both at reservoir sites and upstream and downstream the average suspended sediment concentration near the watershed outlet decreased from 2 08 kg m 3 individual reservoir period to 1 57 kg m 3 early stage of reservoir construction operation and then to 0 01 kg m 3 cascade reservoir period in contrast the average poc concentration in the dammed river increased from less than or around 1 to 1 and finally to 3 during each of these three periods respectively our results highlight the pronounced impacts of cascade reservoirs on river sediment and poc dynamics by providing a method for assessing oc adsorption on sediment and the dynamics of poc in aquatic systems this work advances our understanding of carbon cycling in aquatic systems in times of global change graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords particulate organic carbon adsorption soil and sediment properties hydroelectric dam carbon cycle modelling 1 introduction the transport of organic carbon oc from terrestrial to aquatic systems is a key link in the global carbon cycle ludwig et al 1996 cole et al 2007 understanding oc transport and processes that affect oc fate is critical to the assessment of carbon flux from land to the coastal ocean canuel and hardison 2016 based on filter pore size oc is divided into two principal fractions dissolved organic carbon doc 0 2 0 45 0 7 µm and particulate organic carbon poc 0 2 0 45 0 7 µm szymczycha et al 2017 derrien et al 2019 prior research estimated that the oc flux to the global ocean is 300 tgc yr 1 with poc being 140 tgc yr 1 seitzinger et al 2010 sediment is the major carrier of poc in aquatic environments wu et al 2018 the interface between land and ocean is heterogeneous due to diverse sediment transport dynamics and sedimentation conditions bianchi et al 2018 the role of soil erosion and sediment deposition in the carbon balance and whether soil and sediment carbon are sources of or sinks for atmospheric carbon have been debated for a long time harden et al 1999 smith et al 2001 lal 2003 in this context a better insight into the processes of poc transport with sediment is required the quantification of oc adsorption on sediment during surface runoff and river flow is key for assessing the carbon budget across the terrestrial aquatic interface veyssy et al 1998 nonetheless a comprehensive understanding of the poc dynamics during sediment transport from terrestrial to aquatic systems is still lacking earlier workers have used linear non linear freundlich and langmuir isotherms and their revised versions to describe the adsorption of oc on soils and sediments moore et al 1992 kothawala et al 2009 as these studies indicate oc adsorption is influenced by the properties of soil and sediment particles and also by environmental factors boithias et al 2014 qu et al 2020 found that poc in sediment decreases with the sediment s median particle size but increases with its specific surface area ssa interactions between oc and mineral particles are difficult to generalise because sediments can consist of various mineral grains of different physicochemical properties larowe et al 2020 analysis of pure mineral components of natural soils and sediments has been helpful in determining oc adsorption capacity jardine et al 1989 nowadays however the maximum adsorbed oc is mainly identified through batch experiments on soils and sediments vandenbruwane et al 2007 kothawala et al 2009 in addition much work has been done on the effects of environmental factors such as doc concentration ionic strength and ph on the adsorption of oc on clay mineral surfaces shen 1999 perez et al 2011 recently more attention has also been paid to the influence of suspended sediment concentration on pollutant adsorption in aquatic environments huang et al 2017 when the total suspended solids tss are very low oc adsorption onto sediment is high similar to the oc values in autochthonous pools as a result of primary production ludwig et al 1996 at higher tss values oc adsorption on sediment decreases and may drop to values close to the local soil organic content soc fabre et al 2019 this may be because suspended sediment limits in situ oc production by reducing sunlight penetration in the water and by diluting poc ludwig et al 1996 understanding the interaction between oc and sediment particles is particularly important for predicting the behaviour of oc in aquatic systems oc is readily adsorbed onto the surface of fine mineral particles eroded from soils traditional estimates of watershed scale oc transport to water due to soil erosion were mainly based on empirical equations linking the suspended sediment concentration soc and the oc enrichment ratio of the eroded soil starr et al 2000 or on the empirical relationship between the sediment yield and the limited measurements of actual poc oeurng et al 2011 strauch et al 2018 however the disintegration of soil aggregates introduces great uncertainty into the fate of soil oc during erosion yadav and malanson 2009 the amount of poc transported with sediment in surface runoff therefore cannot be accurately estimated through the combined assessment of suspended sediment concentration and oc enrichment furthermore the total poc concentration at the watershed scale is also difficult to identify with accuracy due to the contribution of other oc inputs e g leaves riparian and aquatic plants into water lee et al 2019 to this end modelling the adsorption of oc on sediment during erosion and river transport rather than assessing poc through empirical methods alone can provide better estimates of poc concentration in large rivers at the watershed scale human activities particularly hydroelectric exploitation in large rivers have altered aquatic environments and ecological situations drastically in the past decades sediment retention in dams profoundly affects the suspended sediment load sediment delivery and poc concentration in rivers sadaoui et al 2018 bianchi et al 2020 damming increases the oc input from terrestrial vegetation and soil into water thus influencing greenhouse gas emissions due to organic matter decomposition barros et al 2011 several studies address the problem of organic matter flux in rivers and estuaries downstream of hydroelectric dams zhang et al 2014 sadaoui et al 2018 the yangtze river in china is one of the world s largest rivers with several giant dams in its upper reaches in the yangtze river poc primarily originates from terrestrial sources cauwet and mackenzie 1993 in 2009 the sediment and poc load from the yangtze river to the east china sea were approximately 408 mt yr 1 and 1 52 tgc yr 1 respectively wang et al 2012 with the completion of hydroelectric reservoirs in yangtze s upper reaches the river flow and sediment load changed fang et al 2012 the jinsha river representative of the upper yangtze river has a length of 3 481 km accounting for approximately 77 of the entire upper yangtze river course cascade reservoirs were operational under construction or planned in the jinsha river sediment retention in dam reservoirs is the main cause of the decrease in poc flux in china over the past 60 years liu et al 2020 variations in poc concentration induced by hydroelectric exploitation result in important perturbations in the carbon cycle more work is needed to advance understanding of these phenomena long term poc variation in rivers was generally estimated by empirical models fabre et al 2019 liu et al 2020 however field measurement is rarely an easy task and results from in situ oc adsorption experiments cannot be readily extrapolated to the scale of large watersheds here we present a novel approach for estimating the poc concentration in the dammed upper yangtze river this approach can contribute to the evaluation of the long term poc dynamics in large watersheds the main objectives of this work are to a model the dynamics of oc adsorption on sediment particles through a mechanism based approach b determine the effects of sediment particle properties and environmental factors on oc adsorption and c quantify the poc concentration transported with suspended sediment in the dammed upper yangtze river 2 methodology 2 1 description of the study area the yangtze river the third largest river in the world with the sixth largest flow discharge and the fourth largest sediment load wang et al 2018 is divided into three parts fig 1 its headwater the jinsha river originates at the geladandong snowy mountain on the tibetan plateau the climate in the jinsha river basin varies greatly due to the variable elevation of the basin the upstream basin has a typical highland climate with snowmelt events while the middle and downstream basins are mainly characterised by a subtropical climate with an annual precipitation of around 1 000 mm in jinsha s middle and lower reaches the runoff is 880 108 m3 yr 1 2006 to 2015 and the total sediment load is 85 6 mt yr 1 2002 to 2015 approximately zhang et al 2019 as the main source of yangtze s sediment the jinsha river basin contributes approximately 57 of the sediment load in the upper yangtze river li et al 2018 the jinsha river contains abundant hydropower resources with a potential capacity of about 83 2 million kw and annual power generation of 362 billion kwh wu et al 2020 more than 30 hydropower stations were operational under construction or planned in the jinsha river trunk stream and the yalong river its biggest tributary in 2017 in the cascade of reservoirs events occurring in the upstream reservoirs may significantly impact the events in the downstream ones cunha santino et al 2017 amongst these cascade reservoirs the ertan hydropower station has operated since 1998 four giant hydropower stations wudongde baihetan xiluodu and xiangjiaba with the total installed capacity of 46 5 million kw have been under construction or completed in the lower jinsha river trunk stream since 2011 cascade reservoirs account for about 45 of the sediment load reduction in this river almost 90 of sediment retention is due to the operation of the xiluodu and xiangjiaba hydropower stations since 2013 zhang et al 2019 as a result the poc load transported with sediment in the upper yangtze river has been profoundly impacted by changes in river flow and sediment transport 2 2 estimate of organic carbon adsorption organic carbon adsorption on sediment depends on sediment particle properties that determine the maximum oc adsorption capacity and on environmental factors that influence how much oc can be adsorbed on sediment particles in aquatic environments the equation used to estimate oc adsorption on sediment is thus as follows 1 q e q max f environmental factors where qe is the oc adsorbed on sediment at equilibrium mg g 1 qmax is the oc adsorption capacity of the sediment mg g 1 and f environmental factors is a function of environmental factors the qmax is determined by intrinsic properties of the sediment particles including the particle size distribution particle surface structure and mineralogy qu et al 2020 to describe the properties of the sediment particles we used the comprehensive factor p fang et al 2017 2 p d n s f 2 a n s ρ 2 d 1 85 f 2 a 0 60 where d is the median particle size μm ns is the surface site density site nm 2 for the interaction proton exchange between the sediment particle and oc f 2 a is the weighted average descriptor for sediment particle morphology and ρ is the particle density g cm 3 the relationship between qmax and p is expressed with the following empirical formula that quantifies the effects of mineral sediment particles on maximum oc adsorption fang et al 2017 3 q max f p a p b where a and bare empirical parameters these parameters describe soil and sediment mineral properties the environmental factors affecting oc adsorption on sediment particles generally include the aqueous equilibrium concentration of oc ce ph ionic strength i and the concentration of suspended solids tss considering these environmental parameters as individual functions their combined effect on oc adsorption on sediment particles is expressed as follows 4 f environmental factors f c e f ph f i f tss where f ce f ph f i f tss are the functions of ce ph i and tss respectively moreover the partition coefficient kd has been widely used to characterise the oc adsorption process in water sediment pollutant systems therefore we also introduced this coefficient in our analysis nodvin et al 1986 5 k d q e c e 2 3 determination of adsorption capacity to identify the inherent oc adsorption properties of natural sediment independently of site specificity and environmental influences we used pure samples of the six minerals that make up the bulk of natural sediment in the yangtze river basin quartz potassium feldspar calcite kaolin montmorillonite and hematite these mineral samples were obtained from the national centre of reference material ncrm the particle size of natural sediment was determined using a laser particle size analyser horiba la 920 japan the mineral composition of natural sediments was determined with an x ray diffractometer d max ra japan the specific surface area ssa was obtained through nitrogen gas isothermal adsorption and the brunauer emmett teller bet method brunauer et al 1938 using an asap 2020m system micromeritics usa the weighted average morphological descriptor f 2 a describes the micromorphology raised or sunken microrelief of mineral particles which significantly affect their surface charge distribution and sorption capacity changes in the micromorphology of mineral surfaces influence the specific affinity and local electrostatic forces that affect chemical complexation at reactive surface sites cui et al 2017 taking this into account we recorded the micromorphology of mineral particles using a jeoljsm 6310f scanning electron microscope sem and processed the microscopic images we used matlab 2016 to extract the particles edge profile and applied a mathematical characterisation method based on taylor series expansion to describe the micro morphology characteristics and calculate the morphological descriptor f 2 a details on the f 2 a calculation method are available in cui et al 2017 the particle surface site density ns is affected by the particle s miner composition ns values were obtained from previous studies and were optimised based on oc adsorption data white and zelazny 1988 venema et al 1998 wieland and stumm 1992 natural sediments entering the jinsha river originate from the erosion of soils composed of various minerals hence the f 2 a ns and ρ of natural sediment in the jinsha river basin was determined through the component additivity method davis et al 1998 calculations were based on the properties f 2 a ns and ρ and mass percentage of each mineral species the oc adsorption capacity of sediment transported from terrestrial to aquatic environments is often difficult to measure fine mineral particles can be significantly enriched in oc it has been demonstrated that oc adsorbed on sediment is very closely linked with the clay content of the suspended sediment correlation coefficient 0 718 yu et al 2011 adsorption experiments on typical yangtze river basin soils further indicated that there is a linear relationship between the maximum adsorbed oc and clay content xu and zhao 2017 therefore the qmax of sediments in the jinsha river basin can be estimated from its empirical linear relationship with the clay fraction we estimated the qmax based on measured poc values in the upper yangtze river which ranged from 20 78 when the reservoir water level reached 156 m in the three gorges dam to 0 3 which is close to the lowest soil organic carbon content in the watershed zhang et al 2014 wu et al 2018 a total of 19 main types of soils felty soils dark felty soils and frigid calcic soils etc from which jinsha river sediments are derived occupying 98 62 of the total jinsha river watershed were analysed to identify maximum oc adsorption our analysis focused on the erosion prone top horizons of these soils 0 20 cm sample selection was based on china s soil scientific database and on field survey in the study area chen et al 2005 zhao et al 2018a 2 4 determination of environmental factors to quantify the impact of the oc aqueous equilibrium concentration on oc adsorption f ce we developed an empirical equation based on the classic freundlich and langmuir isotherms and on previous work vandenbruwane et al 2007 6 f c e k e c e m 1 where ke and m 1 are empirical parameters calculated in previous experimental studies shen 1999 vandenbruwane et al 2007 kothawala et al 2009 xu and zhao 2017 the impact of ph on oc adsorption f ph varies across different ph ranges oc adsorption on sediment particles generally increases with increasing ph when ph is lower than 4 5 5 and decreases with increasing ph when ph ranges from 5 to 10 jardine et al 1989 shen 1999 langmuir isotherm calculation of oc adsorption as a function of ph pagnanelli et al 2003 showed that the power function describes the ph impact better than the linear and exponential functions considering the ph range in natural water ph 4 5 and the quantitative relationships between oc adsorption and ph established from observed data huang et al 2016 pagnanelli et al 2003 we proposed the following equation 7 f ph k ph ph m 2 where k ph and m 2 are empirical parameters calculated in previous experimental studies jardine et al 1989 shen 1999 the influence of ionic strength on oc adsorption f i was weak at the ionic strength i 0 001 to 0 1 mol l 1 using nacl considered here jardine et al 1989 nacl of three concentrations 0 3 0 03 and 0 003 mol l 1 were used and the final solution i were 0 1 0 01 and 0 001 mol l 1 respectively jardine et al 1989 thus we assumed that f i 1 finally the influence of suspended sediment f tss was calculated from the following equation based on field observation and adsorption experiments huang et al 2017 8 f tss k tss ts s m 3 where ktss and m 3 were empirical parameters whose values are based on measured sediment concentration changjiang water resources commission cwrc and poc measurements in the yangtze river wu et al 2007 bao et al 2014 wu et al 2018 the following equation clarifies the influence of environmental factors on oc adsorption 9 k d q max f environmental factors c e k c e m 1 1 p h m 2 ts s m 3 where k is a dimensionless parameter of value to be determined a summary of variable names and definitions used in this study is shown in table 1 2 5 observed sediment and poc concentrations in the upper yangtze river the poc

correlation coefficient r and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse these two indicators have been widely used for performance evaluation of watershed hydrologic and water quality model moriasi et al 2015 details of evaluation methods were described by tang and maggi 2018 3 results 3 1 adsorption capacity the mineral properties that affect oc adsorption on natural sediments and soils in the jinsha river basin are listed in table 2 quartz and potassium feldspar are the main mineral components of natural sediments by proportions of different minerals representing natural sediment the weighted average morphological descriptor f 2 a is 0 148 the surface site density ns is 4 51 site nm 2 and the particle density ρ is 2 66 g cm 3 the properties p and qmax of topsoil layers in the jinsha river basin are listed in table 3 the median soil particle size in the jinsha river watershed is hard to constrain to reflect the sediment characteristics at the watershed scale and to reduce calculation errors we estimated the representative median particle size from the textural properties of the top most vulnerable to erosion horizons of the 19 main soil types in the jinsha river basin table 3 we used eq 2 to calculate the properties factor p of sediment originating from erosion of these 19 topsoil types applying the component additivity method davis et al 1998 we calculated the average value of maximum oc adsorption on sediment average qmax in the jinsha river basin at 72 05 mg g 1 the qmax ranged from 2 06 to 20 78 of oc in sediment by weight a linear relationship analysis between p and qmax eq 3 showed that a and b are 291 1 and 1 01 respectively r2 0 71 p 0 001 table 3 this establishes a quantitative relationship between the sediment s oc adsorption capacity and its properties median particle size surface site density morphological descriptor and particle density comprehensively described by p our results demonstrate that the comprehensive factor p can indeed describe a sediment s oc adsorption capacity 3 2 environmental factors first we quantified the effect of the oc aqueous equilibrium concentration ce on oc adsorption the extensive literature on oc adsorption on mineral particles in soils with low humus other organic content and soils sharing similar characteristics with natural sediments in the jinsha river basin was consulted we used a wide range of ce values fig 2 obtained from previous experimental studies shen 1999 vandenbruwane et al 2007 kothawala et al 2009 xu and zhao 2017 and eq 9 the relationship between kd qmax and ce to obtain the parameter m 1 fig 2 as shown in fig 2 there is a close correlation between kd qmax and ce r2 0 82 since m 1 1 0 934 we obtained m 1 0 066 we then quantified the effects of ph on oc adsorption because the previous experiments vandenbruwane et al 2007 xu and zhao 2017 did not include a wide range of ph conditions the relationship between kd qmax ce m 1 1 and ph cannot be used for the identification of m 2 there are few experimental studies that consider both the ce and ph range in controlled experiments therefore we used data from the literature jardine et al 1989 shen 1999 to quantify the impact of ph on oc adsorption fig 3 these earlier results demonstrate that the oc adsorption on sediment particles generally increases with ph increasing from 3 to 4 5 but it decreases rapidly with further increase in ph above the value of 4 5 to some extent this variable effect of ph can also be seen in the relationship between kd qmax ce m 1 1 and ph fig 3 notwithstanding the narrow range of ph values in earlier experiments this pattern was also observed for pure minerals davis and glour 1981 considering the ph range in natural river water ph 4 5 we fitted a power function y a x b in the adsorbed oc and ph values for ph 4 5 fig 3 b ranged from 1 80 to 1 19 table 4 therefore average m 2 1 518 the parameter m 3 and ks 0 for the upper yangtze river were calculated from the empirical relationship between suspended sediment concentration and oc adsorption proposed by huang et al 2017 10 q e 0 k s 0 ts s m 3 where qe 0 is the oc adsorption on sediment particles mg g 1 ks 0 is the empirical parameter by inserting measured sediment concentration and poc values in the upper yangtze river into eq 10 we found that ks 0 2 858 and m 3 0 610 based on calibration and validation results fig s1 the oc adsorbed on sediment particles qe is expressed as follows 11 q e q max k c e m 1 p h m 2 ts s m 3 72 05 k c e 0 066 p h 1 518 ts s 0 610 from eqs 10 and 11 we obtain k 0 879 on average the poc concentration in the upper yangtze river is thus estimated as follows 12 q e 63 34 c e 0 066 p h 1 518 t s s 0 610 3 3 comparison between observations and calculations owing to the geographical location and economic development of the jinsha river basin extensive observed poc doc ph and suspended sediment concentration data were relatively unavailable observed data are also available for the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river based on the measured values of doc ph and suspended sediment concentration the poc concentration for the entire yangtze river was calculated and then compared with the measured poc validation analysis demonstrated a very good model performance based on the r2 and nse r2 0 89 nse 0 83 p 0 001 in the upper yangtze river fig 4 according to the evaluation criteria at the watershed scale suggested by moriasi et al 2015 the r between the calculated and observed poc for the entire yangtze river was 0 78 p 0 001 uncertainty analysis of poc estimate under empirical parameter variations was conducted poc estimates under different parameters were compared with the poc estimate under the identified parameters in eq 12 only one parameter was changed and the other ones were kept constant at a time parameters m 1 m 2 m 3 and k were changed by 20 to 20 with an increment of 5 analysis showed that variations in m 2 caused the greatest uncertainty fig s2 model uncertainty was very low when parameter varied by 5 to 5 0 87 nse 0 99 this analysis validates our poc calculation approach for the upper yangtze river 3 4 variations in suspended sediment concentration the suspended sediment concentration in the upper yangtze river decrease markedly from the period of individual reservoir operation 2007 2011 to the early stage of cascade reservoir construction operation 2012 and further when the cascade reservoir became operational 2015 2016 fig 5 during 2007 2011 the highest suspended sediment concentration was measured at the pingshan station peak value 2 08 kg m 3 the second highest was at the huatan 1 82 kg m 3 fig 5 in 2012 the suspended sediment concentration was high at the shigu luning tributary huatan and xiangjiaba stations nevertheless the suspended sediment concentration in the lower stream was not higher than that in the upper stream fig 5 b the suspended sediment concentration at xianjiaba peaked in september 2012 1 57 kg m 3 during 2015 2016 when the xiluodu and xiangjiaba hydropower stations had become operational the suspended sediment concentration at xiangjiaba was very low average 0 01 kg m 3 the shigu and luning stations which were less affected by the cascade reservoirs had high suspended sediment concentrations 1 45 kg m 3 in july and 1 08 kg m 3 in june on average moreover the panzhihua station although at some distance from the cascade reservoirs also showed a clear decrease in suspended sediment concentration from 0 48 kg m 3 before reservoir construction 2007 2011 to 0 27 kg m 3 in the early stage of reservoir construction operation then to 0 07 kg m 3 during the operation of the cascade reservoir average sediment april november values analysis of variance anova showed that the monthly variance between these three periods was significant in panzhihua and pingshan xiangjiaba by retaining sediment cascade reservoirs had a pronounced impact on the yangtze river system 3 5 variations in poc concentration the effects of dam construction on poc concentration of poc in tss in the dammed upper yangtze river were especially pronounced during the period of cascade reservoir construction and operation fig 6 a marked increase in poc was recorded at the tongzilin xiangjiaba and jinanqiao hydrological stations located near the dam site during the period of individual reservoir operation 2007 2011 the highest poc 3 in december was at tongzilin 18 km from the ertan hydropower station in the middle to lower jinsha river the poc was less than or around 1 at the early stage of cascade reservoir construction operation 2012 the highest poc was recorded at xiangjiaba 5 1 and the second highest at tongzilin 4 the average poc in the middle to lower jinsha river during this period was 1 during the main period of cascade reservoir construction operation 2015 2016 the poc at xiangjiaba average concentration 8 1 was far higher than that in any other area the poc at jinanqiao was also high especially in november and december average concentration 7 1 the average poc in the middle to lower jinsha river during this period was 3 showing that the cascade reservoir operation profoundly altered the oc dynamics in the river system analysis of variance anova showed that the monthly variance in poc between these three periods was significant in panzhihua luning huatan baihetan and pingshan xiangjiaba which indicated that these areas were most affected by the cascade reservoirs 4 discussion 4 1 effects of sediment properties on oc adsorption the oc adsorption capacity and the properties factor p of the 19 main types of soils in the jinsha river basin exhibit a range of values topsoil erosion generally contributed the bulk of sediment input amongst surface and sub surface materials to riverine sediment blair et al 2003 adams et al 2015 the maximum oc adsorption on jinsha river sediment qmax at the watershed scale calculated with an empirical method based on the additivity of observed components falls within the range of global values ludwig et al 1996 previous empirical studies have also suggested that there is a relationship between the clay fraction and the sediment s oc adsorption capacity shen 1999 oren and chefetz 2012 uncertainties notwithstanding our results indicate that the method presented here is effective for estimating the oc adsorption capacity the principal soils in the jinsha river basin felty dark felty and frigid calcic soils are all characterised by a low clay content in their top horizons implying that sediments resulting from erosion of these soils may have an oc adsorption capacity lower than the maximum oc adsorption capacity observed over the entire yangtze river the effects of sediment properties on oc adsorption capacity can be expressed by the comprehensive factor p which integrates median particle size surface site density a morphological descriptor and particle density scanning electron microscopy can provide better insights to the mechanisms of oc adsorption on sediment since changes in sediment type may occur at sub centimetre scale larowe et al 2020 the linear fitting between p and qmax was good highlighting the role of all the above factors in oc adsorption on sediment this also implied that sediment properties that determine the oc adsorption capacity are critical to poc estimates sediment particle size and surface site density are indeed known to exercise important effects on oc adsorption dynamics during sediment transport haering et al 2013 bouchez et al 2014 fang et al 2017 however the impacts of mineral surface morphology on oc adsorption dynamics were seldom explored up to now the oc adsorption capacity of sediments may differ even when their median particle sizes are the same as also observed by huang et al 2016 understanding how changes in the sediment properties alone or in combination affect oc adsorption capacity will improve the evaluating of carbon dynamics in aquatic environments 4 2 effects of environmental factors on oc adsorption in this study we modelled the effects of the oc aqueous equilibrium concentration and ph on oc adsorption on sediments the influence of environmental factors at the water sediment interface on oc adsorption was extensively explored in earlier studies jin et al 2008 this study went further than previous studies vandenbruwane et al 2007 xu and zhao 2017 to explore the combined effects of various environmental factors on oc adsorption dynamics it is known that the effect of ph varies within different ph ranges and that decrease in ph may contribute to the dissolution of oc when ph is less than 5 perez et al 2011 in this study we focused on the natural river environment with ph higher than 4 5 and concluded that the oc adsorbed on sediments decreases as ph increased the suspended sediment concentration which varies widely in aquatic systems was found to be the dominant factor controlling oc adsorption on sediment particles the poc tended to decrease with increasing concentration of suspended sediment this varying pattern was also demonstrated by ludwig et al 1996 at the global scale earlier studies estimated the poc at the watershed scale through empirical methods by considering only soil organic carbon and suspended sediment concentration oeurng et al 2011 boithias et al 2014 fabre et al 2019 however if the multiple factors influencing poc are not taken into account in poc calculations empirical methods may underestimate the poc by a wide margin veyssy et al 1998 the multifactor approach that integrates sediment properties and environmental factors proposed here therefore greatly advances poc estimates in aquatic systems at the watershed scale however this model under predicted poc at higher poc concentrations lower tss concentrations in ct fig 4 this may be because of the variations in tss dynamics maggi and tang 2015 and the activities of phytoplankton and microorganisms therefore this model needs improvement by considering dynamics of suspended matter e g sinking flocculation and resuspension and more environmental and biological ecological factors advective flow of adsorbed oc can be enhanced due to the increasing exposure of suspended matter dynamics to anthropogenic nutrient input tang and maggi 2016 in addition warming temperatures generally lead to increased oc degradation gudasz et al 2010 this increase is closely related to aquatic primary production and microbial activities sunagawa et al 2015 rantala et al 2016 living organisms e g algae microzooplankton drummond et al 2014 tang and maggi 2018 play a critical role in oc fate optimisation of the model developed here is the priority for future research which will make a significant contribution to the literature on carbon cycling in aquatic systems 4 3 impacts of hydroelectric exploitation on the poc concentration the impact of cascade reservoirs on the reduction of suspended sediment in the jinsha river is pronounced although soil and water conservation may account for approximately 35 of the total reduction in suspended sediment concentration zhang et al 2019 cascade hydroelectric exploitation was the dominant reason for this reduction the impacts of hydroelectric exploitation on the aquatic environment at a regional or even global scale are not fully understood vorosmarty et al 2003 in the jinsha river basin reduction in suspended sediment concentration occurred around reservoirs and their nearby areas e g panzhihua and also further downstream at the lower jinsha river and its tributary reservoirs propagate their effect upstream and downstream by constructing the movement and exchange of sediments organic matter and nutrients they impact river biodiversity and the riverine ecosystem grill et al 2019 furthermore cascade reservoirs may contribute to discontinuous fluctuations in sediment properties guo et al 2020 thereby altering riverine oc dynamics the impacts of hydroelectric exploitation especially cascade dams on the aquatic environment therefore warrant deeper investigation cascade reservoirs lead to an increase in poc within tss locally around the reservoirs our results highlighted that hydroelectric exploitation has greatly altered the poc dynamics in the upper yangtze river the poc during the period of cascade reservoir operation was five times higher than that during the period of individual reservoir operation the variation in the poc displayed seasonal characteristics with an increase in the dry period and a decrease in the flood period confirming earlier findings zhang et al 2012 the ph in the river water fluctuated seasonally from about 7 8 to 8 0 but this fluctuation impacted the poc concentration only slightly cascade reservoirs alter the shift between the dissolved and particulate phase of oc and contribute to the decrease in poc fluxes in aquatic environments globally cascade reservoirs are predicted to decrease the total poc delivery to the ocean by 19 by 2030 maavara et al 2017 this can have far reaching impacts on the carbon cycling from rivers to the ocean system which have also been observed in other asian rivers such as the yellow river xia et al 2016 the mekong river zhao et al 2018b and the red river thi et al 2017 since the poc tss dynamics are closely related to hydrological and ecological processes in the aquatic environment derrien et al 2019 the investigation of the impacts of hydroelectric exploitation on aquatic systems calls for a holistic approach at the watershed scale wu et al 2020 5 conclusion a mechanism based approach integrating sediment particle properties particle size particle density surface site density morphological descriptor and environmental factors dissolved organic carbon concentration ph suspended sediment concentration was developed to model the dynamics of organic carbon adsorption on river sediment this approach produced reliable estimates of the particulate organic carbon concentration in the dammed upper yangtze river the observed and calculated particulate organic carbon concentrations correlated very well r2 0 89 nse 0 83 p 0 001 demonstrating the reliability of the proposed model this model enabled us to explore the dynamics of particulate organic carbon transported with sediment in the upper yangtze river cascade reservoirs led to a decrease in suspended sediment concentration and a significant increase in particulate organic carbon concentration in local areas around the reservoirs and the watershed outlet the average particulate organic carbon in tss increased from less than or around 1 during the period of individual reservoir operation to 1 during the early stage of reservoir construction operation and finally to 3 during the period of cascade reservoir operation the impacts of cascade reservoirs on suspended sediment concentration and particulate organic carbon were pronounced in both the reservoir areas and further upstream and downstream the method for estimating particulate organic carbon proposed here can advance research into carbon cycling in aquatic systems in times of global change future work should focus on the optimisation of the model by considering dynamics of suspended matter and more environmental and biological ecological factors

17707,understanding the behaviour of particulate organic carbon poc with sediment transport allows for a more accurate estimation of global carbon cycling and the conditions of aquatic ecosystems river damming alters poc dynamics profoundly by the retention of sediments on which organic carbon oc is adsorbed in this study we developed a mechanism based approach to investigate organic carbon oc adsorption on river sediment integrating sediment particle properties particle size particle density surface site density and particle morphology and environmental factors dissolved oc concentration ph and suspended sediment concentration we used this approach to assess the poc concentration in the dammed upper yangtze river and to compare it with observed poc values in literature model results and observations correlated very well r2 0 89 nse 0 83 p 0 001 oc adsorption on sediment was found to correlate positively with dissolved organic carbon concentration and negatively with ph and suspended sediment concentration we found that hydroelectric cascade development contributed to a decrease in suspended sediment concentration with a significant increase in poc concentration both at reservoir sites and upstream and downstream the average suspended sediment concentration near the watershed outlet decreased from 2 08 kg m 3 individual reservoir period to 1 57 kg m 3 early stage of reservoir construction operation and then to 0 01 kg m 3 cascade reservoir period in contrast the average poc concentration in the dammed river increased from less than or around 1 to 1 and finally to 3 during each of these three periods respectively our results highlight the pronounced impacts of cascade reservoirs on river sediment and poc dynamics by providing a method for assessing oc adsorption on sediment and the dynamics of poc in aquatic systems this work advances our understanding of carbon cycling in aquatic systems in times of global change graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords particulate organic carbon adsorption soil and sediment properties hydroelectric dam carbon cycle modelling 1 introduction the transport of organic carbon oc from terrestrial to aquatic systems is a key link in the global carbon cycle ludwig et al 1996 cole et al 2007 understanding oc transport and processes that affect oc fate is critical to the assessment of carbon flux from land to the coastal ocean canuel and hardison 2016 based on filter pore size oc is divided into two principal fractions dissolved organic carbon doc 0 2 0 45 0 7 µm and particulate organic carbon poc 0 2 0 45 0 7 µm szymczycha et al 2017 derrien et al 2019 prior research estimated that the oc flux to the global ocean is 300 tgc yr 1 with poc being 140 tgc yr 1 seitzinger et al 2010 sediment is the major carrier of poc in aquatic environments wu et al 2018 the interface between land and ocean is heterogeneous due to diverse sediment transport dynamics and sedimentation conditions bianchi et al 2018 the role of soil erosion and sediment deposition in the carbon balance and whether soil and sediment carbon are sources of or sinks for atmospheric carbon have been debated for a long time harden et al 1999 smith et al 2001 lal 2003 in this context a better insight into the processes of poc transport with sediment is required the quantification of oc adsorption on sediment during surface runoff and river flow is key for assessing the carbon budget across the terrestrial aquatic interface veyssy et al 1998 nonetheless a comprehensive understanding of the poc dynamics during sediment transport from terrestrial to aquatic systems is still lacking earlier workers have used linear non linear freundlich and langmuir isotherms and their revised versions to describe the adsorption of oc on soils and sediments moore et al 1992 kothawala et al 2009 as these studies indicate oc adsorption is influenced by the properties of soil and sediment particles and also by environmental factors boithias et al 2014 qu et al 2020 found that poc in sediment decreases with the sediment s median particle size but increases with its specific surface area ssa interactions between oc and mineral particles are difficult to generalise because sediments can consist of various mineral grains of different physicochemical properties larowe et al 2020 analysis of pure mineral components of natural soils and sediments has been helpful in determining oc adsorption capacity jardine et al 1989 nowadays however the maximum adsorbed oc is mainly identified through batch experiments on soils and sediments vandenbruwane et al 2007 kothawala et al 2009 in addition much work has been done on the effects of environmental factors such as doc concentration ionic strength and ph on the adsorption of oc on clay mineral surfaces shen 1999 perez et al 2011 recently more attention has also been paid to the influence of suspended sediment concentration on pollutant adsorption in aquatic environments huang et al 2017 when the total suspended solids tss are very low oc adsorption onto sediment is high similar to the oc values in autochthonous pools as a result of primary production ludwig et al 1996 at higher tss values oc adsorption on sediment decreases and may drop to values close to the local soil organic content soc fabre et al 2019 this may be because suspended sediment limits in situ oc production by reducing sunlight penetration in the water and by diluting poc ludwig et al 1996 understanding the interaction between oc and sediment particles is particularly important for predicting the behaviour of oc in aquatic systems oc is readily adsorbed onto the surface of fine mineral particles eroded from soils traditional estimates of watershed scale oc transport to water due to soil erosion were mainly based on empirical equations linking the suspended sediment concentration soc and the oc enrichment ratio of the eroded soil starr et al 2000 or on the empirical relationship between the sediment yield and the limited measurements of actual poc oeurng et al 2011 strauch et al 2018 however the disintegration of soil aggregates introduces great uncertainty into the fate of soil oc during erosion yadav and malanson 2009 the amount of poc transported with sediment in surface runoff therefore cannot be accurately estimated through the combined assessment of suspended sediment concentration and oc enrichment furthermore the total poc concentration at the watershed scale is also difficult to identify with accuracy due to the contribution of other oc inputs e g leaves riparian and aquatic plants into water lee et al 2019 to this end modelling the adsorption of oc on sediment during erosion and river transport rather than assessing poc through empirical methods alone can provide better estimates of poc concentration in large rivers at the watershed scale human activities particularly hydroelectric exploitation in large rivers have altered aquatic environments and ecological situations drastically in the past decades sediment retention in dams profoundly affects the suspended sediment load sediment delivery and poc concentration in rivers sadaoui et al 2018 bianchi et al 2020 damming increases the oc input from terrestrial vegetation and soil into water thus influencing greenhouse gas emissions due to organic matter decomposition barros et al 2011 several studies address the problem of organic matter flux in rivers and estuaries downstream of hydroelectric dams zhang et al 2014 sadaoui et al 2018 the yangtze river in china is one of the world s largest rivers with several giant dams in its upper reaches in the yangtze river poc primarily originates from terrestrial sources cauwet and mackenzie 1993 in 2009 the sediment and poc load from the yangtze river to the east china sea were approximately 408 mt yr 1 and 1 52 tgc yr 1 respectively wang et al 2012 with the completion of hydroelectric reservoirs in yangtze s upper reaches the river flow and sediment load changed fang et al 2012 the jinsha river representative of the upper yangtze river has a length of 3 481 km accounting for approximately 77 of the entire upper yangtze river course cascade reservoirs were operational under construction or planned in the jinsha river sediment retention in dam reservoirs is the main cause of the decrease in poc flux in china over the past 60 years liu et al 2020 variations in poc concentration induced by hydroelectric exploitation result in important perturbations in the carbon cycle more work is needed to advance understanding of these phenomena long term poc variation in rivers was generally estimated by empirical models fabre et al 2019 liu et al 2020 however field measurement is rarely an easy task and results from in situ oc adsorption experiments cannot be readily extrapolated to the scale of large watersheds here we present a novel approach for estimating the poc concentration in the dammed upper yangtze river this approach can contribute to the evaluation of the long term poc dynamics in large watersheds the main objectives of this work are to a model the dynamics of oc adsorption on sediment particles through a mechanism based approach b determine the effects of sediment particle properties and environmental factors on oc adsorption and c quantify the poc concentration transported with suspended sediment in the dammed upper yangtze river 2 methodology 2 1 description of the study area the yangtze river the third largest river in the world with the sixth largest flow discharge and the fourth largest sediment load wang et al 2018 is divided into three parts fig 1 its headwater the jinsha river originates at the geladandong snowy mountain on the tibetan plateau the climate in the jinsha river basin varies greatly due to the variable elevation of the basin the upstream basin has a typical highland climate with snowmelt events while the middle and downstream basins are mainly characterised by a subtropical climate with an annual precipitation of around 1 000 mm in jinsha s middle and lower reaches the runoff is 880 108 m3 yr 1 2006 to 2015 and the total sediment load is 85 6 mt yr 1 2002 to 2015 approximately zhang et al 2019 as the main source of yangtze s sediment the jinsha river basin contributes approximately 57 of the sediment load in the upper yangtze river li et al 2018 the jinsha river contains abundant hydropower resources with a potential capacity of about 83 2 million kw and annual power generation of 362 billion kwh wu et al 2020 more than 30 hydropower stations were operational under construction or planned in the jinsha river trunk stream and the yalong river its biggest tributary in 2017 in the cascade of reservoirs events occurring in the upstream reservoirs may significantly impact the events in the downstream ones cunha santino et al 2017 amongst these cascade reservoirs the ertan hydropower station has operated since 1998 four giant hydropower stations wudongde baihetan xiluodu and xiangjiaba with the total installed capacity of 46 5 million kw have been under construction or completed in the lower jinsha river trunk stream since 2011 cascade reservoirs account for about 45 of the sediment load reduction in this river almost 90 of sediment retention is due to the operation of the xiluodu and xiangjiaba hydropower stations since 2013 zhang et al 2019 as a result the poc load transported with sediment in the upper yangtze river has been profoundly impacted by changes in river flow and sediment transport 2 2 estimate of organic carbon adsorption organic carbon adsorption on sediment depends on sediment particle properties that determine the maximum oc adsorption capacity and on environmental factors that influence how much oc can be adsorbed on sediment particles in aquatic environments the equation used to estimate oc adsorption on sediment is thus as follows 1 q e q max f environmental factors where qe is the oc adsorbed on sediment at equilibrium mg g 1 qmax is the oc adsorption capacity of the sediment mg g 1 and f environmental factors is a function of environmental factors the qmax is determined by intrinsic properties of the sediment particles including the particle size distribution particle surface structure and mineralogy qu et al 2020 to describe the properties of the sediment particles we used the comprehensive factor p fang et al 2017 2 p d n s f 2 a n s ρ 2 d 1 85 f 2 a 0 60 where d is the median particle size μm ns is the surface site density site nm 2 for the interaction proton exchange between the sediment particle and oc f 2 a is the weighted average descriptor for sediment particle morphology and ρ is the particle density g cm 3 the relationship between qmax and p is expressed with the following empirical formula that quantifies the effects of mineral sediment particles on maximum oc adsorption fang et al 2017 3 q max f p a p b where a and bare empirical parameters these parameters describe soil and sediment mineral properties the environmental factors affecting oc adsorption on sediment particles generally include the aqueous equilibrium concentration of oc ce ph ionic strength i and the concentration of suspended solids tss considering these environmental parameters as individual functions their combined effect on oc adsorption on sediment particles is expressed as follows 4 f environmental factors f c e f ph f i f tss where f ce f ph f i f tss are the functions of ce ph i and tss respectively moreover the partition coefficient kd has been widely used to characterise the oc adsorption process in water sediment pollutant systems therefore we also introduced this coefficient in our analysis nodvin et al 1986 5 k d q e c e 2 3 determination of adsorption capacity to identify the inherent oc adsorption properties of natural sediment independently of site specificity and environmental influences we used pure samples of the six minerals that make up the bulk of natural sediment in the yangtze river basin quartz potassium feldspar calcite kaolin montmorillonite and hematite these mineral samples were obtained from the national centre of reference material ncrm the particle size of natural sediment was determined using a laser particle size analyser horiba la 920 japan the mineral composition of natural sediments was determined with an x ray diffractometer d max ra japan the specific surface area ssa was obtained through nitrogen gas isothermal adsorption and the brunauer emmett teller bet method brunauer et al 1938 using an asap 2020m system micromeritics usa the weighted average morphological descriptor f 2 a describes the micromorphology raised or sunken microrelief of mineral particles which significantly affect their surface charge distribution and sorption capacity changes in the micromorphology of mineral surfaces influence the specific affinity and local electrostatic forces that affect chemical complexation at reactive surface sites cui et al 2017 taking this into account we recorded the micromorphology of mineral particles using a jeoljsm 6310f scanning electron microscope sem and processed the microscopic images we used matlab 2016 to extract the particles edge profile and applied a mathematical characterisation method based on taylor series expansion to describe the micro morphology characteristics and calculate the morphological descriptor f 2 a details on the f 2 a calculation method are available in cui et al 2017 the particle surface site density ns is affected by the particle s miner composition ns values were obtained from previous studies and were optimised based on oc adsorption data white and zelazny 1988 venema et al 1998 wieland and stumm 1992 natural sediments entering the jinsha river originate from the erosion of soils composed of various minerals hence the f 2 a ns and ρ of natural sediment in the jinsha river basin was determined through the component additivity method davis et al 1998 calculations were based on the properties f 2 a ns and ρ and mass percentage of each mineral species the oc adsorption capacity of sediment transported from terrestrial to aquatic environments is often difficult to measure fine mineral particles can be significantly enriched in oc it has been demonstrated that oc adsorbed on sediment is very closely linked with the clay content of the suspended sediment correlation coefficient 0 718 yu et al 2011 adsorption experiments on typical yangtze river basin soils further indicated that there is a linear relationship between the maximum adsorbed oc and clay content xu and zhao 2017 therefore the qmax of sediments in the jinsha river basin can be estimated from its empirical linear relationship with the clay fraction we estimated the qmax based on measured poc values in the upper yangtze river which ranged from 20 78 when the reservoir water level reached 156 m in the three gorges dam to 0 3 which is close to the lowest soil organic carbon content in the watershed zhang et al 2014 wu et al 2018 a total of 19 main types of soils felty soils dark felty soils and frigid calcic soils etc from which jinsha river sediments are derived occupying 98 62 of the total jinsha river watershed were analysed to identify maximum oc adsorption our analysis focused on the erosion prone top horizons of these soils 0 20 cm sample selection was based on china s soil scientific database and on field survey in the study area chen et al 2005 zhao et al 2018a 2 4 determination of environmental factors to quantify the impact of the oc aqueous equilibrium concentration on oc adsorption f ce we developed an empirical equation based on the classic freundlich and langmuir isotherms and on previous work vandenbruwane et al 2007 6 f c e k e c e m 1 where ke and m 1 are empirical parameters calculated in previous experimental studies shen 1999 vandenbruwane et al 2007 kothawala et al 2009 xu and zhao 2017 the impact of ph on oc adsorption f ph varies across different ph ranges oc adsorption on sediment particles generally increases with increasing ph when ph is lower than 4 5 5 and decreases with increasing ph when ph ranges from 5 to 10 jardine et al 1989 shen 1999 langmuir isotherm calculation of oc adsorption as a function of ph pagnanelli et al 2003 showed that the power function describes the ph impact better than the linear and exponential functions considering the ph range in natural water ph 4 5 and the quantitative relationships between oc adsorption and ph established from observed data huang et al 2016 pagnanelli et al 2003 we proposed the following equation 7 f ph k ph ph m 2 where k ph and m 2 are empirical parameters calculated in previous experimental studies jardine et al 1989 shen 1999 the influence of ionic strength on oc adsorption f i was weak at the ionic strength i 0 001 to 0 1 mol l 1 using nacl considered here jardine et al 1989 nacl of three concentrations 0 3 0 03 and 0 003 mol l 1 were used and the final solution i were 0 1 0 01 and 0 001 mol l 1 respectively jardine et al 1989 thus we assumed that f i 1 finally the influence of suspended sediment f tss was calculated from the following equation based on field observation and adsorption experiments huang et al 2017 8 f tss k tss ts s m 3 where ktss and m 3 were empirical parameters whose values are based on measured sediment concentration changjiang water resources commission cwrc and poc measurements in the yangtze river wu et al 2007 bao et al 2014 wu

2003 period three gorges dam engineering development corporation of china and ph measurements in the yangtze river for the 2003 2006 period chen and tu 2008 model performance was evaluated with the correlation coefficient r and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse these two indicators have been widely used for performance evaluation of watershed hydrologic and water quality model moriasi et al 2015 details of evaluation methods were described by tang and maggi 2018 3 results 3 1 adsorption capacity the mineral properties that affect oc adsorption on natural sediments and soils in the jinsha river basin are listed in table 2 quartz and potassium feldspar are the main mineral components of natural sediments by proportions of different minerals representing natural sediment the weighted average morphological descriptor f 2 a is 0 148 the surface site density ns is 4 51 site nm 2 and the particle density ρ is 2 66 g cm 3 the properties p and qmax of topsoil layers in the jinsha river basin are listed in table 3 the median soil particle size in the jinsha river watershed is hard to constrain to reflect the sediment characteristics at the watershed scale and to reduce calculation errors we estimated the representative median particle size from the textural properties of the top most vulnerable to erosion horizons of the 19 main soil types in the jinsha river basin table 3 we used eq 2 to calculate the properties factor p of sediment originating from erosion of these 19 topsoil types applying the component additivity method davis et al 1998 we calculated the average value of maximum oc adsorption on sediment average qmax in the jinsha river basin at 72 05 mg g 1 the qmax ranged from 2 06 to 20 78 of oc in sediment by weight a linear relationship analysis between p and qmax eq 3 showed that a and b are 291 1 and 1 01 respectively r2 0 71 p 0 001 table 3 this establishes a quantitative relationship between the sediment s oc adsorption capacity and its properties median particle size surface site density morphological descriptor and particle density comprehensively described by p our results demonstrate that the comprehensive factor p can indeed describe a sediment s oc adsorption capacity 3 2 environmental factors first we quantified the effect of the oc aqueous equilibrium concentration ce on oc adsorption the extensive literature on oc adsorption on mineral particles in soils with low humus other organic content and soils sharing similar characteristics with natural sediments in the jinsha river basin was consulted we used a wide range of ce values fig 2 obtained from previous experimental studies shen 1999 vandenbruwane et al 2007 kothawala et al 2009 xu and zhao 2017 and eq 9 the relationship between kd qmax and ce to obtain the parameter m 1 fig 2 as shown in fig 2 there is a close correlation between kd qmax and ce r2 0 82 since m 1 1 0 934 we obtained m 1 0 066 we then quantified the effects of ph on oc adsorption because the previous experiments vandenbruwane et al 2007 xu and zhao 2017 did not include a wide range of ph conditions the relationship between kd qmax ce m 1 1 and ph cannot be used for the identification of m 2 there are few experimental studies that consider both the ce and ph range in controlled experiments therefore we used data from the literature jardine et al 1989 shen 1999 to quantify the impact of ph on oc adsorption fig 3 these earlier results demonstrate that the oc adsorption on sediment particles generally increases with ph increasing from 3 to 4 5 but it decreases rapidly with further increase in ph above the value of 4 5 to some extent this variable effect of ph can also be seen in the relationship between kd qmax ce m 1 1 and ph fig 3 notwithstanding the narrow range of ph values in earlier experiments this pattern was also observed for pure minerals davis and glour 1981 considering the ph range in natural river water ph 4 5 we fitted a power function y a x b in the adsorbed oc and ph values for ph 4 5 fig 3 b ranged from 1 80 to 1 19 table 4 therefore average m 2 1 518 the parameter m 3 and ks 0 for the upper yangtze river were calculated from the empirical relationship between suspended sediment concentration and oc adsorption proposed by huang et al 2017 10 q e 0 k s 0 ts s m 3 where qe 0 is the oc adsorption on sediment particles mg g 1 ks 0 is the empirical parameter by inserting measured sediment concentration and poc values in the upper yangtze river into eq 10 we found that ks 0 2 858 and m 3 0 610 based on calibration and validation results fig s1 the oc adsorbed on sediment particles qe is expressed as follows 11 q e q max k c e m 1 p h m 2 ts s m 3 72 05 k c e 0 066 p h 1 518 ts s 0 610 from eqs 10 and 11 we obtain k 0 879 on average the poc concentration in the upper yangtze river is thus estimated as follows 12 q e 63 34 c e 0 066 p h 1 518 t s s 0 610 3 3 comparison between observations and calculations owing to the geographical location and economic development of the jinsha river basin extensive observed poc doc ph and suspended sediment concentration data were relatively unavailable observed data are also available for the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river based on the measured values of doc ph and suspended sediment concentration the poc concentration for the entire yangtze river was calculated and then compared with the measured poc validation analysis demonstrated a very good model performance based on the r2 and nse r2 0 89 nse 0 83 p 0 001 in the upper yangtze river fig 4 according to the evaluation criteria at the watershed scale suggested by moriasi et al 2015 the r between the calculated and observed poc for the entire yangtze river was 0 78 p 0 001 uncertainty analysis of poc estimate under empirical parameter variations was conducted poc estimates under different parameters were compared with the poc estimate under the identified parameters in eq 12 only one parameter was changed and the other ones were kept constant at a time parameters m 1 m 2 m 3 and k were changed by 20 to 20 with an increment of 5 analysis showed that variations in m 2 caused the greatest uncertainty fig s2 model uncertainty was very low when parameter varied by 5 to 5 0 87 nse 0 99 this analysis validates our poc calculation approach for the upper yangtze river 3 4 variations in suspended sediment concentration the suspended sediment concentration in the upper yangtze river decrease markedly from the period of individual reservoir operation 2007 2011 to the early stage of cascade reservoir construction operation 2012 and further when the cascade reservoir became operational 2015 2016 fig 5 during 2007 2011 the highest suspended sediment concentration was measured at the pingshan station peak value 2 08 kg m 3 the second highest was at the huatan 1 82 kg m 3 fig 5 in 2012 the suspended sediment concentration was high at the shigu luning tributary huatan and xiangjiaba stations nevertheless the suspended sediment concentration in the lower stream was not higher than that in the upper stream fig 5 b the suspended sediment concentration at xianjiaba peaked in september 2012 1 57 kg m 3 during 2015 2016 when the xiluodu and xiangjiaba hydropower stations had become operational the suspended sediment concentration at xiangjiaba was very low average 0 01 kg m 3 the shigu and luning stations which were less affected by the cascade reservoirs had high suspended sediment concentrations 1 45 kg m 3 in july and 1 08 kg m 3 in june on average moreover the panzhihua station although at some distance from the cascade reservoirs also showed a clear decrease in suspended sediment concentration from 0 48 kg m 3 before reservoir construction 2007 2011 to 0 27 kg m 3 in the early stage of reservoir construction operation then to 0 07 kg m 3 during the operation of the cascade reservoir average sediment april november values analysis of variance anova showed that the monthly variance between these three periods was significant in panzhihua and pingshan xiangjiaba by retaining sediment cascade reservoirs had a pronounced impact on the yangtze river system 3 5 variations in poc concentration the effects of dam construction on poc concentration of poc in tss in the dammed upper yangtze river were especially pronounced during the period of cascade reservoir construction and operation fig 6 a marked increase in poc was recorded at the tongzilin xiangjiaba and jinanqiao hydrological stations located near the dam site during the period of individual reservoir operation 2007 2011 the highest poc 3 in december was at tongzilin 18 km from the ertan hydropower station in the middle to lower jinsha river the poc was less than or around 1 at the early stage of cascade reservoir construction operation 2012 the highest poc was recorded at xiangjiaba 5 1 and the second highest at tongzilin 4 the average poc in the middle to lower jinsha river during this period was 1 during the main period of cascade reservoir construction operation 2015 2016 the poc at xiangjiaba average concentration 8 1 was far higher than that in any other area the poc at jinanqiao was also high especially in november and december average concentration 7 1 the average poc in the middle to lower jinsha river during this period was 3 showing that the cascade reservoir operation profoundly altered the oc dynamics in the river system analysis of variance anova showed that the monthly variance in poc between these three periods was significant in panzhihua luning huatan baihetan and pingshan xiangjiaba which indicated that these areas were most affected by the cascade reservoirs 4 discussion 4 1 effects of sediment properties on oc adsorption the oc adsorption capacity and the properties factor p of the 19 main types of soils in the jinsha river basin exhibit a range of values topsoil erosion generally contributed the bulk of sediment input amongst surface and sub surface materials to riverine sediment blair et al 2003 adams et al 2015 the maximum oc adsorption on jinsha river sediment qmax at the watershed scale calculated with an empirical method based on the additivity of observed components falls within the range of global values ludwig et al 1996 previous empirical studies have also suggested that there is a relationship between the clay fraction and the sediment s oc adsorption capacity shen 1999 oren and chefetz 2012 uncertainties notwithstanding our results indicate that the method presented here is effective for estimating the oc adsorption capacity the principal soils in the jinsha river basin felty dark felty and frigid calcic soils are all characterised by a low clay content in their top horizons implying that sediments resulting from erosion of these soils may have an oc adsorption capacity lower than the maximum oc adsorption capacity observed over the entire yangtze river the effects of sediment properties on oc adsorption capacity can be expressed by the comprehensive factor p which integrates median particle size surface site density a morphological descriptor and particle density scanning electron microscopy can provide better insights to the mechanisms of oc adsorption on sediment since changes in sediment type may occur at sub centimetre scale larowe et al 2020 the linear fitting between p and qmax was good highlighting the role of all the above factors in oc adsorption on sediment this also implied that sediment properties that determine the oc adsorption capacity are critical to poc estimates sediment particle size and surface site density are indeed known to exercise important effects on oc adsorption dynamics during sediment transport haering et al 2013 bouchez et al 2014 fang et al 2017 however the impacts of mineral surface morphology on oc adsorption dynamics were seldom explored up to now the oc adsorption capacity of sediments may differ even when their median particle sizes are the same as also observed by huang et al 2016 understanding how changes in the sediment properties alone or in combination affect oc adsorption capacity will improve the evaluating of carbon dynamics in aquatic environments 4 2 effects of environmental factors on oc adsorption in this study we modelled the effects of the oc aqueous equilibrium concentration and ph on oc adsorption on sediments the influence of environmental factors at the water sediment interface on oc adsorption was extensively explored in earlier studies jin et al 2008 this study went further than previous studies vandenbruwane et al 2007 xu and zhao 2017 to explore the combined effects of various environmental factors on oc adsorption dynamics it is known that the effect of ph varies within different ph ranges and that decrease in ph may contribute to the dissolution of oc when ph is less than 5 perez et al 2011 in this study we focused on the natural river environment with ph higher than 4 5 and concluded that the oc adsorbed on sediments decreases as ph increased the suspended sediment concentration which varies widely in aquatic systems was found to be the dominant factor controlling oc adsorption on sediment particles the poc tended to decrease with increasing concentration of suspended sediment this varying pattern was also demonstrated by ludwig et al 1996 at the global scale earlier studies estimated the poc at the watershed scale through empirical methods by considering only soil organic carbon and suspended sediment concentration oeurng et al 2011 boithias et al 2014 fabre et al 2019 however if the multiple factors influencing poc are not taken into account in poc calculations empirical methods may underestimate the poc by a wide margin veyssy et al 1998 the multifactor approach that integrates sediment properties and environmental factors proposed here therefore greatly advances poc estimates in aquatic systems at the watershed scale however this model under predicted poc at higher poc concentrations lower tss concentrations in ct fig 4 this may be because of the variations in tss dynamics maggi and tang 2015 and the activities of phytoplankton and microorganisms therefore this model needs improvement by considering dynamics of suspended matter e g sinking flocculation and resuspension and more environmental and biological ecological factors advective flow of adsorbed oc can be enhanced due to the increasing exposure of suspended matter dynamics to anthropogenic nutrient input tang and maggi 2016 in addition warming temperatures generally lead to increased oc degradation gudasz et al 2010 this increase is closely related to aquatic primary production and microbial activities sunagawa et al 2015 rantala et al 2016 living organisms e g algae microzooplankton drummond et al 2014 tang and maggi 2018 play a critical role in oc fate optimisation of the model developed here is the priority for future research which will make a significant contribution to the literature on carbon cycling in aquatic systems 4 3 impacts of hydroelectric exploitation on the poc concentration the impact of cascade reservoirs on the reduction of suspended sediment in the jinsha river is pronounced although soil and water conservation may account for approximately 35 of the total reduction in suspended sediment concentration zhang et al 2019 cascade hydroelectric exploitation was the dominant reason for this reduction the impacts of hydroelectric exploitation on the aquatic environment at a regional or even global scale are not fully understood vorosmarty et al 2003 in the jinsha river basin reduction in suspended sediment concentration occurred around reservoirs and their nearby areas e g panzhihua and also further downstream at the lower jinsha river and its tributary reservoirs propagate their effect upstream and downstream by constructing the movement and exchange of sediments organic matter and nutrients they impact river biodiversity and the riverine ecosystem grill et al 2019 furthermore cascade reservoirs may contribute to discontinuous fluctuations in sediment properties guo et al 2020 thereby altering riverine oc dynamics the impacts of hydroelectric exploitation especially cascade dams on the aquatic environment therefore warrant deeper investigation cascade reservoirs lead to an increase in poc within tss locally around the reservoirs our results highlighted that hydroelectric exploitation has greatly altered the poc dynamics in the upper yangtze river the poc during the period of cascade reservoir operation was five times higher than that during the period of individual reservoir operation the variation in the poc displayed seasonal characteristics with an increase in the dry period and a decrease in the flood period confirming earlier findings zhang et al 2012 the ph in the river water fluctuated seasonally from about 7 8 to 8 0 but this fluctuation impacted the poc concentration only slightly cascade reservoirs alter the shift between the dissolved and particulate phase of oc and contribute to the decrease in poc fluxes in aquatic environments globally cascade reservoirs are predicted to decrease the total poc delivery to the ocean by 19 by 2030 maavara et al 2017 this can have far reaching impacts on the carbon cycling from rivers to the ocean system which have also been observed in other asian rivers such as the yellow river xia et al 2016 the mekong river zhao et al 2018b and the red river thi et al 2017 since the poc tss dynamics are closely related to hydrological and ecological processes in the aquatic environment derrien et al 2019 the investigation of the impacts of hydroelectric exploitation on aquatic systems calls for a holistic approach at the watershed scale wu et al 2020 5 conclusion a mechanism based approach integrating sediment particle properties particle size particle density surface site density morphological descriptor and environmental factors dissolved organic carbon concentration ph suspended sediment concentration was developed to model the dynamics of organic carbon adsorption on river sediment this approach produced reliable estimates of the particulate organic carbon concentration in the dammed upper yangtze river the observed and calculated particulate organic carbon concentrations correlated very well r2 0 89 nse 0 83 p 0 001 demonstrating the reliability of the proposed model this model enabled us to explore the dynamics of particulate organic carbon transported with sediment in the upper yangtze river cascade reservoirs led to a decrease in suspended sediment concentration and a significant increase in particulate organic carbon concentration in local areas around the reservoirs and the watershed outlet the average particulate organic carbon in tss increased from less than or around 1 during the period of individual reservoir operation to 1 during the early stage of reservoir construction operation and finally to 3 during the period of cascade reservoir operation the impacts of cascade reservoirs on suspended sediment concentration and particulate organic carbon were pronounced in both the reservoir areas and further upstream and downstream the method for estimating particulate organic carbon proposed here can advance research into carbon cycling in aquatic systems in times of global change future work should focus on the optimisation of the model by considering dynamics of suspended matter and more environmental and biological ecological factors

17708,the efficiency of a new advanced oxidation process aop namely the photo fenton like process uv c h2o2 ids cu in removing determinants of antibiotic resistance and pathogenic bacteria was compared to a consolidated aop namely uv c h2o2 in a secondary treated municipal wastewater ww a reductionist experimental laboratory based approach was applied on real ww and the parameters were

composition 16s rrna amplicon sequencing and the abundances of antibiotic resistance genes args and of the class 1 integron inti1 gene by quantitative pcr the same approach was applied also to post treatment regrowth tests 24 h to define the potential persistence of the tested parameters these experiments were performed in both human pathogens favorable conditions hpc in rich medium and 37 c and in environmental mimicking conditions emc original ww and 20 c uv c h2o2 ids cu process resulted to be more effective than the uv c h2o2in inactivating bacterial cells in the emc post treatment regrowth experiments both aops were efficiently abating potential human pathogenic bacteria and args in the hpc regrowth experiments although this trend could not be detected in the measurements taken immediately after the disinfection in comparison with the uv c h2o2 the uv c h2o2 ids cu process did not apparently offer significant improvements in the abatement of the tested parameters in the ww effluent but by evaluating the results of the regrowth experiments it was possible to extrapolate more complex trends suggesting contrasting efficiencies visible only after a few hours this study offers a detailed view on the abatement efficiency of microbiological genetic parameters for the uv c h2o2 ids cu process calling for technical adjustments for this very promising technology at the same time our results clearly demonstrated the inadequacy of currently applied methodologies in the evaluation of specific parameters e g determinants of antibiotic resistance and pathogenic bacteria in ww graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic resistance bacterial regrowth photo fenton like wastewater disinfection water reuse 1 introduction municipal wastewater treatment plants mwwtps are widely recognized as a main hotspot for the spread of putative pathogenic bacteria possibly antibiotic resistant arb and or of antibiotic resistance genes args into the environment representing one of the main point sources of pollution for the aquatic environment and through waters to soils and crops berendonk et al 2015 zammit et al 2020 because they are not designed for the abatement of arb args krzeminski et al 2019 rizzo et al 2019 the treatment step devoted to the reduction of fecal bacteria fb is when present disinfection which is however designed to inactivate coliforms e g e coli only not considering the impact of the treatment on the whole pathobiota the community of pathogens here resized as potential human pathogenic bacteria only lasa et al 2019 nor on the arg content of the treated bacterial community indeed the efficacy of a disinfection treatment has so far mainly been investigated by enumeration of the fb and or arb abundances by cultivation approach aguas et al 2019 fiorentino et al 2018 turolla et al 2017 in some studies the overall bacterial community in the final effluent has been analyzed in terms of cell abundance and composition alexander et al 2016 only a very few seminal studies have approached regrowth experiments to test the potential of putative pathogenic bacteria and or arb args to survive or to proliferate after the treatments di cesare et al 2016b fiorentino et al 2015 the results of the regrowth experiments very often did not confirm the evidences from the measurements in the final effluent offering completely different scenarios especially when in the final treatment the solely measured parameter was the e coli colonies abundance thus on the one hand there is the need to find effective disinfection methods for the abatement of both the whole pathobiota and the args and on the other hand there is the need to apply updated technologies and alternative methodologies to test the efficacy of the different tertiary processes i e disinfection in the last years photo driven advanced oxidation processes aops have been increasingly investigated to improve disinfection performances compared to conventional systems rizzo et al 2020 among aops the photo fenton based process uv c fe h2o2 is a promising option for tertiary treatment of municipal ww because in addition to successfully inactivate a wide range of microorganisms it is also effective in the abatement of the contaminants of emerging concern typically detected in mwwtps giannakis 2018 ioannou ttofa et al 2019 generally making the effluents safer even for a possible reuse for crops irrigation rizzo et al 2020 however its application at full scale has not been a feasible attractive option so far because acidic ph operating conditions are requested to achieve an effective process possible solutions to overcome such limitation and make the process effective even under neutral ph conditions typical for municipal ww include i the addition of chelating agents that can form complexes with metals used to promote fenton reaction clarizia et al 2017 and ii the synthesis of metal organic complexes fiorentino et al 2018 both preventing metal precipitation at neutral ph as the effect of aops on antibiotic resistance is of concern the scientific literature has mainly focused on the effect of such processes on specific arb strains and specific args showing contrasting results alexander et al 2016 fiorentino et al 2019 giannakis et al 2018 guo et al 2017 iakovides et al 2019 and therefore calling for further studies to better elucidate process efficiency as well as possible mechanisms in our previous work a new photo fenton like process uv c h2o2 ids cu using iminodisuccinic acid ids cu complex as catalyst was investigated in the degradation of a model organic compound phenol as well as compared to conventional photo fenton in terms of e coli inactivation at natural ph in real municipal ww fiorentino et al 2018 while the best disinfection performance in the inactivation of e coli was observed for the different photo fenton processes investigated with a complete inactivation 3 5 log units achieved within 20 min treatment the investigated processes only partially inactivated the whole bacterial community 40 for uv c h2o2 ids cu according to flow cytometry measurements remarking how traditional cultivation method approach targeting only one bacterial family is at least questionable when evaluating disinfection process efficiency thanks to the encouraging results observed the effect of this new photo fenton process on antibiotic resistance was investigated in the present work using a consolidated photo driven aop namely uv c h2o2 as benchmark rizzo et al 2019 process efficiency was compared in terms of i reduction of the total bacterial abundance and of ii fitness of the surviving bacterial community measured by flow cytometry iii relative abundance of potential human pathogenic bacteria by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and iv of arg dynamics by qpcr assays all the above mentioned parameters were analyzed in untreated and treated ww moreover to get a complete overview of the efficacy of the tested disinfection processes the experimental design also included the simulation of a 24 h regrowth of the microbial community in the treated ww in environmental mimicking emc at 20 c without any addition and human pathogens favorable hpc at 37 c in a rich medium lb broth conditions supplementary material file figure s1 emc aims to simulate bacterial regrowth into environmentally relevant conditions while hpc aims to simulate possible regrowth of fb in humans to take into account a scenario where humans body come into contact with pathogens following the ingestion of crops irrigated with contaminated wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater sample secondary treated ww samples were taken just before disinfection at the mwwtp located in verbania details about the mwwtp are

material file table s1 2 2 experimental design ww sample was divided in three triplicate series of flasks 150 ml ww per flask one set of flasks was kept untreated as negative control nd the second one

in with 150 ml ww samples were placed at 20 cm from the uv c lamp 16 w sankyo denky g10t5l japan the light intensity of the lamp 4 9 mw cm 2 was measured by a radiometer model hr 2000 ocean optics

residual cu concentration below the limit set by the italian regulation for mwwtps effluent reuse 1 mg l 1 cu ids complex was prepared according to the procedure explained in our previous work fiorentino et al 2018 the exposure time during disinfection tests was set to 25 min this time was selected as a compromise among experimental needs results from previous experiments fiorentino et al 2018 and realistic conditions for possible full scale applications the disinfection efficiency of the investigated processes was evaluated immediately after the treatment t1 and through post treatment regrowth tests two different regrowth tests were performed incubation for 24 h under dark conditions of post treatment ww samples i at 20 c without lb t24 to simulate environmentally mimicking conditions emc and ii at 37 c with lb t24 lb to simulate human pathogens favorable conditions hpc total bacterial number and the proportion between dead damaged cells and total bacterial number were assessed by flow cytometry using a previously described protocol di cesare et al 2016a to prevent any possible effect of residual h2o2 on microorganisms over time from sampling to microbiological and

gene inti1 and 16srrna gene by qpcr using protocols and programs described in our previous work di cesare et al 2016b in particular teta gene providing resistance against tetracycline qnrs against quinolones and sul2 against sulphonamides were selected as target args because typically detected in mwwtps effluents cacace et al 2019 krzeminski et al 2019 and abundant in previously analyzed ww

carried out by the dilution method as previously described di cesare et al 2013 and no inhibition was observed but for the samples of dna extracted from lb after good growing experimental condition a maximum of 2 threshold cycle of inhibition was determined and thus only these samples of dna were twenty fold diluted the conversion of the concentration from ng reaction 1 to copy reaction 1 for each

processes supplementary table s10 fig 3 4 discussion in our work we evaluated the efficiency of two aops in contrasting the spread of determinants of antibiotic resistance and of putative human pathogenic bacteria through an integrated approach aimed to simultaneously investigate different parameters by concomitantly apply more analytical approaches to test for i total bacterial number and ii fitness of the overall bacterial community through flow cytometry iii relative abundance of potential human pathogenic bacteria through 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and iv args and class 1 integron abundaces by qpcr moreover the analysis of these parameters in the final effluent was then compared to those measured after a 24 h incubation in hpc and emc to evaluate the potential regrowth of bacteria genes not suitable for the analyses directly performed on the effluent our results are consistent with the scientific literature when full scale or simulated real conditions were investigated using conventional chlorination uv radiation or peracetic acid or alternative aops disinfection processes indeed in some studies it was observed that classical chemical disinfectants i e chlorination and or peracetic acid selected for args di cesare et al 2016b jia et al 2015 liu et al 2018 while a limited effect was observed when uv disinfection mckinney and pruden 2012 and uv h2o2 ferro et al 2016 were applied however the degradation of args was also observed in previous laboratory based works with not real ww guo et al 2017 hu et al 2019 leading to the hypothesis that the complexity of aqueous matrices can drastically change the effect of the investigated process on antibiotic resistance due to different interfering factors e g organic matter occurrence of radical scavengers suspended solids photo sensitive compounds etc lado ribeiro et al 2019 as the treated ww are released into the environment or reused for crop irrigation they stand local environmental parameters ecological physical chemical atmospheric characterized by a huge variability exercising a strong control on the survival regrowth of the bacterial community of the final effluent or of parts of it fiorentino et al 2015 giannakis et al 2016a this has indeed a further impact on the potential transfer of antibiotic resistance through water soil and plants alygizakis et al 2020 cerqueira et al 2019 fortunato et al 2018 marano et al 2019 therefore when the effect of aops on the microbial community and on the selected args and class 1 integron was investigated after a period of regrowth t24 significant differences were observed in comparison to the conditions detected just after the treatment t1 noteworthy almost all the tested args and the class 1 integron were less abundant in the treated ww if compared with the untreated ww in hpc t24 lb fig 1 in order to explain the differences observed among t1 t24 and t24 lb conditions in treated and untreated ww we should consider that disinfection by reactive oxygen species garcía fernández et al 2012 and or uv light holloman et al 2007 damages microbial dna inactivating but not destroying the bacterial cells that are generally still accounted as units in the total bacterial number hpc t24 lb growth conditions were also more favorable than emc t24 because of nutrients addition and higher temperature furthermore some damaged and not viable bacterial cells are collected on the filters for dna extraction this bias hampers the evaluation of the effect of disinfection on arg abundances by detecting persisting bacterial genotypes when analyzed by a cultivation independent approach therefore regrowth experiments become fundamental as they can evaluate the survival rates of the overall bacterial community of specific species or populations and of genes e g args from the original effluent and characterize the risk of antibiotic resistance transfer especially when wastewater are stored before reuse for crop irrigation the results achieved by both aops investigated in terms of bacterial abundance fig 2a in the final effluent just after the tertiary treatment t1 show that cultivation method approach can overestimate disinfection process efficiency as matter of fact these results are consistent with our previous work where the effect of uv c h2o2 ids cu was compared with other aops and uv c disinfection in terms of both e coli evaluated through cultivation method and whole bacterial community evaluated through flow cytometry inactivation fiorentino et al 2018 while the best disinfection performance in the inactivation of e coli was observed for the three different aops investigated with a complete inactivation 3 5 log units achieved within 20 min treatment all the investigated processes only partially inactivated the whole bacterial community from 18 for uv c to 40 for uv c h2o2 ids cu according to flow cytometry measurements moreover cu based photo fenton processes resulted in the higher percentage of inactivated total cells and as h2o2 dose was decreased uv c h2o2 cu ids was more effective than uv c h2o2 cu process this poor efficiency of aops in terms of reducing the total bacterial cell numbers is consistent with the constant number of detected args and of class 1 integron in the same conditions t1 fig 1 suggesting that the treatment process was not enough intensive to degrade genetic material looking at the effects of the two tested aops on the status of bacteria intact dead cells only uv c h2o2 ids cu treatment was effective resulting in an increase of the proportion of dead total bacterial cells in emc t24 fig 2b according to what was previously observed for the disinfection with peracetic acid di cesare et al 2016b as the effect of the investigated aops on the whole bacterial community is of concern the biggest differences were observed in hpc t24 lb fig 3 this is possibly due to the strong bottleneck effect introduced by dilution of the original sample in the rich medium allowing for the fast growth of different opportunistic bacteria comparing the bacterial community in terms of relative abundance of putative human pathogenic bacteria immediately after disinfection in treated ww respect to the untreated one t1 pseudomonas spp or pantoea spp resulted significantly higher fig 3 this result is in agreement with previous works where different disinfection treatments i e ozonation or chlorination caused a selection of putative pathogenic bacteria like pseudomonas aeruginosa alexander et al 2016 or mycobacterium tuberculosis kumaraswamy et al 2014 furthermore both aops were not effective in the removal of putative pathogenic bacteria in emc t24 and in particular uv c h2o2 ids cu selected for acinetobacter spp fig 3 however in hpc t24 lb several putative pathogenic bacteria resulted less abundant in treated ww than those measured in untreated ww in particular bacteroides spp and proteus spp were significantly less abundant in treated ww regardless of the tested treatment if compared with the untreated one bacteroides spp are gram negative bacteria normally beneficial for humans when confined in the gut but significantly dangerous if outside causing abscess in several body sites wexler 2007 proteus spp are gram negative bacteria considered as commensals in human gut but also recognized as urinary tract infection agents and recently identified as potential pathogens in crohn s disease hamilton et al 2018 this highlights unequivocally that both aops are good disinfectants in this respect uv c h2o2 process was more effective than uv c h2o2 ids cu to reduce the relative abundance of args and potential pathogenic bacteria i e aeromonas spp escherichia shighella spp but less effective in reducing the total alive intact cells bacteria the inactivation mechanisms of bacterial cells by the investigated processes are those related to the action of the radical species forming during aops mainly hydroxyl radical ho cho et al 2004 dalrymple et al 2010 giannakis et al 2016b cu and cu2 cupper oxidation states react with h2o2 eqs 1 and 2 in the same way of fe2 h2o2 and fe3 h2o2 reaction systems respectively bokare and choi 2014 1 cu2 h2o2 cu ho2 oh k 4 6 102 m 1 s 1 2 cu h2o2 cu2 ho ho k 1 0 104 m 1 s 1 in addition to radicals effect a contribution from cu is also expected although the measured residual cu 0 6 mg l 1 is under the limit of 1 mg l 1 set by the italian regulation for wastewater reuse dm 93 2006 it is however in a sufficient concentration to exert from one hand a toxic effect on bacterial growth or survival zhao et al 2013 and on the other hand a selective pressure on copper tolerant pathogenic bacteria jeanvoine et al 2019 the cu reduction under the investigated reaction conditions has been attributed to the bio degradability of the cu ids complex 55 5 and its photo degradation mediated by uv c radiation for cu ii iminodiacetate mailhot et al 1995 in this way the cu is released by the cu ids complex and precipitated as cu oh 2 at the observed ph of 7 5 moreover other possible simultaneous interactive processes could affect the inactivation of the whole bacterial community as matter of fact just uv c radiation can inactivate bacterial cells through uv induced damages such as the formation of pyrimidine dimers in their dna which can prevent its replication hijnen et al 2006 in our previous work the contribution of uv c radiation to bacterial cells inactivation evaluated through flow cytometry was significant 18 compared to that one observed for uv c h2o2 ids cu process 40 fiorentino et al 2018 a contribution from h2o2 can also be expected 25 mg h2o2 l 1 resulted in 25 bacterial community inactivation in absence of uv c radiation fiorentino et al 2018 the inactivation of bacterial cells by h2o2 can take place through an external action where h2o2 reacts probably directly with the cellular membrane thus increasing its permeability and allowing higher concentrations of h2o2 to get in and finally affecting the viability of the cell giannakis et al 2016b an internal inactivation action can also take place into bacterial cells through an internal fenton process due to the simultaneous occurrence of metals namely fe and cu and h2o2 giannakis et al 2016b the composition of the wastewater also affects disinfection process the h2o2 purposely added to start uv c h2o2 ids cu and uv c h2o2 processes respectively will be partially consumed through reactions will take place with organic matter metals nitrogen compounds etc typically occurring in real wastewater for example dissolved organic matter dom can act as hydroxyl radicals scavenger according to the eq 3 3 dom ho dom ox oh taking into account that a significant part of the cod and bod5 measured in the samples used for the experiments table s1 is dom a scavenging effect possibly took place in our tests this effect is also expected in the presence of bi carbonates in the aqueous matrix rubio et al 2013 4 ho hco 3 co 3 h2o 5 ho co2 3 co 3 oh in addition bi carbonates also offer protection to bacterial cells from disinfection process giannakis et al 2016b however although scavenged by different components occurring in real aqueous matrices ho can also be produced through the reaction of other components with uv radiation that is the case of nitrite and nitrate typically occurring in wastewater table s1 which form ho according to the following reactions giannakis et al 2016b 6 no 3 h hv ho no2 7 no 3 h2o hv ho no 2 oh 8 no 2 h2o hv ho no oh 5 conclusions the uv c h2o2 ids cu process was found to be even more efficient than other aops uv c radiation and h2o2 in the inactivation of e coli according to our previous work fiorentino et al 2018 thus making the effluent in compliance with e coli standards set at national and international level for ww disposal or reuse however the integrated approach used in this work to evaluate the disinfection efficiency of two aops in real urban ww emphasized that the traditional monitoring through cultivation method targeting only one bacterial family in a single time space point the final effluent is not a suitable approach to monitor the efficiency of disinfection processes when emerging challenges such as the spread of antibiotic resistance should be addressed the results explained and discussed herein depended on the evaluation parameter cells abundance dead cells vs args vs putative human pathogenic bacteria and the simulated conditions after treatment vs emc vs hpc uv c h2o2 ids cu process was more effective than uv c h2o2 in terms of reduction of alive bacterial cells on the other hand uv c h2o2 process was more effective in decreasing the relative abundances of inti1 and teta in hpc moreover both aops were not effective in the removal of putative pathogenic bacteria in emc while they were both effective in the inactivation of some bacterial groups e g bacteroides spp and proteus spp in hpc these results show that uv c h2o2 ids cu process is worthy of further investigation to evaluate its efficiency under more intensive operational conditions in conclusion the evaluation of disinfection process efficiency is a task worthy of a more complete and exhaustive approach where cultivation method should be complemented with the above discussed methods flow cytometry and molecular analysis not on a routine basis but whenever the boundary conditions make it necessary to avoid to underestimate the risk of putative pathogenic bacteria

17708,the efficiency of a new advanced oxidation process aop namely the photo fenton like process uv c h2o2 ids cu in removing determinants of antibiotic resistance and pathogenic bacteria was compared to a consolidated aop namely uv c h2o2 in a secondary treated municipal wastewater ww a reductionist experimental laboratory based approach was applied on real ww and the parameters were collected by an alternative integrated approach using i flow cytometry to enumerate bacteria and test for the fitness of the bacterial communities and ii molecular analyses to define the community composition 16s rrna amplicon sequencing and the abundances of antibiotic resistance genes args and of the class 1 integron inti1 gene by quantitative pcr the same approach was applied also to post treatment regrowth tests 24 h to define the potential persistence of the tested parameters these experiments were performed in both human pathogens favorable conditions hpc in rich medium and 37 c and in environmental mimicking conditions emc original ww and 20 c uv c h2o2 ids cu process resulted to be more effective than the uv c h2o2in inactivating bacterial cells in the emc post treatment regrowth experiments both aops were efficiently abating potential human pathogenic bacteria and args in the hpc regrowth experiments although this trend could not be detected in the measurements taken immediately after the disinfection in comparison with the uv c h2o2 the uv c h2o2 ids cu process did not apparently offer significant improvements in the abatement of the tested parameters in the ww effluent but by evaluating the results of the regrowth experiments it was possible to extrapolate more complex trends suggesting contrasting efficiencies visible only after a few hours this study offers a detailed view on the abatement efficiency of microbiological genetic parameters for the uv c h2o2 ids cu process calling for technical adjustments for this very promising technology at the same time our results clearly demonstrated the inadequacy of currently applied methodologies in the evaluation of specific parameters e g determinants of antibiotic resistance and pathogenic bacteria in ww graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic resistance bacterial regrowth photo fenton like wastewater disinfection water reuse 1 introduction municipal wastewater treatment plants mwwtps are widely recognized as a main hotspot for the spread of putative pathogenic bacteria possibly antibiotic resistant arb and or of antibiotic resistance genes args into the environment representing one of the main point sources of pollution for the aquatic environment and through waters to soils and crops berendonk et al 2015 zammit et al 2020 because they are not designed for the abatement of arb args krzeminski et al 2019 rizzo et al 2019 the treatment step devoted to the reduction of fecal bacteria fb is when present disinfection which is however designed to inactivate coliforms e g e coli only not considering the impact of the treatment on the whole pathobiota the community of pathogens here resized as potential human pathogenic bacteria only lasa et al 2019 nor on the arg content of the treated bacterial community indeed the efficacy of a disinfection treatment has so far mainly been investigated by enumeration of the fb and or arb abundances by cultivation approach aguas et al 2019 fiorentino et al 2018 turolla et al 2017 in some studies the overall bacterial community in the final effluent has been analyzed in terms of cell abundance and composition alexander et al 2016 only a very few seminal studies have approached regrowth experiments to test the potential of putative pathogenic bacteria and or arb args to survive or to proliferate after the treatments di cesare et al 2016b fiorentino et al 2015 the results of the regrowth experiments very often did not confirm the evidences from the measurements in the final effluent offering completely different scenarios especially when in the final treatment the solely measured parameter was the e coli colonies abundance thus on the one hand there is the need to find effective disinfection methods for the abatement of both the whole pathobiota and the args and on the other hand there is the need to apply updated technologies and alternative methodologies to test the efficacy of the different tertiary processes i e disinfection in the last years photo driven advanced oxidation processes aops have been increasingly investigated to improve disinfection performances compared to conventional systems rizzo et al 2020 among aops the photo fenton based process uv c fe h2o2 is a promising option for tertiary treatment of municipal ww because in addition to successfully inactivate a wide range of microorganisms it is also effective in the abatement of the contaminants of emerging concern typically detected in mwwtps giannakis 2018 ioannou ttofa et al 2019 generally making the effluents safer even for a possible reuse for crops irrigation rizzo et al 2020 however its application at full scale has not been a feasible attractive option so far because acidic ph operating conditions are requested to achieve an effective process possible solutions to overcome such limitation and make the process effective even under neutral ph conditions typical for municipal ww include i the addition of chelating agents that can form complexes with metals used to promote fenton reaction clarizia et al 2017 and ii the synthesis of metal organic complexes fiorentino et al 2018 both preventing metal precipitation at neutral ph as the effect of aops on antibiotic resistance is of concern the scientific literature has mainly focused on the effect of such processes on specific arb strains and specific args showing contrasting results alexander et al 2016 fiorentino et al 2019 giannakis et al 2018 guo et al 2017 iakovides et al 2019 and therefore calling for further studies to better elucidate process efficiency as well as possible mechanisms in our previous work a new photo fenton like process uv c h2o2 ids cu using iminodisuccinic acid ids cu complex as catalyst was investigated in the degradation of a model organic compound phenol as well as compared to conventional photo fenton in terms of e coli inactivation at natural ph in real municipal ww fiorentino et al 2018 while the best disinfection performance in the inactivation of e coli was observed for the different photo fenton processes investigated with a complete inactivation 3 5 log units achieved within 20 min treatment the investigated processes only partially inactivated the whole bacterial community 40 for uv c h2o2 ids cu according to flow cytometry measurements remarking how traditional cultivation method approach targeting only one bacterial family is at least questionable when evaluating disinfection process efficiency thanks to the encouraging results observed the effect of this new photo fenton process on antibiotic resistance was investigated in the present work using a consolidated photo driven aop namely uv c h2o2 as benchmark rizzo et al 2019 process efficiency was compared in terms of i reduction of the total bacterial abundance and of ii fitness of the surviving bacterial community measured by flow cytometry iii relative abundance of potential human pathogenic bacteria by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and iv of arg dynamics by qpcr assays all the above mentioned parameters were analyzed in untreated and treated ww moreover to get a complete overview of the efficacy of the tested disinfection processes the experimental design also included the simulation of a 24 h regrowth of the microbial community in the treated ww in environmental mimicking emc at 20 c without any addition and human pathogens favorable hpc at 37 c in a rich medium lb broth conditions supplementary material file figure s1 emc aims to simulate bacterial regrowth into environmentally relevant conditions while hpc aims to simulate possible regrowth of fb in humans to take into account a scenario where humans body come into contact with pathogens following the ingestion of crops irrigated

residual cu concentration below the limit set by the italian regulation for mwwtps effluent reuse 1 mg l 1 cu ids complex was prepared according to the procedure explained in our previous work fiorentino et al 2018 the exposure time during disinfection tests was set to 25 min this time was selected as a compromise among experimental needs results from previous experiments fiorentino et al 2018 and realistic conditions for possible full scale applications the disinfection efficiency of the investigated processes was evaluated immediately after the treatment t1 and through post treatment regrowth tests two different regrowth tests were performed incubation for 24 h under dark conditions of post treatment ww samples i at 20 c without lb t24 to simulate environmentally mimicking conditions emc and ii at 37 c with lb t24 lb to simulate human pathogens favorable conditions hpc total bacterial number and the proportion between dead damaged cells and total bacterial number were assessed by flow cytometry using a previously described protocol di cesare et al 2016a to prevent any possible effect of residual h2o2 on microorganisms over time from sampling to microbiological and molecular analyzes h2o2 was quenched through the addition of bovine liver catalase 2300 u mg sigma aldrich usa 20 µl of 0 1 g l 1 freshly prepared catalase solution was added for each ml of sample as

molecular processing the residual concentration of cu was measured by icp oes perkin elmer optima7000 dv the aerobic biodegradability of the cu ids has been evaluated according to manometric

gene inti1 and 16srrna gene by qpcr using protocols and programs described in our previous work di cesare et al 2016b in particular teta gene providing resistance against tetracycline qnrs against quinolones and sul2 against sulphonamides were selected as target args because typically detected in mwwtps effluents cacace et al 2019 krzeminski et al 2019 and abundant in previously analyzed ww

carried out by the dilution method as previously described di cesare et al 2013 and no inhibition was observed but for the samples of dna extracted from lb after good growing experimental condition a maximum of 2 threshold cycle of inhibition was determined and thus only these samples of dna were twenty fold diluted the conversion of the concentration from ng reaction 1 to copy reaction 1 for each tested gene was carried out as previously described di cesare et al 2013 the abundances of the tested genes were expressed as copy of args or copy of inti1 per copy of 16s rrna gene to understand the role of treatment time and culture conditions on cell numbers and args we used linear mixed effect models lmems beckerman 2014 with treatment time and culture conditions as explicit factors were

for the tested genes in the other experimental conditions 3 2 effect of aops on bacterial abundance the effect of the investigated aops on the abundance of total bacterial cells can be observed from fig 2 a table s6 under hpc t24 lb an increase in the abundance of the total number of cells under all investigated conditions was observed range 4 1 107 to 8 75 108 cells ml 1 compared to t1 and t24 conditions fig 2a however only the difference between untreated ww t24lbnd and ww treated by uv c h2o2 process t24lbhu was statistically significant p 0 05 table s6 fig 2a the proportion between the dead and total cells was between 12 4 and 67 9 supplementary table s7 fig 2b the higher difference was observed between untreated ww t24nd and the ww treated by uv c h2o2 ids cu t24cu under emc p 0 001 supplementary table s7 fig 2b 3 3 effect of aops on bacterial community composition in terms of bacterial community composition beta diversity indicates that all samples were rather similar except for those ones under hpc t24lb compared to the other communities but also within the same community treated and untreated ww nmds supplementary figure s2 focusing on the putative human pathogenic bacteria pseudomonas spp was significantly more abundant in ww immediately after treatment by uv c h2o2 ids cu t1cu p 0 05 supplementary table s8 fig 3 the abundance of pantoea spp was significantly

process if compared with the ww treated by uv c h2o2 ids cu p 0 05 however when present the relative abundance of this genus was of 1 read thus too low to be further considered data not shown supplementary table s8 in emc t24 only the relative abundance of acinetobacter spp was significantly higher in ww treated by uv c h2o2 ids cu compared to the untreated one p 0 05 supplementary table s9 fig 3 in hpc t24lb bacteroides spp p 0 001 morganella spp p 0 001 proteus spp p 0 001 and streptococcus spp p 0 05 were significantly less abundant in ww treated by uv c h2o2 or by uv c h2o2 ids cu processes supplementary table s10 fig 3 4 discussion in our work we evaluated the efficiency of two aops in contrasting the spread of determinants of antibiotic resistance and of putative human pathogenic bacteria through an integrated approach aimed to simultaneously investigate different parameters by concomitantly apply more analytical approaches to test for i total bacterial number and ii fitness of the overall bacterial community through flow cytometry iii relative abundance of potential human pathogenic bacteria through 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and iv args and class 1 integron abundaces by qpcr moreover the analysis of these parameters in the final effluent was then compared to those measured after a 24 h incubation in hpc and emc to evaluate the potential regrowth of bacteria genes not suitable for the analyses directly performed on the effluent our results are consistent with the scientific literature when full scale or simulated real conditions were investigated using conventional chlorination uv radiation or peracetic acid or alternative aops disinfection processes indeed in some studies it was observed that classical chemical disinfectants i e chlorination and or peracetic acid selected for args di cesare et al 2016b jia et al 2015 liu et al 2018 while a limited effect was observed when uv disinfection mckinney and pruden 2012 and uv h2o2 ferro et al 2016 were applied however the degradation of args was also observed in previous laboratory based works with not real ww guo et al 2017 hu et al 2019 leading to the hypothesis that the complexity of aqueous matrices can drastically change the effect of the investigated process on antibiotic resistance due to different interfering factors e g organic matter occurrence of radical scavengers suspended solids photo sensitive compounds etc lado ribeiro et al 2019 as the treated ww are released into the environment or reused for crop irrigation they stand local environmental parameters ecological physical chemical atmospheric characterized by a huge variability exercising a strong control on the survival regrowth of the bacterial community of the final effluent or of parts of it fiorentino et al 2015 giannakis et al 2016a this has indeed a further impact on the potential transfer of antibiotic resistance through water soil and plants alygizakis et al 2020 cerqueira et al 2019 fortunato et al 2018 marano et al 2019 therefore when the effect of aops on the microbial community and on the selected args and class 1 integron was investigated after a period of regrowth t24 significant differences were observed in comparison to the conditions detected just after the treatment t1 noteworthy almost all the tested args and the class 1 integron were less abundant in the treated ww if compared with the untreated ww in hpc t24 lb fig 1 in order to explain the differences observed among t1 t24 and t24 lb conditions in treated and untreated ww we should consider that disinfection by reactive oxygen species garcía fernández et al 2012 and or uv light holloman et al 2007 damages microbial dna inactivating but not destroying the bacterial cells that are generally still accounted as units in the total bacterial number hpc t24 lb growth conditions were also more favorable than emc t24 because of nutrients addition and higher temperature furthermore some damaged and not viable bacterial cells are collected on the filters for dna extraction this bias hampers the evaluation of the effect of disinfection on arg abundances by detecting persisting bacterial genotypes when analyzed by a cultivation independent approach therefore regrowth experiments become fundamental as they can evaluate the survival rates of the overall bacterial community of specific species or populations and of genes e g args from the original effluent and characterize the risk of antibiotic resistance transfer especially when wastewater are stored before reuse for crop irrigation the results achieved by both aops investigated in terms of bacterial abundance fig 2a in the final effluent just after the tertiary treatment t1 show that cultivation method approach can overestimate disinfection process efficiency as matter of fact these results are consistent with our previous work where the effect of uv c h2o2 ids cu was compared with other aops and uv c disinfection in terms of both e coli evaluated through cultivation method and whole bacterial community evaluated through flow cytometry inactivation fiorentino et al 2018 while the best disinfection performance in the inactivation of e coli was observed for the three different aops investigated with a complete inactivation 3 5 log units achieved within 20 min treatment all the investigated processes only partially inactivated the whole bacterial community from 18 for uv c to 40 for uv c h2o2 ids cu according to flow cytometry measurements moreover cu based photo fenton processes resulted in the higher percentage of inactivated total cells and as h2o2 dose was decreased uv c h2o2 cu ids was more effective than uv c h2o2 cu process this poor efficiency of aops in terms of reducing the total bacterial cell numbers is consistent with the constant number of detected args and of class 1 integron in the same conditions t1 fig 1 suggesting that the treatment process was not enough intensive to degrade genetic material looking at the effects of the two tested aops on the status of bacteria intact dead cells only uv c h2o2 ids cu treatment was effective resulting in an increase of the proportion of dead total bacterial cells in emc t24 fig 2b according to what was previously observed for the disinfection with peracetic acid di cesare et al 2016b as the effect of the investigated aops on the whole bacterial community is of concern the biggest differences were observed in hpc t24 lb fig 3 this is possibly due to the strong bottleneck effect introduced by dilution of the original sample in the rich medium allowing for the fast growth of different opportunistic bacteria comparing the bacterial community in terms of relative abundance of putative human pathogenic bacteria immediately after disinfection in treated ww respect to the untreated one t1 pseudomonas spp or pantoea spp resulted significantly higher fig 3 this result is in agreement with previous works where different disinfection treatments i e ozonation or chlorination caused a selection of putative pathogenic bacteria like pseudomonas aeruginosa alexander et al 2016 or mycobacterium tuberculosis kumaraswamy et al 2014 furthermore both aops were not effective in the removal of putative pathogenic bacteria in emc t24 and in particular uv c h2o2 ids cu selected for acinetobacter spp fig 3 however in hpc t24 lb several putative pathogenic bacteria resulted less abundant in treated ww than those measured in untreated ww in particular bacteroides spp and proteus spp were significantly less abundant in treated ww regardless of the tested treatment if compared with the untreated one bacteroides spp are gram negative bacteria normally beneficial for humans when confined in the gut but significantly dangerous if outside causing abscess in several body sites wexler 2007 proteus spp are gram negative bacteria considered as commensals in human gut but also recognized as urinary tract infection agents and recently identified as potential pathogens in crohn s disease hamilton et al 2018 this highlights unequivocally that both aops are good disinfectants in this respect uv c h2o2 process was more effective than uv c h2o2 ids cu to reduce the relative abundance of args and potential pathogenic bacteria i e aeromonas spp escherichia shighella spp but less effective in reducing the total alive intact cells bacteria the inactivation mechanisms of bacterial cells by the investigated processes are those related to the action of the radical species forming during aops mainly hydroxyl radical ho cho et al 2004 dalrymple et al 2010 giannakis et al 2016b cu and cu2 cupper oxidation states react with h2o2 eqs 1 and 2 in the same way of fe2 h2o2 and fe3 h2o2 reaction systems respectively bokare and choi 2014 1 cu2 h2o2 cu ho2 oh k 4 6 102 m 1 s 1 2 cu h2o2 cu2 ho ho k 1 0 104 m 1 s 1 in addition to radicals effect a contribution from cu is also expected although the measured residual cu 0 6 mg l 1 is under the limit of 1 mg l 1 set by the italian regulation for wastewater reuse dm 93 2006 it is however in a sufficient concentration to exert from one hand a toxic effect on bacterial growth or survival zhao et al 2013 and on the other hand a selective pressure on copper tolerant pathogenic bacteria jeanvoine et al 2019 the cu reduction under the investigated reaction conditions has been attributed to the bio degradability of the cu ids complex 55 5 and its photo degradation mediated by uv c radiation for cu ii iminodiacetate mailhot et al 1995 in this way the cu is released by the cu ids complex and precipitated as cu oh 2 at the observed ph of 7 5 moreover other possible simultaneous interactive processes could affect the inactivation of the whole bacterial community as matter of fact just uv c radiation can inactivate bacterial cells through uv induced damages such as the formation of pyrimidine dimers in their dna which can prevent its replication hijnen et al 2006 in our previous work the contribution of uv c radiation to bacterial cells inactivation evaluated through flow cytometry was significant 18 compared to that one observed for uv c h2o2 ids cu process 40 fiorentino et al 2018 a contribution from h2o2 can also be expected 25 mg h2o2 l 1 resulted in 25 bacterial community inactivation in absence of uv c radiation fiorentino et al 2018 the inactivation of bacterial cells by h2o2 can take place through an external action where h2o2 reacts probably directly with the cellular membrane thus increasing its permeability and allowing higher concentrations of h2o2 to get in and finally affecting the viability of the cell giannakis et al 2016b an internal inactivation action can also take place into bacterial cells through an internal fenton process due to the simultaneous occurrence of metals namely fe and cu and h2o2 giannakis et al 2016b the composition of the wastewater also affects disinfection process the h2o2 purposely added to start uv c h2o2 ids cu and uv c h2o2 processes respectively will be partially consumed through reactions will take place with organic matter metals nitrogen compounds etc typically occurring in real wastewater for example dissolved organic matter dom can act as hydroxyl radicals scavenger according to the eq 3 3 dom ho dom ox oh taking into account that a significant part of the cod and bod5 measured in the samples used for the experiments table s1 is dom a scavenging effect possibly took place in our tests this effect is also expected in the presence of bi carbonates in the aqueous matrix rubio et al 2013 4 ho hco 3 co 3 h2o 5 ho co2 3 co 3 oh in addition bi carbonates also offer protection to bacterial cells from disinfection process giannakis et al 2016b however although scavenged by different components occurring in real aqueous matrices ho can also be produced through the reaction of other components with uv radiation that is the case of nitrite and nitrate typically occurring in wastewater table s1 which form ho according to the following reactions giannakis et al 2016b 6 no 3 h hv ho no2 7 no 3 h2o hv ho no 2 oh 8 no 2 h2o hv ho no oh 5 conclusions the uv c h2o2 ids cu process was found to be even more efficient than other aops uv c radiation and h2o2 in the inactivation of e coli according to our previous work fiorentino et al 2018 thus making the effluent in compliance with e coli standards set at national and international level for ww disposal or reuse however the integrated approach used in this work to evaluate the disinfection efficiency of two aops in real urban ww emphasized that the traditional monitoring through cultivation method targeting only one bacterial family in a single time space point the final effluent is not a suitable approach to monitor the efficiency of disinfection processes when emerging challenges such as the spread of antibiotic resistance should be addressed the results explained and discussed herein depended on the evaluation parameter cells abundance dead cells vs args vs putative human pathogenic bacteria and the simulated conditions after treatment vs emc vs hpc uv c h2o2 ids cu process was more effective than uv c h2o2 in terms of reduction of alive bacterial cells on the other hand uv c h2o2 process was more effective in decreasing the relative abundances of inti1 and teta in hpc moreover both aops were not effective in the removal of putative pathogenic bacteria in emc while they were both effective in the inactivation of some bacterial groups e g bacteroides spp and proteus spp in hpc these results show that uv c h2o2 ids cu process is worthy of further investigation to evaluate its efficiency under more intensive operational conditions in conclusion the evaluation of disinfection process efficiency is a task worthy of a more complete and exhaustive approach where cultivation method should be complemented with the above discussed methods flow cytometry and molecular analysis not on a routine basis but whenever the boundary conditions make it necessary to avoid to underestimate the risk of putative pathogenic bacteria

17709,reject water contains complex components of organic compounds which have significant influences on the nitrogen removal performance when treated using biological autotrophic nitrogen removal technology in this study a two stage partial nitritation pn anammox floc granule system was established to treat reject water cod nh4 n 0 97 0 15 and the evolution of organic compounds along pn and annamox bioreactors was investigated using gas chromatography mass spectrometry and excitation emission matrix also the variation of pn and anammox sludge properties relating to cod reduction was examined the pn anammox system removed approximately 80 of total inorganic nitrogen and cod with hydraulic reaction time of 16 h the influent organics 330 600 mg cod l in reject water were primarily composed of volatile protein like and humic acid like organic compounds pn process contributed 53 18 of the overall cod removal primarily including oxygen containing organics e g phenol proteins and humic acids anammox process contributed 22 15 of the overall cod removal but large molecule acids e g lactic acid and small molecule alcohols e g glycerol were reoccurred contributing to the effluent cod with recalcitrant hydrocarbons e g n octadecane reject water increased the extracellular proteins polysaccharides ratio of pn and anammox sludge promoting the adsorption and degradation of organic compounds high throughput sequencing results showed that denitrifying bacteria of ottowia increased from 0 03 to 14 4 in pn reactor and of denitratisoma increased from 9 6 to 15 4 in anammox reactor the occurrence of these denitrifiers might mitigate the negative impact of organics to functional organisms this study highlights the organics fate during pn anammox treatment system which is important to maintain the robust nitrogen removal when treating organics containing and high ammonium concentration wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reject water organic compounds evolution partial nitritation anammox denitrification nitrogen removal 1 introduction reject water which is composed of digester supernatant and sludge dewatering liquor is the wastewater produced from the treatment of sludge hu et al 2017 torà et al 2014 this wastewater is usually recycled to the inlet of wastewater treatment plant and mixed with the influent for treatment torà et al 2014 however reject water is characterized by high ammonium concentration 500 1500 mg n l and a low chemical oxygen demand cod n ratio 1 100 1000 mg cod l which is highly unfavorable for nitrogen removal by conventional nitrification and heterotrophic denitrification chen et al 2015 peng et al 2012 although its flow rate only accounts for approximately 2 of the total influent flow the reject water contributes to 10 30 of the total nitrogen load of a wastewater treatment plant choi et al 2019 van loosdrecht and salem 2006 therefore it can be a good option to treat reject water separately to reduce the nitrogen load of the mainline processes and achieve the stringent nitrogen discharge standards peng et al 2012 the novel and promising autotrophic anammox process opens a new door for nitrogen removal from reject water owing to several economic benefits lackner et al 2014 van der star et al 2007 indeed numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the feasibility of using partial nitritation pn and anammox processes to treat reject water galí et al 2007 lackner et al 2012 strous et al 1997 torà et al 2014 van der star et al 2007 in a fluidized bed anammox reactor treating reject water 82 ammonium removal efficiency and 99 nitrite removal efficiency were achieved strous et al 1997 in 2002 the first full scale anammox reactor was successfully set up in rotterdam netherlands treating partially nitritated reject water with a design load of 7 1 kg n m3 d van der star et al 2007 then a sequencing batch reactor sbr and a chemostat type of reactor were compared to treat reject water and produce a suitable influent for anammox process galí et al 2007 both reactors produced a 50 50 ammonium nitrite effluent but the sbr had a higher nitrogen conversion rate of 1 1 kg n m3 d than that of the chemostat reactor of 0 35 kg n m3 d while the chemostat reactor was more stable when nh4 n concentration fluctuated later oxidation reduction potential was recommended as a main indicator to maintain stable operation of a single stage pn and anammox system when treating reject water lackner et al 2012 stable effluent for anammox was also produced through a new control loop by manipulating the influent flow rate when treating reject water with a nitrogen loading rate of 5 0 1 0 kg n m3 d torà et al 2014 clearly most studies on the pn anammox system treatment of reject water have only focused on the nitrogen transformation lackner et al 2012 strous et al 1997 van der star et al 2007 or the control strategies for pn process galí et al 2007 torà et al 2014 and few have involved in the evolution of organic compounds along the process procedure which however is important for the robust operation of the pn anammox process as reject water also contains amount of organic compounds lackner et al 2012 peng et al 2012 it should be noted that the influences of organic compounds on the pn and anammox processes depend heavily on its composition jenni et al 2014 the organic compounds in reject water usually compose of toxic organics such as phenolics substances biodegradable volatile fatty acids refractory organics such as humic substances and high molecular weight proteins and particulate organics lu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 toxic organics have a direct toxic effect on aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anammox bacteria lyu et al 2019 biodegradable organics can stimulate the proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria which have a competition effect on aob and anammox bacteria towards oxygen substrate and living space li et al 2020 refractory and particulate organics can limit the diffusion of substrate zhang et al 2018 influent total organic carbon toc concentration above 50 mg l seriously inhibited the activity of anammox bacteria when treating reject water li et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 investigated four organic fractions in reject water soluble cod particulate cod large colloidal cod and small colloidal cod separately using batch tests and they found that soluble cod directly inhibited aob while particulate and colloidal cod indirectly inhibited aob by causing diffusion limitation for anammox bacteria they were mainly directly inhibited by soluble cod in long term operation the occurrence of organic compounds could stimulate the proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria under aeration condition and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria under anoxic condition which would degrade the toxic organic compounds and improve the nitrogen removal efficiency in pn anammox systems in a one stage pn and anammox system treating reject water 60 70 cod was removed possibly due to the adsorption and biodegradation reactions and stable nitrogen removal performance could still maintain lackner et al 2012 yang et al 2015 in another two stage pn and anammox system 30 and 15 of toc were removed by pn process and anammox process respectively with a steady total nitrogen removal efficiency of 90 zhang et al 2010 the degradation of toxic organic compounds is essential to maintain the activity of autotrophic aob and anammox bacteria although these studies have illustrated that the pn anammox system could reduce the organics concentrations of reject water lackner et al 2012 yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 it is still unclear which part of organics can be reduced from the perspective of chemical composition and how these organics are reduced and subsequently impact the performance of the pn anammox system therefore the evolution of organic compounds along pn anammox processes is urgently required to be investigated further in this study a laboratory scale two stage pn and anammox system was established to assess their feasibility to simultaneous removal of nitrogen and organic compounds from reject water a two stage pn anammox system was chosen to mitigate the negative impacts of organics on the post anammox process and investigate the effects of organics towards aob and anammox bacteria separately special attention had been payed to the organic compounds evolution along the pn and anammox bioreactors using gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms and three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem gc ms was carried out to analyze the relatively volatile and thermo stable organic compounds while 3d eem was used to investigate the fluorescent organic compounds the influences of reject water on the sludge properties such as sludge morphology extracellular polymeric substances eps composition and microbial activity and composition were also identified this study for the first time provided deep insights into the evolution of organic compounds along pn and anammox treatment processes and the variation of pn and anammox sludge properties relating to cod reduction the results are expected to provide useful guidance for the manipulation of the full scale employment of pn and anammox system to treat organic containing and high ammonium concentration wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactors and seeding sludge fig 1 presents a schematic diagram of the pn and anammox processes the pn process was carried out in an anoxic oxic 20

cultured using inorganic synthetic wastewater for 265 days before treating reject water am egsb was inoculated with anammox granules from another egsb in our laboratory which was dominant by candidatus kuenenia wang et al 2019 the reactor was separately cultured using inorganic synthetic wastewater for 220 days before treating reject water the compositions of the synthetic inorganic wastewaters for ao sbr and am egsb are detailed in si s1 2 2 operational strategies reject water produced by sludge dewatering liquor was collected from a wastewater treatment plant with anaerobic sludge digestion procedure in shanghai china the characteristics of reject water are listed in table s1 to eliminate the effect of sudden increase of organic compounds on the reactor performance from day 266 on reject water and inorganic synthetic wastewater were mixed as influent for ao sbr at a ratio of 1 3 this mixture ratio changed to 1 2 and 2 1 at day 267 and 270 respectively and reject water was directly used as the influent at day 275 from day 317 on when the effluent of ao sbr had stable ammonium and organic concentrations fig 2 a c and e it was stored in a storage tank and used as the influent for am egsb from an economic point of view we did not adjust the ph of the reject water 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 gc ms analysis the organic compounds in wastewater were firstly

discussion 3 1 long term performance of the pn anammox system with the influent ammonium cod and doc concentrations in reject water respectively fluctuated in the range of 400 600 mg n l 330 600 mg l and 100 200 mg l the combination of pn and anammox processes could achieve a stable effluent with ammonium nitrite nitrate concentrations of 13 5 8 9 0 64 3 8 1 mg n l respectively and with cod and doc concentrations of 198 45 and 50 14 mg l respectively the combination of pn and anammox processes could remove 83 2 of total inorganic nitrogen tin 74 6 of cod and 78 5 of doc in reject water 3 1 1 nitrogen and carbon removal performance of ao sbr fig 2a c and e shows the evolution of nitrogen and organic concentrations in the pn reactor the ao sbr was fed with reject water and operated for 129 days 266 394 d by gradually increasing the proportion of reject water the ao sbr achieved a stable state 317 394 d with the effluent ammonium and nitrite concentrations stabilizing at 145 18 and 163 21 mg n l respectively fig 2a the mean ratio of no2 n nh4 n in the effluent was 1 13 0 11 which is suitable for the subsequent anammox treatment almost no nitrate was detected in the effluent indicating a successful control of nob actually none of nob was detected in the pn sludge by analysis of the microbial composition details in section 3 3 3 additionally a high inorganic nitrogen loss occurred in the ao sbr with the tin removal efficiency tinre of 32 9 although the influent cod and doc fluctuated at 600 330 and 200 100 mg l respectively during 317 394 d the effluent cod and doc concentrations were stable at 198 45 and 50 14 mg l of the ao sbr fig 2c and e specifically the ao sbr could removal 53 18 of influent cod and 62 16 of influent doc the high concentration of organic compounds in reject water could stimulate the growth of denitrifying bacteria which might result in the simultaneously high removal efficiency of tin cod and doc yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 indeed the 16s rdna sequencing results revealed that the relative abundance of ottowia a kind of denitrifying bacteria in ao sbr increased from 0 03 to 14 4 details in section 3 3 3 3 1 2 nitrogen and carbon removal performance of am egsb when the ao sbr reached a stable state the effluent of the ao sbr was subsequently treated by the am egsb 317 394 d as shown in fig 2b d and f the am egsb had a good adaptability to the effluent of the ao sbr the effluent ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations of the am egsb were 13 5 8 9 0 and 64 3 8 1 mg n l respectively fig 2b the tin removal rate and tinre of am egsb were stable at 0 71 0 10 kg n m3 d and 75 4 respectively with the tin loading rate of 0 94 0 11 kg n m3 d the ratio of δno2 n δnh4 n was 1 26 0 14 similar to the theoretical values of 1 32 the ratio of δno3 n δnh4 n in am egsb was 0 45 0 08 higher than the theoretical value of 0 26 which might be due to the increase in nob abundance and activity details in section 3 4 3 the anammox reactor could also remove some of the organic compounds i e approximately 41 17 of influent cod 22 15 of the total cod in reject water and 38 19 of influent doc 18 17 of the total doc in reject water were removed with the effluent cod and doc stable at 113 20 and 30 3 mg l respectively fig 2d and f this removal of the organic compounds could also be attributed to the occurrence of denitrifying bacteria in the am egsb which was further confirmed in section 3 4 3 taken together the combined pn and anammox processes could removal approximately 80 of tin cod and doc fig s2 nevertheless approximately 64 3 8 1 mg no3 n l was residual in the effluent which needs to be removed by adding a post heterotrophic denitrification reactor the ao sbr contributed 32 9 of total tin removal and 53 18 of total cod removal the am egsb contributed 52 9 of total tin removal and 22 15 of total cod removal clearly most organic compounds had been removed in the ao sbr and the evolution of organic compounds was further comprehensively discussed in section 3 2 3 2 evolutions of organic compounds in ao sbr and am egsb in order to gain a deeper understanding of how the organic compounds evolved in the pn anammox system gc ms and eem analyses were carried out in terms of volatile organic compounds and fluorescent organic substances mainly protein like and humic acid like organic compounds the peak intensities of gc ms and eem were used for semi quantitative analysis sheng and yu 2006 wu and zhou 2010 3 2 1 volatile organic compounds evolution revealed by gc ms the relatively volatile and thermo stable organic compounds in the influent of ao sbr pinf effluent of ao sbr peff also is the influent of am egsb and effluent of am egsb aeff were analyzed using gc ms results showed that the hydrocarbon compounds in influent and effluent were almost unchanged but most of the oxygen containing organic compounds could be removed in the ao sbr fig 3 in the subsequent am egsb large molecule acids and small molecule alcohols could be reoccurred by the microbial metabolism fig 3b as shown in fig 3 the detected compounds were classified as hydrocarbon compounds and oxygen containing organic compounds for hydrocarbon compounds the intensities were almost the same in pinf peff and aeff fig 3a reflecting the recalcitrant property of these hydrocarbon compounds lu et al 2018 large amounts of hydrocarbons have been found in sludge anaerobic digestion process lu et al 2018 which might be caused by the anaerobic degradation of biomass wu and zhou 2010 for oxygen containing organic compounds small molecule acids 3 methylbutyric acid and valeric acid large molecule alcohols tridecyl alcohol phenolics substances phenol p cresol 3 5 dimethylphenol dodecyl acrylate and 2 3 dimethoxybenzaldehyde were only detected in pinf fig 3b suggesting that these organic compounds had been degraded by the microbes in ao sbr the intensities of large molecule acids lactic acid and palmitic acid decreased from pinf to peff but increased again in aeff while stearic acid was only detected in aeff therefore ao sbr had a low removal efficiency on large molecule acids while am egsb could increase the concentration of large molecule acids by microbial metabolism small molecule alcohols 1 2 propanediol and glycerol were detected in pinf and aeff but not detected in peff suggesting that these molecules could be totally degraded in ao sbr but reoccurred in am egsb by microbial metabolism the bio degradation of organic compounds especially the toxic compounds such as phenol ensured the stable nitrogen transformation of ao sbr and am egsb fig 2a and b phenolics substances were all degraded in ao sbr in accordance with the increased ottowia in ao sbr who are capable of degrading phenolic substances and denitrify details in section 3 3 3 felföldi et al 2010 3 2 2 protein like and humic acid like organic compounds evolution revealed by eem protein like and humic acid like organic compounds were analyzed using eem and results showed that the fluorescence intensity decreased dramatically from pinf to peff but slightly increased from peff to a eff fig 4 a c the protein like and humic acid like organic compounds were also mostly removed by ao sbr fig 4 to be specific only one peak with high fluorescence intensity was found in the raw reject water pinf fig 4a this peak was at excitation emission wavelengths of 275 nm 297 5 nm which was generally thought to be tyrosine and protein like substances table s2 chen et al 2003 however the previous gc ms results had showed that pinf had quantities of phenol p cresol and 3 5 dimethylphenol fig 3b these phenolics substances which all were monocyclic aromatic compounds had a similar π π conjugated double bond structure with tyrosine and could enhance the intensity of fluorescent peaks of tyrosine and protein like substances wang and zhang 2010 after treated by ao sbr none of phenol p cresol and 3 5 dimethylphenol was detected in peff fig 3b simultaneously the fluorescence intensity of tyrosine and protein like substances at excitation emission wavelengths of 275 nm 300 nm decreased by 90 from 521 391 to 53 209 table s2 the decrease in the fluorescence intensity might also be caused by the removal of tyrosine and protein like substances due to the decrease of fluorescence intensity of tyrosine and protein like substances at excitation emission wavelengths of 275 nm 300 nm the fluorescent peaks for polyaromatic humic acid like substances and marine humic acids appeared in peff fig 4b chen et al 2003 wang and zhang 2010 these two fluorescent peaks for humic acid like substances might be distorted and covered by the high fluorescence intensity of tyrosine and protein like substances in pinf after treated by am egsb the fluorescence intensity of the aeff increased although cod and doc decreased from peff to aeff fig 4c and table s2 this might be caused by the different ph values in the peff and aeff previous studies had reported that the fluorescence intensity of humic acid substances increases with the increase of ph in the range of 2 10 sheng et al 2008 therefore the higher ph of aeff 6 9 than peff 6 1 might had led to the higher fluorescence intensity of aeff in order to quantitatively assess the evolution of polysaccharides proteins and humic acids in reject water the anthrone method and a modified lowry method were used to measure the concentration of polysaccharides and proteins and humic acids respectively as shown in fig 4d the concentration of polysaccharides seemed almost unchanged from pinf to peff and aeff with the values maintaining at 9 mg l but the concentrations of proteins and humic acids decreased from 65 0 7 and 112 0 9 to 15 0 4 and 38 0 5 mg l and decreased by 77 and 61 from pinf to peff respectively after treated by ao sbr after treated by am egsb the concentration of proteins and humic acids further decreased to 14 1 4 and 29 1 4 mg l with the decrease percentage of 2 5 and 7 6 fig 4d respectively it comes that the proteins and humic acids substances had been mostly removed by ao sbr in accordance with the eem results fig 4a c the higher proteins and humic acids concentrations in pinf than peff led to the higher increase of fluorescence intensities of protein like and humic acid like substances in pn sludge eps after treating reject water than that of anammox granular eps details in sections 3 3 2 and 3 4 2 combined with the results of gc ms and eem it could be concluded that most oxygen containing organics 77 of protein like and 61 humic acid like organics were removed in ao sbr which was consistent with the higher cod removal efficiency of 53 18 in ao sbr as mentioned in section 3 1 3 3 the pn sludge properties variation and microbial structure shift after fed with reject water the variation of sludge properties would directly affect the wastewater treatment efficiency in this study sludge morphology eps and microbial compositions of pn sludge and anammox granules were compared before and after fed with reject water 3 3 1 effect of reject water on the pn sludge morphology the morphology of pn sludge cultured with synthetic wastewater or reject water was shown in fig s3a d after treatment of reject water the pn sludge structure became denser and sludge aggregates obviously occurred the size of the sludge flocs significantly increased from 140 to 296 μm fig s4a this might be due to the addition of flocculating agent such as cationic polyacrylamide during sludge dewatering process wirtz and dague 1997 the presence of flocculating agent in the reject water could promote the electrostatic adsorption and adsorption bridging between bacteria and thus stimulated the aggregation of flocculent pn sludge sem results showed that the bacteria in both sludge samples were mainly coccus fig s5a d the surface of sludge treating synthetic wastewater was smooth with clear outline but treating reject water caused a lot of sticky material on the surface of bacteria which might be eps later was proved in section 3 3 2 filamentous bacteria were also observed in the sludge sample treating reject water fig s5b and d the organic compounds in reject water could stimulate the growth of heterotrophic bacteria including filamentous bacteria which could provide a skeleton for bacterial aggregation and thus stimulate the increase in the sludge size 3 3 2 effect of reject water on the eps properties of pn sludge eps of microorganisms plays a significant role in pollutant migration and transformation during wastewater treatment sheng et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 as shown in fig 5 a after treating reject water the polysaccharides concentration of pn sludge eps decreased from 21 5 1 0 to 6 2 0 2 mg g vss while the proteins and humic acids concentrations of pn sludge eps increased from 29 2 0 2 and 8 0 1 2 to 120 6 2 5 and 38 6 2 2 mg g vss respectively the decrease in polysaccharides and increase in proteins led to the proteins polysaccharides ratio increased significantly from 1 4 0 1 to 19 4 0 6 fig 5a the increased proteins polysaccharides ratio might be due to the secretion of extracellular enzymes by heterotrophic bacteria to degrade organic compounds miao et al 2018 previous studies have shown that the hydrophobic part of eps was mainly composed of proteins while the hydrophilic part was mainly polysaccharides jorand et al 1998 the increase in the proteins polysaccharides ratio could enhance the hydrophobicity of bacteria surface further promote the adsorption and degradation of organic compounds in reject water indeed a high cod of approximately 250 mg l was removed by ao sbr figs 2c moreover the increased proteins polysaccharides ratio could also lead to the larger pn sludge size fig s4a eem spectra further showed that the fluorescence intensities of protein like and humic acid like substances in loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps were increased after treating reject water fig 6 a d the detected humic acid like substances included marine humic acids with emission wavelengths in the ultraviolet region 400 nm and polyaromatic and polycarboxylate type humic acid like substances with emission wavelengths in the visible region 400 nm the marine humic acids and polyaromatic humic acid like substances with the emission wavelength located in the ultraviolet region were mainly identified in the pinf and peff of ao sbr fig 4a c and the weak peak of polycarboxylate type humic acid like substances was only observed in tb eps under the synthetic wastewater condition fig 6c therefore the marine humic acids and polyaromatic humic acid like substances might be adsorbed from the reject water while the polycarboxylate type humic acid like substances might be secreted by the bacteria under the stimulation of organic compounds hence some kinds of organic compounds such as humic acids could be removed by physical adsorption also fig 4 showed that most proteins and humic acids substances in reject water had been removed by ao sbr so we deduced that a fraction of them could be adsorbed by the pn sludge eps which led to a high increase of fluorescence intensities of protein like and humic acid like substances in the pn sludge eps fig 6a d 3 3 3 effect of reject water on nitrification activity and microbial composition of pn sludge after fed with reject water the activity of aob in ao sbr slightly decreased by 5 from 90 0 0 4 to 85 2 0 9 mg nh4 n g mlvss h p 0 02 0 05 fig 5b the activity of nob was still controlled at a low level of 0 35 0 27 mg no2 n g mlvss h indicating the stable operation of pn process with reject water the high ammonium concentration of 400 600 mg n l in the reject water might have enhanced the suppression of nob the microbial communities of pn sludge when treating synthetic wastewater and reject water are shown in fig 7 a and b at the phylum level proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi were the three most abundant microorganisms in the sludge samples fig 7a proteobacteria are common in the wastewater treatment system and most aob and part of nob are affiliated to this phylum the relative abundance of proteobacteria decreased from 58 to 28 after treating reject water while that of bacteroidetes increased from 25 to 61 and became the dominant microorganisms in the ao sbr bacteroidetes are considered to be highly adaptable which could degrade high molecular weight polymeric compounds with a preference for growth on granule surface fernández gómez et al 2013 at the genus level nitrosomonas was the only known genus detected in the two samples that is directly related to ammonia oxidation but the relative abundance of nitrosomonas decreased from 22 to 0 3 after fed with reject water fig 7b the dominant bacteria also changed from nitrosomonas to norank f ns9 marine group with the relative abundance of 41 surprisingly the activity of aob only decreased by 5 and ao sbr still maintained excellent pn performance indicating that other bacteria in this system had been responsible for the ammonia oxidation marine group is an uncultured branch of bacteria found in marine ecosystems and might participate in the nitrogen cycle in ocean wright et al 2014 the norank f ns9 marine group occurred in this study might be a new aob genus with ammonia oxidation function when nitrosomonas could not adapt to the complex water quality of reject water norank f ns9 marine group with a strong adaptability gradually occupied the dominant position ottowia which could degrade phenolic substances and denitrify felföldi et al 2010 became the second most abundant microbes 14 4 fig 7b their abundance might contribute greatly to the decreased toxic phenolics substances in ao sbr as reveled by gc ms fig 3b comamonas and rhodanobacter also occurred with the relative abundance of 4 6 and 0 02 which have denitrification function fig 7b the growth of these denitrifying bacteria could well explain the high removal efficiency of organic compounds in ao sbr fig 2c and e taken together our results suggest that denitrification and adsorption played an important role in the cod reduction reject water stimulated the secretion of eps of pn sludge which increased the bacterial hydrophobicity and favored the adsorption and degradation of organic compounds reject water also selected the growth of denitrifying bacteria ottowia which could degrade phenolic substances these findings elucidated the high cod removal efficiency in ao sbr from the perspective of the microbes section 3 1 3 4 the anammox sludge properties variation and microbial structure shift after fed with reject water 3 4 1 effect of reject water on anammox granular morphology after fed with reject water the size shape and color of anammox granules became more diversified fig s3e h granules with black or brown colors gradually appeared which might be due to the growth of heterotrophic bacteria the particle size of granules was polarized and a few bigger granules and a lot of smaller flocs appeared but the sludge was still dominated by large size granules with the peak granule size rising from 1183 to 1343 μm fig s4b the peak granule size of small flocculent sludge decreased from 174 to 153 μm the formation of larger granules might be due to the increased proteins polysaccharides ratio in eps details in section 3 4 2 and the enhanced cell surface hydrophobicity under the stimulation of organic compounds in the influent peff which might be more conducive to the aggregation of bacteria under the stress of organic compounds such as phenols yang et al 2013 also found the particle size of anammox granule sludge increased and even reached 15 6 mm sem images revealed that there were a lot of filamentous bacteria growth on the granule surface after treating reject water fig s5e h accordingly the increase in the proportion of sludge with smaller size fig s4b might be caused by the over proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria that caused granule disintegration 3 4 2 effect of reject water on anammox granular eps properties the eps contents of anammox granules are shown in fig 5c after fed with reject water the content of proteins in anammox granular eps increased by 9 from 35 1 5 to 38 0 2 mg l the content of humic acids increased by 25 from 13 0 6 to 16 0 1 mg l while the content of polysaccharides decreased by 67 from 8 0 1 to 3 0 1 mg l this resulted in an increase in the proteins polysaccharides ratio from 4 0 2 to 14 0 5 similar to that of pn sludge with the increase in the extracellular proteins polysaccharides ratio the bacteria surface hydrophobicity increased which might increase the granule size fig s4b and promote the adsorption and degradation of hydrophobic organic compounds in the peff eem spectra of anammox granular eps are shown in fig 6e h for the lb eps tyrosine and protein like substances and marine humic acids peaks with stronger fluorescence intensity occurred after fed with reject water fig 6f indeed ye et al 2011 also reported that bacteria tend to produce more lb eps under unfavorable environments different from the ao sbr there were no peaks of polyaromatic and polycarboxylate type humic acid like substances for the anammox granular eps as the marine humic acids peaks were observed in both peff and aeff the increased marine humic acids peak in lb eps might be absorbed by anammox granules from reject water suggesting that adsorption had contributed to a part of reduction of cod in the studied am egsb moreover the increase of fluorescence intensities of protein like and humic acid like substances in anammox granular eps after treating reject water was lower than that of pn sludge possibly due to the lower proteins and humic acids concentrations in peff than that of pinf fig 4 3 4 3 effect of reject water on anammox activity and microbial composition of anammox granules similar to the sludge in the ao sbr the activity of anammox sludge also decreased by 27 from 0 13 0 005 to 0 10 0 007 g n g vss d after fed with reject water fig 5d which might be caused by the presence of organic compounds such as humic acids and low ph value 6 1 in peff the inhibition of organic compounds on aob might be due to the direct toxicity of organic compounds e g phenolics substances and the competition of heterotrophic bacteria while the inhibition on anammox bacteria might be caused by the competition of heterotrophic bacteria the influent organic compounds in reject water had posed certain negative influences on both aob and anammox bacteria and these influences were greater on anammox bacteria than that on aob regardless most of organic compounds having been removed by the prior ao sbr meanwhile the low ph value of 6 1 for peff could also inhibit anammox activity as a suitable ph for anammox bacteria is 6 7 8 3 strous et al 1999 the microbial composition of am egsb changed slightly after treating reject water fig 7c and d at the phylum level planctomycetes chloroflexi and proteobacteria were the three most abundant microorganisms in both sludge samples fig 7c after fed with reject water the relative abundance of anammox related planctomycetes slightly decreased from 49 to 42 and that of aob and nob related proteobacteria slightly increased from 20 to 26 at the genus level candidatus kuenenia unclassified f brocadiaceae denitratisoma and nitrospira were detected in both samples that related to nitrogen conversion fig 7d candidatus kuenenia and unclassified f brocadiaceae were constantly two major anammox microorganisms in the am egsb after fed with reject water the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia increased slightly from 14 to 15 and the relative abundance of unclassified f brocadiaceae decreased from 29 to 22 it is speculated that candidatus kuenenia could adapt to the change in the living environment but unclassified f brocadiaceae was greatly affected by the complex organic compounds and low ph value indeed miao et al 2018 had found that candidatus kuenenia dominated the known anammox genus due to its high substrate affinity and better adaptability to landfill leachate and the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia in biofilms increased from 3 to 12 in the present study the relative abundance of denitratisoma and nitrospira increased from 9 6 and 0 9 to 15 4 and 1 4 respectively denitratisoma as a kind of denitrifying bacteria could participate in the degradation of organic compounds cao et al 2016 which might contribute to the reduction of organic compounds in the am egsb fig 2d and f nitrospira as a kind of nitrite oxidizing bacteria liu and wang 2013 could led to the high nitrate concentration in the effluent fig 2b the increase in nitrospira might be caused by two reasons i the residual oxygen in the effluent of ao sbr ii the relatively low ph and low ammonium concentration in peff that could not inhibit the proliferation of nitrospira the variation of denitrifying bacteria in ao sbr and am egsb corresponded well with the variation of organic compounds in pinf and peff fig 3b as the influent cod was mostly removed by the prior ao sbr reject water seemed to have less influences on anammox granules than on pn sludge in terms of eps properties and microbial composition figs 5 6 and 7 exploring of the impacts of reject water on pn and anammox sludge properties can deepen our understanding on organic compounds evolution mechanism and further favor the full scale application of the two stage pn and anammox system to treat reject water 3 5 future perspectives in this study the ammonium and cod concentrations of reject water fluctuated from 400 to 600 mg n l and 330 to 600 mg l respectively with a cod n ratio stable at 0 97 0 15 the combination of pn and anammox processes shown good adaptability to the reject water fig s2 although organic compounds in reject water affected the morphology activity eps and microbial compositions of pn and anammox sludges the nitrogen and organic compounds could be simultaneously removed with excellent efficiency of approximately 80 in our study organic compounds including oxygen containing volatile small molecule acids large molecule alcohols phenolics substances protein like and humic acid like organics were mostly removed in pn process therefore these organic compounds might have a more prominent impact on the properties of pn sludge while the left refractory organics mainly hydrocarbons compounds had a more prominent impact on the properties of anammox sludge such organic compounds impact requires careful consideration for pn anammox processes when treating reject water meanwhile there were approximately 110 mg l cod mainly refractory organics such as hydrocarbons compounds and 60 mg n l no3 fig 2b and d residual in the effluent so future studies are required to efficiently remove the refractory organics and nitrate for instance use partial denitrification ji et al 2020 or dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium approaches castro barros et al 2017 or recycle a fraction of effluent to the influent of pn process to remove the residual nitrate and use advanced oxidation technology to remove refractory organics besides the shift of microbial community structure in ao sbr and the exact role of norank f ns9 marine group occurred in the reject water treatment system also warrant further investigation 4 conclusions in this study a two stage pn anammox system was stably operated to remove 83 of tin and 74 of cod from reject water for the first time the evolution of organic compounds along pn and anammox processes was characterized by gc ms and eem the variation of pn and anammox sludge properties relating to cod reduction such as sludge morphology eps and microbial compositions was also identified the main conclusions can be drawn as follows ao sbr removed 32 9 of nitrogen by denitrification and am egsb removed 52 9 of nitrogen mainly by anammox reaction 53 18 of cod including most of oxygen containing organic compounds proteins and humic acids was removed in ao sbr by denitrification and adsorption am egsb removed 22 15 of cod hydrocarbons compounds were recalcitrant and composed most of the effluent cod the organics in reject water stimulated the growth of filamentous bacteria and increased the proteins polysaccharides ratio of eps in ao sbr and am egsb which would enhance the hydrophobicity of bacteria surface enlarge the size of pn and anammox sludge and promote the adsorption and degradation of organic compounds in reject water reject water stimulated the growth of denitrifying bacteria such as ottowia and denitratisoma

17709,reject water contains complex components of organic compounds which have significant influences on the nitrogen removal performance when treated using biological autotrophic nitrogen removal technology in this study a two stage partial nitritation pn anammox floc granule system was established to treat reject water cod nh4 n 0 97 0 15 and the evolution of organic compounds along pn and annamox bioreactors was investigated using gas chromatography mass spectrometry and excitation emission matrix also the variation of pn and anammox sludge properties relating to cod reduction was examined the pn anammox system removed approximately 80 of total inorganic nitrogen and cod with hydraulic reaction time of 16 h the influent organics 330 600 mg cod l in reject water were primarily composed of volatile protein like and humic acid like organic compounds pn process contributed 53 18 of the overall cod removal primarily including oxygen containing organics e g phenol proteins and humic acids anammox process contributed 22 15 of the overall cod removal but large molecule acids e g lactic acid and small molecule alcohols e g glycerol were reoccurred contributing to the effluent cod with recalcitrant hydrocarbons e g n octadecane reject water increased the extracellular proteins polysaccharides ratio of pn and anammox sludge promoting the adsorption and degradation of organic compounds high throughput sequencing results showed that denitrifying bacteria of ottowia increased from 0 03 to 14 4 in pn reactor and of denitratisoma increased from 9 6 to 15 4 in anammox reactor the occurrence of these denitrifiers might mitigate the negative impact of organics to functional organisms this study highlights the organics fate during pn anammox treatment system which is important to maintain the robust nitrogen removal when treating organics containing and high ammonium concentration wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reject water organic compounds evolution partial nitritation anammox denitrification nitrogen removal 1 introduction reject water which is composed of digester supernatant and sludge dewatering liquor is the wastewater produced from the treatment of sludge hu et al 2017 torà et al 2014 this wastewater is usually recycled to the inlet of wastewater treatment plant and mixed with the influent for treatment torà et al 2014 however reject water is characterized by high ammonium concentration 500 1500 mg n l and a low chemical oxygen demand cod n ratio 1 100 1000 mg cod l which is highly unfavorable for nitrogen removal by conventional nitrification and heterotrophic denitrification chen et al 2015 peng et al 2012 although its flow rate only accounts for approximately 2 of the total influent flow the reject water contributes to 10 30 of the total nitrogen load of a wastewater treatment plant choi et al 2019 van loosdrecht and salem 2006 therefore it can be a good option to treat reject water separately to reduce the nitrogen load of the mainline processes and achieve the stringent nitrogen discharge standards peng et al 2012 the novel and promising autotrophic anammox process opens a new door for nitrogen removal from reject water owing to several economic benefits lackner et al 2014 van der star et al 2007 indeed numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the feasibility of using partial nitritation pn and anammox processes to treat reject water galí et al 2007 lackner et al 2012 strous et al 1997 torà et al 2014 van der star et al 2007 in a fluidized bed anammox reactor treating reject water 82 ammonium removal efficiency and 99 nitrite removal efficiency were achieved strous et al 1997 in 2002 the first full scale anammox reactor was successfully set up in rotterdam netherlands treating partially nitritated reject water with a design load of 7 1 kg n m3 d van der star et al 2007 then a sequencing batch reactor sbr and a chemostat type of reactor were compared to treat reject water and produce a suitable influent for anammox process galí et al 2007 both reactors produced a 50 50 ammonium nitrite effluent but the sbr had a higher nitrogen conversion rate of 1 1 kg n m3 d than that of the chemostat reactor of 0 35 kg n m3 d while the chemostat reactor was more stable when nh4 n concentration fluctuated later oxidation reduction potential was recommended as a main indicator to maintain stable operation of a single stage pn and anammox system when treating reject water lackner et al 2012 stable effluent for anammox was also produced through a new control loop by manipulating the influent flow rate when treating reject water with a nitrogen loading rate of 5 0 1 0 kg n m3 d torà et al 2014 clearly most studies on the pn anammox system treatment of reject water have only focused on the nitrogen transformation lackner et al 2012 strous et al 1997 van der star et al 2007 or the control strategies for pn process galí et al 2007 torà et al 2014 and few have involved in the evolution of organic compounds along the process procedure which however is important for the robust operation of the pn anammox process as reject water also contains amount of organic compounds lackner et al 2012 peng et al 2012 it should be noted that the influences of organic compounds on the pn and anammox processes depend heavily on its composition jenni et al 2014 the organic compounds in reject water usually compose of toxic organics such as phenolics substances biodegradable volatile fatty acids refractory organics such as humic substances and high molecular weight proteins and particulate organics lu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 toxic organics have a direct toxic effect on aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anammox bacteria lyu et al 2019 biodegradable organics can stimulate the proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria which have a competition effect on aob and anammox bacteria towards oxygen substrate and living space li et al 2020 refractory and particulate organics can limit the diffusion of substrate zhang et al 2018 influent total organic carbon toc concentration above 50 mg l seriously inhibited the activity of anammox bacteria when treating reject water li et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 investigated four organic fractions in reject water soluble cod particulate cod large colloidal cod and small colloidal cod separately using batch tests and they found that soluble cod directly inhibited aob while particulate and colloidal cod indirectly inhibited aob by causing diffusion limitation for anammox bacteria they were mainly directly inhibited by soluble cod in long term operation the occurrence of organic compounds could stimulate the proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria under aeration condition and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria under anoxic condition which would degrade the toxic organic compounds and improve the nitrogen removal efficiency in pn anammox systems in a one stage pn and anammox system treating reject water 60 70 cod was removed possibly due to the adsorption and biodegradation reactions and stable nitrogen removal performance could still maintain lackner et al 2012 yang et al 2015 in another two stage pn and anammox system 30 and 15 of toc were removed by pn process and anammox process respectively with a steady total nitrogen removal efficiency of 90 zhang et al 2010 the degradation of toxic organic compounds is essential to maintain the activity of autotrophic aob and anammox bacteria although these studies have illustrated that the pn anammox system could reduce the organics concentrations of reject water lackner et al 2012 yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 it is still unclear which part of organics can be reduced from the perspective of chemical composition and how these organics are reduced and subsequently impact the performance of the pn anammox system therefore the evolution of organic compounds along pn anammox processes is urgently required to be investigated further in this study a laboratory scale two stage pn and anammox system was established to assess their feasibility to simultaneous removal of nitrogen and organic compounds from reject water a two stage pn anammox system was chosen to mitigate the negative impacts of organics on the post anammox process and investigate the effects of organics towards aob and anammox bacteria separately special attention had been payed to the organic compounds evolution along the pn and anammox bioreactors using gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms and three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem gc ms was carried out to analyze the relatively volatile and thermo stable organic compounds while 3d eem was used to investigate the fluorescent organic compounds the influences of reject water on the sludge properties such as sludge morphology extracellular polymeric substances eps composition and microbial activity and composition were also identified this study for the first time provided deep insights into the evolution of organic compounds along pn and anammox treatment processes and the variation of pn and anammox sludge properties relating to cod reduction the results are expected to provide useful guidance for the manipulation of the full scale employment of pn and anammox system to treat organic containing and high ammonium concentration wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactors and seeding sludge fig 1 presents a schematic diagram of the pn and anammox processes the pn process was carried out in an anoxic oxic 20 420 min sbr ao sbr with an effective volume of 2 l and the cycle pattern for the ao sbr is shown in fig s1 the sludge retention time was controlled at 10 15 days oxygen was regularly supplied to the bottom of ao sbr using a fine bubble diffuser controlled by a rotor flow meter the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the aeration phase was controlled in the range of 0 8 1 8 mg l the reactor was mixed using a propeller stirrer at 150 rpm the effluent of ao sbr was stored in a storage tank and continuously fed to a modified expanded granular sludge bed reactor ni et al 2019 performing anammox process am egsb with an effective volume of 1 l diameter 50 mm height to diameter ratio 10 2 fig 1 the liquid upflow velocity was controlled at 5 1 m h the temperatures of both reactors were controlled at 33 1 c using a thermostatic water jacket ao sbr was inoculated with floc sludge in a granule floc sbr system performing one stage pn and anammox processes in our laboratory and it was cultured using inorganic synthetic wastewater for 265 days before treating reject water am egsb was inoculated with anammox granules from another egsb in our laboratory which was dominant by candidatus kuenenia wang et al 2019 the reactor was separately cultured using inorganic synthetic wastewater for 220 days before treating reject water the compositions of the synthetic inorganic wastewaters for ao sbr and am egsb are detailed in si s1 2 2 operational strategies reject water produced by sludge dewatering liquor was collected from a wastewater treatment plant with anaerobic sludge digestion procedure in shanghai china the characteristics of reject water are listed in table s1 to eliminate the effect of sudden increase of organic compounds on the reactor performance from day 266 on reject water and inorganic synthetic wastewater were mixed as influent for ao sbr at a ratio of 1 3 this mixture ratio changed to 1 2 and 2 1 at day 267 and 270 respectively and reject water was directly used as the influent at day 275 from day 317 on when the effluent of ao sbr had stable ammonium and organic concentrations fig 2 a c and e it was stored in a storage tank and used as the influent for am egsb from an economic point of view we did not adjust the ph of the reject water 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 gc ms analysis the organic compounds in wastewater were firstly extracted using dichloromethane as described by kunacheva et al 2017 extractive with a volume of 1 µl was injected into the gc ms system 7890gc 5795ms agilent with a hp 5 column the temperature of

conditions were as follows excitation and emission slit widths 5 nm excitation wavelength 240 to 400 nm in 5 nm increments emission wavelength 290 to 450 nm in 2 5 nm increments 2 3 3 eps extraction and composition analysis eps of pn and anammox sludges were extracted separately using a modified heat method according to yu et al 2008 and li and yang 2007 the contents of proteins and humic acids were analyzed by a modified lowry method using bovine serum albumin and humic acids as standards respectively the content of polysaccharides was measured by the anthrone method using glucose as a standard bo et al 1996 2 3 4 activity assays the activities of aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were characterized by oxygen uptake rate ex situ as described by surmacz gorska et al 1996 specifically the activity of aob was represented by specific ammonia uptake rate saur while that of nob was represented by specific nitrite uptake rate snur specific anammox activity saa was determined in situ in am egsb specifically the influent pump was shut down and the reflux pump was adjusted to increase the upflow velocity to 10 m h the initial nh4 n and no2 n concentrations were

concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were determined using ion chromatography ics 5000 thermo usa cod was measured by photometric measurements dr 1000 hach usa dissolved organic carbon doc was analyzed using an organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu japan specific morphology characterization of sludge was executed with a stereoscopic microscope szx 16 olympus japan and a scanning electron microscope sem s4800 hitachi japan sludge size was analyzed by a malvern laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 uk ph was monitored using a ph probe multimate 350i wtw germany 2 4 16s rdna sequencing microbial community composition was analyzed using high throughput sequencing in short total genomic dna was extracted in triplicate using a power soil dna isolation kit sangon china according to the manufacturer s instructions the v3 v4 region of 16s rdna was amplified from the dna extracts using bacterial universal primers 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 pcr amplifications were performed in a dna thermocycler geneamp 9700 abi usa microbial community was analyzed using illumina miseq platform majorbio china these sequences with 97 similarity cutoff were clustered into the same operational taxonomic unit the 16s rdna sequences obtained in this study were deposited in ncbi with accession number prjna636938 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term performance of the pn anammox system with the influent ammonium cod and doc concentrations in reject water respectively fluctuated in the range of 400 600 mg n l 330 600 mg l and 100 200 mg l the combination of pn and anammox processes could achieve a stable effluent with ammonium nitrite nitrate concentrations of 13 5 8 9 0 64 3 8 1 mg n l respectively and with cod and doc concentrations of 198 45 and 50 14 mg l respectively the combination of pn and anammox processes could remove 83 2 of total inorganic nitrogen tin 74 6 of cod and 78 5 of doc in reject water 3 1 1 nitrogen and carbon removal performance of ao sbr fig 2a c and e shows the evolution of nitrogen and organic concentrations in the pn reactor the ao sbr was fed with reject water and operated for 129 days 266 394 d by gradually increasing the proportion of reject water the ao sbr achieved a stable state 317 394 d with the effluent ammonium and nitrite concentrations stabilizing at 145 18 and 163 21 mg n l respectively fig 2a the mean ratio of no2 n nh4 n in the effluent was 1 13 0 11 which is suitable for the subsequent anammox treatment almost no nitrate was detected in the effluent indicating a successful control of nob actually none of nob was detected in the pn sludge by analysis of the microbial composition details in section 3 3 3 additionally a high inorganic nitrogen loss occurred in the ao sbr with the tin removal efficiency tinre of 32 9 although the influent cod and doc fluctuated at 600 330 and 200 100 mg l respectively during 317 394 d the effluent cod and doc concentrations were stable at 198 45 and 50 14 mg l of the ao sbr fig 2c and e specifically the ao sbr could removal 53 18 of influent cod and 62 16 of influent doc the high concentration of organic compounds in reject water could stimulate the growth of denitrifying bacteria which might result in the simultaneously high removal efficiency of tin cod and doc yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 indeed the 16s rdna sequencing results revealed that the relative abundance of ottowia a kind of denitrifying bacteria in ao sbr increased from 0 03 to 14 4 details in section 3 3 3 3 1 2 nitrogen and carbon removal performance of am egsb when the ao sbr reached a stable state the effluent of the ao sbr was subsequently treated by the am egsb 317 394 d as shown in fig 2b d and f the am egsb had a good adaptability to the effluent of the ao sbr the effluent ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations of the am egsb were 13 5 8 9 0 and 64 3 8 1 mg n l respectively fig 2b the tin removal rate and tinre of am egsb were stable at 0 71 0 10 kg n m3 d and 75 4 respectively with the tin loading rate of 0 94 0 11 kg n m3 d the ratio of δno2 n δnh4 n was 1 26 0 14 similar to the theoretical values of 1 32 the ratio of δno3 n δnh4 n in am egsb was 0 45 0 08 higher than the theoretical value of 0 26 which might be due to the increase in nob abundance and activity details in section 3 4 3 the anammox reactor could also remove some of the organic compounds i e approximately 41 17 of influent cod 22 15 of the total cod in reject water and 38 19 of influent doc 18 17 of the total doc in reject water were removed with the effluent cod and doc stable at 113 20 and 30 3 mg l respectively fig 2d and f this removal of the organic compounds could also be attributed to the occurrence of denitrifying bacteria in the am egsb which was further confirmed in section 3 4 3 taken together the combined pn and anammox processes could removal approximately 80 of tin cod and doc fig s2 nevertheless approximately 64 3 8 1 mg no3 n l was residual in the effluent which needs to be removed by adding a post heterotrophic denitrification reactor the ao sbr contributed 32 9 of total tin removal and 53 18 of total cod removal the am egsb contributed 52 9 of total tin removal and 22 15 of total cod removal clearly most organic compounds had been removed in the ao sbr and the evolution of organic compounds was further comprehensively discussed in section 3 2 3 2 evolutions of organic compounds in ao sbr and am egsb in order to gain a deeper understanding of how the organic compounds evolved in the pn anammox system gc ms and eem analyses were carried out in terms of volatile organic compounds and fluorescent organic substances mainly protein like and humic acid like organic compounds the peak intensities of gc ms and eem were used for semi quantitative analysis sheng and yu 2006 wu and zhou 2010 3 2 1 volatile organic compounds evolution revealed by gc ms the relatively volatile and thermo stable organic compounds in the influent of ao sbr pinf effluent of ao sbr peff also is the influent of am egsb and effluent of am egsb aeff were analyzed using gc ms results showed that the hydrocarbon compounds in influent and effluent were almost unchanged but most of the oxygen containing organic compounds could be removed in the ao sbr fig 3 in the subsequent am egsb large molecule acids and small molecule alcohols could be reoccurred by the microbial metabolism fig 3b as shown in fig 3 the detected compounds were classified as hydrocarbon compounds and oxygen containing organic compounds for hydrocarbon compounds the intensities were almost the same in pinf peff and aeff fig 3a reflecting the recalcitrant property of these hydrocarbon compounds lu et al 2018 large amounts of hydrocarbons have been found in sludge anaerobic digestion process lu et al 2018 which might be caused by the anaerobic degradation of biomass wu and zhou 2010 for oxygen containing organic compounds small molecule acids 3 methylbutyric acid and valeric acid large molecule alcohols tridecyl alcohol phenolics substances phenol p cresol 3 5 dimethylphenol dodecyl acrylate and 2 3 dimethoxybenzaldehyde were only detected in pinf fig 3b suggesting that these organic compounds had been degraded by the microbes in ao sbr the intensities of large molecule acids lactic acid and palmitic acid decreased from pinf to peff but increased again in aeff while stearic acid was only detected in aeff therefore ao sbr had a low removal efficiency on large molecule acids while am egsb could increase the concentration of large molecule acids by microbial metabolism small molecule alcohols 1 2 propanediol and glycerol were detected in pinf and aeff but not detected in peff suggesting that these molecules could be totally degraded in ao sbr but reoccurred in am egsb by microbial metabolism the bio degradation of organic compounds especially the toxic compounds such as phenol ensured the stable nitrogen transformation of ao sbr and am egsb fig 2a and b phenolics substances were all degraded in ao sbr in accordance with the increased ottowia in ao sbr who are capable of degrading phenolic substances and denitrify details in section 3 3 3 felföldi et al 2010 3 2 2 protein like and humic acid like organic compounds evolution revealed by eem protein like and humic acid like organic compounds were analyzed using eem and results showed that the fluorescence intensity decreased dramatically from pinf to peff but slightly increased from peff to a eff fig 4 a c the protein like and humic acid like organic compounds were also mostly removed by ao sbr fig 4 to be specific only one peak with high fluorescence intensity was found in the raw reject water pinf fig 4a this peak was at excitation emission wavelengths of 275 nm 297 5 nm which was generally thought to be tyrosine and protein like substances table s2 chen et al 2003 however the previous gc ms results had showed that pinf had quantities of phenol p cresol and 3 5 dimethylphenol fig 3b these phenolics substances which all were monocyclic aromatic compounds had a similar π π conjugated double bond structure with tyrosine and could enhance the intensity of fluorescent peaks of tyrosine and protein like substances wang and zhang 2010 after treated by ao sbr none of phenol p cresol and 3 5 dimethylphenol was detected in peff fig 3b simultaneously the fluorescence intensity of tyrosine and protein like substances at excitation emission wavelengths of 275 nm 300 nm decreased by 90 from 521 391 to 53 209 table s2 the decrease in the fluorescence intensity might also be caused by the removal of tyrosine and protein like substances due to the decrease of fluorescence intensity of tyrosine and protein like substances at excitation emission wavelengths of 275 nm 300 nm the fluorescent peaks for polyaromatic humic acid like substances and marine humic acids appeared in peff fig 4b chen et al 2003 wang and zhang 2010 these two fluorescent peaks for humic acid like substances might be distorted and covered by the high fluorescence intensity of tyrosine and protein like substances in pinf after treated by am egsb the fluorescence intensity of the aeff increased although cod and doc decreased from peff to aeff fig 4c and table s2 this might be caused by the different ph values in the peff and aeff previous studies had reported that the fluorescence intensity of humic acid substances increases with the increase of ph in the range of 2 10 sheng et al 2008 therefore the higher ph of aeff 6 9 than peff 6 1 might had led to the higher fluorescence intensity of aeff in order to quantitatively assess the evolution of polysaccharides proteins and humic acids in reject water the anthrone method and a modified lowry method were used to measure the concentration of polysaccharides and proteins and humic acids respectively as shown in fig 4d the concentration of polysaccharides seemed almost unchanged from pinf to peff and aeff with the values maintaining at 9 mg l but the concentrations of proteins and humic acids decreased from 65 0 7 and 112 0 9 to 15 0 4 and 38 0 5 mg l and decreased by 77 and 61 from pinf to peff respectively after treated by ao sbr after treated by am egsb the concentration of proteins and humic acids further decreased to 14 1 4 and 29 1 4 mg l with the decrease percentage of 2 5 and 7 6 fig 4d respectively it comes that the proteins and humic acids substances had been mostly removed by ao sbr in accordance with the eem results fig 4a c the higher proteins and humic acids concentrations in pinf than peff led to the higher increase of fluorescence intensities of protein like and humic acid like substances in pn sludge eps after treating reject water than that of anammox granular eps details in sections 3 3 2 and 3 4 2 combined with the results of gc ms and eem it could be concluded that most oxygen containing organics 77 of protein like and 61 humic acid like organics were removed in ao sbr which was consistent with the higher cod removal efficiency of 53 18 in ao sbr as mentioned in section 3 1 3 3 the pn sludge properties variation and microbial structure shift after fed with reject water the variation of sludge properties would directly affect the wastewater treatment efficiency in this study sludge morphology eps and microbial compositions of pn sludge and anammox granules were compared before and after fed with reject water 3 3 1 effect of reject water on the pn sludge morphology the morphology of pn sludge cultured with synthetic wastewater or reject water was shown in fig s3a d after treatment of reject water the pn sludge structure became denser and sludge aggregates obviously occurred the size of the sludge flocs significantly increased from 140 to 296 μm fig s4a this might be due to the addition of flocculating agent such as cationic polyacrylamide during sludge dewatering process wirtz and dague 1997 the presence of flocculating agent in the reject water could promote the electrostatic adsorption and adsorption bridging between bacteria and thus stimulated the aggregation of flocculent pn sludge sem results showed that the bacteria in both sludge samples were mainly coccus fig s5a d the surface of sludge treating synthetic wastewater was smooth with clear outline but treating reject water caused a lot of sticky material on the surface of bacteria which might be eps later was proved in section 3 3 2 filamentous bacteria were also observed in the sludge sample treating reject water fig s5b and d the organic compounds in reject water could stimulate the growth of heterotrophic bacteria including filamentous bacteria which could provide a skeleton for bacterial aggregation and thus stimulate the increase in the sludge size 3 3 2 effect of reject water on the eps properties of pn sludge eps of microorganisms plays a significant role in pollutant migration and transformation during wastewater treatment sheng et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 as shown in fig 5 a after treating reject water the polysaccharides concentration of pn sludge eps decreased from 21 5 1 0 to 6 2 0 2 mg g vss while the proteins and humic acids concentrations of pn sludge eps increased from 29 2 0 2 and 8 0 1 2 to 120 6 2 5 and 38 6 2 2 mg g vss respectively the decrease in polysaccharides and increase in proteins led to the proteins polysaccharides ratio increased significantly from 1 4 0 1 to 19 4 0 6 fig 5a the increased proteins polysaccharides ratio might be due to the secretion of extracellular enzymes by heterotrophic bacteria to degrade organic compounds miao et al 2018 previous studies have shown that the hydrophobic part of eps was mainly composed of proteins while the hydrophilic part was mainly polysaccharides jorand et al 1998 the increase in the proteins polysaccharides ratio could enhance the hydrophobicity of bacteria surface further promote the adsorption and degradation of organic compounds in reject water indeed a high cod of approximately 250 mg l was removed by ao sbr figs 2c moreover the increased proteins polysaccharides ratio could also lead to the larger pn sludge size fig s4a eem spectra further showed that the fluorescence intensities of protein like and humic acid like substances in loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps were increased after treating reject water fig 6 a d the detected humic acid like substances included marine humic acids with emission wavelengths in the ultraviolet region 400 nm and polyaromatic and polycarboxylate type humic acid like substances with emission wavelengths in the visible region 400 nm the marine humic acids and polyaromatic humic acid like substances with the emission wavelength located in the ultraviolet region were mainly identified in the pinf and peff of ao sbr fig 4a c and the weak peak of polycarboxylate type humic acid like substances was only observed in tb eps under the synthetic wastewater condition fig 6c therefore the marine humic acids and polyaromatic humic acid like substances might be adsorbed from the reject water while the polycarboxylate type humic acid like substances might be secreted by the bacteria under the stimulation of organic compounds hence some kinds of organic compounds such as humic acids could be removed by physical adsorption also fig 4 showed that most proteins and humic acids substances in reject water had been removed by ao sbr so we deduced that a fraction of them could be adsorbed by the pn sludge eps which led to a high increase of fluorescence intensities of protein like and humic acid like substances in the pn sludge eps fig 6a d 3 3 3 effect of reject water on nitrification activity and microbial composition of pn sludge after fed with reject water the activity of aob in ao sbr slightly decreased by 5 from 90 0 0 4 to 85 2 0 9 mg nh4 n g mlvss h p 0 02 0 05 fig 5b the activity of nob was still controlled at a low level of 0 35 0 27 mg no2 n g mlvss h indicating the stable operation of pn process with reject water the high ammonium concentration of 400 600 mg n l in the reject water might have enhanced the suppression of nob the microbial communities of pn sludge when treating synthetic wastewater and reject water are shown in fig 7 a and b at the phylum level proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi were the three most abundant microorganisms in the sludge samples fig 7a proteobacteria are common in the wastewater treatment system and most aob and part of nob are affiliated to this phylum the relative abundance of proteobacteria decreased from 58 to 28 after treating reject water while that of bacteroidetes increased from 25 to 61 and became the dominant microorganisms in the ao sbr bacteroidetes are considered to be highly adaptable which could degrade high molecular weight polymeric compounds with a preference for growth on granule surface fernández gómez et al 2013 at the genus level nitrosomonas was the only known genus detected in the two samples that is directly related to ammonia oxidation but the relative abundance of nitrosomonas decreased from 22 to 0 3 after fed with reject water fig 7b the dominant bacteria also changed from nitrosomonas to norank f ns9 marine group with the relative abundance of 41 surprisingly the activity of aob only decreased by 5 and ao sbr still maintained excellent pn performance indicating that other bacteria in this system had been responsible for the ammonia oxidation marine group is an uncultured branch of bacteria found in marine ecosystems and might participate in the nitrogen cycle in ocean wright et al 2014 the norank f ns9 marine group occurred in this study might be a new aob genus with ammonia oxidation function when nitrosomonas could not adapt to the complex water quality of reject water norank f ns9 marine group with a strong adaptability gradually occupied the dominant position ottowia which could degrade phenolic substances and denitrify felföldi et al 2010 became the second most abundant microbes 14 4 fig 7b their abundance might contribute greatly to the decreased toxic phenolics substances in ao sbr as reveled by gc ms fig 3b comamonas and rhodanobacter also occurred with the relative abundance of 4 6 and 0 02 which have denitrification function fig 7b the growth of these denitrifying bacteria could well explain the high removal efficiency of organic compounds in ao sbr fig 2c and e taken together our results suggest that denitrification and adsorption played an important role in the cod reduction reject water stimulated the secretion of eps of pn sludge which increased the bacterial hydrophobicity and favored the adsorption and degradation of organic compounds reject water also selected the growth of denitrifying bacteria ottowia which could degrade phenolic substances these findings elucidated the high cod removal efficiency in ao sbr from the perspective of the microbes section 3 1 3 4 the anammox sludge properties variation and microbial structure shift after fed with reject water 3 4 1 effect of reject water on anammox granular morphology after fed with reject water the size shape and color of anammox granules became more diversified fig s3e h granules with black or brown colors gradually appeared which might be due to the growth of heterotrophic bacteria the particle size of granules was polarized and a few bigger granules and a lot of smaller flocs appeared but the sludge was still dominated by large size granules with the peak granule size rising from 1183 to 1343 μm fig s4b the peak granule size of small flocculent sludge decreased from 174 to 153 μm the formation of larger granules might be due to the increased proteins polysaccharides ratio in eps details in section 3 4 2 and the enhanced cell surface hydrophobicity under the stimulation of organic compounds in the influent peff which might be more conducive to the aggregation of bacteria under the stress of organic compounds such as phenols yang et al 2013 also found the particle size of anammox granule sludge increased and even reached 15 6 mm sem images revealed that there were a lot of filamentous bacteria growth on the granule surface after treating reject water fig s5e h accordingly the increase in the proportion of sludge with smaller size fig s4b might be caused by the over proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria that caused granule disintegration 3 4 2 effect of reject water on anammox granular eps properties the eps contents of anammox granules are shown in fig 5c after fed with reject water the content of proteins in anammox granular eps increased by 9 from 35 1 5 to 38 0 2 mg l the content of humic acids increased by 25 from 13 0 6 to 16 0 1 mg l while the content of polysaccharides decreased by 67 from 8 0 1 to 3 0 1 mg l this resulted in an increase in the proteins polysaccharides ratio from 4 0 2 to 14 0 5 similar to that of pn sludge with the increase in the extracellular proteins polysaccharides ratio the bacteria surface hydrophobicity increased which might increase the granule size fig s4b and promote the adsorption and degradation of hydrophobic organic compounds in the peff eem spectra of anammox granular eps are shown in fig 6e h for the lb eps tyrosine and protein like substances and marine humic acids peaks with stronger fluorescence intensity occurred after fed with reject water fig 6f indeed ye et al 2011 also reported that bacteria tend to produce more lb eps under unfavorable environments different from the ao sbr there were no peaks of polyaromatic and polycarboxylate type humic acid like substances for the anammox granular eps as the marine humic acids peaks were observed in both peff and aeff the increased marine humic acids peak in lb eps might be absorbed by anammox granules from reject water suggesting that adsorption had contributed to a part of reduction of cod in the studied am egsb moreover the increase of fluorescence intensities of protein like and humic acid like substances in anammox granular eps after treating reject water was lower than that of pn sludge possibly due to the lower proteins and humic acids concentrations in peff than that of pinf fig 4 3 4 3 effect of reject water on anammox activity and microbial composition of anammox granules similar to the sludge in the ao sbr the activity of anammox sludge also decreased by 27 from 0 13 0 005 to 0 10 0 007 g n g vss d after fed with reject water fig 5d which might be caused by the presence of organic compounds such as humic acids and low ph value 6 1 in peff the inhibition of organic compounds on aob might be due to the direct toxicity of organic compounds e g phenolics substances and the competition of heterotrophic bacteria while the inhibition on anammox bacteria might be caused by the competition of heterotrophic bacteria the influent organic compounds in reject water had posed certain negative influences on both aob and anammox bacteria and these influences were greater on anammox bacteria than that on aob regardless most of organic compounds having been removed by the prior ao sbr meanwhile the low ph value of 6 1 for peff could also inhibit anammox activity as a suitable ph for anammox bacteria is 6 7 8 3 strous et al 1999 the microbial composition of am egsb changed slightly after treating reject water fig 7c and d at the phylum level planctomycetes chloroflexi and proteobacteria were the three most abundant microorganisms in both sludge samples fig 7c after fed with reject water the relative abundance of anammox related planctomycetes slightly decreased from 49 to 42 and that of aob and nob related proteobacteria slightly increased from 20 to 26 at the genus level candidatus kuenenia unclassified f brocadiaceae denitratisoma and nitrospira were detected in both samples that related to nitrogen conversion fig 7d candidatus kuenenia and unclassified f brocadiaceae were constantly two major anammox microorganisms in the am egsb after fed with reject water the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia increased slightly from 14 to 15 and the relative abundance of unclassified f brocadiaceae decreased from 29 to 22 it is speculated that candidatus kuenenia could adapt to the change in the living environment but unclassified f brocadiaceae was greatly affected by the complex organic compounds and low ph value indeed miao et al 2018 had found that candidatus kuenenia dominated the known anammox genus due to its high substrate affinity and better adaptability to landfill leachate and the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia in biofilms increased from 3 to 12 in the present study the relative abundance of denitratisoma and nitrospira increased from 9 6 and 0 9 to 15 4 and 1 4 respectively denitratisoma as a kind of denitrifying bacteria could participate in the degradation of organic compounds cao et al 2016 which might contribute to the reduction of organic compounds in the am egsb fig 2d and f nitrospira as a kind of nitrite oxidizing bacteria liu and wang 2013 could led to the high nitrate concentration in the effluent fig 2b the increase in nitrospira might be caused by two reasons i the residual oxygen in the effluent of ao sbr ii the relatively low ph and low ammonium concentration in peff that could not inhibit the proliferation of nitrospira the variation of denitrifying bacteria in ao sbr and am egsb corresponded well with the variation of organic compounds in pinf and peff fig 3b as the influent cod was mostly removed by the prior ao sbr reject water seemed to have less influences on anammox granules than on pn sludge in terms of eps properties and microbial composition figs 5 6 and 7 exploring of the impacts of reject water on pn and anammox sludge properties can deepen our understanding on organic compounds evolution mechanism and further favor the full scale application of the two stage pn and anammox system to treat reject water 3 5 future perspectives in this study the ammonium and cod concentrations of reject water fluctuated from 400 to 600 mg n l and 330 to 600 mg l respectively with a cod n ratio stable at 0 97 0 15 the combination of pn and anammox processes shown good adaptability to the reject water fig s2 although organic compounds in reject water affected the morphology activity eps and microbial compositions of pn and anammox sludges the nitrogen and organic compounds could be simultaneously removed with excellent efficiency of approximately 80 in our study organic compounds including oxygen containing volatile small molecule acids large molecule alcohols phenolics substances protein like and humic acid like organics were mostly removed in pn process therefore these organic compounds might have a more prominent impact on the properties of pn sludge while the left refractory organics mainly hydrocarbons compounds had a more prominent impact on the properties of anammox sludge such organic compounds impact requires careful consideration for pn anammox processes when treating reject water meanwhile there were approximately 110 mg l cod mainly refractory organics such as hydrocarbons compounds and 60 mg n l no3 fig 2b and d residual in the effluent so future studies are required to efficiently remove the refractory organics and nitrate for instance use partial denitrification ji et al 2020 or dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium approaches castro barros et al 2017 or recycle a fraction of effluent to the influent of pn process to remove the residual nitrate and use advanced oxidation technology to remove refractory organics besides the shift of microbial community structure in ao sbr and the exact role of norank f ns9 marine group occurred in the reject water treatment system also warrant further investigation 4 conclusions in this study a two stage pn anammox system was stably operated to remove 83 of tin and 74 of cod from reject water for the first time the evolution of organic compounds along pn and anammox processes was characterized by gc ms and eem the variation of pn and anammox sludge properties relating to cod reduction such as sludge morphology eps and microbial compositions was also identified the main conclusions can be drawn as follows ao sbr removed 32 9 of nitrogen by denitrification and am egsb removed 52 9 of nitrogen mainly by anammox reaction 53 18 of cod including most of oxygen containing organic compounds proteins and humic acids was removed in ao sbr by denitrification and adsorption am egsb removed 22 15 of cod hydrocarbons compounds were recalcitrant and composed most of the effluent cod the organics in reject water stimulated the growth of filamentous bacteria and increased the proteins polysaccharides ratio of eps in ao sbr and am egsb which would enhance the hydrophobicity of bacteria surface enlarge the size of pn and anammox sludge and promote the adsorption and degradation of organic compounds in reject water reject water stimulated the growth of denitrifying bacteria such as ottowia and denitratisoma which might contribute to organic compounds removal and protect the activity of aob and anammox bacteria declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
