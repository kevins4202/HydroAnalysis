related caret package showed that the competent model was rf followed by sgb and knn the worst performance models were cart and svm accordingly rf was used as the reference model for the probability mapping of ac in the study area indicating the 29 618 km of the study area included in the predicted high ac and this zone mainly distribute in the eastern part and a small spot in the north the ac probability map developed in the study could be used for drilling successful artesian flowing wells with minimal efforts and cost and thus for efficient managing of this important system graphical abstract image 1 keywords artesian conditions hydrogeology machine learning iraq 1 introduction groundwater is an important water resource in the northeastern part of maysan province ali al gharbi and al teeb areas of southern iraq it is used mainly in various agricultural and industrial activities and is the only available source of water to supply villages with potable water after treatment through reflective osmosis ro stations the groundwater wells scattered in this area are drilled in the quaternary deposits mukdadiya and bai hassan lower and upper bakhtiari formations generally the groundwater of mukdadiya and bai hassan is characterized by its abundance and good quality compared to groundwater in the quaternary deposits and is usually deeper there is also a distinct system of flowing artesian wells which are found in an undetermined pattern fig 1 a flowing artesian well is a well that taps into an aquifer where the pressure inside the aquifer causes groundwater to rise above the land surface naturally without the use of a pump there are two types of situations in which flowing artesian wells can be found 1 the aquifer is confined in nature 2 the aquifer is not confined but the static water level is above the land surface artesian conditions ac can arise for geological and topographical reasons or by topographical factors alone it is a natural system that is different from groundwater spring or traditional groundwater systems despite the importance of this system in terms of groundwater quality and quantity there are no studies to determine the probability distribution of ac due to the scarcity of hydrogeological and structural studies and the difficulty of obtaining the data needed for conducting such a study in the light of these determinants geospatial analysis coupled with machine learning ml models can introduce a suitable solution to overcome these difficulties ml algorithms are applications of artificial intelligence that offer systems the ability to learn and improve from experience without explicit programming the aim is to enable computers to automatically learn without human assistance to adapt subsequent actions accordingly bishop 2006 because of their predictive capability ml algorithms are the most widely used in groundwater potential mapping al abadi et al 2019 arabameri et al 2019 rizeei et al 2019 termeh et al 2019 lee et al 2019 naghibi et al 2017 park et al 2017 al abadi et al 2016 lee and lee 2015 ozdemir 2011 spring potential mapping chen et al 2019 naghibi et al 2019 kordestani et al 2019 mousavi et al 2017 naghibi dshtpagerdi 2017 naghibi pourghasemi 2016 and risk assessment of groundwater contamination by nitrate nolan et al 2015 sajedi hosseini et al 2018 ransom et al 2017 rodriguez galiano et al 2014 in this research an attempt has been made for the first time for mapping the ac in the northern maysan governorate where this system is found via investigating the relationship between the geographical locations of flowing non flowing artesian wells and different explanatory factors that are believed to control the ac in the study area to achieve this purpose five ml classifiers were utilized the stochastic gradient boosting sgb classification and regression trees cart support vector machine with radial basis kernel function svm radial random forest rf and k nearest neighbor knn the consequence of this study was a map of the probability that delineate the ac that decision makers hydrogeologist and institutional agencies may use to manage the aquifer system sustainably and to drill productive artesian flowing wells in the area under consideration 2 the study area the area of this study is located in maysan province southern iraq between 32 11 32 39 n and 46 52 47 34 e and covers an area of 2152 km2 fig 1 the elevation increases from southeast to northeast and ranges 8 to 260 m fig 1 the area has no distinguishing features except hemrin hills along the iraq iran border al teeb river whose headwaters are in iranian territory runs from the north and ends at hor al sanaf outside the boundaries of the considered area al abadi et al 2017 the river is ephemeral during summer the climate is usually characterized as very hot the average temperature during july and august can reach 50 c and it is a dry season as well it s slightly cold and rainy in the winter the rain normally falls between november and april in the winter and spring months the annual average rainfall total for the period 1980 to 2018 is 102 mm geologically the quaternary deposits appear in large parts of the study area especially the middle ones whereas the tertiary formations mukdadiya and bai hassan formations are exposed in areas adjacent to the iraq iran border and bend hill fig 2 the quaternary deposits comprised of fluviatile lacustrine and aeolian sediments the bai hassan formation is characterized by thick layers of conglomerates inter bedded with sandstone siltstone and claystone buday 1980 the mukdadiya formation comprised mainly from sandstone gravely sandstone and mudstone almost red jassim and goff 2006 the depositional environment of this formation is fluvial in a rapidly subsiding foredeep basin bellen et al 1959 from the tectonic point of view the largest part of the study area is located in the mesopotamian zone a unit of the stable shelf a small part of the study is located within the unstable zone hemrin hills the study area contains buried faults beneath the quaternary deposits cover buday and jassim 1987 the pattern of these faults is northeast southwest in the eastern part and north south in the middle fig 2 the aquifer system consists of three main aquifers separated by two aquitards the hydraulic connection between these aquifers is possible across the aquitards especially between the first shallow aquifers and middle aquifers the thickness of the first shallow aquifer is variable and increases towards the south and southeast parts al abadi et al 2016 the quality of groundwater of this part is generally brackish total dissolved solids tds 3000 ppm todd and mays 2005 the second aquifer is within the bai hassan formation and extends over the whole of the study area it is comprised of gravel sand silt in addition to silt the aquifer is semi confined and its average thickness is 15 125 m the aquifer saturated thickness decreases towards the south and southwest of the study area and attains its highest thickness in the north and northeast the groundwater of this part is also brackish 1000 3000 ppm tds the third aquifer confined aquifer is within the mukdadiya formation and is mainly comprised of gravel and sand this aquifer s depth is 70 m the ac is related to this aquifer and the overlying bai hassan water bearing layers the groundwater of this part is very fresh tds 600 ppm and suitable even for drinking especially in northeastern parts close to the al zubidat area usually the drilling wells penetrate both the first and second aquifers and the produced groundwater is a mixture of these aquifers the groundwater flows from the elevated area in the northeast towards the plain area in the southwest 3 materials and techniques used 3 1 workflow the process of delineating ac shown in fig 3 is divided into four levels 1 preparing an inventory map of artesian flowing non flowing wells using a comprehensive field survey and archival data of the general groundwater commission ggc of maysan governorate 2 selecting and preparing explanatory factors affecting the occurrence of ac based on expert opinion data availability and nature of the study area 3 applying ml classifiers in the r statistical platform and 4 mapping the probability of ac using the best performance ml model 3 1 1 flowing non flowing wells inventory map based on the extensive field survey with the team of the gcg of maysan governorate an inventory map of the non flowing and flowing artesian wells was prepared fig 4 7 flowing artesian wells were accounted along with 32 non flowing wells the flow rates of the flowing wells are generally high 6 l s at the zubidat area and close to the bend hill fig 4 the high flow rate in these areas may be attributed to their proximity to the recharge area in the adjacent iranian territory and the large thickness of bai hassan and mukdadiya formations on the contrary the low rate 1 2 6 l s of flowing wells was recorded in the ali al gharbi and buzrikan areas the groundwater of the flowing wells in the teeb area is generally good tds 1000 ppm compared to groundwater in ali al gharbi tds 3000 the average nearest neighboring technique was used to describe the spatial pattern of the flowing artesian wells in the study area through this technique the distance between each flowing well and its closest neighbor s is calculated the average of these distances is then computed if the calculated average is below the average of a hypothetical probability distribution the normal distribution the distribution of the flowing wells will be clustered conversely if the average of the hypothetical distribution is greater than the average the pattern of the flowing wells is dispersion clark and evans 1954 handhal et al 2019 mathematically if we have n of flowing wells in area a the mean observed distance d o is calculated as 1 d o i 1 n d i n where d i is the observed distance between a flowing well and its closest neighbor by contrast the mean expected distance d e is calculated as oyana and margai 2016 2 d e 0 5 a n 0 0514 0 041 n b n where b is the perimeter of the a the nearest neighbor ratio nnr is calculated by 3 n n r d o d e the spatial pattern of flowing wells is said to be cluster and dispersion if nnr is 1 and 1 respectively the nnr is determined using the average nearest neighbor function in arcgis 10 5 fig 5 it is equal to 0 488 therefore the flowing wells spatial pattern is a cluster and the estimated distance between artesian wells is 8 7 km comparing the cluster pattern of the flowing wells with the fault s distribution showed that the structural factor might play a decisive role in the emergence of ac in the study area as most of these wells are located along or close to these faults 3 1 2 explanatory factors in the absence of previous studies on the spatial delineation of ac globally the expert opinions the nature of the study area and data availability were adopted as a basis for selecting explanatory factors affecting the ac in the study area the explanatory factors chosen are mainly dependent on the topography hydrogeology and geology of the area under study the factors chosen involved the distance to the faults fdis fault density fden lineament density lden elevation above mean sea level the aquifer saturated thickness st and the well depths wd the fdis and fden maps were prepared based on the tectonic map of iraq with a scale of 1 1 000 000 and the work of abdulnaby et al 2016 and abdulnaby 2018 the faults were manually drawn as feature class using the arcgis 10 5 software and then the euclidian distance and line density modulus of spatial analysis extension were utilized to create the distance to faults and faults density map respectively fig 6 a and b it is clear from fig 6a that most of the flowing wells are located either on or near the faults and in both the northeast southwest and northwest southeast directions by examining the fden map fig 6b it is obvious that the density of faults is extremely low and the high density is concentrated in the bend and buzrkan areas where there are two flowing wells the low density of the faults and the pattern of their propagation do not indicate the relationship between these variables it may indicate the secondary role that this factor plays in the emergence of ac in the study area lineaments are straight or roughly linear features that are widely distributed across the earth s surface and are closely linked to underground geological structures such as faults cleavages fractures and various discontinuity surfaces o leary et al 1976 the number of lineaments and their spatial pattern within an area can provide worthy information related to natural resource availability geologic structures tectonic and hazard assessment ni et al 2016 three landsat 8 image scenes table 1 was downloaded from the united state geological survey earthexplorer com web site to use in preparing the lineaments layer different enhancement techniques were applied before extract the lineaments including principal components analysis pca band rationing rgb band combinations and different stretch after extract the lineaments the line density modulus available in the arcgis software was utilized to create the layer of the lineament s density fig 6c in general the lineament s density is low and concentrated in the middle of the study area and somewhat far from the locations of the flowing wells this may give the impression that this factor also plays a secondary role in the ac existence the lineament orientations are northeast southwest and slightly in northwest southeast direction fig 6c the well drilling logs at maysan s gcg were used to prepare the st and wd maps fig 6d and e the st ranges 30 53 59 52 m with an average 43 34 m the aquifer system has the highest st in the al zubidat area and al bend hill where four flowing wells exist along the iraq iran border in ali al gharbi the st decreases towards the northeast and southwest of the study area on the contrary the st ranges 30 56 105 61 m with an average 60 m the highest st values concentrate in the northern part ali al gharbi area and low values in the remaining parts in general there is no clear relation between the distribution of the flowing wells and st 3 1 3 pre steps before applying ml since the number of flowing artesian wells 7 wells in the study area is much lower than the number of non flowing wells 32 wells with a ratio of 0 2 0 8 ml used here to develop the predictive models may fail to achieve adequate accuracy because of the imbalance classification data set problem with this problem ml algorithms tend to be unstable and they result in biased predictions and misleading accuracy the reason behind this is that the ml algorithms do not receive the requisite minority class information to make an accurate prediction handhal et al 2019 the widest method to deal with the imbalanced dataset is the sampling approaches such methods are generally intended to use a mechanism to change an imbalanced dataset to a balanced one it occurs by changing the size of the initial dataset to retain the same equilibrium ratio there are different versions of sampling methods including oversampling undersampling both synthetic data generation and cost sensitive learning in our case both scheme was utilized the rose package of r software was utilized for applying the both scheme in this scheme the minority class is oversampled with replacement and the majority class is undersampled without replacement handhal et al 2019 using the trial and error procedure the number of instances was optimized to be 70 instances 34 for flowing and 36 for non flowing points the total number of balanced data was then randomly divided into two datasets 70 of data was used to train the models and 30 was used to test the developed models the r statistical and its related caret package were used for applying the ml algorithms in this study 3 2 techniques used 3 2 1 feature selection the problem of feature selection fs relates to the selection of the most influential factors in constructing more predictive models by identifying irrelevant and redundant features it is an important step to build more accurate ml models three forms of fs are available including filter wrapper and embedded al abadi et al 2019 each with its advantages and disadvantages in this study a boruta wrapper algorithm breiman 2001 liaw and wiener 2002 was used to pick the most important features and their significance when predicting ac the boruta algorithm iteratively removes features that are proven to be less relevant by a statistical test than random probes kursa and rudnicki 2010 3 2 2 ml algorithms gradient boosting gb is an ml algorithm for solving problems of regression and classification by generating a predictive model in the form of an ensemble of weak predictive models typically decision trees dts like other boosting techniques it creates the predictive model in a stage wise manner and generalizes it by enabling optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function friedman 1999 suggested a minor modification to the gb driven by breiman s technique of bootstrap aggregation bagging and called the new method stochastic gradient boosting sgb with that change friedman noted a significant enhancement in the accuracy of gradient boosting the sbg generally results in accurate and robust prediction friedman 2002 with low overfitting effects brenning 2005 it can also work with a range of independent variables continuous categorical binary and ordinal elith et al 2008 usage of sbg in groundwater potential spring is usually very small naghibi and pourghasmi 2016 mousavi et al 2017 naghibi et al 2019 lee et al 2019 and there is no study yet to map the ac the math behind this technique can be found in friedman 1999 and friedman 2002 cart is a recursive partitioning algorithm seeks to explore the training data structure to produce easily understandable decision rules breiman et al 1984 cart produces a decision tree dt based on a binary partitioning algorithm the divided the data recursively until groups are either homogeneous or have fewer observations than the user defined threshold aertsen et al 2010 naghibi et al 2019 a dt is a flowchart like structure in which each internal node represents a test on an attribute each branch is the outcome of the test and each leaf node is a class label the paths from the root to the leaf are the classification rules svm is a group of supervised kernel based ml algorithms that can be used for analyzing of regression and classification problems svm is built based on the theory of statistical learning and the vapnik chervonekis dimension theory vapnik 1995 in svm the input vector is mapped into a multi dimensional space larger than the original one using kernel functions kfs using a separate hyperplane concept svm maximizes the margin and achieve a good generalization ability dou et al 2019 the selection of kf and its parameters are critical for effective svm use different types of kn are available and the most commonly used in the literature are linear radial basis function polynomial and sigmoid the selection of kn is closely related to the essence and characteristics of the problem being analyzed arabgol et al 2016 the radial basis kernel was used for the analysis as many studies indicate its effectiveness in hydrogeological studies compared to other kernel functions khalil et al 2005 arabgol et al 2016 rf on the other hand is an ensemble supervised ml algorithm for handling both classification and regression tasks with the use of multiple dt and a bootstrap aggregation technique in rf about 2 3 of the learning samples are used for training while the rest 1 3 named as out of bag oob is used for validation purposes rf uses the gini index gi to evaluate the best split threshold of input values for given classes cracknell and reading 2014 compared with the parent node the gi returns a measure of class heterogeneity within child nodes breiman et al 1984 the rf has many advantages including the high capability to handle the missing values the resistance to the overfitting and its ability to accept a large spectrum of data such as numeric categorical binary etc the rf also can estimate the importance of factors in the construction of a predictive model by analyzing how much the prediction error increases as the oob for the factor permutes while other factors remain unchanged catnai et al 2013 knn is a non parametric supervised algorithm that can be used for classification or prediction problems the knn predicts a new sample from the training set using k closest samples kuhn and johnson 2013 to classify or predict a new case the knn relies on finding similar cases in the training data shumeli et al 2018 these neighbors are then utilized to predict the new case by voting for classification or averaging for prediction the knn is robust to noisy training data and is quite successful when a large enough training dataset is given mitchell 1997 the main advantage of knn is its simplicity and lack of parametric assumptions shumeli et al 2018 3 2 3 model performance criteria five statistical error measurements were employed to examine the performance of the predictive models used in this study accuracy kappa receiver operating characteristic curve roc sensitivity and specificity a detailed description of these measures was explained in appendix i 4 results and discussion 4 1 feature selection using boruta table 2 and fig 7 show the results of the application of the fs using the boruta package it is clear that all the factors used are important and the most important factor is fdis followed by fden wd st elevation and lden therefore all factors were used in further analysis of ac the obtained results of this stage of the analysis are consistent with the analysis of the average nearest neighbor technique section 3 1 1 which proved the importance of structural setting representing here by fdis and fden in the emergence of ac in the study area 4 2 models application for applying sgb the gbm function in the carte package was used four hyperparameters should be tuned for optimizing the performance of this algorithm these were the number of iterations i e trees denoted as n trees in the gbm function the complexity of the growing trees interaction depth in gbm function the learning rate which controls how quickly the gbm adapted shrinkage parameters and the minimum number of training set samples in a node to commence splitting n minobsinnode parameter the random search method was selected to implement the tuning process the best result of gbm was acquired using 100 1 0 1 and 10 for n trees interaction depth shrinkage and n minobsinnode respectively the overall accuracy of the gbm model in the training stage table 3 was 0 96 and the kappa statistic was 0 916 almost perfect model the ability of the model in classifying flowing well and non flowing well cases sensitivity and specificity were 0 966 and 0 916 respectively in terms of area under the roc curve auc the obtained auc was 0 983 excellent model after successfully training the gbm model the test data set was passed to the gbm function and the results of the statistical index based evaluation were shown in table 3 the accuracy kappa sensitivity specificity and auc were 0 85 0 70 substantial model 0 70 1 00 and 0 78 good model examining the powerful factors in developing ac using the gbm model fig 8 a indicated that fdis is the most powerful factor followed by st elevation wd the less important factors were fden and lden the rpart package was used for applying the cart algorithm the random search was also used for tuning the complexity parameter cp of the algorithm for the optimized results the cp was 0 313 the accuracy and kappa for the best performance model in the training stage were 0 79 and 0 57 moderate performance model table 3 the specificity and specificity were 0 883 and 0 633 respectively the model in this stage has a good capability for classifying flowing well sensitivity 0 883 and a moderate capability specificity 0 633 in classifying the non flowing wells the auc in the trained cart model was 0 758 good model the cart model used only the fdis factor to create decision trees fig 9 the other factors have no role in controlling ac emergence therefore their importance was zero the test dataset was then passed into the cart model to check its predictive capability and the findings were reported in table 3 the accuracy and kappa were 0 85 and 0 7 respectively the auc was 0 851 overall the performance of the cart model in this stage was better than the model in the training stage overfitting problem the reason may be attributed to the small number of instances used in the training and testing of the model to fit the rf algorithm the rf function of the caret package was used the most important hyperparameters of this function that must be tuned to get the best results are the mtry and ntree the mtry refers to the number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split and ntree is the number of trees to be grown al abadi et al 2019 the best performance model of rf has 2 and 100 for mtry and ntree respectively for the best rf model in the training stage the overall gotten accuracy and kappa were 0 963 and 0 928 almost perfect respectively the trained rf model has an excellent capability for classifying flowing and non flowing wells with 0 950 and 0 966 for sensitivity and specificity respectively the model also described as an excellent model according to the auc 0 991 measure the behavior of the rf model in the testing stage was similar to that in the training stage with 0 900 0 800 0 800 1 000 and 0 983 for accuracy kappa sensitivity specificity and auc respectively examining the variable s importance of the factors using this algorithm fig 8b indicated that fdis was the most important one followed by fden sw lden wd and finally elevation the structural factors fdis and fden play a decisive role in regulating ac within the study area according to the result of this algorithm to use svm for modeling ac conditions in the study area the svmradial function of the caret package was used the random search approach was used for tuning the hyperparameters of this function ie the cost function c and sigma σ the c determines the trade off between the complexity of decision rule and the frequency of error cortes and vapnik 1995 on the other hand σ affect the smoothness of the svm s and hence the complexity and generalization ability of the network horváth 2003 the c and σ for the fitted svm model were 0 5 and 0 06 respectively the svm model s overall accuracy at this point was 0 776 and the kappa statistics were 0 563 fair model table 3 the sensitivity and specificity of the svm model were 0 766 and 0 850 respectively the model has an auc of 0 958 an excellent model in terms of this measure for the testing stage the capability of the svm model dropped significantly the accuracy decreases to 0 650 and the kappa seriously dropped to 0 300 fair model in the same manner the capability of the svm for classifying flowing and non flowing cases was poor 0 700 and 0 600 for sensitivity and specificity respectively in terms of auc the model is regarded as a very good one auc 0 800 the knn algorithm was implanted using the knn function of the caret package to optimize the performance of this function one hyperparameter was tuned namely the number of neighbors to query to make a prediction k the optimized results were gotten by k 9 table 3 the accuracy of the knn model in the training stage was 0 803 the kappa was 0 621 moderate performance model the ability of the knn model for classifying flowing and non flowing wells was very good sensitivity and specificity were 0 866 and 0 883 respectively after the successful training of the knn algorithm the test data set was passed to the algorithm and the results were shown in table 3 the overall accuracy and kappa were 0 700 and 0 400 fair performance model respectively the knn model still very good in classifying the flowing well cases sensitivity 0 800 but it is the ability to classify non flowing well decreasing specificity 0 600 the model in terms of auc was described as a very good model auc 0 820 4 3 models comparison and mapping of ac to select the best performance model for mapping the probability of ac the used models were compared by the test dataset which is the most certain case of a model s effectiveness for prediction and estimation problems comparing the models using the accuracy metric table 3 revealed that the best model was rf accuracy 90 followed by both sgb and cart accuracy 85 both the knn and svm radial models achieved low accuracy accuracy 70 the worst model was svm radial with only 65 accuracy examination of the models in terms of kappa statistics gave models that can be described as substantial for rf sgb and cart and fair for svm and knn in terms of roc it can be said that sgb and svm were good performance models cart and knn were a very good model while rf was excellent the rf model was used to map ac based on those results the preference of rf in the hydrogeological studies is not new as many researchers have proved this both in the studying of groundwater potential and spring potential mapping al abadi et al 2019 naghibi et al 2019 naghibi et al 2019 al abadi et al 2016 cutler et al 2007 this study also proved that this algorithm has advantages for mapping the ac a matter that is different from traditional groundwater potential and spring mapping in terms of its existence and factors influencing it the simplicity of rf structure and parameter lacking assumption robustness to noisy data and outliers the easily easy handling of different data types make this algorithm the best for the best choice for solving complex non linear problems the probability prediction of the rf model for the training and testing stages were interpolated using ordinary kriging interpolation techniques to demonstrate the spatial distribution of ac in the study area fig 10 the interpolated probability values were categorized into three zones using natural break classification scheme low moderate high areas occupied by these zones were 721 km2 33 817 km2 0 38 and 618 km2 0 29 the high probability of ac encompasses the eastern part of the study area and a small area of the north this map can be used by specialists and decision makers to drill artisan flowing wells with minimal efforts and without the need for expensive exploratory drilling programs to avoid drilling unsuccessful artesian wells it is recommended to avoid drilling in all areas of medium or low probabilities 5 conclusions structural and topographical conditions typically control the emergence of ac in an area in ac the pressure within the aquifer forces the groundwater to rise above the land surface naturally without a pump when a well penetrates this aquifer the presence of ac provides an easy opportunity to drill wells that can be invested with little efforts and relatively low costs despite the importance of these hydrogeological systems there are still no studies to delineate their spatial distribution because of the scarcity of hydrogeological studies and the difficulty of obtaining data for example geophysical data for conducting such studies for these reasons the geospatial model supported by ml models provides a suitable solution to study these systems by analyzing the relationship between the locations of the flowing wells and factors that control the ac such as structural topographical and other aquifer s related factors in this study an area in southern iraq where this system exists was chosen for modeling the ac using ml algorithms and the geospatial modeling paradigm in the beginning an inventory map of the flowing and non flowing wells was prepared based on the extensive field survey six factors that influence the ac were also prepared based on data availability and expert opinions the selected factors included fdis fden lden wd st and elevation the spatial pattern of the flowing wells in the study area was first studied using the average nearest neighbor approach this step of the analysis indicated that the flowing wells distributed in a cluster mode the average nearest ratio 0 48 the significance of the influencing ac factors in building the ml models was tested using the boruta package this step showed that all factors were relevant and worthy the most important factor was fdis followed by fden wd and st the less important factors were elevation and lden the results of this analysis confirmed that the structural setting in the study area is more likely to develop ac than the topographical role ml models were run using the r software package and its related caret package the performance of the ml models was compared using five evaluation error statistics namely accuracy kappa sensitivity specificity and roc results showed that the rf model was the best in terms of all error statistics used followed by cart and sgb the rf model was used for the probability mapping of ac the probability values were categorized into three zones low moderate and high the high zone covers 29 of the study area about 618 km2 and distributed in the eastern and northern parts of the study area the ac probability map produced in this research could be used as a guide for drilling productive flowing wells in the study area and contribute significantly to the sustainable management of this aquifer the main limitation of this study is that the aquifer being studied needs a conceptualization model for defining the aquifer architecture and the effect of faults distribution on the emerging of ac a geophysical study using the seismic refraction method or electric method is of importance here to define the boundaries of aquifers in the study area and define a suitable architecture for the water bearing layers and delineate the faults and its impact on the emerging ac declaration of competing

along with six explanatory factors were used the chosen factors were the distance to faults fdis faults density fden lineament density lden aquifer saturated thickness st well depths wd and ground surface elevation examining the spatial pattern of flowing wells using the average nearest neighbor approach showed that the distribution of these wells is a cluster average nearest ratio 0 48 testing the powerful factors in building the models using the boruta package indicated that all factors play a role in controlling the emergence of ac five statistical error measures were employed to examine the predictive capability of the models used namely accuracy kappa receiver operating characteristic curve roc sensitivity and specificity applying the ml models in the r statistical package and its related caret package showed that the competent model was rf followed by sgb and knn the worst performance models were cart and svm accordingly rf was used as the reference model for the probability mapping of ac in the study area indicating the 29 618 km of the study area included in the predicted high ac and this zone mainly distribute in the eastern part and a small spot in the north the ac probability map developed in the study could be used for drilling successful artesian flowing wells with minimal efforts and cost and thus for efficient managing of this important system graphical abstract image 1 keywords artesian conditions hydrogeology machine learning iraq 1 introduction groundwater is an important water resource in the northeastern part of maysan province ali al gharbi and al teeb areas of southern iraq it is used mainly in various agricultural and industrial activities and is the only available source of water to supply villages with potable water after treatment through reflective osmosis ro stations the groundwater wells scattered in this area are drilled in the quaternary deposits mukdadiya and bai hassan lower and upper bakhtiari formations generally the groundwater of mukdadiya and bai hassan is characterized by its abundance and good quality compared to groundwater in the quaternary deposits and is usually deeper there is also a distinct system of flowing artesian wells which are found in an undetermined pattern fig 1 a flowing artesian well is a well that taps into an aquifer where the pressure inside the aquifer causes groundwater to rise above the land surface naturally without the use of a pump there are two types of situations in which flowing artesian wells can be found 1 the aquifer is confined in nature 2 the aquifer is not confined but the static water level is above the land surface artesian conditions ac can arise for geological and topographical reasons or by topographical factors alone it is a natural system that is different from groundwater spring or traditional groundwater systems despite the importance of this system in terms of groundwater quality and quantity there are no studies to determine the probability distribution of ac due to the scarcity of hydrogeological and structural studies and the difficulty of obtaining the data needed for conducting such a study in the light of these determinants geospatial analysis coupled with machine learning ml models can introduce a suitable solution to overcome these difficulties ml algorithms are applications of artificial intelligence that offer systems the ability to learn and improve from experience without explicit programming the aim is to enable computers to automatically learn without human assistance to adapt subsequent actions accordingly bishop 2006 because of their predictive capability ml algorithms are the most widely used in groundwater potential mapping al abadi et al 2019 arabameri et al 2019 rizeei et al 2019 termeh

et al 2014 in this research an attempt has been made for the first time for mapping the ac in the northern maysan governorate where this system is found via investigating the relationship between the geographical locations of flowing non flowing artesian wells and different explanatory factors that are believed to control the ac in the study area to achieve this purpose five ml classifiers were utilized the stochastic gradient boosting sgb classification and regression trees cart support vector machine with radial basis kernel function svm radial random forest rf and k nearest neighbor knn the consequence of this study was a map of the probability that delineate the ac that decision makers hydrogeologist and institutional agencies may use to manage the aquifer system sustainably and to drill productive artesian flowing wells in the area under consideration 2 the study area the area of this study is located in maysan province southern iraq between 32 11 32 39 n and 46 52 47 34 e and covers an area of 2152 km2 fig 1 the elevation increases from southeast to northeast and ranges 8 to 260 m fig 1 the area has no distinguishing features except hemrin hills along the iraq iran border al teeb river whose headwaters are in iranian territory runs from the north and ends at hor al sanaf outside the boundaries of the considered area al abadi et al 2017 the river is ephemeral during summer the climate is usually characterized as very hot the average temperature during july and august can reach 50 c and it is a dry season as well it s slightly cold and rainy in the winter the rain normally falls between november and april in the winter and spring months the annual average rainfall total for the period 1980 to 2018 is 102 mm geologically the quaternary deposits appear in large parts of the study area especially the middle ones whereas the tertiary formations mukdadiya and bai hassan formations are exposed in areas adjacent to the iraq iran border and bend hill fig 2 the quaternary deposits comprised of fluviatile lacustrine and aeolian sediments the bai hassan formation is characterized by thick layers of conglomerates inter bedded with sandstone siltstone and claystone buday 1980 the mukdadiya formation comprised mainly from sandstone gravely sandstone and mudstone almost red jassim and goff 2006 the depositional environment of this formation is fluvial in a rapidly subsiding foredeep basin bellen et al 1959 from the tectonic point of view the largest part of the study area is located in the mesopotamian zone a unit of the stable shelf a small part of the study is located within the unstable zone hemrin hills the study area contains buried faults beneath the quaternary deposits cover buday and jassim 1987 the pattern of these faults is northeast southwest in the eastern part and north south in the middle fig 2 the aquifer system consists of three main aquifers separated by two aquitards the hydraulic connection between these aquifers is possible across the aquitards especially between the first shallow aquifers and middle aquifers the thickness of the first shallow aquifer is variable and increases towards the south and southeast parts al abadi et al 2016 the quality of groundwater of this part is generally brackish total dissolved solids tds 3000 ppm todd and mays 2005 the second aquifer is within the bai hassan formation and extends over the whole of the study area it is comprised of gravel sand silt in addition to silt the aquifer is semi confined and its average thickness is 15 125 m the aquifer saturated thickness decreases towards the south and southwest of the study area and attains its highest thickness in the north and northeast the groundwater of this part is also brackish 1000 3000 ppm tds the third aquifer confined aquifer is within the mukdadiya formation and is mainly comprised of gravel and sand this aquifer s depth is 70 m the ac is related to this aquifer and the overlying bai hassan water bearing layers the groundwater of this part is very fresh tds 600 ppm and suitable even for drinking especially in northeastern parts close to the al zubidat area usually the drilling wells penetrate both the first and second aquifers and the produced groundwater is a mixture of these aquifers the groundwater flows from the elevated area in the northeast towards the plain area in the southwest 3 materials and techniques used 3 1 workflow the process of delineating ac shown in fig 3 is divided into four levels 1 preparing an inventory map of artesian flowing non flowing wells using a comprehensive field survey and archival data of the general groundwater commission ggc of maysan governorate 2 selecting and preparing explanatory factors affecting the occurrence of ac based on expert opinion data availability and nature of the study area 3 applying ml classifiers in the r statistical platform and 4 mapping the probability of ac using the best performance ml model 3 1 1 flowing non flowing wells inventory map based on the extensive field survey with the team of the gcg of maysan governorate an inventory map of the non flowing and flowing artesian wells was prepared fig 4 7 flowing artesian wells were accounted along with 32 non flowing wells the flow rates of the flowing wells are generally high 6 l s at the zubidat area and close to the bend hill fig 4 the high flow rate in these areas may be attributed to their proximity to the recharge area in the adjacent iranian territory and the large thickness of bai hassan and mukdadiya formations on the contrary the low rate 1 2 6 l s of flowing wells was recorded in the ali al gharbi and buzrikan areas the groundwater of the flowing wells in the teeb area is generally good tds 1000 ppm compared to groundwater in ali al gharbi tds 3000 the average nearest neighboring technique was used to describe the spatial pattern of the flowing artesian wells in the study area through this technique the distance between each flowing well and its closest neighbor s is calculated the average of these distances is then computed if the calculated average is below the average of a hypothetical probability distribution the normal distribution the distribution of the flowing wells will be clustered conversely if the average of the hypothetical distribution is greater than the average the pattern of the flowing wells is dispersion clark and evans 1954 handhal et al 2019 mathematically if we have n of flowing wells in area a the mean observed distance d o is calculated as 1 d o i 1 n d i n where d i is the observed distance between a flowing well and its closest neighbor by contrast the mean expected distance d e is calculated as oyana and margai 2016 2 d e 0 5 a n 0 0514 0 041 n b n where b is the perimeter of the a the nearest neighbor ratio nnr is calculated by 3 n n r d o d e the spatial pattern of flowing wells is said to be cluster and dispersion if nnr is 1 and 1 respectively the nnr is determined using the average nearest neighbor function in arcgis 10 5 fig 5 it is equal to 0 488 therefore the flowing wells spatial pattern is a cluster and the estimated distance between artesian wells is 8 7 km comparing the cluster pattern of the flowing wells with the fault s distribution showed that the structural factor might play a decisive role in the emergence of ac in the study area as most of these wells are located along or close to these faults 3 1 2 explanatory factors in the absence of previous studies on the spatial delineation of ac globally the expert opinions the nature of the study area and data availability were adopted as a basis for selecting explanatory factors affecting the ac in the study area the explanatory factors chosen are mainly dependent on the topography hydrogeology and geology of the area under study the factors chosen involved the distance to the faults fdis fault density fden lineament density lden elevation above mean sea level the aquifer saturated thickness st and the well depths wd the fdis and fden maps were prepared based on the tectonic map of iraq with a scale of 1 1 000 000 and the work of abdulnaby et al 2016 and abdulnaby 2018 the faults were manually drawn as feature class using the arcgis 10 5 software and then the euclidian distance and line density modulus of spatial analysis extension were utilized to create the distance to faults and faults density map respectively fig 6 a and b it is clear from fig 6a that most of the flowing wells are located either on or near the faults and in both the northeast southwest and northwest southeast directions by examining the fden map fig 6b it is obvious that the density of faults is extremely low and the high density is concentrated in the bend and buzrkan areas where there are two flowing wells the low density of the faults and the pattern of their propagation do not indicate the relationship between these variables it may indicate the secondary role that this factor plays in the emergence of ac in the study area lineaments are straight or roughly linear features that are widely distributed across the earth s surface and are closely linked to underground geological structures such as faults cleavages fractures and various discontinuity surfaces o leary et al 1976 the number of lineaments and their spatial pattern within an area can provide worthy information related to natural resource availability geologic structures tectonic and hazard assessment ni et al 2016 three landsat 8 image scenes table 1 was downloaded from the united state geological survey earthexplorer com web site to use in preparing the lineaments layer different enhancement techniques were applied before extract the lineaments including principal components analysis pca band rationing rgb band combinations and different stretch after extract the lineaments the line density modulus available in the arcgis software was utilized to create the layer of the lineament s density fig 6c in general the lineament s density is low and concentrated in the middle of the study area and somewhat far from the locations of the flowing wells this may give the impression that this factor also plays a secondary role in the ac existence the lineament orientations are northeast southwest and slightly in northwest southeast direction fig 6c the well drilling logs at maysan s gcg were used to prepare the st and wd maps fig 6d and e the st ranges 30 53 59 52 m with an average 43 34 m the aquifer system has the highest st in the al zubidat area and al bend hill where four flowing wells exist along the iraq iran border in ali al gharbi the st decreases towards the northeast and southwest of the study area on the contrary the st ranges 30 56 105 61 m with an average 60 m the highest st values concentrate in the northern part ali al gharbi area and low values in the remaining parts in general there is no clear relation between the distribution of the flowing wells and st 3 1 3 pre steps before applying ml since the number of flowing artesian wells 7 wells in the study area is much lower than the number of non flowing wells 32 wells with a ratio of 0 2 0 8 ml used here to develop the predictive models may fail to achieve adequate accuracy because of the imbalance classification data set problem with this problem ml algorithms tend to be unstable and they result in biased predictions and misleading accuracy the reason behind this is that the ml algorithms do not receive the requisite minority class information to make an accurate prediction handhal et al 2019 the widest method to deal with the imbalanced dataset is the sampling approaches such methods are generally intended to use a mechanism to change an imbalanced dataset to a balanced one it occurs by changing the size of the initial dataset to retain the same equilibrium ratio there are different versions of sampling methods including oversampling undersampling both synthetic data generation and cost sensitive learning in our case both scheme was utilized the rose package of r software was utilized for applying the both scheme in this scheme the minority class is oversampled with replacement and the majority class is undersampled without replacement handhal et al 2019 using the trial and error procedure the number of instances was optimized to be 70 instances 34 for flowing and 36 for non flowing points the total number of balanced data was then randomly divided into two datasets 70 of data was used to train the models and 30 was used to test the developed models the r statistical and its related caret package were used for applying the ml algorithms in this study 3 2 techniques used 3 2 1 feature selection the problem of feature selection fs relates to the selection of the most influential factors in constructing more predictive models by identifying irrelevant and redundant features it is an important step to build more accurate ml models three forms of fs are available including filter wrapper and embedded al abadi et al 2019 each with its advantages and disadvantages in this study a boruta wrapper algorithm breiman 2001 liaw and wiener 2002 was used to pick the most important features and their significance when predicting ac the boruta algorithm iteratively removes features that are proven to be less relevant by a statistical test than random probes kursa and rudnicki 2010 3 2 2 ml algorithms gradient boosting gb is an ml algorithm for solving problems of regression and classification by generating a predictive model in the form of an ensemble of weak predictive models typically decision trees dts like other boosting techniques it creates the predictive model in a stage wise manner and generalizes it by enabling optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function friedman 1999 suggested a minor modification to the gb driven by breiman s technique of bootstrap aggregation bagging and called the new method stochastic gradient boosting sgb with that change friedman noted a significant enhancement in the accuracy of gradient boosting the sbg generally results in accurate and robust prediction friedman 2002 with low overfitting effects brenning 2005 it can also work with a range of independent variables continuous categorical binary and ordinal elith et al 2008 usage of sbg in groundwater potential spring is usually very small naghibi and pourghasmi 2016 mousavi et al 2017 naghibi et al 2019 lee et al 2019 and there is no study yet to map the ac the math behind this technique can be found in friedman 1999 and friedman 2002 cart is a recursive partitioning algorithm seeks to explore the training data structure to produce easily understandable decision rules breiman et al 1984 cart produces a decision tree dt based on a binary partitioning algorithm the divided the data recursively until groups are either homogeneous or have fewer observations than the user defined threshold aertsen et al 2010 naghibi et al 2019 a dt is a flowchart like structure in which each internal node represents a test on an attribute each branch is the outcome of the test and each leaf node is a class label the paths from the root to the leaf are the classification rules svm is a group of supervised kernel based ml algorithms that can be used for analyzing of regression and classification problems svm is built based on the theory of statistical learning and the vapnik chervonekis dimension theory vapnik 1995 in svm the input vector is mapped into a multi dimensional space larger than the original one using kernel functions kfs using a separate hyperplane concept svm maximizes the margin and achieve a good generalization ability dou et al 2019 the selection of kf and its parameters are critical for effective svm use different types of kn are available and the most commonly used in the literature are linear radial basis function polynomial and sigmoid the selection of kn is closely related to the essence and characteristics of the problem being analyzed arabgol et al 2016 the radial basis kernel was used for the analysis as many studies indicate its effectiveness in hydrogeological studies compared to other kernel functions khalil et al 2005 arabgol et al 2016 rf on the other hand is an ensemble supervised ml algorithm for handling both classification and regression tasks with the use of multiple dt and a bootstrap aggregation technique in rf about 2 3 of the learning samples are used for training while the rest 1 3 named as out of bag oob is used for validation purposes rf uses the gini index gi to evaluate the best split threshold of input values for given classes cracknell and reading 2014 compared with the parent node the gi returns a measure of class heterogeneity within child nodes breiman et al 1984 the rf has many advantages including the high capability to handle the missing values the resistance to the overfitting and its ability to accept a large spectrum of data such as numeric categorical binary etc the rf also can estimate the importance of factors in the construction of a predictive model by analyzing how much the prediction error increases as the oob for the factor permutes while other factors remain unchanged catnai et al 2013 knn is a non parametric supervised algorithm that can be used for classification or prediction problems the knn predicts a new sample from the training set using k closest samples kuhn and johnson 2013 to classify or predict a new case the knn relies on finding similar cases in the training data shumeli et al 2018 these neighbors are then utilized to predict the new case by voting for classification or averaging for prediction the knn is robust to noisy training data and is quite successful when a large enough training dataset is given mitchell 1997 the main advantage of knn is its simplicity and lack of parametric assumptions shumeli et al 2018 3 2 3 model performance criteria five statistical error measurements were employed to examine the performance of the predictive models used in this study accuracy kappa receiver operating characteristic curve roc sensitivity and specificity a detailed description of these measures was explained in appendix i 4 results and discussion 4 1 feature selection using boruta table 2 and fig 7 show the results of the application of the fs using the boruta package it is clear that all the factors used are important and the most important factor is fdis followed by fden wd st elevation and lden therefore all factors were used in further analysis of ac the obtained results of this stage of the analysis are consistent with the analysis of the average nearest neighbor technique section 3 1 1 which proved the importance of structural setting representing here by fdis and fden in the emergence of ac in the study area 4 2 models application for applying sgb the gbm function in the carte package was used four hyperparameters should be tuned for optimizing the performance of this algorithm these were the number of iterations i e trees denoted as n trees in the gbm function the complexity of the growing trees interaction depth in gbm function the learning rate which controls how quickly the gbm adapted shrinkage parameters and the minimum number of training set samples in a node to commence splitting n minobsinnode parameter the random search method was selected to implement the tuning process the best result of gbm was acquired using 100 1 0 1 and 10 for n trees interaction depth shrinkage and n minobsinnode respectively the overall accuracy of the gbm model in the training stage table 3 was 0 96 and the kappa statistic was 0 916 almost perfect model the ability of the model in classifying flowing well and non flowing well cases sensitivity and specificity were 0 966 and 0 916 respectively in terms of area under the roc curve auc the obtained auc was 0 983 excellent model after successfully training the gbm model the test data set was passed to the gbm function and the results of the statistical index based evaluation were shown in table 3 the accuracy kappa sensitivity specificity and auc were 0 85 0 70 substantial model 0 70 1 00 and 0 78 good model examining the powerful factors in developing ac using the gbm model fig 8 a indicated that fdis is the most powerful factor followed by st elevation wd the less important factors were fden and lden the rpart package was used for applying the cart algorithm the random search was also used for tuning the complexity parameter cp of the algorithm for the optimized results the cp was 0 313 the accuracy and kappa for the best performance model in the training stage were 0 79 and 0 57 moderate performance model table 3 the specificity and specificity were 0 883 and 0 633 respectively the model in this stage has a good capability for classifying flowing well sensitivity 0 883 and a moderate capability specificity 0 633 in classifying the non flowing wells the auc in the trained cart model was 0 758 good model the cart model used only the fdis factor to create decision trees fig 9 the other factors have no role in controlling ac emergence therefore their importance was zero the test dataset was then passed into the cart model to check its predictive capability and the findings were reported in table 3 the accuracy and kappa were 0 85 and 0 7 respectively the auc was 0 851 overall the performance of the cart model in this stage was better than the model in the training stage overfitting problem the reason may be attributed to the small number of instances used in the training and testing of the model to fit the rf algorithm the rf function of the caret package was used the most important hyperparameters of this function that must be tuned to get the best results are the mtry and ntree the mtry refers to the number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split and ntree is the number of trees to be grown al abadi et al 2019 the best performance model of rf has 2 and 100 for mtry and ntree respectively for the best rf model in the training stage the overall gotten accuracy and kappa were 0 963 and 0 928 almost perfect respectively the trained rf model has an excellent capability for classifying flowing and non flowing wells with 0 950 and 0 966 for sensitivity and specificity respectively the model also described as an excellent model according to the auc 0 991 measure the behavior of the rf model in the testing stage was similar to that in the training stage with 0 900 0 800 0 800 1 000 and 0 983 for accuracy kappa sensitivity specificity and auc respectively examining the variable s importance of the factors using this algorithm fig 8b indicated that fdis was the most important one followed by fden sw lden wd and finally elevation the structural factors fdis and fden play a decisive role in regulating ac within the study area according to the result of this algorithm to use svm for modeling ac conditions in the study area the svmradial function of the caret package was used the random search approach was used for tuning the hyperparameters of this function ie the cost function c and sigma σ the c determines the trade off between the complexity of decision rule and the frequency of error cortes and vapnik 1995 on the other hand σ affect the smoothness of the svm s and hence the complexity and generalization ability of the network horváth 2003 the c and σ for the fitted svm model were 0 5 and 0 06 respectively the svm model s overall accuracy at this point was 0 776 and the kappa statistics were 0 563 fair model table 3 the sensitivity and specificity of the svm model were 0 766 and 0 850 respectively the model has an auc of 0 958 an excellent model in terms of this measure for the testing stage the capability of the svm model dropped significantly the accuracy decreases to 0 650 and the kappa seriously dropped to 0 300 fair model in the same manner the capability of the svm for classifying flowing and non flowing cases was poor 0 700 and 0 600 for sensitivity and specificity respectively in terms of auc the model is regarded as a very good one auc 0 800 the knn algorithm was implanted using the knn function of the caret package to optimize the performance of this function one hyperparameter was tuned namely the number of neighbors to query to make a prediction k the optimized results were gotten by k 9 table 3 the accuracy of the knn model in the training stage was 0 803 the kappa was 0 621 moderate performance model the ability of the knn model for classifying flowing and non flowing wells was very good sensitivity and specificity were 0 866 and 0 883 respectively after the successful training of the knn algorithm the test data set was passed to the algorithm and the results were shown in table 3 the overall accuracy and kappa were 0 700 and 0 400 fair performance model respectively the knn model still very good in classifying the flowing well cases sensitivity 0 800 but it is the ability to classify non flowing well decreasing specificity 0 600 the model in terms of auc was described as a very good model auc 0 820 4 3 models comparison and mapping of ac to select the best performance model for mapping the probability of ac the used models were compared by the test dataset which is the most certain case of a model s effectiveness for prediction and estimation problems comparing the models using the accuracy metric table 3 revealed that the best model was rf accuracy 90 followed by both sgb and cart accuracy 85 both the knn and svm radial models achieved low accuracy accuracy 70 the worst model was svm radial with only 65 accuracy examination of the models in terms of kappa statistics gave models that can be described as substantial for rf sgb and cart and fair for svm and knn in terms of roc it can be said that sgb and svm were good performance models cart and knn were a very good model while rf was excellent the rf model was used to map ac based on those results the preference of rf in the hydrogeological studies is not new as many researchers have proved this both in the studying of groundwater potential and spring potential mapping al abadi et al 2019 naghibi et al 2019 naghibi et al 2019 al abadi et al 2016 cutler et al 2007 this study also proved that this algorithm has advantages for mapping the ac a matter that is different from traditional groundwater potential and spring mapping in terms of its existence and factors influencing it the simplicity of rf structure and parameter lacking assumption robustness to noisy data and outliers the easily easy handling of different data types make this algorithm the best for the best choice for solving complex non linear problems the probability prediction of the rf model for the training and testing stages were interpolated using ordinary kriging interpolation techniques to demonstrate the spatial distribution of ac in the study area fig 10 the interpolated probability values were categorized into three zones using natural break classification scheme low moderate high areas occupied by these zones were 721 km2 33 817 km2 0 38 and 618 km2 0 29 the high probability of ac encompasses the eastern part of the study area and a small area of the north this map can be used by specialists and decision makers to drill artisan flowing wells with minimal efforts and without the need for expensive exploratory drilling programs to avoid drilling unsuccessful artesian wells it is recommended to avoid drilling in all areas of medium or low probabilities 5 conclusions structural and topographical conditions typically control the emergence of ac in an area in ac the pressure within the aquifer forces the groundwater to rise above the land surface naturally without a pump when a well penetrates this aquifer the presence of ac provides an easy opportunity to drill wells that can be invested with little efforts and relatively low costs despite the importance of these hydrogeological systems there are still no studies to delineate their spatial distribution because of the scarcity of hydrogeological studies and the difficulty of obtaining data for example geophysical data for conducting such studies for these reasons the geospatial model supported by ml models provides a suitable solution to study these systems by analyzing the relationship between the locations of the flowing wells and factors that control the ac such as structural topographical and other aquifer s related factors in this study an area in southern iraq where this system exists was chosen for modeling the ac using ml algorithms and the geospatial modeling paradigm in the beginning an inventory map of the flowing and non flowing wells was prepared based on the extensive field survey six factors that influence the ac were also prepared based on data availability and expert opinions the selected factors included fdis fden lden wd st and elevation the spatial pattern of the flowing wells in the study area was first studied using the average nearest neighbor approach this step of the analysis indicated that the flowing wells distributed in a cluster mode the average nearest ratio 0 48 the significance of the influencing ac factors in building the ml models was tested using the boruta package this step showed that all factors were relevant and worthy the most important factor was fdis followed by fden wd and st the less important factors were elevation and lden the results of this analysis confirmed that the structural setting in the study area is more likely to develop ac than the topographical role ml models were run using the r software package and its related caret package the performance of the ml models was compared using five evaluation error statistics namely accuracy kappa sensitivity specificity and roc results showed that the rf model was the best in terms of all error statistics used followed by cart and sgb the rf model was used for the probability mapping of ac the probability values were categorized into three zones low moderate and high the high zone covers 29 of the study area about 618 km2 and distributed in the eastern and northern parts of the study area the ac probability map produced in this research could be used as a guide for drilling productive flowing wells in the study area and contribute significantly to the sustainable management of this aquifer the main limitation of this study is that the aquifer being studied needs a conceptualization model for defining the aquifer architecture and the effect of faults distribution on the emerging of ac a geophysical study using the seismic refraction method or electric method is of importance here to define the boundaries of aquifers in the study area and define a suitable architecture for the water bearing layers and delineate the faults and its impact on the emerging ac declaration of competing

aquifers in the monaragala region were collected and analysed for major cations and anions and some selected trace element contents the results revealed that over 65 of the groundwater samples from monaragala area were alkaline the anions in groundwater varied as hco3 cl so4 2 f while cations varied in the order of na ca mg k the majority of the samples 75 belong to the ca2 mg2 hco3 type among the studied parameters electrical conductivity chloride sulphate hardness fluoride exceeded the who recommended values for drinking water in most cases for instance 76 of wells in the study area showed fluoride levels higher than the recommended levels 0 5 mg l for sri lanka the higher ion contents in groundwater were mainly due to dissolution of aquifer minerals and a higher rate of evaporation the calculation of water quality index wqi indicated that over 50 of groundwater samples of the study area are poor in quality the higher values of wqi also overlap with high prevalence areas of ckdu this work revealed that groundwater quality has a direct effect on the etiology of ckdu in the region graphical abstract image 1 keywords ckdu dry zone fluoride metamorphic aquifers monaragala water quality index 1 introduction groundwater is the most important natural resource that is used for drinking purposes in many parts of the world however groundwater cannot be optimally used and sustained unless the quality of groundwater is carefully assessed sadat noori et al 2014 yadav et al 2018 the geochemical characteristics play an important role in groundwater quality which greatly influenced by aquifer characteristics and anthropogenic activities foster and chilton 2003 the quality of groundwater has therefore received immense attention since water with extremely high quality is required for drinking the quality of groundwater can be deteriorated rapidly due to various reasons such as agricultural and industrial activities umar et al 2009 the deterioration of the quality of groundwater threatens human health economic development and social prosperity in a community milovanovic 2007 in recent years numerous studies have revealed the groundwater quality and its suitability for drinking domestic and agricultural purposes rao et al 2012 singaraja 2015 yadav et al 2018 among sources of contamination agriculture has a direct and indirect effect on the groundwater quality therefore understanding the hydrogeochemical processes which take place in aquifer systems in an area is important groundwater resources in sri lanka are becoming highly vulnerable due to increased threats from anthropogenic activities mainly from agriculture related events dissanayake and chandrajith 2009 rubasinghe et al 2015 villholth and rajasooriyar 2010 therefore regular monitoring and characterizing the groundwater quality is utmost important in recent years calculating the water quality index wqi is used widely as a tool to classify and characterize water resources for different activities such as agriculture and drinking purposes among many others brown et al 1972 chowdhury et al 2012 cude 2001 yadav et al 2018 last few decades several mathematical models were introduced to calculate the wqi since it provides comprehensive overview of the quality of water resources the wqi has been used to determine the suitability of water for drinking purposes in many countries such as finland slovakia backman et al 1998 india khangembam and kshetrimayum 2019 ponsadailakshmi et al 2018 yadav et al 2018 iran saeedi et al 2010 tunisia ketata et al 2012 china wu et al 2020 and morocco heiβ et al 2020 in developing countries one of the major challenges is to adapting cost effective pollution control strategies particularly for groundwater ongley and booty 1999 under such circumstances critical water quality parameters can be used to obtain the wqi that transfer quality data into manageable single numbers kannel et al 2007 monaragala area fig 1 is one of the low socio economic regions located in dry zone of sri lanka in which groundwater is the main source of water for domestic and agricultural uses water scarcity is the major problem in the region since rainfall is restricted to few months of the year groundwater in the dry zone region of sri lanka is contaminated mainly due to natural reasons causing certain health problems such as dental and skeletal fluorosis chandrajith et al 2012 2020 ranasinghe et al 2019 and chronic kidney disease with uncertain etiology ckdu balasooriya et al 2019 chandrajith et al 2011 wickramarathna et al 2017 among many others many early studies showed that the emergence of ckdu among rural communities with low socioeconomic status is common among populations who use groundwater for their drinking purposes balasooriya et al 2019 chandrajith et al 2011 jayatilake et al 2013 vlahos et al 2019 wickramarathna et al 2017 therefore the main aim of this study is to determine and evaluate the water quality of monaragala region where endemic ckdu is widespread based on the wqi as a monitoring tool 2 study area monaragala region is located in the eastern sri lanka and the whole district covers an area of 5 587 km2 and located in the transition zone between central highland and lowlands fig 1 mountainous terrain is marked in the western boundary of the region in which the elevation varies between 550 and 1 500 m eastern part of the district is undulating and flat in which the elevation is about 160 m the annual precipitation of the region is about 1000 mm over 85 of rain in the region receives during the north east monsoons in november to january frequent drought conditions in the region create an average evapotranspiration of 1200 mm per annum since the climate is semi arid to subtropical due to low rainfall and high evapotranspiration water scarcity is a major problem in the region the combined effects of low rainfall and high evaporation rate drastically impact on the groundwater storage and water quality consequently the community health over 90 of sri lanka is made up of precambrian high grade metamorphic rocks in which primary porosity and permeability are negligible the study area is also a part of the metamorphic terrain that composed mainly of meta sedimentary and meta igneous rocks with few granitic intrusions migmatites augen gneisses granitic gneisses biotite gneisses and hornblende biotite gneisses are predominant in the region structural discontinuities such as foliations faults shear zones joints and associated deep seated weathering make these rocks good aquifers and which often reach 70 100 m dissanayake and chandrajith 2018 groundwater in this region therefore extracts mostly from the weathered overburden and fractured zones 3 materials and methods for this study 99 groundwater samples were collected from both shallow and deep tube wells covering the entire monaragala district fig 1 all these wells were used for drinking and irrigation purposes without any pre treatments samples were collected into high density polyethylene bottles which were acid soaked overnight and then washed thoroughly with deionized water wells were pumped for several minutes before collecting samples samples were filtered through 0 45 μm syringe filters from which one subsample were acidified till ph reached 2 by adding several drops of ultra pure nitric acid for cation analysis filtered un acidified sample was collected for anion analyses all samples were kept cool at 4 c till the analyses were performed ph electrical conductivity ec temperature total dissolved solids tds and dissolved oxygen were measured on site using pre calibrated multi parameter test kits the h2so4 titrimetric method was used for the determination of total alkalinity all other chemical parameters were determined using standard procedures describe by american public health association apha 2005 nitrate sulphate phosphate and fluoride contents were determined using a hach dr 2700 spectrophotometer major cations na k ca and mg were measured using atomic absorption spectrometer varian 240fs while trace metals al cr mn fe co ni cu zn as sr cd hg and pb were quantified by thermo icapq inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms mercury which is one of the most environmental sensitive element that can be originated from fungicides used in agriculture chandrajith et al 1995 was also determined in all samples but levels were less than 0 001 μg l hence not considered for further discussions 4 calculation of water quality index for the calculation of water quality index wqi ph alkalinity hardness chloride sulphate nitrate phosphate fluoride calcium sodium potassium and magnesium were considered for the calculation the weighted arithmetic wqi method was used as it was used in several early studies chowdhury et al 2012 cude 2001 ponsadailakshmi et al 2018 tripathy and sahu 2005 the wqi can be calculated from the following equations w q i i 1 n w i q i i 1 n w i where w i is the unit weightage of i th water quality parameter and qi is the quality rating scale of the i th parameter and in which q i v i v 0 v s v 0 w i k v s a n d k 1 i 1 n v i where n is the number of water quality parameters considered for the calculation k is a constant vi is the estimated concentration of the ith parameter in the laboratory analysis vo is taken as 7 for ph and for other parameters it was considered as zero chowdhury et al 2012 tripathy and sahu 2005 the vs is the standard value recommended by the sri lanka standards for each considered water quality parameter the computed wqi values are classified into five categories as excellent water wqi 25 good water wqi 25 50 poor water wqi 50 75 very poor water wqi 75 100 and water unsuitable for drinking wqi 100 brown et al 1972 5 result and discussion 5 1 hydrogeochemistry of groundwater the quality of drinking water is very important since it has a direct link with human health dissanayake and chandrajith 1999 in this study region over 90 of the population use groundwater for drinking purposes therefore investigations of quality of groundwater are among the highest priorities the results of studied geochemical parameters are summarized in table 1 and except for few wells most of the parameters were well within the allowed limits for drinking water provided by the who fig 2 who 2011 the mean ph in the study area was 7 20 that ranged from 5 77 to 8 37 while over 65 of the groundwater in the region was alkaline electrical conductivity of the studied samples ranged between 32 and 1892 μs cm median 488 μs cm indicating higher mineralization in most groundwater 88 of the groundwater samples in the region were within the who permissible upper limit of 1500 μs cm who 2011 particularly the area is characterized with fairly low rainfall and high ambient temperature hence more salts can accumulate in groundwater due to excessive evaporation hardness of groundwater in the region varied from 4 0 to 710 mg l as caco3 with mean value of 225 mg l about 41 of wells showed higher hardness than the desirable limit of 250 mg l the anion content of groundwater in the area varied in the order hco3 cl so4 2 f fig 2 among the major anionic constituents in groundwater chloride is one of the important parameters chloride concentrations in the studied samples were ranged from 11 to 271 mg l mean 56 mg l and 7 of samples exceeded the desirable limit of 200 mg l for drinking water who 2011 the so4 2 content in water samples ranged from 1 0 to 190 mg l nitrates and phosphates are also important water quality parameters that originate from anthropogenic activities such as application of fertilizer nitrate n content in water samples from the area varied from 0 10 to 1 9 mg l with a mean value of 1 0 mg l remarkably low levels of nitrate and phosphate mean 0 45 mg l were observed in the study region compared to other agricultural regions in sri lanka rubasinghe et al 2015 the main source of nitrate in groundwater is the use of nitrogen fertilizer particularly for paddy cultivation septic tank leachates and animal husbandry also can contribute nitrates to groundwater however the possibility of contaminating deep groundwater is fairly less from such sources compared to shallow groundwater fluoride is one of the important constituents in drinking water which causes serious health effects mainly dental and skeletal fluorosis and is a potential cause for brain and kidney damages dissanayake and chandrajith 2017 2019 monaragala district is one of the hotspots of high fluoride groundwater chandrajith et al 2012 the fluoride content in the study region varied from 0 02 to 2 93 mg l with the mean value of 1 00 mg l about 77 of the groundwater samples showed fluoride values higher than 0 5 mg l groundwater fluoride in the region is mainly derived by weathering of basement rocks such as hornblende biotite gneisses that contain fluoride bearing minerals chandrajith et al 2012 2020 among major elements the content of ca and mg in groundwater in the study region varied from 1 5 to 206 mg l and 0 6 57 mg l respectively while 5 and 10 of the analysed samples exceed the desirable limits of ca 100 mg l and mg 30 mg l both elements can leach into groundwater due to dissolution of minerals that abundantly found in underlie rocks the concentration of na in water samples in the area were varied from 4 1 to 425 mg l and k content ranged from 0 3 to 7 4 mg l table 1 the concentrations of trace elements al cr mn fe co ni cu zn as sr cd and pb in the groundwater samples were given high priority in the analyses however all these trace elements in majority of samples were below the who accepted guidelines fig 2 among the studied trace elements sr fe and mn are found in higher concentrations compared to others with average levels of 292 133 and 45 4 μg l respectively strontium in groundwater usually associated with ca due to their close chemical similarity although sr can be increased due to salt water interactions sahib et al 2016 the possibility of intruding sea water in the study region is not evident as indicated by the chloride contents therefore other than both ca and mg sr also contributes to the hardness of groundwater in the study area iron and mn content in the groundwater are mostly originated from minerals in high grade metamorphic rocks that are rich with fe bearing minerals such as pyroxenes amphiboles and micas from among the studied trace elements as cd and pb are considered as possible causative factors for chronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology ckdu in dry zone of sri lanka jayatilake et al 2013 in the study area as levels in groundwater samples varied from 0 031 to 2 33 μg l with a mean of 0 31 μg l only one location showed an outlier value of 8 14 μg l but it is also less than the who guideline value of 10 μg l arsenic in natural water in sri lanka is usually associated with sedimentary terrains of marine origin amarathunga et al 2019 bandara et al 2018 but not found in alarmingly high levels in the metamorphic aquifer systems balasooriya et al 2019 wickramarathna et al 2017 5 2 geochemical characteristics of groundwater the chemical composition of groundwater is primarily dependent on the geochemical processes which take place to form groundwater based on the chemical constituents groundwater can be categorized in to different facies hydrogeochemical facies are distinct zones that have cation and anion concentrations describable within defined categories of composition appelo and postma 2005 the hydrogeochemical data can be interpreted using different graphical methods such as piper diagram and durov diagram durov plot provides more information on the hydrogeochemical facies by helping to identify the water types durov 1948 it can also display certain possible geochemical processes that help in understanding quality and evaluation of groundwater the durov plot of monaragala area indicated that 75 groundwater in the region were belong to the ca2 mg2 hco3 facies while 7 9 samples were plotted in the ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 field fig 3 this signifies the dominance of alkaline earths over alkali elements in the region 64 samples also showed the processes of mixing and dissolution while 21 of samples showed ion exchange processes that control the ionicity of groundwater only about 11 of the samples were affected by the reverse ion exchange process the source of chemical constituents in groundwater can also be evaluated using the gibbs plot which is widely used to identify the relationship between water composition and aquifer lithological characteristics gibbs 1970 gibbs plot is based on ratios of either na k na k ca or cl cl hco3 as a function of tds from which distinct fields such as precipitation evaporation and rock water interaction dominance regions can be distinguished in this study modified gibbs plot that based on cation anion ratio vs tds was used to evaluate the mechanism of groundwater evaluation in the region fig 4 most of the samples from the study area fell in the rock water interaction dominance and evaporation dominance fields of the modified gibbs diagram this indicates that when water percolates to the subsurface the water get modified by soil liquid interactions the percentage pollution as defined by percentage of anion ratios in meq l versus na cl ratio is used to evaluate the process involved during the hydrogeochemical evaluation of groundwater in an area as given below pacheco and van der weijden 1996 soumya et al 2013 p o l l u t i o n c l s o 4 2 n o 3 100 c l s o 4 2 n o 3 a l k a l i n i t y fig 5 shows the plot of na and cl ratio versus percentage pollution in which most of the groundwaters collected from shallow and deep wells in the dry zone are affected by weathering shallow wells in the region can easily be contaminated by anthropogenic activities such as fertilizer application compared to deep tube wells based on the geochemical constituents in groundwater obtained from both shallow and deep wells silicate weathering is the main factors influence the major ion concentrations in the groundwater in the region rock weathering is less intense in the dry zone of sri lanka and relatively shallow development of soil profiles can be observed jayasena et al 2008 most of the shallow groundwater in the region is seasonal but aquifers in structural discontinuities such as faults lineaments shears and joins that have deep seated weathering effects are highly productive jayasena et al 2008 5 3 water quality index wqi for the calculation of water quality index wqi ph alkalinity hardness chloride sulphate nitrate phosphate fluoride calcium sodium potassium magnesium and tds were used the wqi values for monaragala region ranged from 1 27 to 334 about 48 of water samples were belonged to the good category while 28 of samples exceeded the wqi of 100 indicating the water is not suitable for drinking purposes fig 6 as indicated by the wqi 13 of water samples were fall in the poor water category while 10 and 21 were in the very poor and unsuitable categories most samples from the northern part of the area were fall in the excellent or good categories while 44 of samples in the south west south west part of the study area exceeded the wqi of 50 therefore the area can be considered as a vulnerable area for water quality related issues chronic kidney disease with unknown etiology ckdu is one of the major health issue reported in the study region that mostly believed to be associated with the quality of drinking water balasooriya et al 2019 chandrajith et al 2011 dissanayake and chandrajith 2019 wickramarathna et al 2017 as indicated by the calculated wqi in this study very poor and poor water quality region overlaps with the area with higher incidences of ckdu indicating contributions of drinking water for the etiology of ckdu this study also indicated that the groundwater in the region needs quality improvement before consumption since majority of the population consume water from either shallow wells or deep tube wells 6 conclusions this study revealed that over 65 of the groundwater samples from monaragala areas were alkaline higher contents of ec tds total hardness chloride and fluoride in groundwater samples were mainly due to rock water interaction and high rate of evaporation this study also showed that basement lithology has a major influence on the quality of groundwater the high fluoride in groundwater was contributed by weathering of fluoride bearing minerals such as biotite and amphiboles that are abundant in aquifer rocks levels of most elements in groundwater exceeded their guideline limits recommended by the who the wqi values indicated that nearly 50 of both dug and deep tube wells have poor water quality due to their high ionicity as revelled by the wqi the area with poor groundwater quality is overlap with the areas with high incidences of ckdu however further studies are recommended to evaluate the potential effects on human health from the consumption of groundwater with high ionicity acknowledgements special thanks to prof c b dissanayake and dr saranga diyabalanage for their valuable suggestions and editorial assistance financial support received from the sabaragamuwa

therefore other than both ca and mg sr also contributes to the hardness of groundwater in the study area iron and mn content in the groundwater are mostly originated from minerals in high grade metamorphic rocks that are rich with fe bearing minerals such as pyroxenes amphiboles and micas from among the studied trace elements as cd and pb are considered as possible causative factors for chronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology ckdu in dry zone of sri lanka jayatilake et al 2013 in the study area as levels in groundwater samples varied from 0 031 to 2 33 μg l with a mean of 0 31 μg l only one location showed an outlier value of 8 14 μg l but it is also less than the who guideline value of 10 μg l arsenic in natural water in sri lanka is usually associated with sedimentary terrains of marine origin amarathunga et al 2019 bandara et al 2018 but not found in alarmingly high levels in the metamorphic aquifer systems balasooriya et al 2019 wickramarathna et al 2017 5 2 geochemical characteristics of groundwater the chemical composition of groundwater is primarily dependent on the geochemical processes which take place to form groundwater based on the chemical constituents groundwater can be categorized in to different facies hydrogeochemical facies are distinct zones that have cation and anion concentrations describable within defined categories of composition appelo and postma 2005 the hydrogeochemical data can be interpreted using different graphical methods such as piper diagram and durov diagram durov plot provides more information on the hydrogeochemical facies by helping to identify the water types durov 1948 it can also display certain possible geochemical processes that help in understanding quality and evaluation of groundwater the durov plot of monaragala area indicated that 75 groundwater in the region were belong to the ca2 mg2 hco3 facies while 7 9 samples were plotted in the ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 field fig 3 this signifies the dominance of alkaline earths over alkali elements in the region 64 samples also showed the processes of mixing and dissolution while 21 of samples showed ion exchange processes that control the ionicity of groundwater only about 11 of the samples were affected by the reverse ion exchange process the source of chemical constituents in groundwater can also be evaluated using the gibbs plot which is widely used to identify the relationship between water composition and aquifer lithological characteristics gibbs 1970 gibbs plot is based on ratios of either na k na k ca or cl cl hco3 as a function of tds from which distinct fields such as precipitation evaporation and rock water interaction dominance regions can be distinguished in this study modified gibbs plot that based on cation anion ratio vs tds was used to evaluate the mechanism of groundwater evaluation in the region fig 4 most of the samples from the study area fell in the rock water interaction dominance and evaporation dominance fields of the modified gibbs diagram this indicates that when water percolates to the subsurface the water get modified by soil liquid interactions the percentage pollution as defined by percentage of anion ratios in meq l versus na cl ratio is used to evaluate the process involved during the hydrogeochemical evaluation of groundwater in an area as given below pacheco and van der weijden 1996 soumya et al 2013 p o l l u t i o n c l s o 4 2 n o 3 100 c l s o 4 2 n o 3 a l k a l i n i t y fig 5 shows the plot of na and cl ratio versus percentage pollution in which most of the groundwaters collected from shallow and deep wells in the dry zone are affected by weathering shallow wells in the region can easily be contaminated by anthropogenic activities such as fertilizer application compared to deep tube wells based on the geochemical constituents in groundwater obtained from both shallow and deep wells silicate weathering is the main factors influence the major ion concentrations in the groundwater in the region rock weathering is less intense in the dry zone of sri lanka and relatively shallow development of soil profiles can be observed jayasena et al 2008 most of the shallow groundwater in the region is seasonal but aquifers in structural discontinuities such as faults lineaments shears and joins that have deep seated weathering effects are highly productive jayasena et al 2008 5 3 water quality index wqi for the calculation of water quality index wqi ph alkalinity hardness chloride sulphate nitrate phosphate fluoride calcium sodium potassium magnesium and tds were used the wqi values for monaragala region ranged from 1 27 to 334 about 48 of water samples were belonged to the good category while 28 of samples exceeded the wqi of 100 indicating the water is not suitable for drinking purposes fig 6 as indicated by the wqi 13 of water samples were fall in the poor water category while 10 and 21 were in the very poor and unsuitable categories most samples from the northern part of the area were fall in the excellent or good categories while 44 of samples in the south west south west part of the study area exceeded the wqi of 50 therefore the area can be considered as a vulnerable area for water quality related issues chronic kidney disease with unknown etiology ckdu is one of the major health issue reported in the study region that mostly believed to be associated with the quality of drinking water balasooriya et al 2019 chandrajith et al 2011 dissanayake and chandrajith 2019 wickramarathna et al 2017 as indicated by the calculated wqi in this study very poor and poor water quality region overlaps with the area with higher incidences of ckdu indicating contributions of drinking water for the etiology of ckdu this study also indicated that the groundwater in the region needs quality improvement before consumption since majority of the population consume water from either shallow wells or deep tube wells 6 conclusions this study revealed that over 65 of the groundwater samples from monaragala areas were alkaline higher contents of ec tds total hardness chloride and fluoride in groundwater samples were mainly due to rock water interaction and high rate of evaporation this study also showed that basement lithology has a major influence on the quality of groundwater the high fluoride in groundwater was contributed by weathering of fluoride bearing minerals such as biotite and amphiboles that are abundant in aquifer rocks levels of most elements in groundwater exceeded their guideline limits recommended by the who the wqi values indicated that nearly 50 of both dug and deep tube wells have poor water quality due to their high ionicity as revelled by the wqi the area with poor groundwater quality is overlap with the areas with high incidences of ckdu however further studies are recommended to evaluate the potential effects on human health from the consumption of groundwater with high ionicity acknowledgements special thanks to prof c b dissanayake and dr saranga diyabalanage for their valuable suggestions and editorial assistance financial support received from the sabaragamuwa

keywords rice husk adsorption fluoride silica nano adsorbent 1 introduction around the globe 663 million people are been affected by unsafe water water is very much essential for living organisms there are many contaminations present in water such as arsenic fluoride zinc lead mercury etc fluoride is one of the contamination that needs to be taken as an significant concern fluoride is found in more than 25 countries all over the world mohapatra et al 2012 also its found in earth crust which percolates to ground water india is one which has been mostly affected by fluoride in india state like odisha andhra pradesh punjab gujarat etc are been affected by fluoride in gujarat kheralu village situated in mehasana district has reported the fluoride beyond the permissible limit parikh and parikh 2013 fluoride should not exceed than 1 5 mg l given by world health organization and environmental protection agency zhang et al 2014 many scientists and researchers working on fluoride prove that life long impact of more fluoride in drinking water can cause deformities such as bones deficiency cavities in teeth cancer dna problem lungs problem and paralysis etc moreover fluoride content was found 5 50 mg l in ground water at different place wu et al 2007 many methods are invented to remove fluoride such as filtration nalgonda method co precipitation method adsorption sedimentation and precipitation chi et al 2017 amongst all adsorption method is cheaper and simple to use and rest of the method are highly costly toxic products producing excess sludge shortcomings and complex method in recent years adsorption is widely used process for fluoride removal for the effective adsorption the high capacity adsorbent plays a major role for fluoride removal wang et al 2013 adsorbents which was widely used to remove fluoride such as charcoal nanoparticles alumina bone char dried leaves etc medellin castillo et al 2014 apart from these modified with natural adsorbent was also studied by many scientist s like volatile ash mixed with ceramic cesium oxide based with magnesium waste rice husk with iron oxy hydroxide iron oxide with rice husk modified trivalent ions coated with zeolite chen et al 2019 however rice husk rh was considered as substitute bio adsorbent since it is abundantly used in india and waste of rice mill by product of rice mill mainly consists of rice straw rh rice plant materials etc from all these by product rh consist of silica 95 rh is cheap and also contain silica which have high surface area that helps in defluoridation cope et al 2014 in recent years nanotechnology has become a major part in research cheng and zheng 2014 the main application of nanotechnology is in water treatment medical field batteries etc its small size with large surface area higher reactivity i e physic chemical properties makes an interesting characteristic used for application in water treatment nano scale adsorbent gives an improved adsorption capacity chiavola et al 2016 in this present paper silica nano adsorbent modified from rice husk srh was used as adsorbent to remove fluoride and its physical structural properties was characterized by using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir x ray powder diffraction xrd scanning electron microscope sem and brunauer emmett teller bet the optimization of different factors was also examined the kinetic study and isotherm study were also investigated in addition regeneration study was also performed for fluoride removal 1 1 related works there were many adsorbent which was used for fluoride removal from corn stover rice straw corn cob rice husk and modified carbon from rice husk shown in table 1 the comparison of adsorbent was based on adsorption capacity and optimum ph as a result produced material was capable adsorbent for fluoride removal from water gebrewold et al 2018 2 experimental work 2 1 synthesis of srh rh was procured from local industry to prepare srh the rh was sieved and thoroughly washed with hcl 15 and kept in oven for drying for 2 h at 90 c later rh was crushed and kept at 700 c in muffel furnace for 5 h to form white color powder the obtained srh sample was further characterized and used for fluoride removal batch study pillai et al 2020 2 2 measurement of adsorption capacity to measure fluoride thermo fisher fluoride meter was used for defluoridation batch experiment was conducted for various factors using srh adsorbent the definite amount of adsorbent was taken with stock solution of fluoride 10 ml in beaker 100 ml for each experiment solution was stirred on orbital shaker with different parameters at constant stirring rate and temperature later the compounds were filtered and remaining concentration residual was measured using fluoride meter 3 results and discussion after srh synthesis ftir study was performed to identify the functional group in srh after adsorption ad and before adsorption ba which was illustrates in fig 1 a the analysis of ba and ad shows no change with each other the sio2 present at 647 cm 1 and 716 cm 1 moreover the peak of 3046 cm 1 and 3457 cm 1 show the presence of n h and o h bond bharathi et al 2013 further xrd study was done by x ray diffractometer pan analytical x pert pro in srh to know the elements present shown in fig 1b for ad and ba the diffracted pattern at 2θ peak value for ad and ba of srh was 21 5 23 6 24 6 31 2 34 6 38 5 44 6 49 5 and 56 3 corresponds to the peak 004 420 151 600 040 200 110 211 and 220 de 2018 moreover the morphology of srh was studied by sem analysis as shown in fig 1c morphology size and structure were performed by field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem zeiss ultra 55 for adsorbent the sample was sputter coated with a thin film of gold for conductivity the sample was kept in solvent and sonicated for 5 min before coating after coating the sample was kept in carbon tape for analysis of fe sem it clearly indicated that adsorbent was agglomerated and cavities are present in adsorbent these cavities helps for fluoride adsorption hasan et al 2009 finally nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms were performed to identify the surface area and pore size distribution of srh adsorbent given in fig 1d a b nitrogen sorption isotherms micrometrics gemini were done by bjh method fig 1d a indicates the mesoporous adsorbent of type iv curve mesoporous represents the diffusion transport to adsorbent active sites fig 1d b represents the pore size distribution 3 6 nm for srh adsorbent surface area and the pore volume of srh adsorbent facilitate at 48 90 m2 g and 0 136 m2 g respectively alvarez et al 2015 3 1 sorption studies at various factors 3 1 1 effect of adsorbent dose contact time concentration and ph batch experiments was conducted for adsorbent dose of srh for fluoride removal with constant temperature 20 c and stirring rate 200 rpm fig 2 a shows that the trend line of removal efficiency of fluoride increased in 1 4 g l but after 4 g l removal efficiency remains constant the reason behind the removal efficiency increases and then remains steady due to unavailability of vacant sites the 72 removal efficiency was achieved in dose on srh adsorbent similar trend line was described by samant et al 2017 the fluoride removal efficiency experiments was done for contact time on srh adsorbent by maintaining the dose of 4 g l with temperature 20 c stirring rate 200 rpm shown in fig 2b srh were used for fluoride adsorption batch wise the fluoride removal efficiency increase 72 within 60 min and after that it remain constant till 70 min the adsorption process after 60 min remain due to inaccessibility of active sites in adsorbent pillai et al 2019a b similar trends were reported in literature for contact time mullick and neogi 2019 the concentration was investigated in batch experiment between 10 mg l to 100 mg l for srh adsorbent while other factors were constant like dose of 4 g l with temperature 20 c stirring rate 200 rpm and time 60 min shown in fig 2c it was examined that the removal of fluoride increases rapidly in 10 mg l for srh with 72 removal efficiency this decrement is happening due to less binding sites available at higher concentration the same observation was described in singh et al 2016 the interface between fluoride ion and the rsh focus on ph and examination was achieved in the range 2 12 with dose of 4 g l with temperature 20 c stirring rate 200 rpm and time 60 min shown in fig 2d it was observed that the adsorption capacity of fluoride rises with initial ph value and gradually decrease at higher ph the reason behind was at acidic medium hydrofluoric acid was moderately formed thus the adsorption was less than the neutral ph shen et al 2016 at alkaline medium the f and oh repel thus fluoride removal decrease the maximum adsorption capacity for srh adsorbent obtained at 8 ph with 72 removal efficiency comparable results have been stated by other researcher ali et al 2015 3 1 2 adsorption kinetics the kinetics in adsorption was implemented for srh which includes the pseudo first order and pseudo second order were considered as two main adsorption kinetics represented in table 2 and fig 3 pseudo first order kinetics can be written as eq 1 19 1 dq e dt k 1 q e q t whereas qe and qt represents w r t time min at equilibrium the adsorption take place by adsorbent of fluoride mg g in eq 2 integration and rearranging it becomes 2 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t the pseudo first order model based on the experimental data qe exp and the theoretical data qe cal and it also agrees rate change is related to difference in equilibrium concentration w r t time the r2 was 0 93 by pseudo first order for srh illustrates in fig 3a kumar et al 2011 the outcome showcased that rha was not best fit for first order due to the correlation between experimental and theoretical data are not found in good agreement therefore the adsorption of rha does not follow the diffusion controlled phenomena pillai et al 2019a b pseudo second order shown in eq 3 maity et al 2018 3 dq t dt k 2 q e q t 2 whereas equilibrium constant was represented by k2 g mg 1 min 1 eq 3 integration and rearranging the equation represented by eq 4 4 1 qt 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e in that case results were fitted in pseudo second order qe and k2 are the slope and intercept for graph of t qe vs t the r2 was 0 96 which was nearer to 1 so pseudo second order model was best fit than pseudo first order and given in fig 3b and qe values of calculated and experimental are well matched ahmmad et al 2013 that also indicated that rha and fluoride ion adsorption depend on the bounded active sites for fluoride removal 3 1 3 adsorption isotherm studies to evaluate the interface among molecules of adsorbate adsorbent isotherm was used information regarding external phenomenon of the adsorbent and the viability of the reaction were also investigated in this present paper the investigational data was used in langmuir freundlich and temkin by varying initial concentration 10 100 mg l with 4 g l dose of srh adsorbent shown in table 3 and fig 4 gupta and balomajumder 2016 assumption of langmuir isotherm that those adsorbents are equally distributed on the surface of adsorbate so these mechanisms are known as monolayer adsorption the graph was plot 1 qe and 1 ce and r2 0 90 for srh adsorbent with adsorption capacity of 12 mg g shown in fig 4a dehghani et al 2018 5 1 q e 1 q m bc e 1 q m the qe and ce represent equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g qm indicates the maximum fluoride adsorption capacity mg g and b denotes constant mg l while in freundlich isotherm model it gives a value of kf and 1 n in graph of log qe and log ce with r2 0 94 indicate the fluoride adsorption on srh shown in fig 4b srivastava et al 2008 6 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where kf signifies adsorption capacity and 1 n represents adsorption intensity in heterogeneous system gupta et al 2007 the temkin isotherm model deals with the adsorption potential of adsorbent to adsorbate furthermore it also relates with indirect interaction between the adsorbate adsorbent this cause binding energies uniform distribution that leads to high increase of binding energy habuda stanić et al 2014 7 q e r t b t ln a t r t b t ln c e the graph between qe vs ln ce was plotted and r2 was 0 89 indicate the fluoride adsorption on srh illustrates in fig 4c this model reveals the electrostatic attraction among adsorbate and adsorbent 3 1 4 thermodynamics study to understand the adsorption nature and possibility of the process adsorption was done at different temperatures different thermodynamic factors were carried out at enthalpy change δh⁰ free energy change δg⁰ and entropy change δs⁰ defluoridation adsorption was higher at modest temperature and adsorption decreases with rises in temperature the reason behind the decrement at higher temperatures was due to the formation of a weak bond among fluoride ion and adsorbent the firmness of this system was also responsible for the electrostatic interaction between fluoride ions and srh nps wu et al 2007 thermodynamic parameters were calculated using eq given below and results are illustrated in table 4 8 δ g rtlnk c 9 δ g δ h t δ s 10 log q e m c e δ s 2 303 r δ h 2 303 rt where kc is the equilibrium constant r and t are the universal constant 8 314 j mol k and absolute temperature respectively the plot of kc vs 1 t gives slope and intercept which are considered as δh⁰ and δs⁰ 3 1 5 possible mechanism after the characterization and optimization results the possible mechanism of adsorbent and fluoride ion due to electrostatic attraction and ion exchange the electrostatic attracts inhibits the fluoride ions to adsorb on the surface which directly improve the adsorption factor in ion exchange the oh bond was identified from ftir these oh will attract the adsorbent and remove the fluoride ion de 2018 3 1 6 regeneration study the main aim of this experiment to know the usability of adsorbent the srh adsorbent was performed using batch experiments thereafter concentration 10 mg l of adsorbent was taken and was stirred in naoh for 120 min subsequently the adsorbent was filtered and kept in oven for drying at 90 c for 4 h goswami and kumar 2018 the recycled adsorbent was repeated in the same conditions for all the stages the 57 removal efficiency was attained in 4th cycle shown in fig 5 the efficiency decrease because of unavailability of active sites in adsorbent this can be later on used for cattle feed or construction of houses vardhan and karthikeyan 2011 3 1 7 field study srh used in the current study was tested with field samples about 4 g of adsorbent was added to 50 ml of fluoride water sample and the sample was stirred for 30 min with 25 c the initial fluoride was 2 3 mg l then after adsorption the fluoride decreases to 1 4 g l 4 conclusion in the current work using srh adsorbent fluoride efficiency was performed the ftir xrd sem and bet characterization provides the evidence that srh adsorbent was perfectly synthesized the optimized factors time 60 min dose 4 g ph 8 and concentration 10 mg l with 72 fluoride removal efficiency the adsorption of fluoride and srh was strongly dependent on optimized factors the result of the equilibrium data estimate srh adsorbent follows langmuir isotherm with an adsorption capacity of 12 mg g which agrees single layer adsorption on the surface the regeneration of fluoride removal shows 57 at 4th stage however scalable treatment and larger adsorbent dosage are still among the challenges which must be overcome before commercial applications on the other hand multicomponent adsorption and column and pilot scale studies should be studied in the future this work provides important understandings on promising and cost effective adsorbent for fluoride removal declaration of competing interest the authors

graph of t qe vs t the r2 was 0 96 which was nearer to 1 so pseudo second order model was best fit than pseudo first order and given in fig 3b and qe values of calculated and experimental are well matched ahmmad et al 2013 that also indicated that rha and fluoride ion adsorption depend on the bounded active sites for fluoride removal 3 1 3 adsorption isotherm studies to evaluate the interface among molecules of adsorbate adsorbent isotherm was used information regarding external phenomenon of the adsorbent and the viability of the reaction were also investigated in this present paper the investigational data was used in langmuir freundlich and temkin by varying initial concentration 10 100 mg l with 4 g l dose of srh adsorbent shown in table 3 and fig 4 gupta and balomajumder 2016

2007 the temkin isotherm model deals with the adsorption potential of adsorbent to adsorbate furthermore it also relates with indirect interaction between the adsorbate adsorbent this cause binding

indicate the fluoride adsorption on srh illustrates in fig 4c this model reveals the electrostatic attraction among adsorbate and adsorbent 3 1 4 thermodynamics study to understand the adsorption nature and possibility of the process adsorption was done at different temperatures different thermodynamic factors were carried out at enthalpy change δh⁰ free energy change δg⁰ and entropy change δs⁰ defluoridation adsorption was higher at modest temperature and adsorption decreases with rises in temperature the reason behind the decrement at higher temperatures was due to the formation of a weak bond among fluoride ion and adsorbent the firmness of this system was also responsible for the electrostatic interaction between fluoride ions and srh nps wu et al 2007 thermodynamic parameters were calculated using eq given below and results are illustrated in table 4 8 δ g rtlnk c 9 δ g δ h t δ s 10 log q e m c e δ s 2 303 r δ h 2 303 rt where kc is the equilibrium constant r and t are the universal constant 8 314 j mol k and absolute temperature respectively the plot of kc vs 1 t gives slope and intercept which are considered as δh⁰ and δs⁰ 3 1 5 possible mechanism after the characterization and optimization results the possible mechanism of adsorbent and fluoride ion due to electrostatic attraction and ion exchange the electrostatic attracts inhibits the fluoride ions to adsorb on the surface which directly improve the adsorption factor in ion exchange the oh bond was identified from ftir these oh will attract the adsorbent and remove the fluoride ion de 2018 3 1 6 regeneration study the main aim of this experiment to know the usability of adsorbent the srh adsorbent was performed using batch experiments thereafter concentration 10 mg l of adsorbent was taken and was stirred in naoh for 120 min subsequently the adsorbent was filtered and kept in oven for drying at 90 c for 4 h goswami and kumar 2018 the recycled adsorbent was repeated in the same conditions for all the stages the 57 removal efficiency was attained in 4th cycle shown in fig 5 the efficiency decrease because of unavailability of active sites in adsorbent this can be later on used for cattle feed or construction of houses vardhan and karthikeyan 2011 3 1 7 field study srh used in the current study was tested with field samples about 4 g of adsorbent was added to 50 ml of fluoride water sample and the sample was stirred for 30 min with 25 c the initial fluoride was 2 3 mg l then after adsorption the fluoride decreases to 1 4 g l 4 conclusion in the current work using srh adsorbent fluoride efficiency was performed the ftir xrd sem and bet characterization provides the evidence that srh adsorbent was perfectly synthesized the optimized factors time 60 min dose 4 g ph 8 and concentration 10 mg l with 72 fluoride removal efficiency the adsorption of fluoride and srh was strongly dependent on optimized factors the result of the equilibrium data estimate srh adsorbent follows langmuir isotherm with an adsorption capacity of 12 mg g which agrees single layer adsorption on the surface the regeneration of fluoride removal shows 57 at 4th stage however scalable treatment and larger adsorbent dosage are still among the challenges which must be overcome before commercial applications on the other hand multicomponent adsorption and column and pilot

precipitation method used to remove co2 from contaminated aqueous solutions in the batch adsorption process and obtained the optimum effective parameters on the adsorption process 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and instruments pure ethanol polyethylene glycol peg tetraethyl orthosilicate teos sodium hydroxide hydrochloric acid and cobalt nitrate hexahydrate co no3 2 6h2o 99 9 was purchased from merck co germany the solution of naoh and hcl 0 1 or 1 n were used for ph adjustment the amounts of solutions ph were measured by ph meter hanna instrument the residual co2 concentration in the solution after adsorption was measured by atomic absorption spectrometer spectra 20 aa varian the shaker incubator innova 40 was used for mixing and proper contact of co2 with adsorbent in all adsorption experiments the separation of adsorbents from the suspension was also used with a centrifuge hettich ea20 after the adsorption process the mesoporous characteristic was studied by sem images siemens germany 2 2 synthesis of mesoporous silica to synthesis mesoporous silica firstly dissolve 3 8 ml of polyethylene glycol p 123 with 40 ml mixture of distilled water and ethanol and then add 34 3 ml of hydrochloric acid for 2 h the mixture was shaken under 30 c at 220 rpm by a shaker incubator then 7 ml of tetraethyl orthosilicate teos was added to the solution as the molar ratio of mixture was teos 0 0349 hcl 0 08 and h2o 5 8 it was again heated for 1 h in a shaker incubator under the 30 c at 220 rpm in the end the green sediment was separated from the solution by 0 45 μ filter paper and dried at 70 c for 2 h after washing with deionized water 2 3 adsorption experiments for adsorption experiments a stock solution 1g l co2 were prepared by adding 0 259 g of cobalt nitrate to 100 ml of distilled water the required initial concentrations for working solutions were prepared from the stock solution in 50 ml samples and then the amount of adsorbent was added to each container the effect of contact time on the removal efficiency of co2 by synthesized mesoporous silica was investigated in a concentration of 5 mg l of co2 at 0 5 1 5 8 10 and 12 h at this step the adsorbent mass 0 1 g was added in 50 ml and solution ph was adjusted to 3 to determine the effect of ph on the adsorption process ph was investigated at three levels of 3 5 7 and 9 in the initial co2 concentration of 5 mg l and the optimum contact time for each test the amount of 0 1 g of adsorbent was added to the 50 ml solution with the adjusted above ph values by 1 or 0 1 n hcl and naoh the effect of initial co2 concentration was investigated on the removal efficiency at ph 7 adsorbent mass of 0 1 in 50 ml solutions with concentration of 5 10 20 30 and 50 mg l of co2 also to investigate the effect of adsorbent mass on co2 removal efficiency the amount of 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 g were added to the solutions with 5 mg l co2 ions concentration in all experiments for measuring the concentration of residual co2 in solutions the adsorbent particles were separated from the suspension after the end of adsorption process then the atomic absorption spectrometer was standardized with standard solutions of co2 in a wavelength of 240 nm and the residual co2 were measured in the filtrate samples under the same atomic absorption conditions eventually the adsorption isotherm was obtained at 8 h adsorbent mass of 0 3 g a temperature of 25 c various co2 concentrations of 5 10 30 and 50 mg l and other optimal condition to determine the kinetics of co2 adsorption on mesoporous silica experiments were done in the contact times 0 5 2 3 5 8 16 h at other optimum condition all experiments were carried out at a constant laboratory temperature 25 2 c mixing speed of 150 rpm and a constant volume of 50 ml 2 4 adsorption isotherm equations the isotherms study can describe the behavior of adsorbent with adsorbate in fact the isotherm equation provides a correlation between the concentration of co2 in the solution and the amount of co2 adsorbed on the solid phase surface in which both phases are in equilibrium wang et al 2015 in the present study the experimental data for adsorption of co2 by mesoporous silica were tested for the langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherm models the linear equation of the langmuir isotherm model for single layer adsorption is shown in eq 1 langmuir 1918 salmani et al 2019 1 c e q e 1 k l q m c e q m where qe is the amount of co2 adsorbed on the unit of adsorbent mg g ce is the equilibrium concentration of co2 in solution mg l kl the constant that refers to the bonding energy of sorption in l mg and qm is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g the langmuir equilibrium constants are obtained by plotting ce qe against ce based on the empirical data the freundlich equation is completely empirical and based on adsorption on the heterogeneous surface in which the linear form is shown in eq 2 freundlich 1907 salmani et al 2019 2 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where kf and n are freundlich adsorption constants are related to the adsorption capacity and intensity respectively the freundlich equilibrium constants are obtained by plotting log qe against log ce based on the empirical data the temkin isotherm model is as eq 3 salmani et al 2019 temkin 1940 3 q e b t ln k t b t ln c e where the bt and kt are temkin constants in the linear isotherm model the temkin equilibrium constants are obtained by plotting qe against lnce based on the empirical data 2 5 adsorption kinetic equations by considering of the adsorption kinetic the progress of a reaction will be more accurate over the time in other words the speed of co2 adsorption process on the mesoporous silica and the effect of contact time on the removal efficiency was well studied in the study of adsorption kinetics wang et al 2015 in order to investigate the adsorption kinetic the experimental data were fitted to the pseudo first order eq 4 and pseudo second order eq 5 equations anbia et al 2015 4 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qe and qt are the amounts of co2 adsorbed at the equilibrium and t time mg g respectively the k1 min 1 and k2 g mg min are the pseudo first and pseudo second order rate constants respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of synthesized mesoporous silica the structure and size of the mesoporous silica particles were investigated using sem images that are shown in fig 1 as seen from the image the synthesized mesoporous silica has a honeycomb like structure and porous structure hence it results in a higher surface area for adsorption of metal ions from aqueous environments wang et al 2015 3 2 the effect of contact time the effect of contact time on co2 removal efficiency is shown in fig 2 as can be seen with increasing time the removal rate increases and 85 of the co2 were removed at 8 h contact time as a result the contact time of 8 h was chosen as the optimal time increasing the removal efficiency of co2 ions by increasing the contact time can be related to increasing opportunities for adsorption in other word the collision and contact between the pollutant and adsorbent increase in the adsorption medium vojoudi et al 2017 in addition to the surface area of the mesoporous silica is larger than 30 m2 g and the adsorption sites is vacant so the fast sorption at initial times is related to ion exchange onto the mesopores surface of the synthesized mesoporous silica it is intensified by diffusion of co2 ions through solution balk to surfaces that provides the considerable rate in this stage these results are consistent with the result of kosa et al 2012 and saif et al 2012 study 3 3 the effect of initial ph solution fig 3 shows the effect of ph on the removal efficiency of co2 by mesoporous silica the results indicated that at ph 7 co2 removal efficiency was 70 that was higher than other phs the increasing ph from 3 to 7 acidic ph the removal efficiency increases and then the removal efficiency decreases in alkaline medium which is consists with findings of afkhami et al that used the modified alumina nano particles of diatomite nitrogen phenylhydrazine for removal of heavy metals afkhami et al 2010 a reason for the low efficiency of acidic ph is related to producing a positive charge on the adsorbent at the acidic ph which creates an electrostatic repulsion between the adsorbent and co2 cations and also the amount of hydrogen ions increases in the solution and it instead of the co2 on the adsorbent surface as a result and so the removal efficiency decreases in acidic solution as shown in fig 3 the adsorption efficiency decreases in higher phs due to the formation of cobalt hydroxide hakami et al 2012 li et al 2011 3 4 the effect of initial co2 concentration the effect of initial co2 concentration on the removal efficiency of the synthesized mesoporous silica is shown in fig 4 as can be seen with the increase in co2 concentration from 5 to 30 mg l the removal efficiency decreased from 88 to 40 this is consistent with the results of the study of vojoudi et al on the use of mesoporous silica in the removal of heavy metals from aqueous solution vojoudi et al 2017 and study of anbia et al on the removal of heavy metals by mesoporous silica mcm 48 anbia et al 2015 the decreasing in removal efficiency can be due to repulsion between the co2 ions present in the solution and on the adsorbent surface at high concentration in fact at low concentrations a single layer of metal ions forms on the surface of the adsorbent but at high concentrations more layers are formed on the surface that it limited the number of adsorbent sites and so the adsorption efficiency decreases kanthimathi et al 2012 3 5 effect of adsorbent dose fig 5 shows the effect of adsorbent dose on co2 removal efficiency the results indicated that by increasing the amount of adsorbent from 0 1 to 0 3 g in 50 ml the removal efficiency increased from 41 to 75 after this amount it was observed a little increase but removal efficiency had not changed significantly the increasing adsorbent mass causes the number of active sites in adsorption process or increasing the number ratio of active sites to the adsorbent as a result it causes an increase in the contact surface between the adsorbent and pollutant then the removal efficiency of co2 increase however due to the accumulation of adsorbent in a batch process the adsorbent active sites decreases with increasing mass of adsorbent therefore there was no linear relationship between adsorbent mass and removal efficiency vojoudi et al 2017 a study on the modified mesoporous silica sba 15 to remove mercury ion from the aqueous solution showed that an optimum adsorbent dose was 15 mg and then with increasing the adsorbent dose to 45 mg the removal efficiency was constant bidhendi et al 2014 heidari et al 2009 used nanosized silica amine for ni ii cd ii and pb ii removal and resulted that with an increase in adsorbent dose removal efficiency increases until the optimum amount heidari et al 2009 that their result was consistent with our result 3 6 adsorption isotherm model langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherm models are shown in fig 6 the conformity of the co2 adsorption by mesoporous silica with isotherm models was determined by the determination coefficient based on fig 6 the determination coefficient for freundlich langmuir and temkin were 0 9359 0 8704 and 0 8251 respectively table 1 shows the calculated isotherm parameters of three models for the co2 adsorption according to table 1 there was the highest correlation between the freundlich isotherm model and experimental data for co2 adsorption so this isotherm was selected as the best model for describing the adsorbent properties of mesoporous silica in the adsorption of co2 from aqueous solutions the freundlich isotherm adsorption constant n is related to the adsorption intensity if 1 n is lower than 1 the freundlich isotherm is favorable dehghani et al 2016 in the present study 1 n was 0 33 that indicated the adsorption process of co2 onto mesoporous silica has been desirably performed also experimental data were followed for the langmuir isotherm that assumed the adsorption is done in a single layer the necessary and feasible properties of the langmuir isotherm can be expressed in terms of the dimensionless constant called the separation factor that is calculated by eq 6 wang et al 2015 6 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where rl is isolation factor c0 is the initial concentration of co2 kl is langmuir constant if rl 1 adsorption is unfavorable rl 1 adsorption is linear rl 1 adsorption is irreversible and 0 rl 1 adsorption is favorable wang et al 2015 in the present study rl for optimal concentration obtained 0 19 that is between 0 and 1 and it indicates the adsorption process is favorable maximum adsorption capacities qmax of different adsorbents for co2 adsorption reported in literature are presented in table 2 comparing the qmax of other adsorbents with mesoporous silica used in this study shows that qmax of mesoporous silica is relatively suitable to adsorb co2 ions but the use of different methods for modification of adsorbents such as functionalization and nanoparticle impregnating on the adsorbent surface can be useful for improving and increasing the maximum adsorption capacity of adsorbent bhattacharyya and gupta 2008 chang et al 2006 repo et al 2010 3 7 adsorption kinetic model one of the most important factors for the design of the adsorption system is the prediction of adsorption rate that is controlled by the system kinetic labib et al 2017 the adsorption kinetics was examined based on pseudo first order fig 7 a and pseudo second order fig 7b as can be seen from fig 7 the determination coefficients r2 for both pseudo first and second order models were obtained 0 7657 and 0 9995 respectively based on the kinetic results table 3 the highest accordance was observed by the pseudo second order model and this model was selected as the best model for describing the kinetic behavior of mesoporous silica in adsorption of co2 from aqueous media the pseudo second order model implies that two factors or a second order of a factor effect on the adsorption process rate then it seems that the co2 ions and functional groups on the surface had the important role in the kinetic rate of adsorption 3 8 adsorption free energy change the equilibrium constants were used to compute the gibbs free energy change g of adsorption it is calculated from eq 7 7 δ g r t l n k where r represent the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k and t is the absolute temperature k the constant k is related to kc thermodynamic constant kf freundlich constant kl langmuir constant and kt temkin constant abedi et al 2016 the calculated values for g are given in table 4 the values of free energy change are negative which conferment the feasibility and the spontaneous nature of adsorption process of co2 on the synthesized mesoporous 3 9 adsorption mechanism the adsorption mechanisms are shown in fig 8 according to the first reaction the protonated surface of mesoporous is not favorable for adsorption of co2 ions the dominance of co2 adsorption in the second reaction is probably caused by exchangeable cations to the layers of the mesoporous silica and the subsequent occupation of exchange sites on the surface by other ions pan et al 2009 during the third reaction of the fast metal sorption ionic interactions between ions with functional groups on the mesoporous silica inside ion exchange are supposed to take place ionic attraction deceleration in the close mesopores of mesoporous silica is connected by more intensive sorption in comparison with exchange ion in the surface mesopores fast and slight adsorption of co2 ions in the third stage confirms that the co2 adsorption occurs mainly onto the functional groups on the surface forms and proportions of the kinetic model are same at different initial metal concentrations it is indicated that the increasing of the co2 concentrations in solutions leads to their large intensity and hence to more intensive attraction between ions and the active sites on the surface bui and choi 2009 cashin et al 2018 according to fig 8 and the effect of the solution ph on the adsorption of co2 ions by mesoporous silica fig 3 the adsorption of metal ions depends on the solution ph it influences on electrostatic binding of ions to corresponding oh groups the protonated hydroxyl groups that decreasing the solution ph values and so the numbers of active sites available for co2 ions were then decreased consequently the co2 removal percent is decreased at high concentrations of protons the adjusting ph to 7 oh groups were de protonated and forming negatively charged sites at ph values higher than 8 0 co2 ions precipitated out because of the high concentrations of oh ions in the aqueous solution guo et al 2013 the adsorption capacity of mesoporous silica for co2 adsorption first increased with the increase of the solution ph from ph 3 to 7 but the adsorption capacity of mesoporous decreased when the ph value reached to 7 0 4 conclusions in the present study mesoporous silica was successfully synthesized by a single chemical precipitation method as a low cost adsorbent for co2 adsorption from aqueous solutions experiments showed that the change in the ph from 3 to 7 the removal efficiency of adsorbent for co2 increases and it decreases in the ph 7 by increasing the adsorbent dose and the contact time to optimal levels the removal efficiency of co2 increased also with an increase in the initial co2 concentration from 5 to 30 mg l the removal efficiency decreased the isotherms study showed that the co2 adsorption follows the freundlich isotherm and the adsorption kinetics data was better described by a pseudo second order model finally according to the results porous silica mesoporous can be a good adsorbent for the removal of co2 ions declaration of competing interest there are not conflict of interest

molar ratio of mixture was teos 0 0349 hcl 0 08 and h2o 5 8 it was again heated for 1 h in a shaker incubator under the 30 c at 220 rpm in the end the green sediment was separated from the solution by 0 45 μ filter paper and dried at 70 c for 2 h after washing with deionized water 2 3 adsorption experiments for adsorption experiments a stock solution 1g l co2 were prepared by adding 0 259 g of cobalt nitrate to 100 ml of distilled water the required initial concentrations for working solutions were prepared from the stock solution in 50 ml samples and then the amount of adsorbent was added to each container the effect of contact time on the removal efficiency of co2 by synthesized mesoporous silica was investigated in a concentration of 5 mg l of co2 at 0 5 1 5 8 10 and 12 h at this step the adsorbent mass 0 1 g was added in 50 ml and solution ph was adjusted to 3 to determine the effect of ph on the adsorption process ph was investigated at three levels of 3 5 7 and 9 in the initial co2 concentration of 5 mg l and the optimum contact time for each test the amount of 0 1 g of adsorbent was added to the 50 ml solution with the adjusted above ph values by 1 or 0 1 n hcl and naoh the effect of initial co2 concentration was investigated on the removal efficiency at ph 7 adsorbent mass of 0 1 in 50 ml solutions with concentration of 5 10 20 30 and 50 mg l of co2 also to investigate the effect of adsorbent mass on co2 removal efficiency the amount of 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 g were added to the solutions with 5 mg l co2 ions concentration in all experiments for measuring the concentration of residual co2 in solutions the adsorbent particles were separated from the suspension after the end of adsorption process then the atomic absorption spectrometer was standardized with standard solutions of co2 in a wavelength of 240 nm and the residual co2 were measured in the filtrate samples under the same atomic absorption conditions eventually the adsorption isotherm was obtained at 8 h adsorbent mass of 0 3 g a temperature of 25 c various co2 concentrations of 5 10 30 and 50 mg l and other optimal condition to determine the kinetics of co2 adsorption on mesoporous silica experiments were done in the contact times 0 5 2 3 5 8 16 h at other optimum condition all experiments were carried out at a constant laboratory temperature 25 2 c mixing speed of 150 rpm and a constant volume of 50 ml 2 4 adsorption isotherm equations the isotherms study can describe the behavior of adsorbent with adsorbate in fact the isotherm equation provides a correlation between the concentration of co2 in the solution and the amount of co2 adsorbed on the solid phase surface in which both phases are in equilibrium wang et al 2015 in the present study the experimental data for adsorption of co2 by mesoporous silica were tested for the langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherm models the linear equation of the langmuir isotherm model for single layer adsorption is shown in eq 1 langmuir 1918 salmani et al 2019 1 c e q e 1 k l q m c e q m where qe is the amount of co2 adsorbed on the unit of adsorbent mg g ce is the equilibrium concentration of co2 in solution mg l kl the constant that refers to the bonding energy of sorption in l mg and qm is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g the langmuir equilibrium constants are obtained by plotting ce qe against ce based on the empirical data the freundlich equation is completely empirical and based on adsorption on the heterogeneous surface in which the linear form is shown in eq 2 freundlich 1907 salmani et al 2019 2 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where kf and n are freundlich adsorption constants are related to the adsorption capacity and intensity respectively the freundlich equilibrium constants are obtained by plotting log qe against log ce based on the empirical data the temkin isotherm model is as eq 3 salmani et al 2019 temkin 1940 3 q e b t ln k t b t ln c e where the bt and kt are temkin constants in the linear isotherm model the temkin equilibrium constants are obtained by plotting qe against lnce based on the empirical data 2 5 adsorption kinetic equations by considering of the adsorption kinetic the progress of a reaction will be more accurate over the time in other words the speed of co2 adsorption process on the mesoporous silica and the effect of contact time on the removal efficiency was well studied in the study of adsorption kinetics wang et al 2015 in order to investigate the adsorption kinetic the experimental data were fitted to the pseudo first order eq 4 and pseudo second order eq 5 equations anbia et al 2015 4 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qe and qt are the amounts of co2 adsorbed at the equilibrium and t time mg g respectively the k1 min 1 and k2 g mg min are the pseudo first and pseudo second order rate constants respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of synthesized mesoporous silica the structure and size of the mesoporous silica particles were investigated using sem images that are shown in fig 1 as seen from the image the synthesized mesoporous silica has a honeycomb like structure and porous structure hence it results in a higher surface area for adsorption of metal ions from aqueous environments wang et al 2015 3 2 the effect of contact time the effect of contact time on co2 removal efficiency is shown in fig 2 as can be seen with increasing time the removal rate increases and 85 of the co2 were removed at 8 h contact time as a result the contact time of 8 h was chosen as the optimal time increasing the removal efficiency of co2 ions by increasing the contact time can be related to increasing opportunities for adsorption in other word the collision and contact between the pollutant and adsorbent increase in the adsorption medium vojoudi et al 2017 in addition to the surface area of the mesoporous silica is larger than 30 m2 g and the adsorption sites is vacant so the fast sorption at initial times is related to ion exchange onto the mesopores surface of the synthesized mesoporous silica it is intensified by diffusion of co2 ions through solution balk to surfaces that provides the considerable rate in this stage these results are consistent with the result of kosa et al 2012 and saif et al 2012 study 3 3 the effect of initial ph solution fig 3 shows the effect of ph on the removal efficiency of co2 by mesoporous silica the results indicated that at ph 7 co2 removal efficiency was 70 that was higher than other phs the increasing ph from 3 to 7 acidic ph the removal efficiency increases and then the removal efficiency decreases in alkaline medium which is consists with findings of afkhami et al that used the modified alumina nano particles of diatomite nitrogen phenylhydrazine for removal of heavy metals afkhami et al 2010 a reason for the low efficiency of acidic ph is related to producing a positive charge on the adsorbent at the acidic ph which creates an electrostatic repulsion between the adsorbent and co2 cations and also the amount of hydrogen ions increases in the solution and it instead of the co2 on the adsorbent surface as a result and so the removal efficiency decreases in acidic solution as shown in fig 3 the adsorption efficiency decreases in higher phs due to the formation of cobalt hydroxide hakami et al 2012 li et al 2011 3 4 the effect of initial co2 concentration the effect of initial co2 concentration on the removal efficiency of the synthesized mesoporous silica is shown in fig 4 as can be seen with the increase in co2 concentration from 5 to 30 mg l the removal efficiency decreased from 88 to 40 this is consistent with the results of the study of vojoudi et al on the use of mesoporous silica in the removal of heavy metals from aqueous solution vojoudi et al 2017 and study of anbia et al on the removal of heavy metals by mesoporous silica mcm 48 anbia et al 2015 the decreasing in removal efficiency can be due to repulsion between the co2 ions present in the solution and on the adsorbent surface at high concentration in fact at low concentrations a single layer of metal ions forms on the surface of the adsorbent but at high concentrations more layers are formed on the surface that it limited the number of adsorbent sites and so the adsorption efficiency decreases kanthimathi et al 2012 3 5 effect of adsorbent dose fig 5 shows the effect of adsorbent dose on co2 removal efficiency the results indicated that by increasing the amount of adsorbent from 0 1 to 0 3 g in 50 ml the removal efficiency increased from 41 to 75 after this amount it was observed a little increase but removal efficiency had not changed significantly the increasing adsorbent mass causes the number of active sites in adsorption process or increasing the number ratio of active sites to the adsorbent as a result it causes an increase in the contact surface between the adsorbent and pollutant then the removal efficiency of co2 increase however due to the accumulation of adsorbent in a batch process the adsorbent active sites decreases with increasing mass of adsorbent therefore there was no linear relationship between adsorbent mass and removal efficiency vojoudi et al 2017 a study on the modified mesoporous silica sba 15 to remove mercury ion from the aqueous solution showed that an optimum adsorbent dose was 15 mg and then with increasing the adsorbent dose to 45 mg the removal efficiency was constant bidhendi et al 2014 heidari et al 2009 used nanosized silica amine for ni ii cd ii and pb ii removal and resulted that with an increase in adsorbent dose removal efficiency increases until the optimum amount heidari et al 2009 that their result was consistent with our result 3 6 adsorption isotherm model langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherm models are shown in fig 6 the conformity of the co2 adsorption by mesoporous silica with isotherm models was determined by the determination coefficient based on fig 6 the determination coefficient for freundlich langmuir and temkin were 0 9359 0 8704 and 0 8251 respectively table 1 shows the calculated isotherm parameters of three models for the co2 adsorption according to table 1 there was the highest correlation between the freundlich isotherm model and experimental data for co2 adsorption so this isotherm was selected as the best model for describing the adsorbent properties of mesoporous silica in the adsorption of co2 from aqueous solutions the freundlich isotherm adsorption constant n is related to the adsorption intensity if 1 n is lower than 1 the freundlich isotherm is favorable dehghani et al 2016 in the present study 1 n was 0 33 that indicated the adsorption process of co2 onto mesoporous silica has been desirably performed also experimental data were followed for the langmuir isotherm that assumed the adsorption is done in a single layer the necessary and feasible properties of the langmuir isotherm can be expressed in terms of the dimensionless constant called the separation factor that is calculated by eq 6 wang et al 2015 6 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where rl is isolation factor c0 is the initial concentration of co2 kl is langmuir constant if rl 1 adsorption is unfavorable rl 1 adsorption is linear rl 1 adsorption is irreversible and 0 rl 1 adsorption is favorable wang et al 2015 in the present study rl for optimal concentration obtained 0 19 that is between 0 and 1 and it indicates the adsorption process is favorable maximum adsorption capacities qmax of different adsorbents for co2 adsorption reported in literature are presented in table 2 comparing the qmax of other adsorbents with mesoporous silica used in this study shows that qmax of mesoporous silica is relatively suitable to adsorb co2 ions but the use of different methods for modification of adsorbents such as functionalization and nanoparticle impregnating on the adsorbent surface can be useful for improving and increasing the maximum adsorption capacity of adsorbent bhattacharyya and gupta 2008 chang et al 2006 repo et al 2010 3 7 adsorption kinetic model one of the most important factors for the design of the adsorption system is the prediction of adsorption rate that is controlled by the system kinetic labib et al 2017 the adsorption kinetics was examined based on pseudo first order fig 7 a and pseudo second order fig 7b as can be seen from fig 7 the determination coefficients r2 for both pseudo first and second order models were obtained 0 7657 and 0 9995 respectively based on the kinetic results table 3 the highest accordance was observed by the pseudo second order model and this model was selected as the best model for describing the kinetic behavior of mesoporous silica in adsorption of co2 from aqueous media the pseudo second order model implies that two factors or a second order of a factor effect on the adsorption process rate then it seems that the co2 ions and functional groups on the surface had the important role in the kinetic rate of adsorption 3 8 adsorption free energy change the equilibrium constants were used to compute the gibbs free energy change g of adsorption it is calculated from eq 7 7 δ g r t l n k where r represent the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k and t is the absolute temperature k the constant k is related to kc thermodynamic constant kf freundlich constant kl langmuir constant and kt temkin constant abedi et al 2016 the calculated values for g are given in table 4 the values of free energy change are negative which conferment the feasibility and the spontaneous nature of adsorption process of co2 on the synthesized mesoporous 3 9 adsorption mechanism the adsorption mechanisms are shown in fig 8 according to the first reaction the protonated surface of mesoporous is not favorable for adsorption of co2 ions the dominance of co2 adsorption in the second reaction is probably caused by exchangeable cations to the layers of the mesoporous silica and the subsequent occupation of exchange sites on the surface by other ions pan et al 2009 during the third reaction of the fast metal sorption ionic interactions between ions with functional groups on the mesoporous silica inside ion exchange are supposed to take place ionic attraction deceleration in the close mesopores of mesoporous silica is connected by more intensive sorption in comparison with exchange ion in the surface mesopores fast and slight adsorption of co2 ions in the third stage confirms that the co2 adsorption occurs mainly onto the functional groups on the surface forms and proportions of the kinetic model are same at different initial metal concentrations it is indicated that the increasing of the co2 concentrations in solutions leads to their large intensity and hence to more intensive attraction between ions and the active sites on the surface bui and choi 2009 cashin et al 2018 according to fig 8 and the effect of the solution ph on the adsorption of co2 ions by mesoporous silica fig 3 the adsorption of metal ions depends on the solution ph it influences on electrostatic binding of ions to corresponding oh groups the protonated hydroxyl groups that decreasing the solution ph values and so the numbers of active sites available for co2 ions were then decreased consequently the co2 removal percent is decreased at high concentrations of protons the adjusting ph to 7 oh groups were de protonated and forming negatively charged sites at ph values higher than 8 0 co2 ions precipitated out because of the high concentrations of oh ions in the aqueous solution guo et al 2013 the adsorption capacity of mesoporous silica for co2 adsorption first increased with the increase of the solution ph from ph 3 to 7 but the adsorption capacity of mesoporous decreased when the ph value reached to 7 0 4 conclusions in the present study mesoporous silica was successfully synthesized by a single chemical precipitation method as a low cost adsorbent for co2 adsorption from aqueous solutions experiments showed that the change in the ph from 3 to 7 the removal efficiency of adsorbent for co2 increases and it decreases in the ph 7 by increasing the adsorbent dose and the contact time to optimal levels the removal efficiency of co2 increased also with an increase in the initial co2 concentration from 5 to 30 mg l the removal efficiency decreased the isotherms study showed that the co2 adsorption follows the freundlich isotherm and the adsorption kinetics data was better described by a pseudo second order model finally according to the results porous silica mesoporous can be a good adsorbent for the removal of co2 ions declaration of competing interest there are not conflict of interest

ionization along with speciation of adsorbate and concentration of oppositely charged particles on the functional groups of the adsorbent depend on solution s ph value in present work to study the impact of ph on adsorption process ph of uranium vi solutions having a strength of 25 mg l were maintained from 2 to 9 the results are shown into fig 5 in aqueous solutions free uranyl ions uo2 2 are the main ions at ph 5 yu et al 2017 in acidic medium hco3 ions produce from the breakdown of dolomite and these ions adsorbed over it by weak vanderwaals forces which increase net negative charge on dolomite surface karaca et al 2006 positively charged uranyl ions are attracted towards this negatively charged surface and due to electrostatic attraction adsorption occurs the removal efficiency increased from 65 9 to 78 8 on increasing the ph from 2 to 3 then decreased from 69 7 to 20 2 on increasing ph from 4 to 9 the maximum removal efficiency 78 8 obtained at ph 3 at ph 3 because of dense collection of h and h3o ions adsorption of uo2 2 ions decreased as these ions fight with uo2 2 ions for active centres on the surface of dolomite in between 5 0 and 9 0 ph different complex ions like uo2oh uo2 2 oh 2 2 and uo2 3 oh 5 are formed these complex species have complicated molecular structures and greater stability therefore they prevent the removal process 3 3 effect of dolomite dose to investigate impact of dolomite dose on adsorption of uranium vi amount of powdered dolomite rock was changed in the range 0 02 0 2 g with 50 ml uranium vi solution ph 3 strength of uranium vi 25 mg l stirring speed 500 rpm and temperature 30 c were kept constant the results are presented into fig 6 removal capacity by dolomite increased from 10 2 to 78 8 on rising dolomite dose from 0 02 to 0 1 g 50 ml because of increase in the number of binding sites but when the dose was further increased from 0 1 to 0 2 g 50 ml removal capacity decreased up to 55 5 which might because of partial combination of adsorbent particles causing reduction in total surface area of adsorbent similar phenomenon was also found by bhatti and hamid 2014 in their study of removal of from aqueous solutions by eucalyptus citriodora distillation sludge 3 4 effect of uranium vi concentration fig 7 represents impact of uranium vi concentration upon removal efficiency by dolomite at 30 c when initial uranium vi concentration increased from 10 to 25 mg l removal efficiency increased from 75 6 to 78 8 but when uranium concentration was further increased removal efficiency decreased because of less availability of favourable sites with increasing metal concentrations in the aqueous phase uranium vi strength of 25 mg l was selected for further studies 3 5 effect of contact time impact of stirring time on extraction of uranium vi by dolomite was investigated by taking 0 1 g powdered dolomite rock with 50 ml uranium vi solution having the strength of 25 mg l at ph 3 in different sealed polypropylene bottles these bottles were stirred for different time spans ranging from 10 to 80 min at 30 c outcomes are illustrated into fig 8 removal efficiency increased from 51 6 to 78 8 on increasing stirring time from 10 to 40 min after that equilibrium was established between adsorbate and adsorbent and removal efficiency become constant on this basis 40 min stirring time was chosen for further investigations 3 6 effect of temperature the impact of temperature was studied at 303 313 and 323 k which is presented into fig 9 at all these temperatures uranium vi extraction raised until 40 min time period and after that equilibrium achieved between adsorbate and adsorbent slight increase observed in uranium vi removal efficiency on increasing temperature indicating endothermic nature of process similar effect of temperature on dolomite s capacity of sorption of heavy metals is observed by kocaoba 2007 thermodynamic functions like change in gibbs free energy into adsorption δg⁰ kj mol enthalpy of adsorption δh⁰ kj mol and entropy of adsorption δs⁰ kj mol k are estimated through equation given below wang et al 2018 6 k d c i c e v c e w 7 lnk d δ s 0 r δ h 0 rt where ci

positive value of δh⁰ express that adsorption of uranium vi on dolomite surface is endothermic process negative value of δg⁰ indicates spontaneity of adsorption process and positive δs⁰ suggests irreversibility of process these quantities recommend thermodynamical feasibility of process 3 7 adsorption isotherm studies freundlich and langmuir isotherms are used to understand mechanism of adsorption the isotherm investigations were conducted at 303 k and ph is maintained at 3 the uranium vi concentration varied in the range 10 100 mg l freundlich and langmuir parameters were calculated through straight line graphs fig 10 value of kf 1 n qmax kl and linear regression coefficients r2 for the plots are presented into table 2 r2 values indicated that the langmuir behaviour was fitted better to the results suggested monolayer adsorption of uranium vi on dolomite through chemical forces value of qmax is calculated from langmuir model is 22 72 mg g which is close to the experimental value of 19 35 mg g value of rl for different initial concentrations ranged from 0 08 to 0 45 indicate favourable adsorption of uranium vi upon dolomite 3 8 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics of uranium vi adsorption upon dolomite surface was studied by pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetics which are mentioned in eqs 9 and 10 sequentially bhatti and hamid 2014 9 log q e q t logq

11 a and ii t qt versus t fig 11 b respectively from which the values of k1 qe and k2 are evaluated and presented into table 3 kinetic plots have appropriate linearity for both the models as indicated by their correlation coefficient r2 values pseudo first order plot r2 0 958 pseudo second order plot r2 0 992 value of qe calculated from pseudo first order equation was 9 68 mg g which is very near to the experimental value of qe 9 85 mg g than those estimated through the pseudo second order kinetics 12 05 mg g these results implied pseudo first order kinetics was followed in adsorption of uranium vi by dolomite 4 conclusion adsorption of radionuclides by natural materials is of great importance as these materials disposed contaminants without any burden to the environment the adsorptive extraction of uranium vi from aqueous solutions by dolomite is efficient economical and straightforward process uranium vi removal efficiency by dolomite is controlled by several factors namely contact time ph initial uranium vi concentration adsorbent dose and temperature at room temperature maximum uranium vi removal efficiency 78 8 by dolomite was obtained at ph 3 initial uranium

ftir spectral studies of natural dolomite rock pre adsorption and uranium vi contained rock post adsorption are depicted into fig 2 in these ftir spectrums primary absorption peaks observed on 1438 881 and 728 cm 1 these outcomes are in harmony with the previous studies shahraki et al 2009 gunasekaran and anbalagan 2007 transmittance t and position of the peaks due to carbonate group 1438 cm 1

ionization along with speciation of adsorbate and concentration of oppositely charged particles on the functional groups of the adsorbent depend on solution s ph value in present work to study the impact of ph on adsorption process ph of uranium vi solutions having a strength of 25 mg l were maintained from 2 to 9 the results are shown into fig 5 in aqueous solutions free uranyl ions uo2 2 are the main ions at ph 5 yu et al 2017 in acidic medium hco3 ions produce from the breakdown of dolomite and these ions adsorbed over it by weak vanderwaals forces which increase net negative charge on dolomite surface karaca et al 2006 positively charged uranyl ions are attracted towards this negatively charged surface and due to electrostatic attraction adsorption occurs the removal efficiency increased from 65 9 to 78 8 on increasing the ph from 2 to 3 then decreased from 69 7 to 20 2 on increasing ph from 4 to 9 the maximum removal efficiency 78 8 obtained at ph 3 at ph 3 because of dense collection of h and h3o ions adsorption of uo2 2 ions decreased as these ions fight with uo2 2 ions for active centres on the surface of dolomite in between 5 0 and 9 0 ph different complex ions like uo2oh uo2 2 oh 2 2 and uo2 3 oh 5 are formed these complex species have complicated molecular structures and greater stability therefore they prevent the removal process 3 3 effect of dolomite dose to investigate impact of dolomite dose on adsorption of uranium vi amount of powdered dolomite rock was changed in the range 0 02 0 2 g with 50 ml uranium vi solution ph 3 strength of uranium vi 25 mg l stirring speed 500 rpm and temperature 30 c were kept constant the results are presented into fig 6 removal capacity by dolomite increased from 10 2 to 78 8 on rising dolomite dose from 0 02 to 0 1 g 50 ml because of increase in the number of binding sites but when the dose was further increased from 0 1 to 0 2 g 50 ml removal capacity decreased up to 55 5 which might because of partial combination of adsorbent particles causing reduction in total surface area of adsorbent similar phenomenon was also found by bhatti and hamid 2014 in their study of removal of from aqueous solutions by eucalyptus citriodora distillation sludge 3 4 effect of uranium vi concentration fig 7 represents impact of uranium vi concentration upon removal efficiency by dolomite at 30 c when initial uranium vi concentration increased from 10 to 25 mg l removal efficiency increased from 75 6 to 78 8 but when uranium concentration was further increased removal efficiency decreased because of less availability of favourable sites with increasing metal concentrations in the aqueous phase uranium vi strength of 25 mg l was selected for further studies 3 5 effect of contact time impact of stirring time on extraction of uranium vi by dolomite was investigated by taking 0 1 g powdered dolomite rock with 50 ml uranium vi solution having the strength of 25 mg l at ph 3 in different sealed polypropylene bottles these bottles were stirred for different time spans ranging from 10 to 80 min at 30 c outcomes are illustrated into fig 8 removal efficiency increased from 51 6 to 78 8 on increasing stirring time from 10 to 40 min after that equilibrium was established between adsorbate and adsorbent and removal efficiency become constant on this basis 40 min stirring time was chosen for further investigations 3 6 effect of temperature the impact of temperature was studied at 303 313 and 323 k which is presented into fig 9 at all these temperatures uranium vi extraction raised until 40 min time period and after that equilibrium achieved between adsorbate and adsorbent slight increase observed in uranium vi removal efficiency on increasing temperature indicating endothermic nature of process similar effect of temperature on dolomite s capacity of sorption of heavy metals is observed by kocaoba 2007 thermodynamic functions like change in gibbs free energy into adsorption δg⁰ kj mol enthalpy of adsorption δh⁰ kj mol and entropy of adsorption δs⁰ kj mol k are estimated through equation given below wang et al 2018 6 k d c i c e v c e w 7 lnk d δ s 0 r δ h 0 rt where ci and ce initial and equilibrium concentration of uranium vi in solution in mg l v volume of aqueous solution in ml w amount of adsorbent in g kd distribution constant in ml g r gas constant t temperature in kelvin δh⁰ and δs⁰ were estimated through plotting ln kd against 1 t δg⁰ is obtained through equation 8 8 δ g 0 δ h 0 t δ s 0 values of δh⁰ δs⁰ and δg⁰ are presented in table 1 the positive value of δh⁰ express that adsorption of uranium vi on dolomite surface is endothermic process negative value of δg⁰ indicates spontaneity of adsorption process and positive δs⁰ suggests irreversibility of process these quantities recommend thermodynamical feasibility of process 3 7 adsorption isotherm studies freundlich and langmuir isotherms are used to understand mechanism of adsorption the isotherm investigations were conducted at 303 k and ph is maintained at 3 the uranium vi concentration varied in the range 10 100 mg l freundlich and langmuir parameters were calculated through straight line graphs fig 10 value of kf 1 n qmax kl and linear regression coefficients r2 for the plots are presented into table 2 r2 values indicated that the langmuir behaviour was fitted better to the results suggested monolayer adsorption of uranium vi on dolomite through chemical forces value of qmax is calculated from langmuir model is 22 72 mg g which is close to the experimental value of 19 35 mg g value of rl for different initial concentrations ranged from 0 08 to 0 45 indicate favourable adsorption of uranium vi upon dolomite 3 8 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics of uranium vi adsorption upon dolomite surface was studied by pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetics which are mentioned in eqs 9 and 10 sequentially bhatti and hamid 2014 9 log q e q t logq

11 a and ii t qt versus t fig 11 b respectively from which the values of k1 qe and k2 are evaluated and presented into table 3 kinetic plots have appropriate linearity for both the models as indicated by their correlation coefficient r2 values pseudo first order plot r2 0 958 pseudo second order plot r2 0 992 value of qe calculated from pseudo first order equation was 9 68 mg g which is very near to the experimental value of qe 9 85 mg g than those estimated through the pseudo second order kinetics 12 05 mg g these results implied pseudo first order kinetics was followed in adsorption of uranium vi by dolomite 4 conclusion adsorption of radionuclides by natural materials is of great importance as these materials disposed contaminants without any burden to the environment the adsorptive extraction of uranium vi from aqueous solutions by dolomite is efficient economical and straightforward process uranium vi removal efficiency by dolomite is controlled by several factors namely contact time ph initial uranium vi concentration adsorbent dose and temperature at room temperature maximum uranium vi removal efficiency 78 8 by dolomite was obtained at ph 3 initial uranium
