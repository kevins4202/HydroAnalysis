11890,the present study developed an irrigation water quality index iwqi and gis zoning maps for assessing groundwater resources for irrigation purposes in abu dhabi emirate uae the calculated iwqi values varied from 8 78 to 77 44 and 52 of the samples categorized under severe irrigation restrictions where groundwater can be used for irrigation of high salt tolerance plants only while 44 of the investigated wells located within the high restriction category 3 within moderate restriction 1 within the low irrigation restriction category and 0 within unrestricted category moreover wilcox and ussl diagrams confirmed iwqi results as the groundwater was classified mostly as unsuitable for irrigation purposes without prior treatment it shows that waters classified either as permissible to doubtful or good to permissible are forming only 3 of the overall investigated wells and are located east to abu dhabi emirate along the border with oman while none of the samples fall in excellent to good region moreover the combination of the irrigation water quality parameters such as sodium adsorption ratio sar electrical conductivity ec sodium ratio na chloride concentration and permeability index pi provided a guidance for evaluating the problems that might be developed in soil due to current irrigation practices in the study area the spatial distribution gis zoning map of the iwqi provided a clear visualization of irrigation groundwater quality in the study area and can be used along with other water quality parameters and indices as useful tools for the decision makers to identify the red zones that suffer from over extraction and as a guide for action toward a sustainable groundwater management plan for agriculture purposes additionally gis maps can be used as a guide to recommend the range of suitable crops that can be cultivated and used for the range of soils in the study area graphical abstract image 1 keywords sustainable water management groundwater iwqi gis abu dhabi uae 1 introduction water scarcity and quality are serious concerns in many countries governments are still trying to obtain additional water resources to meet the domestic agricultural and industrial sectors demands the disparity between water supply and demand its profligate use and increased global pollution puts unsustainable pressure on water supply and contributes to the depletion of groundwater quality and quantity two critical constraining factors defining water suitability are water availability and quantity to cope with increased water demands in terms of availability and quality monitoring of groundwater is essential and needs establishing adimalla et al 2020 bahadir et al 2016 in recent times a large and growing body of literature investigated groundwater paying particular attention to assessing and understanding hydrochemical characteristics and groundwater quality using several effective tools these include geochemical modelling geographical information system gis techniques water quality index wqi statistical approaches e g multivariate statistical analysis taloor et al 2020 in addition groundwater quality and contamination indices are used based on numerous physical chemical parameters adimalla and qian 2019 adimalla and taloor 2020 aravinthasamy et al 2020 asadi et al 2019 balamurugan et al 2020 goyal et al 2010 haque et al 2020 jasrotia et al

growth and the conservation of healthy ecosystems groundwater resources are still over exploited in many parts of the world particularly in arid and semi arid regions where water scarcity is almost endemic and little attention has been paid in the past to regulating or monitoring the extraction and assessment of groundwater quality in arid to extremely arid areas such as the home of the gcc countries including united arab emirate uae rainfall scarcity and variability high evaporation rates inadequate supply of renewable water coupled with rapid growth of agricultural and industrial activities have put additional stress on groundwater availability and quality although these regions do not have major agricultural potential extensive use of groundwater has been practised for long established irrigated agricultural developments al saidi and saliba 2019 santos pereira et al 2009 in abu dhabi emirate the capital of uae groundwater counts for 60 from the total water supply while desalinated counts for 35 and reclaimed wastewater use 5 the total water supply in abu dhabi emirate was estimated at 3 613 million cubic meter mm3 per year in 2015 ead 2019 agriculture consumes 71 3 followed by domestic 16 5 government 4 7 commercial 6 5 industry 1 0 traditionally local people in the emirate relied on wadis which is a way of tapping into near surface water and transporting it to where it can be used to meet their water requirements as survival in a harsh environment with limited water resources nowadays groundwater has been excessively exploited due to intensive drilling activities and deeper wells which are found mainly near the eastern region in abu dhabi emirate the condition of abu dhabi s groundwater is steadily deteriorating in terms of both quantity and quality as a result the environment agency abu dhabi ead with its key stakeholders is taking extraordinary actions to address the groundwater challenges in 2016 a new law was adopted to regulate groundwater management in the emirate and expand the regulatory capacity of ead to achieve the emirates groundwater resource conservation objectives set out in the 2030 environment vision the annual groundwater abstraction from the shallow aquifers is about 2 000 mm3 the aquifer annual natural recharge ranges from 50 to 140 mm3 a heavy reliance on already scarce groundwater resources mainly for irrigation in agriculture and afforestation has resulted in threatening changes to groundwater quality and quantity recently ead launched a groundwater monitoring network to establish the groundwater quality baseline in abu dhabi emirate which comprised 1506 monitoring wells distributed across the emirate ead 2017 the water consumption trends in abu dhabi evidence on how over the last decades water demand has increased steadily fueled by public policies the expansion of agriculture with a view to protecting the rural heritage and making abu dhabi less dependent on imported food greening the desert policies to providing a habitat for wild animals and stabilising the sand around roads and infrastructure public parks to enhance the aesthetic value of outdoor spaces residential and commercial megaprojects with a view to cater for the local population and a growing tourist industry and rapid industrialisation driven by the government s diversification effort into non oil industries in the uae the excessive use of groundwater in irrigation combined with chemical fertilisers resulted in various problems e g salinity crop toxicity and soil quality degradation which highlights the need to assess the suitability of irrigation waters for sustainable soil resource management and agricultural production 1 1 irrigation of water quality index iwqi several water quality indices wqis have been developed to be used as indicators for determination of water adequacy for both public water supply and irrigation uses adimalla and taloor 2020 dimri et al 2021 gitau et al 2016 ketata et al 2012 pak et al 2021 sutadian et al 2016 taloor et al 2020 uddin et al 2021 wÄ…tor and zdechlik 2021 a water quality index is comprised from a large data set of several water quality parameters from several locations and periods the main objective of the water quality index is to transform large and complex water quality data into objective water quality information yogendra and puttaiah 2008 this information is of direct interest to the public as it helps to provide a better understanding of water quality irrigation water quality index iwqi is a valuable and unique example of these indicators used in soil resource assessment and management of agricultural production w q c 1972 wilcox 1955 the irrigation water quality its associated hazards to soil characteristics and crop yield is often a complicated phenomenon triggered by multiple effects of water quality parameters for irrigation water quality indices only certain constituents of irrigation water quality are considered on the basis of their recommended limits for all soil types epa 1994a b these parameters were generally grouped into two quality indicators based on the following irrigation and soil management concerns bortolini et al 2018 salinity affects crop water availability permeability affects soil infiltration rate toxicity affects sensitive crops and miscellaneous affect susceptible crops ayers and westcot 1985 the two quality indicators were considered the argronomic related to soil quality which include ph ec and sar parameters and management quality indicators which include total suspended solids tss bicarbonates hco3 sulfides manganese mn and iron fe based on the two quality indicators only certain water quality parameters were used to calculate the iwqi electrical conductivity ec sodium adsorption ratio sar and the concentration of the following ions sodium n a chloride c l and bicarbonate h c o 3 abbasnia et al 2018b spandana et al 2013 zaman et al 2018 salinity hazard occurs when salts start to accumulate in the crop root zone reducing the amount of water available to the roots this reduced water availability sometimes reaches to such levels that the crop yield is adversely affected these salts often originate from dissolved minerals in the applied irrigation water or from a high level of saline water infiltration rate of water into soil is a function of many parameters however the two most common water quality factors that influence the normal rate of infiltration of water are the salinity of water and the relative concentrations of sodium magnesium and calcium ions in water that is also known as the sodium adsorption ratio sar chloride is another ion commonly found in irrigation waters although it is essential to crops at low concentrations it can cause toxicity to sensitive crops at higher levels boron is an element that is essential for plant growth when found in soil and water in low concentrations but is considered to be toxic when its concentration exceeds certain levels 1 2 study area the study area has covered abu dhabi emirate between gps coordinates of latitudes 24 28 12 n and longitudes 54 22 84 e abu dhabi emirate is the largest of the seven emirates that comprise the united arab emirates uae it has an area of 67 340 km2 which is equivalent to 80 of the country s total land abu dhabi emirate is located in an extremely arid environment characterised by severe natural water scarcity due low rainfall and high evaporation rates see fig 1 here in the emirate of abu dhabi the government has focused its efforts on meeting rising water demands as result of socio economic expansion by developing and supplying water resources this has involved the development of groundwater extensive installation of desalination plants and expansion in wastewater treatment and reuse within water resource management strategies overall abu dhabi emirate s climate is characterised by hot and dry conditions with temperatures spanning up to 50 c in summer and at least 10 c in winter average temperature 28 c with high relative humidity at coastal areas of abu dhabi 86 humidity decreasing sharply towards al ain region 53 humidity the climatic water balance indicated that precipitation exceeded potential evapotranspiration with an average value of 35 mm and 20 mm respectively this inadequate surface flow average run off 10 mm associated with dry climate low rainfall and extremely high evaporation results in limited aquifer recharge and to a slow hydrological cycle alsharhan et al 2001b the soil classification in the study area were mainly aridisol soils of a dry climate and entisol soils without distinct profile the soil types were sandy soil loamy gravel and gravely sand soil the saline soil is dominated due to several factors such as low rainfall saline groundwater and high salt content of the irrigation water it was estimated that more than 80 of the irrigated land is affected by high salinity 1 3 geology and hydrogeology the surface geology of the study area is mainly covered by quaternary age of aeolian sand sediments with many other defining rocks of different ages spanning from miocene to holocene time and types e g clay limestone sand siltstone anhydrite sandstone conglomerate as indicated by the geological map of abu dhabi that illustrating the main rock distribution in the different epochs fig 1 from a tectonic setting perspective the study area as part of the uae lies within the interior platform of the arabian shield towards the northeast and is bound at the northwest region by the qatar south fars arch and on the east and northeast by the foreland basin adjacent foreland fold and thrust belt of oman alsharhan 1989 the arabian platform has undergone several tectonic activities since the pre cambrian period which have governed the development of present day large scale structures in abu dhabi three principal tectonic cycles were distinguished in the study area the precambrian cycle the paleozoic cycle which began with a continental rift and flooded much of abu dhabi with shallow water before opening of the neo tethys resulting in transgressions and regressions of the sea level and a widespread deposition of the mesozoic cycle noufal et al 2016 structurally abu dhabi area is characterized by lineament sets trend faults fractures and joints approximately north and northwest with prevailing regime strike slip and other features such as anticlines synclines and salt domes grÃ¶tsch et al 2003 noufal et al 2016 the hydrogeological investigations indicate that the main water bearing formations in abu dhabi emirate are found in two thick i e increases to a maximum of 400 m towards al ain region high yield aquifer groups within large sedimentary basins of different geological age and setting fig 2 alsharhan et al 2001a the uppermost unconfined shallow aquifer which hosts most of the useable ground water resources comprises unconsolidated sandstones river alluvium and eolian deposits of quaternary age with thickness ranging from 100 to 120 m while the underlying confined aquifer comprising several water bearing formations namely the dammam rus umm er radhuma and simsima formations of eocene to miocene age consolidated carbonate rocks consist of a complex folded belt in some area that has been disturbed by the uplift of the oman mountains alsharhan et al 2001a the hydraulic properties of the aquifers show porosity and permeability between 6 and 35 and 8 5 x 10 8 to 3 4 x 10 4 cm sec respectively in this context it is noteworthy that fractures in the carbonate aquifer are the main control of groundwater flow alsharhan et al 2001b notwithstanding groundwater reserves range from modern to 15 000 years b p and mainly non renewable with about 80 percent of which consists of brackish water limited local recharges to the quaternary alluvium main aquifer are found northeast part of abu dhabi emirate related to rainfall in the northern oman mountains the east and flows towards the arabian gulf in the west alsharhan et al 2001b henceforth this paper focuses on assessing the suitability of waters for irrigation using 145 groundwater samples and covering a range of physiochemical water parameters in abu dhabi the primary purpose of this study is to provide comprehensive information on the properties of groundwater in abu dhabi and to develop irrigation water quality index iwqi and its spatial distribution using the gis zoning maps the findings of this study provide useful insights to support the adequacy of the current approach the planned or proposed interventions and policies to support decision making in the abu dhabi emirate on sustainable groundwater management for agricultural purposes it also highlights the need to build a risk management model that allows water related risk comparisons such as microbial and chemical hazards for various resource processing and handling practices 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection and analysis of physio chemical parameters a national monitoring programme entitled groundwater quality baseline study was conducted by ead during 2017 2018 in this study 145 groundwater samples were collected for laboratory and field measurements from 145 wells distributed in the study area respectively fig 3 the collected groundwater samples were transported for laboratory analysis at sgs gulf limited laboratories jabel ali free zone dubai using 1 l pre cleaned polyethylene bottles the sgs gulf limited laboratories are accredited according to din en iso iec 17025 sgs guidelines for sample collection and transportation were followed strictly to avoid cross contamination in contrast the other water quality analysis were carried out in the field for properties e g electrical conductivity ec groundwater temperature ph dissolved oxygen turbidity alkalinity and hydrogen sulphide using a pre calibrated portable wtw equipment wtw germany the manufacturer guidelines for calibration and cleaning for the measuring devices were followed it is noteworthy that all field measurements were noted down in the hand held data collection devices the standard methods of the examination of water and wastewater edition 21st and epa method 200 7 were followed for the water analyses apha 2005 epa 1994a b table 1 summarises the water quality parameters and standard methods of analysis 2 2 quality assurance several quality assurance procedures were carried out during the water samples analysis the field measurements were doubled checked in the lab calculation of the charge balance errors cbe in case of the major ion analysis and samples were analysed in duplicates and average value was reported additionally certified reference material crm and analysis of blank methods were employed to double check the quality assurance of the analytical procedure 2 3 geographic information systems gis the qgis 2 2 0 geographic information systems gis was used to produce visualized gis zoning maps for the investigated groundwater quality parameters in the study area the iwqi map was produced by the overlapping of the thematic maps ec sar na cl and hco3 as a result of geo statistical analysis which consists of performing the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation method in idw the vector of points data was weighted during interpolation such that the influence of one point relative to another declines with distance from the target created point this method is an extension plugin available in the qgis spatial analysis package qgis 2017 locations of the investigated wells included in this research are shown in fig 3 on a sample map created using qgis 2 4 determination of sodium adsorption ratio sar the sar was calculated in equation 1 using the following formula spandana et al 2013 1 s a r 2 n a c a 2 m g 2 where na ca2 and mg2 are defined as the concentration of sodium calcium and magnesium ions in water respectively sar unit was given in meq l 1 2 the obtained sar values for our sample are shown in table 2 2 5 determination of sodium percent na the sodium percent na is an important parameter that can be used to evaluate the groundwater quality and its appropriateness for irrigation purposes a well know classification was developed by wilcox 1955 which was documented and used in the literature for long time the groundwater was classified into five classes see also yÄ±ldÄ±z and karakuÅŸ 2020 0 na 20 excellent water 20 na 40 good water 40 na 60 permissible 60 na 80 doubtful and 80 na 100 unsuitable based on this classification the na was determined in equation 2 according to the following formula 2 n a n a k c a 2 m g 2 n a k 100 where na is the sodium percent and na k ca2 and mg2 are the concentration of the major cations in meq l the results for our samples are shown in table 3 2 6 permeability index pi the permeability index pi is another indicator for the suitability of water for irrigation purpose it is an index for the capability of water movement in soil permeability it is influenced by the long term use of irrigation water with a high concentration of salt as it is affected by n a c a 2 m g 2 and h c o 3 ions of the soil rawat et al 2018 according to doneen 1964 who had developed the pi index which is given by equation 3 3 p i n a h c o 3 c a 2 m g 2 n a 100 3 irrigation water quality index iwqi the irrigation water quality index iwqi was calculated based on the following five water quality parameters electrical conductivity e c sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium ion concentration n a chloride ion concentration c l and bicarbonate ion concentration h c o 3 abbasnia et al 2018b before starting data analysis the concentration units were transformed from mg l to meq l according to the conversion factors given by lesch and suarez 2009 in this section the iqwi was evaluated where water quality measurement parameter values q i and the accumulated witness w i were calculated table 4a summaries the irrigation water quality parameters and their proposed limiting values spandana et al 2013 abbasnia et al 2018a the q i values for the five water quality parameters q e c qsar q n a q c l and q h c o 3 were determined in equation 4 using the formula below and sample of the data presented in table 4c the upper limits of the parameters range indicated in table 4a were used as the highest value of the observed samples to evaluate x i m a p 4 q i q max x i j x inf q i m a p x a m p where q m a x is the upper value of the corresponding class of q i x i j represent the data points of the parameters shown in table 4c observed value of each parameter x i n f refers to the lower limit value of the class to which the observed parameter belongs q i m a p represents the class amplitude for q i classes x i m a p corresponds to class amplitude to which the parameter belongs finally the iwqi was determined using the following relation i w q i 1 n q i w i where n represents the number of parameters considered in this case 5 parameters values q i in table 4a were multiplied by the corresponding weight w i of the each parameter listed in table 4b according to meireles et al 2010 4 results and discussion the groundwater quality assessment in the present study was made considering irrigation water quality index iwqi sodium absorption ratio sar sodium percent na electrical conductivity ec and chloride concentration cl likewise the data was visualized using gis zoning maps for each parameter 4 1 irrigation water quality index iwqi the iwqi was considered as one of the most effective instruments for evaluating irrigation water quality for policy makers adimalla et al 2020 falowo 2017 it provided a clear classification for the irrigation water quality based on its impact on irrigated soil and toxicity to plant iwqi was classified into five categories namely no restriction iwqi 85 100 low restriction iwqi 70 85 moderate restriction iwqi 55 70 high restriction iwqi 40 55 and severe restriction iwqi 0 40 abbasnia et al 2018a khalaf r m hassan 2013 meireles et al 2010 accordingly the results of iwqi in the present work classified as follows 52 of the analysed wells were located in the severe range which limits the use of the groundwater to irrigate only high salt tolerance plants with avoiding irrigation under normal conditions while 44 of the investigated wells were located within the high restriction category that limits the use of the irrigation water for moderate to high salt tolerance plants in permeable soil without compact layers and taking in consideration the high frequency of the irrigation schedule for irrigation water with ec 2 000 Î¼s cm and sar 7 only 3 of the investigated wells were placed within the moderate restriction that limits the irrigation groundwater use for the moderate salt tolerance plant and recommended in moderate to high permeable soil taking in consideration moderate soil leaching processes however two wells out of 145 wells were placed within the low restriction category that recommends avoiding the salt sensitive plants and taking in consideration the irrigated soil texture permeability and soil sodicity problems finally no wells were identified with no restriction range table 5 it is noteworthy that 85 of the soil was classified as naturally degraded due to arid environmental conditions the baseline level of salinity in agricultural lands varied between 8 000 and 16 000 Î¼s cm and the soil texture was sandy to sandy loam in abu dhabi area as alsharhan et al 2001b ead 2018 ead 2017 furthermore according to the fao guidelines the soil in the study area falls within the strongly saline soil class therefore irrigation practices using groundwater resources without any prior treatment would increase the saline soil problems ayers and westcot 1994 4 2 gis zoning maps the groundwater quality in the study area was visualized and evaluated for the irrigation purposes using gis zoning maps for the following parameters iwqi fig 4 sodium absorption ratio sar fig 5 sodium percent na fig 6 chloride concentration fig 7 and electrical conductivity ec fig 8 the iwqi values varied between 8 78 and 77 44 generally 96 of the investigated wells have rating of high to severe restriction to be used for irrigation purposes while 4 of the investigated wells were placed within the low to moderate restrictions the gis zoning map represents the spatial distribution of the iwqi and provides a clear visualization of groundwater quality in the study area fig 2 it can be used as a useful tool for the decision makers to identify the hot zones that suffer from over extraction and give a guide for action toward a sustainable groundwater management the iwqi results and classification were discussed in detail in the previous section according to the gis iwqi map the moderate to high salt tolerance plants can be cultivated in the eastern and west southern areas which were highlighted in yellow while the low to moderate restriction plants can be cultivated mainly in the far east northern areas in abu dhabi emirate and were highlighted in in blue and green the severe restricted areas were dominated the study area and highlighted in red most of arid and semiarid regions are suffering from saline sodic soil problems that significantly affect soil properties and crops production batarseh 2017 the combination of different irrigation water quality parameters such as sar na ec and chloride would provide a comprehensive understanding of the groundwater quality and its suitability for irrigation purposes falowo 2017 table 6 was extracted from food agriculture organization f a o guidelines for water quality in irrigation and the results for the present study was categorized accordingly ayers and westcot 1994 sar values ranged from 2 71 to 55 55 meq l with an average value of 19 91 meq l according to f a o guidelines 2 1 of the investigated wells located within the 1st category that unlikely problems might happen due to use of groundwater for irrigation 19 7 within the 2nd category where problems increasingly appear and 78 2 within the 3rd category which advises severe problems to soil and plants as a consequence of irrigation with groundwater correspondingly 13 6 and 86 4 of the ec values for the investigated wells fall within the 2nd and 3rd categories respectively while for chloride concentration 97 24 from the samples were categorized in 3rd category and 2 76 in 2nd category respectively while none of the wells fall in the 1st category for both ec and chloride concentration 4 3 evaluation of groundwater quality the suitability of the groundwater use for irrigation purposes can be judged based on the sodium content percent na equation 2 as it creates sodicity problems and reduces the soil permeability batarseh 2017 a well know classification was developed by wilcox 1955 which was documented and used in the literature for a long time abbasnia et al 2018a falowo 2017 it classifies the groundwater into five classes 0 na 20 excellent water 20 na 40 good water 40 na 60 permissible 60 na 80 doubtful and 80 na 100 unsuitable the data in the present study showed that only one sample is located within the good water which compromised a 0 7 of the investigated wells while 18 4 categorized as permissible water 68 7 as doubtful water and 12 2 as unsuitable water for irrigation respectively moreover the wilcox diagram shows the relationship between salinity hazard expressed via the ec value in Î¼s cm and sodium content in water expressed as sodium ratio na salifu et al 2017 the diagram characterizes the suitability of water for irrigation in several grades namely excellent to good Î¹ good to permissible Î¹Î¹ permissible to doubtful Î¹Î¹Î¹ doubtful to unsuitable Î¹v and unsuitable v adimalla et al 2020 following simler 2021 fig 9 reveals that 88 of the groundwater samples falls in the unsuitable range 9 falls in the doubtful to unsuitable 2 in the permissible to doubtful region while the remaining 1 falls under the good to permissible range none of the investigated samples fall in excellent to good region this makes the groundwater in the study area mostly unsuitable for irrigation purposes without prior treatment this characterisation is well correlated with the high na values which ranged from 32 27 to 92 71 and the ec values from 968 to 62 000 Î¼s cm these findings can be related to high carbonate and bicarbonate content ions which tends to precipitate calcium and magnesium carbonate and elevate the sodium concentration in the irrigated soil the high concentration of sodium will decrease the soil permeability and damage the soil structure taloor et al 2020 the spatial distribution maps figs 6 and 8 for na and ec show clearly that the waters most suitable for irrigation low salinity and low sodium hazard occur in few areas along abu dhabi emirate that is the east along the border with oman moreover us salinity ussl diagram represents the relationship between salinity hazard expressed via the ec value and sodium content in water expressed via the sodium absorption ratio sar concentrations in meq l following he and li 2020 we get the diagram that appears in fig 10 a sar value less than 10 meq l sar 10 meq l are classified as excellent sar values between 10 and 18 meq l are classified as good and classified as doubtful if the sar value is between 18 and 26 meq l groundwater with a sar value greater than 26 meq l is classified as unsuitable see sadashivaiah et al 2008 salifu et al 2017 based on sar values for the study area most of the samples fall in the high or very high salinity ec category and thus most of the groundwaters can be classified as unsuitable for irrigation while ussl diagram shows that 78 6 of the samples fall into the highest salinity class and the highest sar class c4s4 11 located in c4s3 and 0 7 in c3s3 table 7 also less than 4 8 of the samples fall either middle or low in sar values c3s1 and c3s2 however these are still in the high category in electric conductivity c3 column and 3 5 fall within low to middle alkalinity with very high salinity c4s1 c4s2 the ussl diagram reveals that most of the samples fall into c4s4 region that has highest salinity class c4 and the highest sar class s4 and these findings are in alignment with wilcox diagram in fig 9 also the spatial distribution of the investigated samples for sar map in fig 5 shows clearly that the waters that are most suitable for irrigation low salinity and low sodium hazard occur in few areas along abu dhabi emirate which located east along the border with oman too permeability index pi is a good indicator to assess the suitability of water for irrigation as it relates the ions concentration of sodium calcium magnesium and bicarbonate to the effect on the soil permeability singh et al 2020 in uae the high groundwater salinity is attributed due to different factors such as the excessive abstraction for farming and irrigation uses irrigation return flow intrusion of saltwater from the sea in the coastal areas dissolution of limestone and dolomite in the subsurface geological structures and cation exchange processes these factors affect the groundwater quality and led to high pi values too singh et al 2020 pi classifies the water for its suitability for irrigation into three classes class i 75 of maximum permeability water is suitable for irrigation class ii 25 75 of maximum permeability water is good for irrigation and class iii 25 of maximum permeability water is unsuitable for irrigation in the study area the calculated pi values for the investigated groundwater samples fall in classes i 81 and class ii 16 and class iii 3 fig 11 5 conclusion the irrigation water quality index iwqi was developed in order to evaluate groundwater resources in the emirate of abu dhabi for their irrigation suitability the iwqi and gis mapping which illustrates spatial distribution along with other irrigation water quality parameters such as sar na ec and chloride additionally wilcox ussl and permeability index pi diagrams were used to illustrate the quality of groundwater and its suitability for irrigation in the study area the iwqi showed that 96 of investigated wells located within high to severe restriction category which limit it use for irrigation purposes while the other 4 of investigated wells were placed within low to moderate restriction category the gis zoning map represents the spatial distribution of the iwqi and provides a clear visualization of groundwater quality in the study area the spatial distribution maps and wilcox diagrams show clearly that the waters most suitable for irrigation that characterized with low salinity and low sodium hazard occur in few areas along abu dhabi emirate which located in the east along the border with oman although the paper is overall descriptive however this study highlights the need to set up a real time monitoring system for sustainable development of groundwater and builds a risk management module that allows water risk comparisons not only for agricultural purposes but also across a wide range of types such as those associated with public health e g microbial and chemical hazards in water for this purpose further research under way to work on sensitivity analysis to the parameters and indices that are reflected on the gis maps finally incorporating this descriptive and sensitivity analysis into risk management

11890,the present study developed an irrigation water quality index iwqi and gis zoning maps for assessing groundwater resources for irrigation purposes in abu dhabi emirate uae the calculated iwqi values varied from 8 78 to 77 44 and 52 of the samples categorized under severe irrigation restrictions where groundwater can be used for irrigation of high salt tolerance plants only while 44 of the investigated wells located within the high restriction category 3 within moderate restriction 1 within the low irrigation restriction category and 0 within unrestricted category moreover wilcox and ussl diagrams confirmed iwqi results as the groundwater was classified mostly as unsuitable for irrigation purposes without prior treatment it shows that waters classified either as permissible to doubtful or good to permissible are forming only 3 of the overall investigated wells and are located east to abu dhabi emirate along the border with oman while none of the samples fall in excellent to good region moreover the combination of the irrigation water quality parameters such as sodium adsorption ratio sar electrical conductivity ec sodium ratio na chloride concentration and permeability index pi provided a guidance for evaluating the problems that might be developed in soil due to current irrigation practices in the study area the spatial distribution gis zoning map of the iwqi provided a clear visualization of irrigation groundwater quality in the study area and can be used along with other water quality parameters and indices as useful tools for the decision makers to identify the red zones that suffer from over extraction and as a guide for action toward a sustainable groundwater management plan for agriculture purposes additionally gis maps can be used as a guide to recommend the range of suitable crops that can be cultivated and used for the range of soils in the study area graphical abstract image 1 keywords sustainable water management groundwater iwqi gis

growth and the conservation of healthy ecosystems groundwater resources are still over exploited in many parts of the world particularly in arid and semi arid regions where water scarcity is almost endemic and little attention has been paid in the past to regulating or monitoring the extraction and assessment of groundwater quality in arid to extremely arid areas such as the home of the gcc countries including united arab emirate uae rainfall scarcity and variability high evaporation rates inadequate supply of renewable water coupled with rapid growth of agricultural and industrial activities have put additional stress on groundwater availability and quality although these regions do not have major agricultural potential extensive use of groundwater has been practised for long established irrigated agricultural developments al saidi and saliba 2019 santos pereira et al 2009 in abu dhabi emirate the capital of uae groundwater counts for 60 from the total water supply while desalinated counts for 35 and reclaimed wastewater use 5 the total water supply in abu dhabi emirate was estimated at 3 613 million cubic meter mm3 per year in 2015 ead 2019 agriculture consumes 71 3 followed by domestic 16 5 government 4 7 commercial 6 5 industry 1 0 traditionally local people in the emirate relied on wadis which is a way of tapping into near surface water and transporting it to where it can be used to meet their water requirements as survival in a harsh environment with limited water resources nowadays groundwater has been excessively exploited due to intensive drilling activities and deeper wells which are found mainly near the eastern region in abu dhabi emirate the condition of abu dhabi s groundwater is steadily deteriorating in terms of both quantity and quality as a result the environment agency abu dhabi ead with its key stakeholders is taking extraordinary actions to address the groundwater challenges in 2016 a new law was adopted to regulate groundwater management in the emirate and expand the regulatory capacity of ead to achieve the emirates groundwater resource conservation objectives set out in the 2030 environment vision the annual groundwater abstraction from the shallow aquifers is about 2 000 mm3 the aquifer annual natural recharge ranges from 50 to 140 mm3 a heavy reliance on already scarce groundwater resources mainly for irrigation in agriculture and afforestation has resulted in threatening changes to groundwater quality and quantity recently ead launched a groundwater monitoring network to establish the groundwater quality baseline in abu dhabi emirate which comprised 1506 monitoring wells distributed across the emirate ead 2017 the water consumption trends in abu dhabi evidence on how over the last decades water demand has increased steadily fueled by public policies the expansion of agriculture with a view to protecting the rural heritage and making abu dhabi less dependent on imported food greening the desert policies to providing a habitat for wild animals and stabilising the sand around roads and infrastructure public parks to enhance the aesthetic value of outdoor spaces residential and commercial megaprojects with a view to cater for the local population and a growing tourist industry and rapid industrialisation driven by the government s diversification effort into non oil industries in the uae the excessive use of groundwater in irrigation combined with chemical fertilisers resulted in various problems e g salinity crop toxicity and soil quality degradation which highlights the need to assess the suitability of irrigation waters for sustainable soil resource management and agricultural production 1 1 irrigation of water quality index iwqi several water quality indices wqis have been developed to be used as indicators for determination of water adequacy for both public water supply and irrigation uses adimalla and taloor 2020 dimri et al 2021 gitau et al 2016 ketata et al 2012 pak et al 2021 sutadian et al 2016 taloor et al 2020 uddin et al 2021 wÄ…tor and zdechlik 2021 a water quality index is comprised from a large data set of several water quality parameters from several locations and periods the main objective of the water quality index is to transform large and complex water quality data into objective water quality information yogendra and puttaiah 2008 this information is of direct interest to the public as it helps to provide a better understanding of water quality irrigation water quality index iwqi is a valuable and unique example of these indicators used in soil resource assessment and management of agricultural production w q c 1972 wilcox 1955 the irrigation water quality its associated hazards to soil characteristics and crop yield is often a complicated phenomenon triggered by multiple effects of water quality parameters for irrigation water quality indices only certain constituents of irrigation water quality are considered on the basis of their recommended limits for all soil types epa 1994a b these parameters were generally grouped into two quality indicators based on the following irrigation and soil management concerns bortolini et al 2018 salinity affects crop water availability permeability affects soil infiltration rate toxicity affects sensitive crops and miscellaneous affect susceptible crops ayers and westcot 1985 the two quality indicators were considered the argronomic related to soil quality which include ph ec and sar parameters and management quality indicators which include total suspended solids tss bicarbonates hco3 sulfides manganese mn and iron fe based on the two quality indicators only certain water quality parameters were used to calculate the iwqi electrical conductivity ec sodium adsorption ratio sar and the concentration of the following ions sodium n a chloride c l and bicarbonate h c o 3 abbasnia et al 2018b spandana et al 2013 zaman et al 2018 salinity hazard occurs when salts start to accumulate in the crop root zone reducing the amount of water available to the roots this reduced water availability sometimes reaches to such levels that the crop yield is adversely affected these salts often originate from dissolved minerals in the applied irrigation water or from a high level of saline water infiltration rate of water into soil is a function of many parameters however the two most common water quality factors that influence the normal rate of infiltration of water are the salinity of water and the relative concentrations of sodium magnesium and calcium ions in water that is also known as the sodium adsorption ratio sar chloride is another ion commonly found in irrigation waters although it is essential to crops at low concentrations it can cause toxicity to sensitive crops at higher levels boron is an element that is essential for plant growth when found in soil and water in low concentrations but is considered to be toxic when its concentration exceeds certain levels 1 2 study area the study area has covered abu dhabi emirate between gps coordinates of latitudes 24 28 12 n and longitudes 54 22 84 e abu dhabi emirate is the largest of the seven emirates that comprise the united arab emirates uae it has an area of 67 340 km2 which is equivalent to 80 of the country s total land abu dhabi emirate is located in an extremely arid environment characterised by severe natural water scarcity due low rainfall and high evaporation rates see fig 1 here in the emirate of abu dhabi the government has focused its efforts on meeting rising water demands as result of socio economic expansion by developing and supplying water resources this has involved the development of groundwater extensive installation of desalination plants and expansion in wastewater treatment and reuse within water resource management strategies overall abu dhabi emirate s climate is characterised by hot and dry conditions with temperatures spanning up to 50 c in summer and at least 10 c in winter average temperature 28 c with high relative humidity at coastal areas of abu dhabi 86 humidity decreasing sharply towards al ain region 53 humidity the climatic water balance indicated that precipitation exceeded potential evapotranspiration with an average value of 35 mm and 20 mm respectively this inadequate surface flow average run off 10 mm associated with dry climate low rainfall and extremely high evaporation results in limited aquifer recharge and to a slow hydrological cycle alsharhan et al 2001b the soil classification in the study area were mainly aridisol soils of a dry climate and entisol soils without distinct profile the soil types were sandy soil loamy gravel and gravely sand soil the saline soil is dominated due to several factors such as low rainfall saline groundwater and high salt content of the irrigation water it was estimated that more than 80 of the irrigated land is affected by high salinity 1 3 geology and hydrogeology the surface geology of the study area is mainly covered by quaternary age of aeolian sand sediments with many other defining rocks of different ages spanning from miocene to holocene time and types e g clay limestone sand siltstone anhydrite sandstone conglomerate as indicated by the geological map of abu dhabi that illustrating the main rock distribution in the different epochs fig 1 from a tectonic setting perspective the study area as part of the uae lies within the interior platform of the arabian shield towards the northeast and is bound at the northwest region by the qatar south fars arch and on the east and northeast by the foreland basin adjacent foreland fold and thrust belt of oman alsharhan 1989 the arabian platform has undergone several tectonic activities since the pre cambrian period which have governed the development of present day large scale structures in abu dhabi three principal tectonic cycles were distinguished in the study area the precambrian cycle the paleozoic cycle which began with a continental rift and flooded much of abu dhabi with shallow water before opening of the neo tethys resulting in transgressions and regressions of the sea level and a widespread deposition of the mesozoic cycle noufal et al 2016 structurally abu dhabi area is characterized by lineament sets trend faults fractures and joints approximately north and northwest with prevailing regime strike slip and other features such as anticlines synclines and salt domes grÃ¶tsch et al 2003 noufal et al 2016 the hydrogeological investigations indicate that the main water bearing formations in abu dhabi emirate are found in two thick i e increases to a maximum of 400 m towards al ain region high yield aquifer groups within large sedimentary basins of different geological age and setting fig 2 alsharhan et al 2001a the uppermost unconfined shallow aquifer which hosts most of the useable ground water resources comprises unconsolidated sandstones river alluvium and eolian deposits of quaternary age with thickness ranging from 100 to 120 m while the underlying confined aquifer comprising several water bearing formations namely the dammam rus umm er radhuma and simsima formations of eocene to miocene age consolidated carbonate rocks consist of a complex folded belt in some area that has been disturbed by the uplift of the oman mountains alsharhan et al 2001a the hydraulic properties of the aquifers show porosity and permeability between 6 and 35 and 8 5 x 10 8 to 3 4 x 10 4 cm sec respectively in this context it is noteworthy that fractures in the carbonate aquifer are the main control of groundwater flow alsharhan et al 2001b notwithstanding groundwater reserves range from modern to 15 000 years b p and mainly non renewable with about 80 percent of which consists of brackish water limited local recharges to the quaternary alluvium main aquifer are found northeast part of abu dhabi emirate related to rainfall in the northern oman mountains the east and flows towards the arabian gulf in the west alsharhan et al 2001b henceforth this paper focuses on assessing the suitability of waters for irrigation using 145 groundwater samples and covering a range of physiochemical water parameters in abu dhabi the primary purpose of this study is to provide comprehensive information on the properties of groundwater in abu dhabi and to develop irrigation water quality index iwqi and its spatial distribution using the gis zoning maps the findings of this study provide useful insights to support the adequacy of the current approach the planned or proposed interventions and policies to support decision making in the abu dhabi emirate on sustainable groundwater management for agricultural purposes it also highlights the need to build a risk management model that allows water related risk comparisons such as microbial and chemical hazards for various resource processing and handling practices 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection and analysis of physio chemical parameters a national monitoring programme entitled groundwater quality baseline study was conducted by ead during 2017 2018 in this study 145 groundwater samples were collected for laboratory and field measurements from 145 wells distributed in the study area respectively fig 3 the collected groundwater samples were transported for laboratory analysis at sgs gulf limited laboratories jabel ali free zone dubai using 1 l pre cleaned polyethylene bottles the sgs gulf limited laboratories are accredited according to din en iso iec 17025 sgs guidelines for sample collection and transportation were followed strictly to avoid cross contamination in contrast the other water quality analysis were carried out in the field for properties e g electrical conductivity ec groundwater temperature ph dissolved oxygen turbidity alkalinity and hydrogen sulphide using a pre calibrated portable wtw equipment wtw germany the manufacturer guidelines for calibration and cleaning for the measuring devices were followed it is noteworthy that all field measurements were noted down in the hand held data collection devices the standard methods of the examination of water and wastewater edition 21st and epa method 200 7 were followed for the water analyses apha 2005 epa 1994a b table 1 summarises the water quality parameters and standard methods of analysis 2 2 quality assurance several quality assurance procedures were carried out during the water samples analysis the field measurements were doubled checked in the lab calculation of the charge balance errors cbe in case of the major ion analysis and samples were analysed in duplicates and average value was reported additionally certified reference material crm and analysis of blank methods were employed to double check the quality assurance of the analytical procedure 2 3 geographic information systems gis the qgis 2 2 0 geographic information systems gis was used to produce visualized gis zoning maps for the investigated groundwater quality parameters in the study area the iwqi map was produced by the overlapping of the thematic maps ec sar na cl and hco3 as a result of geo statistical analysis which consists of performing the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation method in idw the vector of points data was weighted during interpolation such that the influence of one point relative to another declines with distance from the target created point this method is an extension plugin available in the qgis spatial analysis package qgis 2017 locations of the investigated wells included in this research are shown in fig 3 on a sample map created using qgis 2 4 determination of sodium adsorption ratio sar the sar was calculated in equation 1 using the following formula spandana et al 2013 1 s a r 2 n a c a 2 m g 2 where na ca2 and mg2 are defined as the concentration of sodium calcium and magnesium ions in water respectively sar unit was given in meq l 1 2 the obtained sar values for our sample are shown in table 2 2 5 determination of sodium percent na the sodium percent na is an important parameter that can be used to evaluate the groundwater quality and its appropriateness for irrigation purposes a well know classification was developed by wilcox 1955 which was documented and used in the literature for long time the groundwater was classified into five classes see also yÄ±ldÄ±z and karakuÅŸ 2020 0 na 20 excellent water 20 na 40 good water 40 na 60 permissible 60 na 80 doubtful and 80 na 100 unsuitable based on this classification the na was determined in equation 2 according to the following formula 2 n a n a k c a 2 m g 2 n a k 100 where na is the sodium percent and na k ca2 and mg2 are the concentration of the major cations in meq l the results for our samples are shown in table 3 2 6 permeability index pi the permeability index pi is another indicator for the suitability of water for irrigation purpose it is an index for the capability of water movement in soil permeability it is influenced by the long term use of irrigation water with a high concentration of salt as it is affected by n a c a 2 m g 2 and h c o 3 ions of the soil rawat et al 2018 according to doneen 1964 who had developed the pi index which is given by equation 3 3 p i n a h c o 3 c a 2 m g 2 n a 100 3 irrigation water quality index iwqi the irrigation water quality index iwqi was calculated based on the following five water quality parameters electrical conductivity e c sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium ion concentration n a chloride ion concentration c l and bicarbonate ion concentration h c o 3 abbasnia et al 2018b before starting data analysis the concentration units were transformed from mg l to meq l according to the conversion factors given by lesch and suarez 2009 in this section the iqwi was evaluated where water quality measurement parameter values q i and the accumulated witness w i were calculated table 4a summaries the irrigation water quality parameters and their proposed limiting values spandana et al 2013 abbasnia et al 2018a the q i values for the five water quality parameters q e c qsar q n a q c l and q h c o 3 were determined in equation 4 using the formula below and sample of the data presented in table 4c the upper limits of the parameters range indicated in table 4a were used as the highest value of the observed samples to evaluate x i m a p 4 q i q max x i j x inf q i m a p x a m p where q m a x is the upper value of the corresponding class of q i x i j represent the data points of the parameters shown in table 4c observed value of each parameter x i n f refers to the lower limit value of the class to which the observed parameter belongs q i m a p represents the class amplitude for q i classes x i m a p corresponds to class amplitude to which the parameter belongs finally the iwqi was determined using the following relation i w q i 1 n q i w i where n represents the number of parameters considered in this case 5 parameters values q i in table 4a were multiplied by the corresponding weight w i of the each parameter listed in table 4b according to meireles et al 2010 4 results and discussion the groundwater quality assessment in the present study was made considering irrigation water quality index iwqi sodium absorption ratio sar sodium percent na electrical conductivity ec and chloride concentration cl likewise the data was visualized using gis zoning maps for each parameter 4 1 irrigation water quality index iwqi the iwqi was considered as one of the most effective instruments for evaluating irrigation water quality for policy makers adimalla et al 2020 falowo 2017 it provided a clear classification for the irrigation water quality based on its impact on irrigated soil and toxicity to plant iwqi was classified into five categories namely no restriction iwqi 85 100 low restriction iwqi 70 85 moderate restriction iwqi 55 70 high restriction iwqi 40 55 and severe restriction iwqi 0 40 abbasnia et al 2018a khalaf r m hassan 2013 meireles et al 2010 accordingly the results of iwqi in the present work classified as follows 52 of the analysed wells were located in the severe range which limits the use of the groundwater to irrigate only high salt tolerance plants with avoiding irrigation under normal conditions while 44 of the investigated wells were located within the high restriction category that limits the use of the irrigation water for moderate to high salt tolerance plants in permeable soil without compact layers and taking in consideration the high frequency of the irrigation schedule for irrigation water with ec 2 000 Î¼s cm and sar 7 only 3 of the investigated wells were placed within the moderate restriction that limits the irrigation groundwater use for the moderate salt tolerance plant and recommended in moderate to high permeable soil taking in consideration moderate soil leaching processes however two wells out of 145 wells were placed within the low restriction category that recommends avoiding the salt sensitive plants and taking in consideration the irrigated soil texture permeability and soil sodicity problems finally no wells were identified with no restriction range table 5 it is noteworthy that 85 of the soil was classified as naturally degraded due to arid environmental conditions the baseline level of salinity in agricultural lands varied between 8 000 and 16 000 Î¼s cm and the soil texture was sandy to sandy loam in abu dhabi area as alsharhan et al 2001b ead 2018 ead 2017 furthermore according to the fao guidelines the soil in the study area falls within the strongly saline soil class therefore irrigation practices using groundwater resources without any prior treatment would increase the saline soil problems ayers and westcot 1994 4 2 gis zoning maps the groundwater quality in the study area was visualized and evaluated for the irrigation purposes using gis zoning maps for the following parameters iwqi fig 4 sodium absorption ratio sar fig 5 sodium percent na fig 6 chloride concentration fig 7 and electrical conductivity ec fig 8 the iwqi values varied between 8 78 and 77 44 generally 96 of the investigated wells have rating of high to severe restriction to be used for irrigation purposes while 4 of the investigated wells were placed within the low to moderate restrictions the gis zoning map represents the spatial distribution of the iwqi and provides a clear visualization of groundwater quality in the study area fig 2 it can be used as a useful tool for the decision makers to identify the hot zones that suffer from over extraction and give a guide for action toward a sustainable groundwater management the iwqi results and classification were discussed in detail in the previous section according to the gis iwqi map the moderate to high salt tolerance plants can be cultivated in the eastern and west southern areas which were highlighted in yellow while the low to moderate restriction plants can be cultivated mainly in the far east northern areas in abu dhabi emirate and were highlighted in in blue and green the severe restricted areas were dominated the study area and highlighted in red most of arid and semiarid regions are suffering from saline sodic soil problems that significantly affect soil properties and crops production batarseh 2017 the combination of different irrigation water quality parameters such as sar na ec and chloride would provide a comprehensive understanding of the groundwater quality and its suitability for irrigation purposes falowo 2017 table 6 was extracted from food agriculture organization f a o guidelines for water quality in irrigation and the results for the present study was categorized accordingly ayers and westcot 1994 sar values ranged from 2 71 to 55 55 meq l with an average value of 19 91 meq l according to f a o guidelines 2 1 of the investigated wells located within the 1st category that unlikely problems might happen due to use of groundwater for irrigation 19 7 within the 2nd category where problems increasingly appear and 78 2 within the 3rd category which advises severe problems to soil and plants as a consequence of irrigation with groundwater correspondingly 13 6 and 86 4 of the ec values for the investigated wells fall within the 2nd and 3rd categories respectively while for chloride concentration 97 24 from the samples were categorized in 3rd category and 2 76 in 2nd category respectively while none of the wells fall in the 1st category for both ec and chloride concentration 4 3 evaluation of groundwater quality the suitability of the groundwater use for irrigation purposes can be judged based on the sodium content percent na equation 2 as it creates sodicity problems and reduces the soil permeability batarseh 2017 a well know classification was developed by wilcox 1955 which was documented and used in the literature for a long time abbasnia et al 2018a falowo 2017 it classifies the groundwater into five classes 0 na 20 excellent water 20 na 40 good water 40 na 60 permissible 60 na 80 doubtful and 80 na 100 unsuitable the data in the present study showed that only one sample is located within the good water which compromised a 0 7 of the investigated wells while 18 4 categorized as permissible water 68 7 as doubtful water and 12 2 as unsuitable water for irrigation respectively moreover the wilcox diagram shows the relationship between salinity hazard expressed via the ec value in Î¼s cm and sodium content in water expressed as sodium ratio na salifu et al 2017 the diagram characterizes the suitability of water for irrigation in several grades namely excellent to good Î¹ good to permissible Î¹Î¹ permissible to doubtful Î¹Î¹Î¹ doubtful to unsuitable Î¹v and unsuitable v adimalla et al 2020 following simler 2021 fig 9 reveals that 88 of the groundwater samples falls in the unsuitable range 9 falls in the doubtful to unsuitable 2 in the permissible to doubtful region while the remaining 1 falls under the good to permissible range none of the investigated samples fall in excellent to good region this makes the groundwater in the study area mostly unsuitable for irrigation purposes without prior treatment this characterisation is well correlated with the high na values which ranged from 32 27 to 92 71 and the ec values from 968 to 62 000 Î¼s cm these findings can be related to high carbonate and bicarbonate content ions which tends to precipitate calcium and magnesium carbonate and elevate the sodium concentration in the irrigated soil the high concentration of sodium will decrease the soil permeability and damage the soil structure taloor et al 2020 the spatial distribution maps figs 6 and 8 for na and ec show clearly that the waters most suitable for irrigation low salinity and low sodium hazard occur in few areas along abu dhabi emirate that is the east along the border with oman moreover us salinity ussl diagram represents the relationship between salinity hazard expressed via the ec value and sodium content in water expressed via the sodium absorption ratio sar concentrations in meq l following he and li 2020 we get the diagram that appears in fig 10 a sar value less than 10 meq l sar 10 meq l are classified as excellent sar values between 10 and 18 meq l are classified as good and classified as doubtful if the sar value is between 18 and 26 meq l groundwater with a sar value greater than 26 meq l is classified as unsuitable see sadashivaiah et al 2008 salifu et al 2017 based on sar values for the study area most of the samples fall in the high or very high salinity ec category and thus most of the groundwaters can be classified as unsuitable for irrigation while ussl diagram shows that 78 6 of the samples fall into the highest salinity class and the highest sar class c4s4 11 located in c4s3 and 0 7 in c3s3 table 7 also less than 4 8 of the samples fall either middle or low in sar values c3s1 and c3s2 however these are still in the high category in electric conductivity c3 column and 3 5 fall within low to middle alkalinity with very high salinity c4s1 c4s2 the ussl diagram reveals that most of the samples fall into c4s4 region that has highest salinity class c4 and the highest sar class s4 and these findings are in alignment with wilcox diagram in fig 9 also the spatial distribution of the investigated samples for sar map in fig 5 shows clearly that the waters that are most suitable for irrigation low salinity and low sodium hazard occur in few areas along abu dhabi emirate which located east along the border with oman too permeability index pi is a good indicator to assess the suitability of water for irrigation as it relates the ions concentration of sodium calcium magnesium and bicarbonate to the effect on the soil permeability singh et al 2020 in uae the high groundwater salinity is attributed due to different factors such as the excessive abstraction for farming and irrigation uses irrigation return flow intrusion of saltwater from the sea in the coastal areas dissolution of limestone and dolomite in the subsurface geological structures and cation exchange processes these factors affect the groundwater quality and led to high pi values too singh et al 2020 pi classifies the water for its suitability for irrigation into three classes class i 75 of maximum permeability water is suitable for irrigation class ii 25 75 of maximum permeability water is good for irrigation and class iii 25 of maximum permeability water is unsuitable for irrigation in the study area the calculated pi values for the investigated groundwater samples fall in classes i 81 and class ii 16 and class iii 3 fig 11 5 conclusion the irrigation water quality index iwqi was developed in order to evaluate groundwater resources in the emirate of abu dhabi for their irrigation suitability the iwqi and gis mapping which illustrates spatial distribution along with other irrigation water quality parameters such as sar na ec and chloride additionally wilcox ussl and permeability index pi diagrams were used to illustrate the quality of groundwater and its suitability for irrigation in the study area the iwqi showed that 96 of investigated wells located within high to severe restriction category which limit it use for irrigation purposes while the other 4 of investigated wells were placed within low to moderate restriction category the gis zoning map represents the spatial distribution of the iwqi and provides a clear visualization of groundwater quality in the study area the spatial distribution maps and wilcox diagrams show clearly that the waters most suitable for irrigation that characterized with low salinity and low sodium hazard occur in few areas along abu dhabi emirate which located in the east along the border with oman although the paper is overall descriptive however this study highlights the need to set up a real time monitoring system for sustainable development of groundwater and builds a risk management module that allows water risk comparisons not only for agricultural purposes but also across a wide range of types such as those associated with public health e g microbial and chemical hazards in water for this purpose further research under way to work on sensitivity analysis to the parameters and indices that are reflected on the gis maps finally incorporating this descriptive and sensitivity analysis into risk management

11891,globally groundwater resources play a crucial role in supporting livelihoods and sustaining human health groundwater recharge is mainly influenced by the spatial distribution of rainfall patterns across groundwater basins and the heterogeneous distribution of geology soil and topographical characteristics this study evaluates the implications of variations in rainfall and land use on groundwater level fluctuations in the kathmandu valley nepal we selected and analyzed data from thirty five monitoring wells observed by citizen scientists from july 2017 to june 2019 over two years groundwater levels varied spatially from 0 11m negative sign denotes a groundwater level higher than the ground surface to 11 5m with a mean of 4 24m and a standard deviation of 2 29m our results indicated a strong positive correlation between rainfall and groundwater levels as the fluctuation was influenced by the rainfall of that area the seasonal fluctuations in groundwater level showed the direct influence of monsoonal rainfall in areas with agricultural land use 80 of the analysed wells showed a strong and statistically significant correlation between rainfall and groundwater levels in contrast higher groundwater extraction rates and surface sealing limited groundwater recharge in built land uses therefore wells across non agricultural land uses showed a weak correlation in most of the cases in the northern groundwater district we found areas with highly permeable sand and gravel have nearly constant groundwater levels shallow in agricultural land use and deep in built land use year round and act as potential recharge zones for the aquifer the areas with less permeable but highly porous clay and silt in agricultural land use and show greater seasonal groundwater fluctuations our study highlights the ability of citizens to generate meaningful hydrogeologic datasets and the importance of rainfall and land use planning to groundwater recharge understanding these complex relationships must form the basis for the sustainable management of the rapidly declining groundwater resources of the kathmandu valley graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater citizen science

agricultural and industrial usage foster and chilton 2003 shah 2007 giordano 2009 because of its ready availability in most areas and generally good quality i e requiring minimal treatment foster and cherlet 2014 since groundwater is an unseen resource it s difficult to characterize or monitor over time and space groundwater levels in aquifers represent a dynamic balance between groundwater storage recharge and discharge conlon et al 2005 aquifer storage increases if recharge exceeds discharge and vice versa groundwater levels continuously rise or fall according to the imbalance between recharge and discharge one of the simple ways of tracking groundwater storage fluctuations over time is monitoring the groundwater levels in wells groundwater level measurements also provide an

about half of the valley s total water supply during the wet season and around 60 70 during the dry season comes from groundwater sources including shallow and deep aquifers jha et al 1997 khatiwada et al 2002 however the excessive groundwater extraction coupled with land use change and lack of solid waste and wastewater management has increased the vulnerability of the groundwater resources in the valley and is expected to worsen due to climate change impacts in the future pandey et al 2010 gautam et al 2017 lamichhane and shakya 2019 erratic changes in rainfall and evaporation due to climate change might significantly impact groundwater resources by affecting groundwater recharge rates and changing groundwater availability shrestha et al 2020 in the past two decades from 1990 to 2010 significant land use change has been observed in the kathmandu valley where agricultural areas decreased by 9 8 forests by 9 28 and water bodies by 77 however the decline in these areas expanded urbanized areas by about 52 wang et al 2020 the conversion of natural and agricultural land for residential and urban uses results from rapid population growth caused by internal immigration and unplanned urbanization icimod 2010 the agricultural area in the kathmandu valley is projected to decrease by 20 in contrast the built up area is projected to increase by 21 between 2020 and 2050 which will have a significant implication in groundwater depletion lamichhane and shakya 2019 high population growth rate coupled with haphazard urbanization cause both an excessive abstraction of groundwater beyond recharge rate and an increase in surface sealing pandey et al 2010 the rise in surface sealing subsequently amplifies the rate of surface runoff resulting in decreased groundwater recharge and modifies the natural drainage system kinzie 2008 thapa et al 2017 thapa et al 2017 depicted that the evaporation varied from around 41 47 and the runoff varied from 55 59 of the total precipitation showing very little recharge due to highly urbanized land use patterns across the valley floor previously numerous studies have been carried out to identify the impact of rainfall and land use change in groundwater recharge adhikari et al 2020 assessed the impacts of change in land use patterns on the quantity of groundwater recharge in ho chi minh city vietnam by using an empirical land use projection model conversion of land use and its effects dyna clue and a hydrologic model soil and water assessment tool swat their study found out that the change in the built up area has a huge impact on the groundwater recharge as it was observed to increase in the far future of low urbanization scenario by 10 in comparison reductions of 30 and 52 in annual average recharge were observed in the far future of medium urbanization scenario and the high urbanization scenario respectively abdelaziz et al 2020 carried out a similar study focusing on the influence of land use land cover on groundwater recharge using the water balance method in the continental terminal area of abidjan ivory coast their study revealed that rainfall is the most influential factor in groundwater recharge during the wet season in contrast both rainfall and land use land cover change have a significant impact on annual recharge likewise patra et al 2018 evaluated the effect of rainfall temperature and land use change in the groundwater level during the pre monsoon and post monsoon season using remote sensing and gis techniques in west bengal india in this context a proper understanding of the spatial and temporal fluctuation of groundwater levels in connection with rainfall and land use is crucial for effective and sustainable groundwater resource management of the kathmandu valley limited studies have been conducted to explore the linkage of groundwater level variability to rainfall and land use in the kathmandu valley lamichhane et al 2020 adopted a model based approach to identify the spatial distribution of potential recharge rates and changes in groundwater level by considering pumping rate and land use land cover change scenarios however the existing studies have in general focused on examining bivariate relationships between change in groundwater level and rainfall change in land use and groundwater recharge etc hence a multivariate relationship among groundwater level rainfall land use soil types and hydrogeology remained largely unexplored in the literature this particular research work is an attempt to fill in this gap in other words this study was designed to evaluate the effects of variations in rainfall land use soil types and hydrogeology on groundwater level fluctuations in the kathmandu valley the objectives of the study were 1 to understand the spatio temporal variation of groundwater levels of the kathmandu valley 2 to investigate the response of groundwater levels to rainfall in different land use types soil types and hydrogeological zones 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the kathmandu valley is located between 27 32 13 27 49 10 n latitude and 85 11 31 85 31 38 e longitude in the central region of nepal fig 1 the kathmandu valley watershed with a total land area of 584km2 is a circular intermontane basin roughly 25 km in diameter and encircled by hills in its peripheries within this small geographical area the valley has complex topography thapa and murayama 2009 as the elevation of the valley ranges from approximately 1100 to 2700 m above mean sea level masl the subtropical climate of the valley is influenced by the south asian monsoon altering the precipitation pattern and wind direction and more than 80 of the annual rainfall occurs from june to september shrestha 2000 istiaque et al 2017 davids et al 2018 within the valley the highest and lowest amounts of precipitation fall in the northwestern and southern regions respectively the monsoon season is followed by winter spring and summer the average annual temperature and rainfall of the valley is 18 1 c and 1407 mm respectively ishtiaque et al 2017 the kathmandu valley resides on an intensely folded faulted and fractured kathmandu nappe sakai 2001 the southern and western parts of the valley contain sedimentary basement rocks whereas igneous and metamorphic rocks dominate the northern and eastern parts dhital 2015 it contains a compact fluvial lacustrine layer of quaternary pleistocene sediments composed of sand silt clay and gravel shakya et al 2019a b a figure showing the shallow subsurface soil profile and groundwater districts of the study area is included as supplementary material s1 this subsurface soil profile is reproduced from the engineering and environmental geological map of the kathmandu valley it was reclassified into different classes clay silt sand and gravel and river deposits based on their infiltration capacity silt sand and gravel soil types cover most parts of the groundwater basin in the valley whereas clay soil type is scattered around the central and southern part of the groundwater basin shrestha et al 2017 shakya et al 2019a b based on physical and chemical characteristics of the groundwater and geological conditions jica 1990 categorized the kathmandu valley into three groundwater districts the principal aquifer of the northern groundwater district ngd is formed by the deposits of sand and gravel beds and has high recharge potential chapagain et al 2010 the central groundwater district cgd is overlain by very thick 200 m impermeable black kalimati clay which limits the recharge rate chapagain et al 2010 the southern groundwater district sgd comprises carbonate rocks classified as lower permeability layers chapagain et al 2010 groundwater in the valley is extracted from both shallow 0 60m depth and deep 60m depth aquifers shakya et al 2019a b gurung et al 2007 the deep aquifer and shallow aquifer are distinguished by a thick aquitard of approximately 200m clay distributed mostly toward the central valley the aquitard thickness gradually reduces toward the valley peripheries jica 1990 metcalf and eddy 2000 the extracted groundwater is one of the major sources for drinking and other domestic purposes for the entire valley population shrestha et al 2014 2 2 data analysis 2 2 1 rainfall data daily rainfall data was obtained from the department of hydrology and meteorology dhm government of nepal gon dhm 2019 there are 20 rainfall stations in the kathmandu valley with elevations ranging from 1212m at khokana to 2163m at nagarkot however one station budhanilkantha had no data for the study period and was excluded from the analysis remaining 19 stations fig 1 were utilized for the july 2017 to june 2019 study period to develop the spatial distribution of rainfall in the kathmandu valley a summary of the selected rainfall stations including their locations elevation and installation date is included as supplementary material missing data were replaced with rainfall data of the nearest station and the thiessen polygon method was used to create a continuous coverage of daily rainfall data for the kathmandu valley the geo locations of the rainfall stations along with the rainfall data of the study period were then loaded into a quantum geographic information system qgis database for further analysis 2 2 2 land use data land use classifications at a 30m spatial resolution were developed by davids et al 2018 using a landsat 8 image captured in the fall of 2015 and ground based observations conducted by citizen scientists broadly three land uses classes were selected to represent the land uses in the kathmandu valley for this study i natural land uses forest shrubland ii agricultural land use and iii built land uses davids et al 2018 classified the valley as 33 natural land uses 41 agricultural land use and 26 built land use fig 1 the recharge area contributing to each monitoring well i e zone of contribution or zoc was assumed to have a radius of 1000m the percentage of different land use types was determined for each well s zoc using qgis and the largest percentage land use type was classified as the dominant land use type of the 35 groundwater stations the zoc for 15 stations was a majority built land use and the zoc for 20 stations was a majority agricultural land use no monitoring wells were a majority natural land use 2 2 3 groundwater data a total of 35 shallow dug wells having regular measurements more than 70 of measurements from july 2017 to june 2019 were analyzed the groundwater measurements used in the analysis were performed by the citizen scientists of smartphones for water nepal s4w nepal the groundwater levels were estimated using a 30m measuring tape in the early morning before any withdrawal of water on the fifteenth of every month as of the english calendar data were collected using an android smartphone through the open data kit odk collect application the collected data was transferred in a centralized database via cellular network or wi fi a tabular summary of the 35 groundwater wells including their locations elevation dominant adjacent land use and dominant soil type is included as supplementary material s4 time series data of groundwater levels and rainfall assembled on a monthly basis were evaluated and interpreted graphically to understand the dynamics of groundwater levels and rainfall groundwater level and rainfall data were selected based on the location of the well or rainfall station and the length and completeness of their record the selected wells were categorized based on their land use types soil types and hydrogeologic zones the monthly change in groundwater levels was determined mathematically by subtracting the depth to groundwater levels of the current month from the depth to groundwater levels of the preceding month the calculated value is positive if the groundwater levels have increased during the period or negative if the groundwater levels have decreased a heatmap of the monthly change in groundwater levels for all monitoring sites was prepared to analyze the temporal variation of monthly change in groundwater levels the median and distribution of groundwater depth from groundwater surface for all monitoring sites were analyzed by preparing a violin plot annual fluctuation in groundwater levels Î´h of each monitoring site was calculated as the difference of maximum and minimum values of the monthly groundwater levels for each year monthly spatial maps for groundwater levels and annual spatial maps for rainfall were prepared using the qgis for the study period pearson s correlation coefficient r values lee rodgers and nicewander 1988 were used to assess relationships between rainfall and groundwater levels the pearson s r values were tested for significance with two tailed p value hypothesis tests using an alpha level of 0 05 we developed python scripts to create figs 3 5 and 6 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall variation the mean annual rainfall was 1440 mm for the study period the highest rainfall i e 2300 mm was observed in sundarijal mulkharka station in 2018 19 and the lowest rainfall i e 726 mm was observed in tikathali station in 2017 18 fig 2 shows the seasonal cumulative rainfall of the valley the northern part of the valley received relatively higher annual rainfall 1700 mm whereas the western and southern part received less rainfall 1200 mm fig 5 as mountains receive higher rainfall than the valley floor the valley is drier than mountains local factors such as topography elevation etc have a crucial role in the spatial distribution of rainfall the average annual rainfall values for 2017 18 and 2018 19 were 1335 mm and 1525 mm respectively figs 2 and 5 also show that 2017 18 was drier than 2018 19 3 2 groundwater levels variation over two years i e from july 2017 to june 2019 groundwater levels across all sites varied from 0 11 m where the negative sign denotes groundwater levels that are higher than the ground surface to 11 5 m the mean groundwater level observed was 4 24 m with a standard deviation of 2 29 m the measurement represents depth to groundwater from the ground surface with lower and higher values denoting higher and lower groundwater levels respectively fig 3 shows a heatmap of monthly groundwater level changes for the 24 months for all measurement locations in pre monsoon april may may june and monsoon june july july august months the largest number of blue values can be seen which indicates comparatively higher recharge of the monitoring wells than the other months the majority of the values from august to march are red showing a decline in groundwater levels during this period some of the monitoring sites such as w2 w14 w19 and w32 had a shallow groundwater level depth of less than 3m below ground surface in contrast some sites such as w10 w11 w23 and w30 had a deeper groundwater level depth of more than 6m below the ground surface throughout the study period a violin plot of all the monitoring sites over the study period is included as supplementary material s4 the groundwater table increases to its study period peak during the wet period july august and september when rainfall is abundant and it gradually drops during the dry period after the offset of monsoon october through may during the study period the most shallow and deepest groundwater levels were recorded in august 2018 and february 2018 respectively in july the monsoonal rainfall intensified the recharge potential and increased the median groundwater levels thus compact distribution of the median groundwater levels can be seen in the monsoon months dinka et al 2013 a similar distribution was observed in the post monsoon months because of the aquifer recharge however scarce rainfall complemented by continued extraction gradually decreased the median groundwater levels from august through february the level remained almost constant in pre monsoon february march and april as groundwater extraction was offset by pre monsoon rainfall a similar trend was also observed in monsoon and post monsoon months fig 4 shows the seasonal fluctuation in the groundwater levels the northern part of the valley has shallow groundwater levels throughout the year compared to other parts of the valley as seen in fig 4 the northern part of the valley receives the highest rainfall amount annually 1700 mm which might be one reason for less fluctuation in groundwater levels in that part of the valley throughout the study period on the contrary the western and southern parts of the valley receive comparatively less annual rainfall 1200 mm less rain accompanied by high abstraction lowered the groundwater table in the dry periods november to march despite moderate annual rainfall 1500 mm the depth to water was more than 5m below the ground surface with less annual fluctuation in the central part of the valley since the central part of the valley has a majority built land use rainwater does not infiltrate the ground and high runoff occurs due to surface sealing in the central parts of the valley groundwater levels slowly increase with pre monsoonal rainfall and the trend continues during the monsoon fig 5 shows the total annual rainfall and mean annual groundwater level for both years the effect of rainfall variation in groundwater level fluctuations seems to be more prominent in areas with extreme rain higher rainfall i e northern part lower rainfall i e south western part as already mentioned above 2017 18 was drier than 2018 19 as a result the mean annual groundwater levels in the northern and western parts of the valley were relatively higher in 2017 18 compared to 2018 19 rainfall is abundant with an average of more than 1000 in the valley during the monsoon due to high rainfall the recharge rate is high and the depth to groundwater is shallow in post monsoon groundwater depth still remains shallow despite rainfall being considerably low 100 mm the aquifer gets sufficiently recharged in the monsoon period and can sustain the abstraction till the post monsoon period the groundwater table gradually declines in the winter with increases in abstraction due to less kukl water supply in the winter season and no other recharge source this result indicates a good relationship between rainfall and groundwater levels as the fluctuation was influenced by rainfall in the area many studies highlight precipitation infiltration as one of the key recharge sources of the shallow groundwater abdullahi and garba 2015 palanichamy 2017 tesfaldet and puttiwongrak 2019 however other factors such as evapotranspiration atmospheric pressure climatic variability land use patterns and aquifer deformation also affect groundwater levels hasan et al 2003 jan et al 2007 li et al 2020 3 3 correlation analysis the influence of rainfall on groundwater levels is evaluated through monthly groundwater levels and monthly rainfall data to learn about the physical processes that dominate the changes in aquifer storage gardner and heilweil 2009 the results of correlation analysis are visualized in figs 6 and 7 for agricultural and built land use respectively for each groundwater monitoring well both the correlation coefficient r left axis and the p value right axis are plotted a strong negative correlation in the range between 0 4 and 0 9 that is statistically significant at the 5 level is seen in 57 of all monitoring wells this negative correlation means that depth to groundwater decreases as rainfall increases out of the 20 monitoring wells surrounded by agricultural land use 15 wells 75 have a strong and statistically significant correlation at the 5 level the remaining five monitoring wells in agricultural land use have consistent shallow groundwater levels less than 3m throughout the study period in contrast for built land uses the depth to groundwater is greater and there is no such strong rainfall groundwater levels correlation in most cases likely due to a high rate of groundwater extraction and surface sealing reducing groundwater recharge only five out of 15 monitoring wells 33 in built land use show a statistically significant negative correlation at the 5 level although the zoc of these five monitoring wells were primarily covered by built land use around 30 of the zoc was still covered by agricultural or natural land use the presence of the agricultural and natural land use in the zoc of these wells likely increases seasonal recharge of shallow groundwater during rainfall the lack of good correlation between rainfall and groundwater levels strengthens the possibility that rainfall influenced variations in groundwater levels decrease as groundwater levels become impacted by anthropogenic interventions gardner and heilweil 2009 around 55 monitoring wells show statistically significant negative rainfall groundwater levels correlation at the 5 level in ngd and cgd whereas 80 monitoring wells show statistically significant negative rainfall groundwater levels correlation at the 5 level in sgd the concentration of monitoring wells featuring significant negative correlation has been found mostly over most parts of sgd the eastern part of ngd and the eastern and southern part of cgd more than 70 of the monitoring wells show a statistically significant negative rainfall groundwater levels correlation at the 5 level in clay and silt soil type whereas 35 monitoring wells show statistically significant negative rainfall groundwater levels correlation at the 5 level in sand and gravel soil type the good correlations in the clay and silt soil type with agricultural land use indicate the rainfall driven variations in groundwater levels are notable in the areas that are not overly influenced by anthropogenic stresses it will depend on the hydraulic characteristics of the phreatic layer mainly the permeability and porosity porosity determines the capacity of the material to hold water whereas permeability determines its ability to yield water silt and clay are made of tiny particles with a large amount of pore space between them however the pore spaces are so small that they create a resistance to flow reducing groundwater permeability sand and gravel may not be as porous as clay but the pore spaces are larger and better connected and the materials are much more permeable the seasonal dynamics of groundwater levels are less apparent in the northern and central parts of ngd an area of highly permeable sands and gravels shrestha et al 2012 which has consistent year round groundwater levels shallow in agriculture land use and deep in built land use it appears to respond slowly to the rainfall which may be related to the dominant recharge mechanism the northern belt receives more high altitude rainfall in the mountains which slowly percolates through the highly permeable layer of sands and gravels thus sand and gravel in the northern part of the valley facilitate recharge for both shallow and deep aquifers referring to lamichhane et al 2020 the spatial distribution of recharge depth corresponds to rainfall distribution and the northern parts of the valley have relatively more recharge potential than the southern parts on the other hand clay and silt resist groundwater movement and restrict rainwater from recharging deep aquifers while holding rainwater locally and showing higher seasonal groundwater variation in both cases the aquifer recharge is further influenced by the land use type sand and gravel with natural or agricultural land use in ngd act as potential recharge spots for deep whereas clay and silt with agriculture or natural land use recharges shallow groundwater and shows seasonal groundwater fluctuations also the northern part of the valley receives comparatively higher amounts of rainfall throughout the year in the southern part of the valley the impact of continued groundwater abstraction and less rainwater infiltration results in lowering of groundwater levels in the dry season and ultimately high seasonal fluctuations of groundwater levels and a strong rainfall groundwater correlation the good rainfall groundwater level correlations that we see imply that the shallow groundwater level rapidly influences the local rainfall patterns gardner and heilweil 2009 the rainfall groundwater levels correlation gives a direct indication of the sensitivities of shallow aquifers to rainfall several factors including the aquifer location storage capacity and recharge mechanism may delay groundwater levels responses to rainfall patterns gardner and heilweil 2009 the groundwater level fluctuation in a well near a stream channel may be rapid compared to a well at a greater distance from a stream channel in addition to rainfall infiltration streambed infiltration of runoff is another recharge source of the wells in the valley floor closer to the stream channel the aquifer s recharge generally is less cradled by the aquifer storage and happens over a shorter time frame gardner and heilweil 2009 3 4 limitations although the existing groundwater level data are not sufficient for a long term analysis it provides an insightful picture of rainfall driven patterns in groundwater level variations in different land uses soil types and groundwater zones the current study is helpful for analyzing the impact of anthropogenic stresses but it doesn t consider the effects of climatic factors it also doesn t give the estimates of the rainfall driven groundwater recharge furthermore the rainfall data of available stations cannot account for a heterogeneous spatio temporal variability the deployment of a rainfall station at each groundwater monitoring site would be ideal also the study considered gross surficial soil types and hydrogeology but more localized investigations are lacking and would be beneficial a proper geological investigation is required to prepare a lithological database of the monitoring wells the monitoring wells considered in this study are used as public or private wells and have high degrees of variability in terms of withdrawal volume and frequency a dedicated network of monitoring wells should be established for long term groundwater monitoring 4 conclusion the study quantified the dependence of groundwater levels on rainfall using monthly groundwater levels generated by citizen scientists at 35 groundwater monitoring wells july 2017 to june 2019 and monthly rainfall data of 19 rainfall stations in the kathmandu valley we found seasonal groundwater levels fluctuations showed a strong association with monsoonal rainfall we explored groundwater level variability for areas with different land use types and soil types the study discussed the groundwater recharge in relation to rainfall and also looked into anthropogenic stresses to support different patterns of variability and correlation at different regions across the study area generally rainfall was negatively correlated with groundwater levels depth meaning that groundwater depth decreased as rainfall increased since the groundwater level is shallow in areas with agricultural land use there is a noticeable rainfall groundwater level correlation in contrast for areas with built land uses groundwater levels are relatively deeper there is a poor rainfall groundwater level correlation in most cases this is likely due to a higher rate of groundwater extraction and sealed ground cover reducing groundwater recharge the good correlations in the clay and silt soil type with agricultural land use indicate the rainfall driven variations in groundwater levels are notable in the areas that are not overly influenced by anthropogenic stresses the seasonal dynamic of groundwater levels are less apparent in the northern and central part of ngd an area of highly permeable sands and gravels which have almost constant groundwater levels shallow in agriculture land use and deep in built land use year round thus sand and gravel with natural or agricultural land use in ngd act as potential recharge spots for deep aquifers whereas clay and silt with agriculture or natural land use recharge shallow groundwater and show seasonal groundwater fluctuation increased withdrawals from the shallow aquifers during the last few decades resulting from haphazard and rapid urbanization have led to a decline of groundwater levels which significantly impact nearby streams wetlands land subsidence and other environmental services the analysis of groundwater level response to natural and anthropogenic stresses is important for sustainable water resource management it is becoming increasingly obvious that groundwater levels are influenced by rainfall and land use since land use and rainfall changes are likely to intensify in the future the management of these processes must be integrated rather than managed separately especially in light of rapid changes in population dynamics these findings can be used to make general inferences about the physical parameters controlling shallow groundwater systems despite the limitation of existing data the results of this study should help further groundwater research in the kathmandu valley and highlight the essential role of citizen scientists in generating these data further research should focus on methods to increase seasonal storage of monsoon rains including the use of rainwater

11891,globally groundwater resources play a crucial role in supporting livelihoods and sustaining human health groundwater recharge is mainly influenced by the spatial distribution of rainfall patterns across groundwater basins and the heterogeneous distribution of geology soil and topographical characteristics this study evaluates the implications of variations in rainfall and land use on groundwater level fluctuations in the kathmandu valley nepal we selected and analyzed data from thirty five monitoring wells observed by citizen scientists from july 2017 to june 2019 over two years groundwater levels varied spatially from 0 11m negative sign denotes a groundwater level higher than the ground surface to 11 5m with a mean of 4 24m and a standard deviation of 2 29m our results indicated a strong positive correlation between rainfall and groundwater levels as the fluctuation was influenced by the rainfall of that area the seasonal fluctuations in groundwater level showed the direct influence of monsoonal rainfall in areas with agricultural land use 80 of the analysed wells showed a strong and statistically significant correlation between rainfall and groundwater levels in contrast higher groundwater extraction rates and surface sealing limited groundwater recharge in built land uses therefore wells across non agricultural land uses showed a weak correlation in most of the cases in the northern groundwater district we found areas with highly permeable sand and gravel have nearly constant groundwater levels shallow in agricultural land use and deep in built land use year round and act as potential recharge zones for the aquifer the areas with less permeable but highly porous clay and silt in agricultural land use and show greater seasonal groundwater fluctuations our study highlights the ability of citizens to generate meaningful hydrogeologic datasets and the importance of rainfall and land use planning to groundwater recharge understanding these complex relationships must form the basis for the sustainable management of the rapidly declining groundwater resources of the kathmandu valley graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater citizen science

agricultural and industrial usage foster and chilton 2003 shah 2007 giordano 2009 because of its ready availability in most areas and generally good quality i e requiring minimal treatment foster and cherlet 2014 since groundwater is an unseen resource it s difficult to characterize or monitor over time and space groundwater levels in aquifers represent a dynamic balance between groundwater storage recharge and discharge conlon et al 2005 aquifer storage increases if recharge exceeds discharge and vice versa groundwater levels continuously rise or fall according to the imbalance between recharge and discharge one of the simple ways of tracking groundwater storage fluctuations over time is monitoring the groundwater levels in wells groundwater level measurements also provide an understanding of the different properties of aquifers groundwater is a dynamic replenishable natural resource influenced by several factors such as the climatic conditions rainfall evapotranspiration etc hydrogeological factors land use soil type anthropogenic activities etc alley and taylor 2001 shalini et al 2012 the recharge of groundwater basins surrounded by mountains is mainly influenced by the spatial distribution of rainfall patterns the basin system and the topography shakya et al 2019a 2019b the increased dependency of our world s growing population on groundwater resources has led to increased groundwater extractions resulting in lowering water tables and drying of shallow dug wells in some areas tripathi et al 2016 rainfall is one of the major components of the hydrologic cycle and is the primary groundwater recharge source shrestha and sthapit 2015 in nepal the summer monsoon june to september contributes about 80 of the total annual rainfall shrestha 2000 talchabhadel et al 2018 diverse topography over a relatively small area causes large variability in rainfall throughout nepal seasonal variability of the shallow groundwater levels is mainly due to rainfall variability throughout the year in the kathmandu valley increasing urbanization and rapid population growth expansion from 1 11 million in 1991 to 1 65 million in 2001 and 2 53 million in 2011 thapa et al 2018 in the past two decades has led to a corresponding increase in water demand 35 1 mld in 1998 155 mld in 2000 320 mld in 2009 and 370 mld in 2015 thapa et al 2016a thapa et al 2018 however as of 2015 kathmandu upatyaka khanepani limited kukl the authorized body supplying potable water to the valley population can only meet 31 in a wet season and 19 in a dry season of the valley s demand thapa et al 2016a 2016b kukl is harnessing only 65 3 mld in the dry season and 131 mld in the wet season from the existing surface water sources such as rivers and springs the demand deficit is fulfilled by groundwater sources such as private wells kukl wells tanker water by water vendors and traditional stone spouts thapa et al 2016b gautam et al 2017 to cope with the huge supply demand deficit which was projected as 102 mld in 2016 and 322 mld by 2021 udmale et al 2016 the use of shallow and deep wells both private and public is increasing thapa et al 2016a udmale et al 2016 about half of the valley s total water supply during the wet season and around 60 70 during the dry season comes from groundwater sources including shallow and deep aquifers jha et al 1997 khatiwada et al 2002 however the excessive groundwater extraction coupled with land use change and lack of solid waste and wastewater management has increased the vulnerability of the groundwater resources in the valley and is expected to worsen due to climate change impacts in the future pandey et al 2010 gautam et al 2017 lamichhane and shakya 2019 erratic changes in rainfall and evaporation due to climate change might significantly impact groundwater resources by affecting groundwater recharge rates and changing groundwater availability shrestha et al 2020 in the past two decades from 1990 to 2010 significant land use change has been observed in the kathmandu valley where agricultural areas decreased by 9 8 forests by 9 28 and water bodies by 77 however the decline in these areas expanded urbanized areas by about 52 wang et al 2020 the conversion of natural and agricultural land for residential and urban uses results from rapid population growth caused by internal immigration and unplanned urbanization icimod 2010 the agricultural area in the kathmandu valley is projected to decrease by 20 in contrast the built up area is projected to increase by 21 between 2020 and 2050 which will have a significant implication in groundwater depletion lamichhane and shakya 2019 high population growth rate coupled with haphazard urbanization cause both an excessive abstraction of groundwater beyond recharge rate and an increase in surface sealing pandey et al 2010 the rise in surface sealing subsequently amplifies the rate of surface runoff resulting in decreased groundwater recharge and modifies the natural drainage system kinzie 2008 thapa et al 2017 thapa et al 2017 depicted that the evaporation varied from around 41 47 and the runoff varied from 55 59 of the total precipitation showing very little recharge due to highly urbanized land use patterns across the valley floor previously numerous studies have been carried out to identify the impact of rainfall and land use change in groundwater recharge adhikari et al 2020 assessed the impacts of change in land use patterns on the quantity of groundwater recharge in ho chi minh city vietnam by using an empirical land use projection model conversion of land use and its effects dyna clue and a hydrologic model soil and water assessment tool swat their study found out that the change in the built up area has a huge impact on the groundwater recharge as it was observed to increase in the far future of low urbanization scenario by 10 in comparison reductions of 30 and 52 in annual average recharge were observed in the far future of medium urbanization scenario and the high urbanization scenario respectively abdelaziz et al 2020 carried out a similar study focusing on the influence of land use land cover on groundwater recharge using the water balance method in the continental terminal area of abidjan ivory coast their study revealed that rainfall is the most influential factor in groundwater recharge during the wet season in contrast both rainfall and land use land cover change have a significant impact on annual recharge likewise patra et al 2018 evaluated the effect of rainfall temperature and land use change in the groundwater level during the pre monsoon and post monsoon season using remote sensing and gis techniques in west bengal india in this context a proper understanding of the spatial and temporal fluctuation of groundwater levels in connection with rainfall and land use is crucial for effective and sustainable groundwater resource management of the kathmandu valley limited studies have been conducted to explore the linkage of groundwater level variability to rainfall and land use in the kathmandu valley lamichhane et al 2020 adopted a model based approach to identify the spatial distribution of potential recharge rates and changes in groundwater level by considering pumping rate and land use land cover change scenarios however the existing studies have in general focused on examining bivariate relationships between change in groundwater level and rainfall change in land use and groundwater recharge etc hence a multivariate relationship among groundwater level rainfall land use soil types and hydrogeology remained largely unexplored in the literature this particular research work is an attempt to fill in this gap in other words this study was designed to evaluate the effects of variations in rainfall land use soil types and hydrogeology on groundwater level fluctuations in the kathmandu valley the objectives of the study were 1 to understand the spatio temporal variation of groundwater levels of the kathmandu valley 2 to investigate the response of groundwater levels to rainfall in different land use types soil types and hydrogeological zones 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the kathmandu valley is located between 27 32 13 27 49 10 n latitude and 85 11 31 85 31 38 e longitude in the central region of nepal fig 1 the kathmandu valley watershed with a total land area of 584km2 is a circular intermontane basin roughly 25 km in diameter and encircled by hills in its peripheries within this small geographical area the valley has complex topography thapa and murayama 2009 as the elevation of the valley ranges from approximately 1100 to 2700 m above mean sea level masl the subtropical climate of the valley is influenced by the south asian monsoon altering the precipitation pattern and wind direction and more than 80 of the annual rainfall occurs from june to september shrestha 2000 istiaque et al 2017 davids et al 2018 within the valley the highest and lowest amounts of precipitation fall in the northwestern and southern regions respectively the monsoon season is followed by winter spring and summer the average annual temperature and rainfall of the valley is 18 1 c and 1407 mm respectively ishtiaque et al 2017 the kathmandu valley resides on an intensely folded faulted and fractured kathmandu nappe sakai 2001 the southern and western parts of the valley contain sedimentary basement rocks whereas igneous and metamorphic rocks dominate the northern and eastern parts dhital 2015 it contains a compact fluvial lacustrine layer of quaternary pleistocene sediments composed of sand silt clay and gravel shakya et al 2019a b a figure showing the shallow subsurface soil profile and groundwater districts of the study area is included as supplementary material s1 this subsurface soil profile is reproduced from the engineering and environmental geological map of the kathmandu valley it was reclassified into different classes clay silt sand and gravel and river deposits based on their infiltration capacity silt sand and gravel soil types cover most parts of the groundwater basin in the valley whereas clay soil type is scattered around the central and southern part of the groundwater basin shrestha et al 2017 shakya et al 2019a b based on physical and chemical characteristics of the groundwater and geological conditions jica 1990 categorized the kathmandu valley into three groundwater districts the principal aquifer of the northern groundwater district ngd is formed by the deposits of sand and gravel beds and has high recharge potential chapagain et al 2010 the central groundwater district cgd is overlain by very thick 200 m impermeable black kalimati clay which limits the recharge rate chapagain et al 2010 the southern groundwater district sgd comprises carbonate rocks classified as lower permeability layers chapagain et al 2010 groundwater in the valley is extracted from both shallow 0 60m depth and deep 60m depth aquifers shakya et al 2019a b gurung et al 2007 the deep aquifer and shallow aquifer are distinguished by a thick aquitard of approximately 200m clay distributed mostly toward the central valley the aquitard thickness gradually reduces toward the valley peripheries jica 1990 metcalf and eddy 2000 the extracted groundwater is one of the major sources for drinking and other domestic purposes for the entire valley population shrestha et al 2014 2 2 data analysis 2 2 1 rainfall data daily rainfall data was obtained from the department of hydrology and meteorology dhm government of nepal gon dhm 2019 there are 20 rainfall stations in the kathmandu valley with elevations ranging from 1212m at khokana to 2163m at nagarkot however one station budhanilkantha had no data for the study period and was excluded from the analysis remaining 19 stations fig 1 were utilized for the july 2017 to june 2019 study period to develop the spatial distribution of rainfall in the kathmandu valley a summary of the selected rainfall stations including their locations elevation and installation date is included as supplementary material missing data were replaced with rainfall data of the nearest station and the thiessen polygon method was used to create a continuous coverage of daily rainfall data for the kathmandu valley the geo locations of the rainfall stations along with the rainfall data of the study period were then loaded into a quantum geographic information system qgis database for further analysis 2 2 2 land use data land use classifications at a 30m spatial resolution were developed by davids et al 2018 using a landsat 8 image captured in the fall of 2015 and ground based observations conducted by citizen scientists broadly three land uses classes were selected to represent the land uses in the kathmandu valley for this study i natural land uses forest shrubland ii agricultural land use and iii built land uses davids et al 2018 classified the valley as 33 natural land uses 41 agricultural land use and 26 built land use fig 1 the recharge area contributing to each monitoring well i e zone of contribution or zoc was assumed to have a radius of 1000m the percentage of different land use types was determined for each well s zoc using qgis and the largest percentage land use type was classified as the dominant land use type of the 35 groundwater stations the zoc for 15 stations was a majority built land use and the zoc for 20 stations was a majority agricultural land use no monitoring wells were a majority natural land use 2 2 3 groundwater data a total of 35 shallow dug wells having regular measurements more than 70 of measurements from july 2017 to june 2019 were analyzed the groundwater measurements used in the analysis were performed by the citizen scientists of smartphones for water nepal s4w nepal the groundwater levels were estimated using a 30m measuring tape in the early morning before any withdrawal of water on the fifteenth of every month as of the english calendar data were collected using an android smartphone through the open data kit odk collect application the collected data was transferred in a centralized database via cellular network or wi fi a tabular summary of the 35 groundwater wells including their locations elevation dominant adjacent land use and dominant soil type is included as supplementary material s4 time series data of groundwater levels and rainfall assembled on a monthly basis were evaluated and interpreted graphically to understand the dynamics of groundwater levels and rainfall groundwater level and rainfall data were selected based on the location of the well or rainfall station and the length and completeness of their record the selected wells were categorized based on their land use types soil types and hydrogeologic zones the monthly change in groundwater levels was determined mathematically by subtracting the depth to groundwater levels of the current month from the depth to groundwater levels of the preceding month the calculated value is positive if the groundwater levels have increased during the period or negative if the groundwater levels have decreased a heatmap of the monthly change in groundwater levels for all monitoring sites was prepared to analyze the temporal variation of monthly change in groundwater levels the median and distribution of groundwater depth from groundwater surface for all monitoring sites were analyzed by preparing a violin plot annual fluctuation in groundwater levels Î´h of each monitoring site was calculated as the difference of maximum and minimum values of the monthly groundwater levels for each year monthly spatial maps for groundwater levels and annual spatial maps for rainfall were prepared using the qgis for the study period pearson s correlation coefficient r values lee rodgers and nicewander 1988 were used to assess relationships between rainfall and groundwater levels the pearson s r values were tested for significance with two tailed p value hypothesis tests using an alpha level of 0 05 we developed python scripts to create figs 3 5 and 6 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall variation the mean annual rainfall was 1440 mm for the study period the highest rainfall i e 2300 mm was observed in sundarijal mulkharka station in 2018 19 and the lowest rainfall i e 726 mm was observed in tikathali station in 2017 18 fig 2 shows the seasonal cumulative rainfall of the valley the northern part of the valley received relatively higher annual rainfall 1700 mm whereas the western and southern part received less rainfall 1200 mm fig 5 as mountains receive higher rainfall than the valley floor the valley is drier than mountains local factors such as topography elevation etc have a crucial role in the spatial distribution of rainfall the average annual rainfall values for 2017 18 and 2018 19 were 1335 mm and 1525 mm respectively figs 2 and 5 also show that 2017 18 was drier than 2018 19 3 2 groundwater levels variation over two years i e from july 2017 to june 2019 groundwater levels across all sites varied from 0 11 m where the negative sign denotes groundwater levels that are higher than the ground surface to 11 5 m the mean groundwater level observed was 4 24 m with a standard deviation of 2 29 m the measurement represents depth to groundwater from the ground surface with lower and higher values denoting higher and lower groundwater levels respectively fig 3 shows a heatmap of monthly groundwater level changes for the 24 months for all measurement locations in pre monsoon april may may june and monsoon june july july august months the largest number of blue values can be seen which indicates comparatively higher recharge of the monitoring wells than the other months the majority of the values from august to march are red showing a decline in groundwater levels during this period some of the monitoring sites such as w2 w14 w19 and w32 had a shallow groundwater level depth of less than 3m below ground surface in contrast some sites such as w10 w11 w23 and w30 had a deeper groundwater level depth of more than 6m below the ground surface throughout the study period a violin plot of all the monitoring sites over the study period is included as supplementary material s4 the groundwater table increases to its study period peak during the wet period july august and september when rainfall is abundant and it gradually drops during the dry period after the offset of monsoon october through may during the study period the most shallow and deepest groundwater levels were recorded in august 2018 and february 2018 respectively in july the monsoonal rainfall intensified the recharge potential and increased the median groundwater levels thus compact distribution of the median groundwater levels can be seen in the monsoon months dinka et al 2013 a similar distribution was observed in the post monsoon months because of the aquifer recharge however scarce rainfall complemented by continued extraction gradually decreased the median groundwater levels from august through february the level remained almost constant in pre monsoon february march and april as groundwater extraction was offset by pre monsoon rainfall a similar trend was also observed in monsoon and post monsoon months fig 4 shows the seasonal fluctuation in the groundwater levels the northern part of the valley has shallow groundwater levels throughout the year compared to other parts of the valley as seen in fig 4 the northern part of the valley receives the highest rainfall amount annually 1700 mm which might be one reason for less fluctuation in groundwater levels in that part of the valley throughout the study period on the contrary the western and southern parts of the valley receive comparatively less annual rainfall 1200 mm less rain accompanied by high abstraction lowered the groundwater table in the dry periods november to march despite moderate annual rainfall 1500 mm the depth to water was more than 5m below the ground surface with less annual fluctuation in the central part of the valley since the central part of the valley has a majority built land use rainwater does not infiltrate the ground and high runoff occurs due to surface sealing in the central parts of the valley groundwater levels slowly increase with pre monsoonal rainfall and the trend continues during the monsoon fig 5 shows the total annual rainfall and mean annual groundwater level for both years the effect of rainfall variation in groundwater level fluctuations seems to be more prominent in areas with extreme rain higher rainfall i e northern part lower rainfall i e south western part as already mentioned above 2017 18 was drier than 2018 19 as a result the mean annual groundwater levels in the northern and western parts of the valley were relatively higher in 2017 18 compared to 2018 19 rainfall is abundant with an average of more than 1000 in the valley during the monsoon due to high rainfall the recharge rate is high and the depth to groundwater is shallow in post monsoon groundwater depth still remains shallow despite rainfall being considerably low 100 mm the aquifer gets sufficiently recharged in the monsoon period and can sustain the abstraction till the post monsoon period the groundwater table gradually declines in the winter with increases in abstraction due to less kukl water supply in the winter season and no other recharge source this result indicates a good relationship between rainfall and groundwater levels as the fluctuation was influenced by rainfall in the area many studies highlight precipitation infiltration as one of the key recharge sources of the shallow groundwater abdullahi and garba 2015 palanichamy 2017 tesfaldet and puttiwongrak 2019 however other factors such as evapotranspiration atmospheric pressure climatic variability land use patterns and aquifer deformation also affect groundwater levels hasan et al 2003 jan et al 2007 li et al 2020 3 3 correlation analysis the influence of rainfall on groundwater levels is evaluated through monthly groundwater levels and monthly rainfall data to learn about the physical processes that dominate the changes in aquifer storage gardner and heilweil 2009 the results of correlation analysis are visualized in figs 6 and 7 for agricultural and built land use respectively for each groundwater monitoring well both the correlation coefficient r left axis and the p value right axis are plotted a strong negative correlation in the range between 0 4 and 0 9 that is statistically significant at the 5 level is seen in 57 of all monitoring wells this negative correlation means that depth to groundwater decreases as rainfall increases out of the 20 monitoring wells surrounded by agricultural land use 15 wells 75 have a strong and statistically significant correlation at the 5 level the remaining five monitoring wells in agricultural land use have consistent shallow groundwater levels less than 3m throughout the study period in contrast for built land uses the depth to groundwater is greater and there is no such strong rainfall groundwater levels correlation in most cases likely due to a high rate of groundwater extraction and surface sealing reducing groundwater recharge only five out of 15 monitoring wells 33 in built land use show a statistically significant negative correlation at the 5 level although the zoc of these five monitoring wells were primarily covered by built land use around 30 of the zoc was still covered by agricultural or natural land use the presence of the agricultural and natural land use in the zoc of these wells likely increases seasonal recharge of shallow groundwater during rainfall the lack of good correlation between rainfall and groundwater levels strengthens the possibility that rainfall influenced variations in groundwater levels decrease as groundwater levels become impacted by anthropogenic interventions gardner and heilweil 2009 around 55 monitoring wells show statistically significant negative rainfall groundwater levels correlation at the 5 level in ngd and cgd whereas 80 monitoring wells show statistically significant negative rainfall groundwater levels correlation at the 5 level in sgd the concentration of monitoring wells featuring significant negative correlation has been found mostly over most parts of sgd the eastern part of ngd and the eastern and southern part of cgd more than 70 of the monitoring wells show a statistically significant negative rainfall groundwater levels correlation at the 5 level in clay and silt soil type whereas 35 monitoring wells show statistically significant negative rainfall groundwater levels correlation at the 5 level in sand and gravel soil type the good correlations in the clay and silt soil type with agricultural land use indicate the rainfall driven variations in groundwater levels are notable in the areas that are not overly influenced by anthropogenic stresses it will depend on the hydraulic characteristics of the phreatic layer mainly the permeability and porosity porosity determines the capacity of the material to hold water whereas permeability determines its ability to yield water silt and clay are made of tiny particles with a large amount of pore space between them however the pore spaces are so small that they create a resistance to flow reducing groundwater permeability sand and gravel may not be as porous as clay but the pore spaces are larger and better connected and the materials are much more permeable the seasonal dynamics of groundwater levels are less apparent in the northern and central parts of ngd an area of highly permeable sands and gravels shrestha et al 2012 which has consistent year round groundwater levels shallow in agriculture land use and deep in built land use it appears to respond slowly to the rainfall which may be related to the dominant recharge mechanism the northern belt receives more high altitude rainfall in the mountains which slowly percolates through the highly permeable layer of sands and gravels thus sand and gravel in the northern part of the valley facilitate recharge for both shallow and deep aquifers referring to lamichhane et al 2020 the spatial distribution of recharge depth corresponds to rainfall distribution and the northern parts of the valley have relatively more recharge potential than the southern parts on the other hand clay and silt resist groundwater movement and restrict rainwater from recharging deep aquifers while holding rainwater locally and showing higher seasonal groundwater variation in both cases the aquifer recharge is further influenced by the land use type sand and gravel with natural or agricultural land use in ngd act as potential recharge spots for deep whereas clay and silt with agriculture or natural land use recharges shallow groundwater and shows seasonal groundwater fluctuations also the northern part of the valley receives comparatively higher amounts of rainfall throughout the year in the southern part of the valley the impact of continued groundwater abstraction and less rainwater infiltration results in lowering of groundwater levels in the dry season and ultimately high seasonal fluctuations of groundwater levels and a strong rainfall groundwater correlation the good rainfall groundwater level correlations that we see imply that the shallow groundwater level rapidly influences the local rainfall patterns gardner and heilweil 2009 the rainfall groundwater levels correlation gives a direct indication of the sensitivities of shallow aquifers to rainfall several factors including the aquifer location storage capacity and recharge mechanism may delay groundwater levels responses to rainfall patterns gardner and heilweil 2009 the groundwater level fluctuation in a well near a stream channel may be rapid compared to a well at a greater distance from a stream channel in addition to rainfall infiltration streambed infiltration of runoff is another recharge source of the wells in the valley floor closer to the stream channel the aquifer s recharge generally is less cradled by the aquifer storage and happens over a shorter time frame gardner and heilweil 2009 3 4 limitations although the existing groundwater level data are not sufficient for a long term analysis it provides an insightful picture of rainfall driven patterns in groundwater level variations in different land uses soil types and groundwater zones the current study is helpful for analyzing the impact of anthropogenic stresses but it doesn t consider the effects of climatic factors it also doesn t give the estimates of the rainfall driven groundwater recharge furthermore the rainfall data of available stations cannot account for a heterogeneous spatio temporal variability the deployment of a rainfall station at each groundwater monitoring site would be ideal also the study considered gross surficial soil types and hydrogeology but more localized investigations are lacking and would be beneficial a proper geological investigation is required to prepare a lithological database of the monitoring wells the monitoring wells considered in this study are used as public or private wells and have high degrees of variability in terms of withdrawal volume and frequency a dedicated network of monitoring wells should be established for long term groundwater monitoring 4 conclusion the study quantified the dependence of groundwater levels on rainfall using monthly groundwater levels generated by citizen scientists at 35 groundwater monitoring wells july 2017 to june 2019 and monthly rainfall data of 19 rainfall stations in the kathmandu valley we found seasonal groundwater levels fluctuations showed a strong association with monsoonal rainfall we explored groundwater level variability for areas with different land use types and soil types the study discussed the groundwater recharge in relation to rainfall and also looked into anthropogenic stresses to support different patterns of variability and correlation at different regions across the study area generally rainfall was negatively correlated with groundwater levels depth meaning that groundwater depth decreased as rainfall increased since the groundwater level is shallow in areas with agricultural land use there is a noticeable rainfall groundwater level correlation in contrast for areas with built land uses groundwater levels are relatively deeper there is a poor rainfall groundwater level correlation in most cases this is likely due to a higher rate of groundwater extraction and sealed ground cover reducing groundwater recharge the good correlations in the clay and silt soil type with agricultural land use indicate the rainfall driven variations in groundwater levels are notable in the areas that are not overly influenced by anthropogenic stresses the seasonal dynamic of groundwater levels are less apparent in the northern and central part of ngd an area of highly permeable sands and gravels which have almost constant groundwater levels shallow in agriculture land use and deep in built land use year round thus sand and gravel with natural or agricultural land use in ngd act as potential recharge spots for deep aquifers whereas clay and silt with agriculture or natural land use recharge shallow groundwater and show seasonal groundwater fluctuation increased withdrawals from the shallow aquifers during the last few decades resulting from haphazard and rapid urbanization have led to a decline of groundwater levels which significantly impact nearby streams wetlands land subsidence and other environmental services the analysis of groundwater level response to natural and anthropogenic stresses is important for sustainable water resource management it is becoming increasingly obvious that groundwater levels are influenced by rainfall and land use since land use and rainfall changes are likely to intensify in the future the management of these processes must be integrated rather than managed separately especially in light of rapid changes in population dynamics these findings can be used to make general inferences about the physical parameters controlling shallow groundwater systems despite the limitation of existing data the results of this study should help further groundwater research in the kathmandu valley and highlight the essential role of citizen scientists in generating these data further research should focus on methods to increase seasonal storage of monsoon rains including the use of rainwater

11892,municipal supply of water under climate variations growing population uncertainty and scarcity requires water planners to devise feasible and sustainable water sourcing plans especially for territories relying on groundwater the conventional ways to cope with water scarcity will no longer guarantee reaping the maximum benefits of declining available water resources efficiency and circularity of water are claimed as essential criteria for seeking solutions in designing long term supply management a plan b water assessment applied to a group of municipalities in dry areas of colombia is proposed as a hydro economic model aimed at providing inputs for water resources planning in which the depletable and common pool character of aquifers are incorporated a declination speed index is introduced in two ways the surface water table distance and water table saturated thickness distance this issue should not be overlooked if spatial differentiation in water tables is incorporated in groundwater extraction permits analysis for multiple and convergent water users research results are promising for sustainability of water management in dry areas around the world respect to status quo situation a 22 of efficiency gain might be achieved in the next 20 years in sucre colombia under an efficient model of water consumption if an efficient and circular water management model is endeavored multiple gains would be harvested for the benefit of water users and ecosystems relying on aquifers increased efficiency is mostly driven by 30 million m3 sewage water recirculated in agriculture which in turn would prevent aquifer extraction for this activity in business as usual scheme water efficiency gap will be wider extraction costs will rise to prohibitive levels for low income municipalities the declining water tables will oblige to make new punches by simultaneous water users and water declination index calculated would reflect a precipitous decay research results provide empirical evidence to the discussion on possible solutions for sustainable and efficient water management as stated in sustainable development goals specifically target goal 6

pool resources circular economy of water 1 introduction different cities in the caribbean of colombia are exhibiting perilous signs of vast pressures on water systems surface water are suffering of water flow attenuation and groundwater tables of aquifer are declining even in rainy seasons municipal supply of water under climate variations growing population uncertainty and scarcity requires water planners to devise feasible and sustainable water sourcing plans especially for territories relying on groundwater such as municipalities over morroa aquifer sucre and cÃ³rdoba departments in which water supply to match demand is running down groundwater at a high rate managing water supply to match levels of water demand is a reasonable economic and management approach since tense situations created by water shortages are to be circumvented despite the environmental and water authorities efforts to implement economic and political instruments to manage groundwater competition and efficient water allocations oecd 2015 2017a repeated water shortages create perceptions of government failure world bank 2018 whether plentiful or scarce water managers are told to bring abundant water to all who demand it zetland 2011 notwithstanding when referring to groundwater management the analysis might not be so simple as matching supply with demand shared aquifer systems by different municipalities represent a case in which groundwater stocks exhibit a puzzling interdependent matter different municipal water utilities abstracting from shared aquifer cells might be independently confident that their aquifer water supply is enough to satisfy demand in their jurisdictions however one municipality s demand may impinge a limited supply onto other neighboring municipalities for instance some adjacent municipalities endowed with less technological capacity for water abstractions would reap less benefits from groundwater resources in comparison to the better equipped ones since every single municipality must independently manage water resource it does not mean that interdependent aquifer resources may prevent that an interdependent water resources management plan by multiple municipalities might be devised interdependency in groundwater resources is palpable through different hydrogeological variables more outstandingly groundwater and surface water exhibit unnoticed water flow interactions glennon 2002 winter et al 1998 for illustration the steady groundwater abstraction in waterwells under operation create a cone of depression the interdependent feature arises when cones of depression are overlapped when multiple wells are active another two factors demonstrating this interdependence make reference to environmental flow requirements efr 1 1

of them might be located over more productive spots meanwhile the others might be placed over deeper water tables which oblige them to incur in higher cost to collect needed water units groundwater table declination and droughts are pervasive phenomena in western usa australia morocco mexico iran jordan iran india parts of china and other areas in south asia world bank 2018 climate shocks are taking a toll on many urban centers and amplifying the unpredictability of freshwater availability which is exacerbated due to increasing numbers of prolonged droughts affecting competing users world bank 2018 different municipalities in the caribbean region of colombia relying on groundwater for domestic and agricultural purposes exhibit frequent water scarce and drought situations ideam 2014 and water use altogether entail interdependent effects of water extractions the interdependency of extractions should be assessed and incorporated in water planning water supply should be consistent with the declining water tables and all the pressures upcoming from climate change and the hidden competition of water in shared aquifers similarly given the observed pervasive declinations of water tables in the area of study and around the world there is an urgent call to pursue a sustainable management of water resources therefore how to design and implement groundwater sustainability plans for interdependent water users represent the main research question of this article one may think of sustainability of water resources in terms of matching water demanded to actual and forecasted water supply otherwise one may prefer to challenge extant water demand patterns and drive it towards efficient water consumption levels consequently efficiency would probably imply consuming less than different water users are accustomed to in reference to efficiency one may question whether consuming 110 l person day 3 3 reported water consumption level in sucre up to 2018 at household levels is an excessive volume of water or not whether actual volumes of water applied to agricultural activities are efficient enough to reap the greatest efficiency potential per cubic meter applied to the crops and whether each volume of water consumed by industries is treated simply as another production input or as a resource which is potentially subject to reuse or recycling since water use interdependency appears and indeed is complex it should not prevent water planners to trigger water resources efficiency and sustainability plans as part of serious water policies managing any resource efficiently pareto efficiency occurs when a water allocation can provide no further gains in production or satisfaction without simultaneously creating a loss harou et al 2009 efficiency refers to the capacity of water applied to the agricultural and industrial processes to apprehend the maximum potential of water consumed without creating losses to neighbor users for this aim best available agricultural practices are used as benchmarks as a mean to address sustainability in consumptive water use the benchmarks do not necessarily represent a verified sustainable case in terms of environmental footprints instead they show that reductions in water consumption in agriculture industry and households are possible the present research is relevant to sustainable development goals sdg the research question aim is related to providing empirical evidence about possible strategies to sustainable and efficient water management the target goal 6 4 of sdgs states that by 2030 water efficiency and sustainability in water withdrawals should be accomplished for this sdg efficiency and circularity of water are taken as key criteria for sustainability an efficient and circular plan b is proposed plan a represent the status quo in which supply is matched with the demand the proposed models do not pretend being all encompassing but it incorporates the need for water from neighboring municipalities it includes the environmental flow requirement of ecosystems depending on groundwater as well an optimal control theory model is utilized to optimize extractions for each municipality i given the optimal extraction of the neighbor municipalities i in this case sincelejo sucre is used as the initial point of departure for optimization analysis this article is organized as follows introductory statements and justifications are included in this section 1 problem statement is added to summarize some stylized facts and to make it comparable with other regions of the world in section 2 a short description of literature review of relevant publications is developed keywords such as water management scarcity and groundwater were used section 3 presents the research methods mainly focused in optimal control theory application to calculate optimal extractions section 4 consists of research results it includes water efficiency gap water table declination index calculated and scenarios presented to discuss efficiency gains finally in discussion and conclusions sections 5 and 6 attention is drawn on the need to abandon the inertial water supply management scheme of simple matching supply with demand 1 1 problem statement since the aquifer stock is not part of the observed key variables in municipal long term planning the exhaustible nature of aquifers is rarely embedded in ex ante analysis of municipal water planning focusing only on water table declination does not guarantee complete knowledge of aquifers as a water source for ecosystems and humans whose resources may end exhausted water planning instruments such as water efficient use and saving plans and aquifer environmental management plans reflect a sort of myopic analysis in terms of the unattended interdependent effects of water abstractions municipalities relying on aquifers for freshwater provision and agricultural activities may impose negative effects onto other municipalities this is especially relevant for municipal water companies industries and farmers boreholes built over single cell aquifers the problem statement is relevant for more locations in colombia and water scarce cities around the world for this particular context urban and rural areas reliance on abating aquifers is a tough issue to manage in sucre colombia because there is a sort of invisible competition for water resources between water users and the municipal water facilities in sucre more than 90 of municipalities rely on groundwater to provide water for domestic and agricultural uses public entities in charge of water management use powerful pumps to collect water from the underground and distribute it to households some waterwells have experienced declinations around 17 m year which threaten aquifer sustainability carsucre 2003 aside up to 2011 there existed 1 788 water wells under operation 4 4 1 713 waterwells reported in the jurisdiction of carsucre and 75 wells in the area of regional environmental corporation corpomojana it shows that there is not a unique centrally managed water distribution system but a collection of private and public boreholes which are jeopardizing water resources however competition for groundwater reserves is not symmetric when observing map 1 groundwater access is uneven for a single municipality for instance in ovejas or sampuÃ©s since pretending to punch water wells in south east locations may result fruitless consequently alternative plan b water sourcing analysis for some locations should be consciously devised this is especially the case of actual circumstances in which some locations better endowed with underground water are overexploiting reserves which are the feasible scenarios for asymmetric water access and declining water tables for each municipality for next 10 30 50 and more years how to assess and implement future municipal water sourcing plans to meet water demand under the challenges of interdependent water abstractions from neighbor municipalities in this research the plan b water assessment is introduced as an alternative approach which might be useful to support municipalities in adapting to declining water resources plan b is based on some criteria named efficiency and interconnectedness of the effects of water extraction this interconnection is close to the circular economy of water approach since some opportunities arise in reaping multiple benefits from water while using this resource in the economy 1 2 common pool resources efficiency and circular economy approach one municipality relying on surface water for freshwater provision and agricultural activities might be prone to explore groundwater sources when surface water flows are declined to critical levels however new water wells should not be built over randomly selected places since every well spot represents differing implications in terms of adequacy for aquifer sustainability analysis some well spots might not be convenient due to possible deep water tables presence of recharge zones cones of depression conformed underground and other key hydrogeological aspects worth to be noted if sustainability becomes a priority similarly if one municipality devise a plan to explore alternative water sources the need to access water by other neighbor municipalities and users should not be ignored if bad mannered competition over water stocks and flows does not want to be sparked each municipality is demanded to take a further inward look at their water flows management a take make waste model leonard 2011 in water management should no longer persist as the status quo water should not be wasted few steps after it is taken out from underground and similarly sewage water should not waste surface water systems at the end of the flow since this is the reported case in sucre for last 20 years water wasted from the underground source and degenerative flows driven by sewage water at the end seems to be the social norm in regional water management and comptroller s documents excessive non accounted water is reported and main creeks serve as point of sewage discharge despite the intended efforts to tackle so high undetected water squandering non accounted water is still kept as the social norm non accounted water reported in 2003 was 46 defensorÃ­a del pueblo 2005 shockingly water losses in sincelejo were greater than 67 and greater than 55 in corozal in 2017 aguas de la sabana 2017 and reduction goals for next five years are conservative since expected water losses are 55 and 43 respectively aguas de la sabana 2017 reducing water losses represent a tough endeavor notwithstanding the urgent need to efficiently manage and adapt to water scarcity and climate variability demand serious exertions to reduce pressure on groundwater systems there are rooms for improvements stemming from reduction of water losses however further opportunities exist in order to turn to water use efficiency a claim is placed on the need to reap the maximum benefit of water flows pressures on groundwater might be reduced by means of a change in water management paradigm as well instead of continuing exerting more water outflows to distribute it to water users a halt should be made in the logic of outflows allocation actual water management dynamic is governed by the logic of bringing abundant water to all who demand it zetland 2011 and increase water supply at the pace of population demand is how things stand water volume outflows should be treated as a valuable resource object to a circular logic as a planned design a circular approach of water would definitely assist in reaping the maximum potential benefit of water volumes until the last drop of utility is attained water used at industries and households should not use water as a simple raw material or as an input for products processing or indoor domestic activities in its place a new logic aimed at attaining the highest potential of each liter of water should be imperative 2 literature review groundwater may have been put to beneficial use for many thousands of years but the fundamental principles of sustainable groundwater management are very young howard 2015 conceivably the more comprehensive concept encompassing the aspirations of efficiency sustainability and water management refers to integrated water resources management iwrm iwrm is aimed at promoting the coordination in development and management of water land and related resources in order to maximize the economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without jeopardizing the sustainability of vital ecosystems gwp 2000 one of the recommendations of paris statement 2007 to promote sustainable development of water resources refer to using the entire water cycle including groundwater with all its components and their interactions as a unifying framework for effective management howard 2015 adding the concept of water cycle might become iwrm as a more complex issue to implement and operationalize indeed iwrm does not provide any real guidance to water professionals and policy makers so as to make planning management and decision making processes more rational and efficient to achieve biswas 2008 as an alternative hydro economics offer practical applications for the integration of different disciplines supporting sustainable water resources management hydro economic models represent spatially distributed water resource systems infrastructure management options and economic values in an integrated manner to address the complexity of urban water supply arising from consumers dependence on multiple interconnected sources of water harou et al 2009 srinivasan et al 2010 hydrogeological models play a key role in building conceptual maps encompassing basic hydrological variables these models are aimed at providing relevant information in regard of estimated water storage recharge levels of aquifer and the water balance at regional level gauging groundwater reserves and recharge of aquifer should be a priority for municipalities regions relying on aquifers ignoring stock and recharging levels simply face municipalities and regions to a sort of blind planning which might surprise water managers to unadvertised severe declinations of water table contamination and saltwater intrusion due to limited capacity to systematically monitor aquifer characteristics this in turn would prevent water planners to devise timely plans to adapt to water scarcity and climate change in short water managers relying on aquifers should get a grip on the overarching relevance of hydrogeological knowledge notwithstanding the hydrogeological dimension of aquifer systems planning fall short in understanding the complex dimensions of optimal water use different approaches might be useful to make a wide ranging counterpart for water demand and water supply analysis to guarantee clean water provision in the cities in the developing world it will be important for the future that groundwater be used more widely on an efficient and sustainable basis for urban water supply foster s and hirata 2011 promoting efficiency and sustainability of aquifer systems demand interdisciplinary planning engineering and hydrogeology are well equipped with the essential knowledge to understand aquifer characteristics however multiple dimensions would remain missing or unattended if groundwater planning if not supported by other disciplines in many cases groundwater is either ignored or it is simply lumped together with surface water despite the fact that groundwater and surface water operate on distinctly different scales of time and space howard 2015 hydro ecology may help in understating water stocks and flows essential to sustain freshwater and estuarine ecosystems sociology may help in approaching water users and understand how reliance on aquifers affects water literacy well ownership and water awareness it may emphasize on the ethics of conserving and staying mindful of aquifers as well ternes 2018 achieving the sustainable development target goal 6 4 demand the understanding of the complex factors shaping water use efficiency and sustainable withdrawals however it is important to not largely focus on the supply side of the problem but on the demand and behavioral side sustainable water withdrawals 5 5 conceptualization of sustainability in groundwater resources is quite complicated and subject to current discussions among hydrogeologist and water planners for some cases there has to be recognition that groundwater resource is not renewable and its use therefore be sustainable kalf and woolley 2005 entails puzzling social dimensions worth to incorporate in project design and implementation to curb water consumption asprilla echeverrÃ­a 2020 for this reason further research of social sciences would play a key role in disentangling the reductions in urban water consumption the economics of natural resources is equipped with robust economic and mathematical tools aimed at analyzing optimality in resource extractions despite all criticism to economic sciences due to sophistication of models and strong and unreal assumptions it may provide valuable inputs for efficiency and sustainability analysis in burt 1964 the method of dynamic programming is used using the principle of bellman optimality for aquifers in california a net profit function is built which depends on the amount of resource used and the amount for the remaining per period as a general condition of optimality it is concluded that the level of production must be expanded to the point where the net marginal product per unit of water is equal to the negative of the marginal cost of pumping with respect to the water in the storage in burt 1967 applied to san joaquin valley in california as well the author uses first order differences equations to solve the model of dynamic programming in this model the net marginal product with respect to the extraction rate is equal to the net marginal product capitalized with respect to the stock besides it determines the existence of a balance stock level from which recharge and optimal extraction depend on provencher and burt 1994b discuss the effectiveness and convenience of comparing centralized groundwater management control schemes with respect to models such as privatization understood as the allocation of property rights for the madera county in california the authors demonstrate that with the privatization model which provides a marketable permit endowment of the on site stock which agents control over time higher earnings are obtained in well being of water users than traditional forms of centralized control because the market allows the management of risks krulce d roumasset j wilson 1997 use the optimal control theory for coastal aquifer analyses in hawaii where they model desalinated water as a replacement or backstop technology for water extracted from the ground in this exercise an optimal control problem is built with infinite time horizon and there are three optimal stages are found firstly an increasing stage in which the height of the aquifer must be retained in the following period there is an overdraft or reduction and the water table is decreasing and a finally stage in which the height of the aquifer follows a steady state to infinity in another relevant models such as noel et al 1980 the optimal control theory is employed as well the research calculates socially optimal temporal and spatial allocations between agricultural and urban uses with a quadratic linear control model with economic and hydrologic components to model the joint use of ground and surface water this model is applied to several watersheds in yolo county in california based on the fact that possibly users who live in the present would not be willing to sacrifice their consumption pitafi and roumasset 2009 propose a model that allows to increase the political feasibility of regulating the use of aquifers in hawaii this is done through a mechanism whereby those experiencing welfare losses can be compensated for the efficient management of the resource and applied to a spatial temporal context more recently an optimal path of extraction of groundwater was built for the chitradurga district in india patil k mahadev c bhat g manjunatha 2015 the authors applied the maximum principle of pontryagin a linear inverse demand function a linear cost function and also a total rainfall dependent recharge function were used with this information coupled with information on characteristics of agricultural producers an optimal control model for steady state equilibrium was estimated in reference to application of optimal control theory different models might be developed to calculate optimal extraction rates of control variables some models might incorporate different specifications for the transversality condition this condition applies for the terminal condition for state variable for this research aim state variable refer to aquifer stocks see 3 3 below terminal condition of zero means that the shadow price of aquifer stock should be driven to zero at the terminal time consequently reaping benefits from aquifer extraction within the period 0 t would matter and that whatever water stock that still exists at time t being too late to put to use would have no economic value to water users or water planners 6 6 adapted from chiang 1992 despite being plausible in providing an image of possible time for aquifers getting exhausted there are still missing issues in resource economics models for instance i would stress the need to manage minimum stock level of groundwater so as to not approaching the water as resource subject to exhaustion real aquifer sustainability models should treat terminal state variable stock of aquifer s t as s t s t m i n instead of s t f r e e o r zero a closer look to the concept of groundwater sustainability may refer to aquifer sustainable yields sustainable yields can be derived from conservation of mass principles in a groundwater basin i n f l o w i o u t f l o w o Î´ s t kalf and woolley 2005 7 7 where Î´ s correspond to change in storage in l3 and i and o in l3 t 1 inflows are mostly determined by nature 8 8 natural processes such as recharges led by infiltration of precipitation leakage from streams and lakes artificial recharge kalf and woolley 2005 while outflows are mostly driven by social dimensions abstractions and to a lesser extent by the nature natural discharges a sustainable groundwater management system would benefit from greater inputs than outputs through the time sustainability of aquifer systems mass equilibrium in groundwater basin time dimensions and variables determining the groundwater flow properties are discussed in j bredehoeft 1997 kalf and woolley 2005 the time taken to attain equilibrium will depend on the magnitude of the abstraction rate aquifer characteristics and distances to recharge boundaries kalf and woolley 2005 notwithstanding in j bredehoeft 1997 j d bredehoeft 2002 kalf and woolley 2005 groundwater system planning takes social dimensions for granted and more importantly do not recognize the common pool nature of the resource the cpr characteristic of aquifers means there exists competition to reap the most of benefits of abstraction in the present the free rider problem variations in time horizon perceptions about the resource value and other issues leading to productive or destructive outcomes as appointed by hardin 1968 negri 1989 ostrom 2015 3 methods before embarking in designing empirical methods a document analysis of water policy and regional water planning documents was developed special attention to the approaches made to tackle water scarcity was paid and the way how water supply of groundwater resources has been addressed by water managers is discussed basic descriptive analysis of water consumption reports released by water companies were analyzed as well monthly data on households industries and commercial uses are available since 2002 through 2018 data on agricultural water consumption were more disperse but mostly obtained from the recent national agricultural census and official general comptroller environmental reports information and data on the hydrogeological characteristics of aquifer were collected from different sources such as research thesis environmental authority conceptual hydrogeologic maps and the national institute of geological service with all this information water balances needed to prepare scenarios to analyze changes in water flows were performed this included the analysis of modifications of water flows aimed at estimating changes on environmental pressures on groundwater systems reducing the burden on groundwater makes sense since aquifer stocks are rarely unlimited resources despite replenishment of aquifers may provide the control mechanism to convert it into a renewable resource extant aquifer recharge in dry areas tend to be scanty certainly in sucre for more than 40 years groundwater reserves have been running out because people annually extract more water than it seeps into the ground carsucre 2015 consequently one key assumption utilized in building models refer to treat aquifer as a non renewable resource due to scant replenishment and forecasted reductions in precipitations in the area of sucre and the caribbean ideam pnud mads dnp cancilleria 2017 some additional assumptions refer to policy measures that might not be implemented for instance efficiency analysis may estipulate sewage water treatment for recycling which might not be put in place shortly in order to reduce pressure on surface and groundwater systems some assumptions in regard of new activities demanding water are incorporated as well population would rise at a 1 0 growing rate keeping actual rates according to dane it is also assumed that people would continue moving to urban areas 3 1 hydro economic methods given the complex characteristics of efficiency and interdependency of groundwater extractions research methods combine different disciplines such as hydrology hydrogeology and economics hydrologic models provide key elements such as groundwater inventory aquifer recharge and stocks hydraulics of groundwater offer relevant aspects such as water flows permeability and storage capacity hydrogeologic variables were used to estimate water balance which are represented through water flow diagrams to facilitate representation of water flows in the territory economics provide useful tools to understand and assess efficiency of water resources optimization of water consumption is supported on optimal control theory optimal control formulation of a dynamic optimization problem focuses upon one or more control variables that serve as instruments of optimization optimal control foremost aim is the determination of the optimal time path for a control variable u t chiang 1992 chiang and wainwright 2005 control variables influence state variables paths the former includes examples such as the extraction rates pumping timing and waterwells location and the latter refer to variables such as aquifer stock and aquifer saturated thickness optimal control entails the specification of the objective functional subject to maximization the definition of state function initial and end values for state variables and the specifications regarding boundaries and control set for instance the control set might be an open or a closed set the most important result in optimal control theory a first order necessary conditions is known as the maximum principle chiang and wainwright 2005 the research aim focused on sustainably integrate socio physical interdependence in regional water planning entail the definition of the management scheme in defining the economic models this definition is relevant to determine the role of stakeholders the control and state variables subject of analysis it is also assumed that actual water management system of central planning is kept the main interest of the environmental authority as a central planner is maximizing the net present economic value of the added benefit of water consumption it refers to the benefits in production for relevant agricultural crops environmental flow requirement and domestic groundwater demand function for sincelejo corozal sampuÃ©s morroa los palmitos and ovejas in sucre in addition to this the authority is interested in maintaining water units for other neighboring municipalities and ecosystems depending on ground and surface water therefore the optimal water extraction rates for the major types of beneficiaries should be chosen by the environmental authorities the economic model consists of two state variables given by the stock or water reserves denoted as s t and the height of the aquifer h t the dynamics of state variables are driven by the nature but are influenced by control variables as well extraction permits entitled to water petitioners who approach before the regional environmental corporation provide the mechanism of how control variables are chosen w d w m w y a and w y represent the extraction of water by domestic consumers maize yam and yucca producers respectively the extraction can take values less than or equal to the aquifer stock size thus 0 w d w m w y a w y s 0 s 0 correspond to initial exploitable 9 9 there exists an important difference in the type of aquifer reserves exploitable reserves is different from total reserves elastic reserves and stored reserves carsucre 2003 stock which is estimated in 3247 million m3 carsucre 2003 in addition it is assumed that this stock is stored in an irregular aquifer 10 10 the complex and heterogeneous nature of the aquifer hydrogeology must require a more detailed modeling of the optimization process for example treating as a multi cell aquifer with interconnections between them notwithstanding the analysis with a single cell can offer a good approximation to the study of the optimal extraction given the dynamics of geographic concentration of the users who most extract the natural resource from the underground in economic and physical terms the stock is constituted in a state variable that the hydrogeology defines as the total amount of water that is confined in the rocks and that can be drained or not according to characteristics like porosity the specific retention among others ideam 2014 as part of sustainability approach the environmental authority is concerned with the intergenerational justice and the common pool character of aquifer used by other neighbor municipalities consequently a minimum level of stock of the aquifers is considered so that total water availability is not jeopardized the randomness of rainfall as a source of aquifer recharges makes this issue worth noted 3 1 1 specification of economic models the functions of benefit for water used are specified for main agricultural activities and domestic users efficient and sustainable groundwater allocation to main water users represent one of the key policy instruments for environmental authorities pursuing sustainable use of groundwater reserves in table 1 a summary of function of benefits is presented for more details and explanation on the equations see annexes section 3 1 1 1 extraction cost function cost function is represented as a reserve dependent model for which krulce d roumasset j wilson 1997 is followed in this model h corresponds to the vertical distance between the level of the water table and the depth of the saturated thickness 11 11 the saturated thickness depends on whether it is a saturated unsaturated free or multi layered aquifer for confined aquifers the thickness is equal to the physical thickness of the aquifer between the aquicludes above and below it this applies to the confined parts of a free aquifer in both cases the saturated thickness is constant over time for cases of unconfined aquifers the thickness corresponds to the difference between the water table and the aquicludes of the aquifer this saturated thickness is the lower physical limit of the aquifer the lower the level the more costly the water withdrawal as the aquifer approaches exhaustion h t 0 the extraction costs grow rapidly in this sense the average cost of water extraction of the aquifers is modeled as a convex positive and decreasing function of the height of the aquifer as follows c h 0 c h 0 c h 0 lim h 0 c h so the total water extraction cost for w d w y w y a and w m summarized in w corresponds to c h w it is assumed that investment costs for boreholes and maintenance are lower compared to recurrent monthly energy costs besides when the aquifer is dry the costs lean towards infinite since there would be no available water and the energy cost and pumping time are increased therefore the cost function is adjusted by incorporating the energy costs c e n e r 6 c h c e n e r h o h t Î± i w t where h o is the initial height of the water table distance from land surface to water table Î± corresponds to the rate at which water table approaches zero for this case it is equal to 0 8 given the average actual water table declination speed h o 275 m is the average well depth observed in sincelejo morroa and corozal carsucre 2003 the cost of energy will be taken as a cost per kilowatt hour for the study area 3 1 1 2 state variable functions variables subject to rules of nature correspond to aquifer stock s t and the height h t of water table provencher and burt 1994b propose a recursive function given by s t 1 s t r t w t where the resource status depends on the recharge of the aquifer r t and extractions by different users image 1 the depth of the aquifer is represented by the following linear model 7 h i t s t w t h i r Î² s t i w t h i r refers to the distance between saturated thickness and actual water table for municipality i in time t h i r 100 m 500 m Î² represent a conversion factor to transform volume units into height units in this case Î² 3 82 x 10 8 s t refers to the aquifer stock over time initiating in s 0 4 results excel solver functionalities were utilized to run optimization model fig 1 shows a sort of a water stock efficiency gap the forecasted evolution of morroa aquifer stock is shown for the status quo situation and for the groundwater reserves under optimality circumstances the gap measures the groundwater foregone reserves which is a lost valuable opportunity in pursuing sustainable management of aquifer systems a steady widening efficiency gap is observed as the time passes stock decay has implications in water tables water table declination is spatially unevenly distributed municipalities placed over deeper saturated thickness may be benefitted from more productive water spots plan b incorporates differentiations in spatial and underground characteristics of water table in doing this the distance between surface water table h 0 and the distance between water table saturated thickness h r is used in the hydro economic model making this distinction is meaningful since more probably morroa aquifer is characterized as a synclinal one with deeper inclination to the east of sucre carsucre 2003 and in some moment in the future punches over the surface will result unfruitful while in other sites it still will result feasible for the former water sourcing alternatives shall be devised while in the latter there would be water available for them and for closer neighboring municipalities the steeper the h 0 h r index the quicker the water table gets farther from the surface and the quicker it approaches the saturated thickness consequently a steeper h 0 h r index represents a sort of a precipitous declination velocity this issue should not be overlooked if spatial differentiation in water tables is incorporated in groundwater extraction permits analysis assuming a continuous extraction of groundwater for agricultural domestic and industrial purposes this differentiated declination is part of the mode how socio physical interdependence in water consumption is made patent more importantly this spatial differentiation is crucial in understanding sustainability of groundwater resources if equitable water distribution is intended by environmental authorities extraction permits petitions by sparsely distributed water users should be consistent with the users needs and their water accessibility according to fig 2 at 20th year in sincelejo water table declination velocity from the surface would be 2 times quicker than the speed at which the saturated thickness is approached this speed relationship is fewer in morroa and corozal since declination speed is half and a third respect to sincelejo for sampuÃ©s los palmitos and ovejas municipalities the relationships are different the speed at which water table approaches the bottommost of the aquifer is quicker than it gets distant from the surface differences in declination speed have social implications as well water users are more interested in how many meters the aquifer static level is the feasibility of water extraction depends on how much building maintaining and operating a borehole cost a water user might be ignorant on different hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifer system notwithstanding the static level depth is uppermost in water users minds because it is closer to the price per meter that he she has paid to get waterwells built in order to avoid observed steady declinations in aquifer stock and water tables in status quo situation optimal extraction rates are suggested especially to agricultural users in fig 3 extraction paths for three staple crops are presented differences in optimal extraction rates are explained by the fact that different maximum efficiency of water use are obtained per crop following mercado et al 2014 trout and dejonge 2017 yao and gouÃ© 1992 maize gets a maximum at 4 m3 of water applied per hectare and at 108 m3 of water yucca crops reach a maximum in water use efficiency this is consistent with the fact cassava crops adapt well to water deficit de tafur et al 1998 and contrarily maize crops are sensitive to water stress steduto et al 2012 consequently at the margin yucca crops appear to be more nurtured with each water unit applied in comparison with maize crops optimal extraction in m 3 day hectare for the first year for maize yucca and yam producers correspond to 0 93 m3 3 8 m3 and 3 m3 for yam producers respectively on a daily or monthly basis this water volume might be unevenly distributed in rainy seasons less water would be abstracted from the underground while in the dry season a greater volume could be extracted for irrigating crops these water volumes per day per hectare might be used as policy instruments aimed at promoting efficiency extraction caps consequently a serious institutional setting to progressively make this water abstraction caps as part of sustainability action shall be looked for municipalities and farms lying over the less deep saturated thickness zones are demanded to be more productive in terms of water use efficiency conversely in case of business as usual scheme of water extractions continuing some projections are made in terms the effect of simultaneous punches over the surface by the action of neighbor municipalities five steps are included in these projections as shown in ilustration 1 1 actual well depth are based on carsucre 2003 2015 contralorÃ­a general departamental de sucre 2013 2014 contralorÃ­a municipal de sincelejo 2017 2 since population tend to increase and water table continue to decline new or deeper punches are expected from different municipalities relying on morroa aquifer system corozal and sincelejo are the ones suffering greater extractions since they concentrate most of departmental population 3 water table declination conformation of cones of depression would probably lead to punches made on close aquifer spots 4 the evolution of water table is based on h it s t w t h ir Î² s t i w t water stock s t incorporates the influence of multiple neighbor municipalities exercising extractions 5 extraction costs are projected for deepening water tables two municipalities are presented as an example for the way how additional extraction costs might spread over municipal water users namely domestic and agricultural producers alternatively in case of prohibitive extraction costs as shown in ilustration 1 municipalities might start to think of distant water sources such as other aquifers in sucre department in this case six municipalities sincelejo morroa corozal los palmitos sampuÃ©s and ovejas might need to invest financial resources to build new boreholes over tolu viejo aquifer and golfo de morrosquillo in the north west or la mojana aquifer in the south however these alternatives might result unfeasible for low income farmers and households since bringing water from 35 km or 43 km far see map 2 undoubtedly add transportation costs to extraction costs instead of costly alternatives shown in map 2 three scenarios are introduced to provide useful options for municipalities interested in finding sustainable options in managing scarcer groundwater under the pressing forces of climate change different scenarios configure the research results gradual changes are incorporated in the presented alternatives which are aimed at improving the efficiency of water supply and demand management large leaps in expected efficient supply management enhancement may result inconsistent within the contexts of developing countries where many financial and cultural challenges in water conservation overflow climate variability would be driven by forecasted reductions in precipitations in the area of sucre and the caribbean ideam et al 2017 and consequently scant recharge rates are expected for all scenarios consequently reductions in water volumes extracted and efficient use is demanded 4 1 scenario 0 status quo keeping water losses and increasing water stock efficiency gap if water users may keep actual water consumption behaviors water companies are asked to increase supply more water wells are punched in order to match population increase and non accounted water is taken as normal or part of the working social norms in place technical and commercial losses surround 50 of all water distributed from freshwater treatment plants reduced precipitations are assumed two key characteristics of this scenario are presented as follows o non accounted water losses surround 50 o wastewater is discharged to different creeks without any previous treatment to reduce chemical or biological load following ilustration 2 in this scenario a total extraction volume of 187 4 million m3 for next 20 years might be expected agricultural activities contribute with 43 while potable water production plants would extract more than 50 of this volume and 53 of the latter would get wasted due to technical and commercial losses circular analysis of water use in sucre is limited since wastewater treatment plants are practically inexistent see section 3 1 above in the status quo situation for the next 5 years between 2021 and 2030 there is a potential of 67 million m3 of wastewater been generated business as usual this volume in turn would be discharged to different creeks that cross the municipalities in circular economy terms this would be a degenerative and damaging by design process 4 2 scenario 1 audacious steps in the right direction increasing water use efficiency it focusses on maintaining the actual water supply capacity and progressive reductions of water losses groundwater outflows are carefully planned and relevant hydrogeological variables are monitored water volume outflows are treated as a valuable resource object of a circular logic by design special attention is paid to the urgent need to guarantee environmental flow requirements for ecosystems relying on surface water more specifically elements and assumptions shaping scenario 1 are presented as follows see ilustrations 3 and 4 o steady reductions of water losses between 5 and 10 per year for 10 years o wastewater treatment plants are built and operated o a halt shall be made in collecting water from ponds and marshlands and surface water is left for environmental flow requirement o public private investments in switching to more efficient irrigation techniques is demanded o adaptation measures to tackle scarcity are put in place e g rainwater harvesting sharing excess of water among farmers 67 million m3 of wastewater been generated in the status quo situation might be put to beneficial use a high potential in finding new sources of water for agricultural activities exists notwithstanding this potential would not straightforwardly be achieved audacious efforts materialized in financial investments must be exerted political resolution is demanded as a prerequisite to get waste water treatment plants built and put under operation similarly modifications in the distribution of municipal sewage water networks are needed since in the actual design the deployed ends of pipes discharge sewage water in the different creeks crossing sucre municipalities whether intended to circulation or not in the economy waste water flowing different creeks must get chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod reduced to levels that do not get riparian ecosystems impaired 4 3 scenario 2 stringent and feasible but urgent efficiency circularity it entails a reduction in water volumes extracted from morroa aquifer and progressively focusses on asking water users to reduce water consumption as much as possible to more efficient levels see ilustration 4 this scenario specifically includes o water treated in wastewater treatment plants circulated for agricultural purposes o halting the collection of water from ponds and marshlands and surface water is left for efr o reuse and recirculate water treated at industrial plants o adaptation measures to tackle scarcity are put in place rainwater harvesting sharing excess of water among farmers switching to more efficient irrigation techniques o a serious water conservation policy is put in place o autonomously devised cultural practices around cpr conservation are embedded among different communities respect to status quo situation a 22 of efficiency might be achieved in the next 20 years if an efficient and circular management model is endeavored multiple gains would be harvested for the benefit of water users and ecosystems relying on aquifers increased efficiency is mostly driven by 30 million m3 stemming from sewage water treatment water recirculated in agriculture would prevent aquifer extraction for agricultural activities 5 discussion actual models of water supply planning are based on isolated extraction activities by different water utilities and individual water users in the caribbean region of colombia since the intended or unintended competition for water resources is made patent in water table declination this would not avoid egoistic attitudes in extractions to continue therefore public municipal water managers may play a key role in activating regional and interdependent water supply planning for this aim awareness on common pool resource character of aquifer and hydrogeological conditions of shared aquifer systems are needed cpr character is not overtly incorporated in existing hydro economic models such as pulido velazquez et al 2016 srinivasan et al 2010 zhu et al 2015 existing hydro economic models incorporate utility consumer reservoirs groundwater tanker modules from a systemic approach srinivasan et al 2010 water conservation concern and options for extensions of infrastructure taking account of operational allocations under variable water availability rosenberg et al 2008 water supply state along the river system and the water demands by the various sectors using water resource ringler et al 2004 notwithstanding the common pool resource cpr nature of water resources especially groundwater are not observed in the extant analysis i suggest that ignoring the cpr character of aquifer and surface water systems may put long term water planning under risk since one municipality might be confident of expected water stocks while other competing municipalities and other users may accelerate extractions and running aquifer water table far from feasible access thus water supply planning for neighboring municipalities should no longer be performed in isolation but at a regional scale in which cpr character of water sources is incorporated collective planning demands a shifting in status quo among planners and users extant model of water planners role dedicated to match supply with demand represent the plan a conversely a plan b demands to introspective analysis in terms of how efficient the water consumption is key issue for efficiency analysis entails questioning to what extent the capacity of water applied to the agricultural and industrial processes is utilized to apprehend the maximum potential of water consumed efficiency and circularity might be sound criteria for sustainable regional water management for instance given actual degenerative situation of extant waste water management rooms for improvement exits for turning to regenerative by design waste water management waste water discharged to different surface water bodies do not fit into the definition of efficiency efficient water use refers to reaping the maximum benefit of each cubic meter of water waste water has a continued potential in water applications to agricultural and industrial processes however waste water treatment plants deployed over sucre are basically inexistent and political resolution might be a must since public goods such as water quality remains on public entities charge opportunities exist for associated water users endeavoring in investing in treatment plants as well to reduce the pressure on the aquifer morroa aquifer demand special attention since declination speed is threatening the aquifer stocks for the future new governance schemes led by extraction caps might help in groundwater conservation an area that can affect both water demand and supply is conservation conservation can reduce demand for a particular use enabling the saved water to be allocated to other uses in order to accomplish this water conservation measures need to be less expensive than the cost of the water saved booker et al 2012 similarly efficiency and common pool rationale should replace actual independent water planning and the collective thinking should be sparked from dared entrepreneurs interested in conservation and limiting extractions an alternative governance scheme led by extraction caps may be part of the urgent transition towards regenerative thinking and action and efficient water consumption in groundwater dependent regions quantitative data on optimal extraction rates may support decision making in extant institutional settings existing rules and institutions in groundwater governance systems should open the door to utilizing quantitative inputs due to the declining and exhaustible nature of groundwater resources however due to different sources of uncertainty the definition of optimal extraction rates should be cautiously prescribed as stated in burt 1964 noel and howitt 1982 provencher and burt 1994a this is optimal extraction paths for long horizons such as 70 80 or 90 years may result impractical due to that a lot of environmental alterations may occur and water users may shift extraction behaviors in the long term instead cautious and iterative calibrations of optimal extraction levels might be implemented we may refer to prescribing optimal rates for 35 or 50 years without take no notice of future generations a 50 years time horizon does not mean wittingly making aquifer depleted in 50 years instead as new data on hydrogeological conditions influencing water stocks and flows are produced updated optimal extraction rates might be calibrated for the subsequent 50 years this iterative process should always be performed under the limits of state variables such as exploitable stocks and similarly imposing constraints of abstractions to minimum stocks minimum levels of reserves may act as a precautionary principle long term perspective is needed while devising cautious short term water supply planning since traditional water supply forecast use to simply match demand with supply there exists an inertial supply management scheme in which water managers just rush for satisfying the demand in the politics of water planning water managers are told to bring abundant water to all who demand it zetland 2011 however business as usual water demand projections data tend to hide bad habits in water consumption degenerative waste water management inefficient water application to agricultural and industries and spendthrift attitudes instead inefficient and damaging water consumption customs should be overtly recognized and disclosed once stakeholders become aware of caveats risks detrimental actions and opportunities rooms for improvement should collectively be built based on efficiency and circularity principles circular economy of water should be a compulsory criterion for water supply and demand forecast in doing this different users would use reuse and recirculate water which in turn would reduce water demanded it does not only refer to an instrumental shift in water consumption but an awareness based shift towards sustainability a long term shift would imply a change in water use paradigm water should be utilized not as a simple input for agricultural domestic or industrial activities but as a valuable natural entity serving nature as well a circular and efficient model would be a cost effective strategy for climate variability adaptation otherwise since declinations in precipitations are expected up to 2100 ideam et al 2017 a deeper water table would place higher pressures on alternative water sources unless water users are willing to collect water around 1 km deeper well depths for differentiated water users will demand serious discussions on justice in water access rising water tables and rising energy costs would impose financial burdens on low income households and farmers conceivably further water tables might trigger new reconfigurations of livelihoods location and new punches over surface would be developed as trends on increasing urban sprawls have been observed relocations in urban areas shall be convenient reasons for rethinking the prevailing water supply planning scheme a new water governance deal led by extraction caps shall be needed a plan b water assessment applied to each municipalities and corresponding neighbors would be needed as an integrative model aimed at providing inputs for water resources planning in which the depletable and common pool character of aquifers is incorporated 6 conclusion this research was aimed at integrating the common pool resource and depletable character of aquifers in municipal water supply planning efficiency and circularity of water in the economy were two criteria used for seek sustainable consumption of water the term water productivity is kept when respective authors use it however the concept on water use efficiency is utilized in this research a hydro economic model was built it incorporates an optimization model aimed at calculating maximum efficiency in water applied to crops cultivated in the region of analysis optimal levels of extraction pretend to reap the maximum benefit of drops applied to three main crops namely yucca maize and yam optimal extraction was compared to status quo situation and an efficiency gap was found in more stringent scenario for the conceivable future an efficiency gain of 22 in water saved for the economy in actual situation there seems to be a degenerative by design waste water management since these waters are discharged directly to creeks crossing sucre territory reducing water pollution is urgent and beneficial since enhancement of surface water ecosystems is a must instead of discharging to surface water bodies recirculation of treated water in agricultural and industrial activities would reduce the pressures on aquifer in the order of 30 million m 3 this reduction would stem from sewage water treatment plants for the next 20 years in case they are built and operated hydro economic models entails different steps knowledge of waterwells location and the understanding of hydrogeology of aquifers are binding pre requisites the model presented in this research may result relevant for other contexts of declining aquifer systems as well overarching conceptual setting refers to the fact that in the foreseeable future neighbor municipalities interested in water extractions to supply water for different users might be planning to make punches over concurrent or adjacent surface spots in thinking and doing this some caveats should be made public future water sources do not simply refer to think horizontally but vertically as well this is the finding of new water sources due to water table declination should not only bear in mind horizontal distances in the vicinity of municipalities but the vertical distances to cones of depressions and to the inclination of aquifer systems for this aim a declination speed index is introduced in two senses the surface water table distance and water table saturated thickness distance this issue should not be overlooked if spatial differentiation in water tables is incorporated in groundwater extraction permits analysis declination speed has crucial social implications derived from differentiated extraction costs for users it is estimated that the exacerbation of water table declinations will accelerate the predicted externalities in cpr management an externality arising from the pumping costs and a strategic externality that emerges from the race between resource users to hold the groundwater stocks negri 1989 the economic theory predicts that each individual haste for mining the resource and consuming the majority in the present because the residual stock might not be available to each one in the future hardin 1968 negri 1989 this strategic behavior of competition for groundwater reserves lead to overexploitation of the resource negri 1989 rising awareness on this issue is needed among water planners and environmental authorities and consequently a regional planning might work better in seeking sustainable and equitable groundwater extraction this research applies to contexts of urban water supplied by municipalities that mainly rely on aquifers for freshwater provision and agricultural activities in addition to this private waterwells are built by individual households using electric pumps in urban areas and rural sectors demanding water for irrigation this combination of public and private provision of water is applicable for international contexts such as brazil and paraguay foster et al 2006 india patil k mahadev c bhat g manjunatha 2015 srinivasan et al 2010 mÃ©xico oecd 2015 sandoval 2004 western usa middle east israel oecd 2017b due to steady declinations of water tables inevitably water utilities and individual water users will be gradually forced to explore and exploit new water sources alternatively instead of thinking of searching for new water sources communities water managers and individual water users should make a halt in the inertial behavior of increasing consumption and instead increase efficiency in consumption of current water supply sources will become more mandatory as the climate change exacerbates its effects on water resources similarly a collective planning scheme might put to work since interdependent water extraction is made patent in the presence of externalities and every cubic meter extracted from one municipality may influence the extractions of neighbor municipalities and extraction costs of water as well consequently water users located over more productive spots might be hassle free while others might experience stressful situation due to costly water supply because of rapid water table declination especially in contexts of droughts however referring to regional planning must be treated with caution since the greater the regional scope of analysis the more complex and entangled the analysis might be notwithstanding water planners should make a halt in the inertial style of simply exploring how deep the waterwells could be exploited instead a reflexive interdisciplinary plan for efficient and sustainable use of existing and new water sources should be done for the foreseeable future 6 1 limitations location of every single water user was not possible at all however data for main water user was collected through different sources data for water consumed at industry level were scarce as well water quality issues were not fully discussed either which may indeed affect extraction volumes for all the activities due to actual covid 19 pandemic situation some additional data collection and pilot tests activities were not possible declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper annexes annex 1 a general overview of the region s water resources glancing at the hydrologic map of sucre colombia we may have a mixed impression in terms of water distribution six watersheds encompass the whole department some basins are shared with environmental authorities of other regions different from sucre northern basins correspond to different streams such as san antonio matatigre enmedio palmar el tigre cascajo y pechilÃ­n which mostly drain its waters to caribbean sea these are mostly seasonal streams since they use to run water flows during rainy seasons lasting for less than 3 months a year listed streams run over municipalities of sampuÃ©s sincelejo morroa corozal los palmitos and ovejas another basin is distributed over the middle part of the department it runs in direction northwest to southeast draining waters to some swamplands and san jorge river available surface water supply in the shared watersheds in the northern part in rainy years correspond to 1714 million m3 and it drops to 429 million m3 in drier years for low san jorge la mojana watershed water supply is much higher since it sums up to 11 932 million m3

11892,municipal supply of water under climate variations growing population uncertainty and scarcity requires water planners to devise feasible and sustainable water sourcing plans especially for territories relying on groundwater the conventional ways to cope with water scarcity will no longer guarantee reaping the maximum benefits of declining available water resources efficiency and circularity of water are claimed as essential criteria for seeking solutions in designing long term supply management a plan b water assessment applied to a group of municipalities in dry areas of colombia is proposed as a hydro economic model aimed at providing inputs for water resources planning in which the depletable and common pool character of aquifers are incorporated a declination speed index is introduced in two ways the surface water table distance and water table saturated thickness distance this issue should not be overlooked if spatial differentiation in water tables is incorporated in groundwater extraction permits analysis for multiple and convergent water users research results are promising for sustainability of water management in dry areas around the world respect to status quo situation a 22 of efficiency gain might be achieved in the next 20 years in sucre colombia under an efficient model of water consumption if an efficient and circular water management model is endeavored multiple gains would be harvested for the benefit of water users and ecosystems relying on aquifers increased efficiency is mostly driven by 30 million m3 sewage water recirculated in agriculture which in turn would prevent aquifer extraction for this activity in business as usual scheme water efficiency gap will be wider extraction costs will rise to prohibitive levels for low income municipalities the declining water tables will oblige to make new punches by simultaneous water users and water declination index calculated would reflect a precipitous decay research results provide empirical evidence to the discussion on possible solutions for sustainable and efficient water management as stated in sustainable development goals specifically target goal 6

pool resources circular economy of water 1 introduction different cities in the caribbean of colombia are exhibiting perilous signs of vast pressures on water systems surface water are suffering of water flow attenuation and groundwater tables of aquifer are declining even in rainy seasons municipal supply of water under climate variations growing population uncertainty and scarcity requires water planners to devise feasible and sustainable water sourcing plans especially for territories relying on groundwater such as municipalities over morroa aquifer sucre and cÃ³rdoba departments in which water supply to match demand is running down groundwater at a high rate managing water supply to match levels of water demand is a reasonable economic and management approach since tense situations created by water shortages are to be circumvented despite the environmental and water authorities efforts to implement economic and political instruments to manage groundwater competition and efficient water allocations oecd 2015 2017a repeated water shortages create perceptions of government failure world bank 2018 whether plentiful or scarce water managers are told to bring abundant water to all who demand it zetland 2011 notwithstanding when referring to groundwater management the analysis might not be so simple as matching supply with demand shared aquifer systems by different municipalities represent a case in which groundwater stocks exhibit a puzzling interdependent matter different municipal water utilities abstracting from shared aquifer cells might be independently confident that their aquifer water supply is enough to satisfy demand in their jurisdictions however one municipality s demand may impinge a limited supply onto other neighboring municipalities for instance some adjacent municipalities endowed with less technological capacity for water abstractions would reap less benefits from groundwater resources in comparison to the better equipped ones since every single municipality must independently manage water resource it does not mean that interdependent aquifer resources may prevent that an interdependent water resources management plan by multiple municipalities might be devised interdependency in groundwater resources is palpable through different hydrogeological variables more outstandingly groundwater and surface water exhibit unnoticed water flow interactions glennon 2002 winter et al 1998 for illustration the steady groundwater abstraction in waterwells under operation create a cone of depression the interdependent feature arises when cones of depression are overlapped when multiple wells are active another two factors demonstrating this interdependence make reference to environmental flow requirements efr 1 1

discussions about the nature of common pool resources see negri 1989 ostrom 2015 ostrom et al 1994 neighbor municipalities sharing a single cell aquifer may experience different extraction costs some of them might be located over more productive spots meanwhile the others might be placed over deeper water tables which oblige them to incur in higher cost to collect needed water units groundwater table declination and droughts are pervasive phenomena in western usa australia morocco mexico iran jordan iran india parts of china and other areas in south asia world bank 2018 climate shocks are taking a toll on many urban centers and amplifying the unpredictability of freshwater availability which is exacerbated due to increasing numbers of prolonged droughts affecting competing users world bank 2018 different municipalities in the caribbean region of colombia relying on groundwater for domestic and agricultural purposes exhibit frequent water scarce and drought situations ideam 2014 and water use altogether entail interdependent effects of water extractions the interdependency of extractions should be assessed and incorporated in water planning water supply should be consistent with the declining water tables and all the pressures upcoming from climate change and the hidden competition of water in shared aquifers similarly given the observed pervasive declinations of water tables in the area of study and around the world there is an urgent call to pursue a sustainable management of water resources therefore how to design and implement groundwater sustainability plans for interdependent water users represent the main research question of this article one may think of sustainability of water resources in terms of matching water demanded to actual and forecasted water supply otherwise one may prefer to challenge extant water demand patterns and drive it towards efficient water consumption levels consequently efficiency would probably imply consuming less than different water users are accustomed to in reference to efficiency one may question whether consuming 110 l person day 3 3 reported water consumption level in sucre up to 2018 at household levels is an excessive volume of water or not whether actual volumes of water applied to agricultural activities are efficient enough to reap the greatest efficiency potential per cubic meter applied to the crops and whether each volume of water consumed by industries is treated simply as another production input or as a resource which is potentially subject to reuse or recycling since water use interdependency appears and indeed is complex it should not prevent water planners to trigger water resources efficiency and sustainability plans as part of serious water policies managing any resource efficiently pareto efficiency occurs when a water allocation can provide no further gains in production or satisfaction without simultaneously creating a loss harou et al 2009 efficiency refers to the capacity of water applied to the agricultural and industrial processes to apprehend the maximum potential of water consumed without creating losses to neighbor users for this aim best available agricultural practices are used as benchmarks as a mean to address sustainability in consumptive water use the benchmarks do not necessarily represent a verified sustainable case in terms of environmental footprints instead they show that reductions in water consumption in agriculture industry and households are possible the present research is relevant to sustainable development goals sdg the research question aim is related to providing empirical evidence about possible strategies to sustainable and efficient water management the target goal 6 4 of sdgs states that by 2030 water efficiency and sustainability in water withdrawals should be accomplished for this sdg efficiency and circularity of water are taken as key criteria for sustainability an efficient and circular plan b is proposed plan a represent the status quo in which supply is matched with the demand the proposed models do not pretend being all encompassing but it incorporates the need for water from neighboring municipalities it includes the environmental flow requirement of ecosystems depending on groundwater as well an optimal control theory model is utilized to optimize extractions for each municipality i given the optimal extraction of the neighbor municipalities i in this case sincelejo sucre is used as the initial point of departure for optimization analysis this article is organized as follows introductory statements and justifications are included in this section 1 problem statement is added to summarize some stylized facts and to make it comparable with other regions of the world in section 2 a short description of literature review of relevant publications is developed keywords such as water management scarcity and groundwater were used section 3 presents the research methods mainly focused in optimal control theory application to calculate optimal extractions section 4 consists of research results it includes water efficiency gap water table declination index calculated and scenarios presented to discuss efficiency gains finally in discussion and conclusions sections 5 and 6 attention is drawn on the need to abandon the inertial water supply management scheme of simple matching supply with demand 1 1 problem statement since the aquifer stock is not part of the observed key variables in municipal long term planning the exhaustible nature of aquifers is rarely embedded in ex ante analysis of municipal water planning focusing only on water table declination does not guarantee complete knowledge of aquifers as a water source for ecosystems and humans whose resources may end exhausted water planning instruments such as water efficient use and saving plans and aquifer environmental management plans reflect a sort of myopic analysis in terms of the unattended interdependent effects of water abstractions municipalities relying on aquifers for freshwater provision and agricultural activities may impose negative effects onto other municipalities this is especially relevant for municipal water companies industries and farmers boreholes built over single cell aquifers the problem statement is relevant for more locations in colombia and water scarce cities around the world for this particular context urban and rural areas reliance on abating aquifers is a tough issue to manage in sucre colombia because there is a sort of invisible competition for water resources between water users and the municipal water facilities in sucre more than 90 of municipalities rely on groundwater to provide water for domestic and agricultural uses public entities in charge of water management use powerful pumps to collect water from the underground and distribute it to households some waterwells have experienced declinations around 17 m year which threaten aquifer sustainability carsucre 2003 aside up to 2011 there existed 1 788 water wells under operation 4 4 1 713 waterwells reported in the jurisdiction of carsucre and 75 wells in the area of regional environmental corporation corpomojana it shows that there is not a unique centrally managed water distribution system but a collection of private and public boreholes which are jeopardizing water resources however competition for groundwater reserves is not symmetric when observing map 1 groundwater access is uneven for a single municipality for instance in ovejas or sampuÃ©s since pretending to punch water wells in south east locations may result fruitless consequently alternative plan b water sourcing analysis for some locations should be consciously devised this is especially the case of actual circumstances in which some locations better endowed with underground water are overexploiting reserves which are the feasible scenarios for asymmetric water access and declining water tables for each municipality for next 10 30 50 and more years how to assess and implement future municipal water sourcing plans to meet water demand under the challenges of interdependent water abstractions from neighbor municipalities in this research the plan b water assessment is introduced as an alternative approach which might be useful to support municipalities in adapting to declining water resources plan b is based on some criteria named efficiency and interconnectedness of the effects of water extraction this interconnection is close to the circular economy of water approach since some opportunities arise in reaping multiple benefits from water while using this resource in the economy 1 2 common pool resources efficiency and circular economy approach one municipality relying on surface water for freshwater provision and agricultural activities might be prone to explore groundwater sources when surface water flows are declined to critical levels however new water wells should not be built over randomly selected places since every well spot represents differing implications in terms of adequacy for aquifer sustainability analysis some well spots might not be convenient due to possible deep water tables presence of recharge zones cones of depression conformed underground and other key hydrogeological aspects worth to be noted if sustainability becomes a priority similarly if one municipality devise a plan to explore alternative water sources the need to access water by other neighbor municipalities and users should not be ignored if bad mannered competition over water stocks and flows does not want to be sparked each municipality is demanded to take a further inward look at their water flows management a take make waste model leonard 2011 in water management should no longer persist as the status quo water should not be wasted few steps after it is taken out from underground and similarly sewage water should not waste surface water systems at the end of the flow since this is the reported case in sucre for last 20 years water wasted from the underground source and degenerative flows driven by sewage water at the end seems to be the social norm in regional water management and comptroller s documents excessive non accounted water is reported and main creeks serve as point of sewage discharge despite the intended efforts to tackle so high undetected water squandering non accounted water is still kept as the social norm non accounted water reported in 2003 was 46 defensorÃ­a del pueblo 2005 shockingly water losses in sincelejo were greater than 67 and greater than 55 in corozal in 2017 aguas de la sabana 2017 and reduction goals for next five years are conservative since expected water losses are 55 and 43 respectively aguas de la sabana 2017 reducing water losses represent a tough endeavor notwithstanding the urgent need to efficiently manage and adapt to water scarcity and climate variability demand serious exertions to reduce pressure on groundwater systems there are rooms for improvements stemming from reduction of water losses however further opportunities exist in order to turn to water use efficiency a claim is placed on the need to reap the maximum benefit of water flows pressures on groundwater might be reduced by means of a change in water management paradigm as well instead of continuing exerting more water outflows to distribute it to water users a halt should be made in the logic of outflows allocation actual water management dynamic is governed by the logic of bringing abundant water to all who demand it zetland 2011 and increase water supply at the pace of population demand is how things stand water volume outflows should be treated as a valuable resource object to a circular logic as a planned design a circular approach of water would definitely assist in reaping the maximum potential benefit of water volumes until the last drop of utility is attained water used at industries and households should not use water as a simple raw material or as an input for products processing or indoor domestic activities in its place a new logic aimed at attaining the highest potential of each liter of water should be imperative 2 literature review groundwater may have been put to beneficial use for many thousands of years but the fundamental principles of sustainable groundwater management are very young howard 2015 conceivably the more comprehensive concept encompassing the aspirations of efficiency sustainability and water management refers to integrated water resources management iwrm iwrm is aimed at promoting the coordination in development and management of water land and related resources in order to maximize the economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without jeopardizing the sustainability of vital ecosystems gwp 2000 one of the recommendations of paris statement 2007 to promote sustainable development of water resources refer to using the entire water cycle including groundwater with all its components and their interactions as a unifying framework for effective management howard 2015 adding the concept of water cycle might become iwrm as a more complex issue to implement and operationalize indeed iwrm does not provide any real guidance to water professionals and policy makers so as to make planning management and decision making processes more rational and efficient to achieve biswas 2008 as an alternative hydro economics offer practical applications for the integration of different disciplines supporting sustainable water resources management hydro economic models represent spatially distributed water resource systems infrastructure management options and economic values in an integrated manner to address the complexity of urban water supply arising from consumers dependence on multiple interconnected sources of water harou et al 2009 srinivasan et al 2010 hydrogeological models play a key role in building conceptual maps encompassing basic hydrological variables these models are aimed at providing relevant information in regard of estimated water storage recharge levels of aquifer and the water balance at regional level gauging groundwater reserves and recharge of aquifer should be a priority for municipalities regions relying on aquifers ignoring stock and recharging levels simply face municipalities and regions to a sort of blind planning which might surprise water managers to unadvertised severe declinations of water table contamination and saltwater intrusion due to limited capacity to systematically monitor aquifer characteristics this in turn would prevent water planners to devise timely plans to adapt to water scarcity and climate change in short water managers relying on aquifers should get a grip on the overarching relevance of hydrogeological knowledge notwithstanding the hydrogeological dimension of aquifer systems planning fall short in understanding the complex dimensions of optimal water use different approaches might be useful to make a wide ranging counterpart for water demand and water supply analysis to guarantee clean water provision in the cities in the developing world it will be important for the future that groundwater be used more widely on an efficient and sustainable basis for urban water supply foster s and hirata 2011 promoting efficiency and sustainability of aquifer systems demand interdisciplinary planning engineering and hydrogeology are well equipped with the essential knowledge to understand aquifer characteristics however multiple dimensions would remain missing or unattended if groundwater planning if not supported by other disciplines in many cases groundwater is either ignored or it is simply lumped together with surface water despite the fact that groundwater and surface water operate on distinctly different scales of time and space howard 2015 hydro ecology may help in understating water stocks and flows essential to sustain freshwater and estuarine ecosystems sociology may help in approaching water users and understand how reliance on aquifers affects water literacy well ownership and water awareness it may emphasize on the ethics of conserving and staying mindful of aquifers as well ternes 2018 achieving the sustainable development target goal 6 4 demand the understanding of the complex factors shaping water use efficiency and sustainable withdrawals however it is important to not largely focus on the supply side of the problem but on the demand and behavioral side sustainable water withdrawals 5 5 conceptualization of sustainability in groundwater resources is quite complicated and subject to current discussions among hydrogeologist and water planners for some cases there has to be recognition that groundwater resource is not renewable and its use therefore be sustainable kalf and woolley 2005 entails puzzling social dimensions worth to incorporate in project design and implementation to curb water consumption asprilla echeverrÃ­a 2020 for this reason further research of social sciences would play a key role in disentangling the reductions in urban water consumption the economics of natural resources is equipped with robust economic and mathematical tools aimed at analyzing optimality in resource extractions despite all criticism to economic sciences due to sophistication of models and strong and unreal assumptions it may provide valuable inputs for efficiency and sustainability analysis in burt 1964 the method of dynamic programming is used using the principle of bellman optimality for aquifers in california a net profit function is built which depends on the amount of resource used and the amount for the remaining per period as a general condition of optimality it is concluded that the level of production must be expanded to the point where the net marginal product per unit of water is equal to the negative of the marginal cost of pumping with respect to the water in the storage in burt 1967 applied to san joaquin valley in california as well the author uses first order differences equations to solve the model of dynamic programming in this model the net marginal product with respect to the extraction rate is equal to the net marginal product capitalized with respect to the stock besides it determines the existence of a balance stock level from which recharge and optimal extraction depend on provencher and burt 1994b discuss the effectiveness and convenience of comparing centralized groundwater management control schemes with respect to models such as privatization understood as the allocation of property rights for the madera county in california the authors demonstrate that with the privatization model which provides a marketable permit endowment of the on site stock which agents control over time higher earnings are obtained in well being of water users than traditional forms of centralized control because the market allows the management of risks krulce d roumasset j wilson 1997 use the optimal control theory for coastal aquifer analyses in hawaii where they model desalinated water as a replacement or backstop technology for water extracted from the ground in this exercise an optimal control problem is built with infinite time horizon and there are three optimal stages are found firstly an increasing stage in which the height of the aquifer must be retained in the following period there is an overdraft or reduction and the water table is decreasing and a finally stage in which the height of the aquifer follows a steady state to infinity in another relevant models such as noel et al 1980 the optimal control theory is employed as well the research calculates socially optimal temporal and spatial allocations between agricultural and urban uses with a quadratic linear control model with economic and hydrologic components to model the joint use of ground and surface water this model is applied to several watersheds in yolo county in california based on the fact that possibly users who live in the present would not be willing to sacrifice their consumption pitafi and roumasset 2009 propose a model that allows to increase the political feasibility of regulating the use of aquifers in hawaii this is done through a mechanism whereby those experiencing welfare losses can be compensated for the efficient management of the resource and applied to a spatial temporal context more recently an optimal path of extraction of groundwater was built for the chitradurga district in india patil k mahadev c bhat g manjunatha 2015 the authors applied the maximum principle of pontryagin a linear inverse demand function a linear cost function and also a total rainfall dependent recharge function were used with this information coupled with information on characteristics of agricultural producers an optimal control model for steady state equilibrium was estimated in reference to application of optimal control theory different models might be developed to calculate optimal extraction rates of control variables some models might incorporate different specifications for the transversality condition this condition applies for the terminal condition for state variable for this research aim state variable refer to aquifer stocks see 3 3 below terminal condition of zero means that the shadow price of aquifer stock should be driven to zero at the terminal time consequently reaping benefits from aquifer extraction within the period 0 t would matter and that whatever water stock that still exists at time t being too late to put to use would have no economic value to water users or water planners 6 6 adapted from chiang 1992 despite being plausible in providing an image of possible time for aquifers getting exhausted there are still missing issues in resource economics models for instance i would stress the need to manage minimum stock level of groundwater so as to not approaching the water as resource subject to exhaustion real aquifer sustainability models should treat terminal state variable stock of aquifer s t as s t s t m i n instead of s t f r e e o r zero a closer look to the concept of groundwater sustainability may refer to aquifer sustainable yields sustainable yields can be derived from conservation of mass principles in a groundwater basin i n f l o w i o u t f l o w o Î´ s t kalf and woolley 2005 7 7 where Î´ s correspond to change in storage in l3 and i and o in l3 t 1 inflows are mostly determined by nature 8 8 natural processes such as recharges led by infiltration of precipitation leakage from streams and lakes artificial recharge kalf and woolley 2005 while outflows are mostly driven by social dimensions abstractions and to a lesser extent by the nature natural discharges a sustainable groundwater management system would benefit from greater inputs than outputs through the time sustainability of aquifer systems mass equilibrium in groundwater basin time dimensions and variables determining the groundwater flow properties are discussed in j bredehoeft 1997 kalf and woolley 2005 the time taken to attain equilibrium will depend on the magnitude of the abstraction rate aquifer characteristics and distances to recharge boundaries kalf and woolley 2005 notwithstanding in j bredehoeft 1997 j d bredehoeft 2002 kalf and woolley 2005 groundwater system planning takes social dimensions for granted and more importantly do not recognize the common pool nature of the resource the cpr characteristic of aquifers means there exists competition to reap the most of benefits of abstraction in the present the free rider problem variations in time horizon perceptions about the resource value and other issues leading to productive or destructive outcomes as appointed by hardin 1968 negri 1989 ostrom 2015 3 methods before embarking in designing empirical methods a document analysis of water policy and regional water planning documents was developed special attention to the approaches made to tackle water scarcity was paid and the way how water supply of groundwater resources has been addressed by water managers is discussed basic descriptive analysis of water consumption reports released by water companies were analyzed as well monthly data on households industries and commercial uses are available since 2002 through 2018 data on agricultural water consumption were more disperse but mostly obtained from the recent national agricultural census and official general comptroller environmental reports information and data on the hydrogeological characteristics of aquifer were collected from different sources such as research thesis environmental authority conceptual hydrogeologic maps and the national institute of geological service with all this information water balances needed to prepare scenarios to analyze changes in water flows were performed this included the analysis of modifications of water flows aimed at estimating changes on environmental pressures on groundwater systems reducing the burden on groundwater makes sense since aquifer stocks are rarely unlimited resources despite replenishment of aquifers may provide the control mechanism to convert it into a renewable resource extant aquifer recharge in dry areas tend to be scanty certainly in sucre for more than 40 years groundwater reserves have been running out because people annually extract more water than it seeps into the ground carsucre 2015 consequently one key assumption utilized in building models refer to treat aquifer as a non renewable resource due to scant replenishment and forecasted reductions in precipitations in the area of sucre and the caribbean ideam pnud mads dnp cancilleria 2017 some additional assumptions refer to policy measures that might not be implemented for instance efficiency analysis may estipulate sewage water treatment for recycling which might not be put in place shortly in order to reduce pressure on surface and groundwater systems some assumptions in regard of new activities demanding water are incorporated as well population would rise at a 1 0 growing rate keeping actual rates according to dane it is also assumed that people would continue moving to urban areas 3 1 hydro economic methods given the complex characteristics of efficiency and interdependency of groundwater extractions research methods combine different disciplines such as hydrology hydrogeology and economics hydrologic models provide key elements such as groundwater inventory aquifer recharge and stocks hydraulics of groundwater offer relevant aspects such as water flows permeability and storage capacity hydrogeologic variables were used to estimate water balance which are represented through water flow diagrams to facilitate representation of water flows in the territory economics provide useful tools to understand and assess efficiency of water resources optimization of water consumption is supported on optimal control theory optimal control formulation of a dynamic optimization problem focuses upon one or more control variables that serve as instruments of optimization optimal control foremost aim is the determination of the optimal time path for a control variable u t chiang 1992 chiang and wainwright 2005 control variables influence state variables paths the former includes examples such as the extraction rates pumping timing and waterwells location and the latter refer to variables such as aquifer stock and aquifer saturated thickness optimal control entails the specification of the objective functional subject to maximization the definition of state function initial and end values for state variables and the specifications regarding boundaries and control set for instance the control set might be an open or a closed set the most important result in optimal control theory a first order necessary conditions is known as the maximum principle chiang and wainwright 2005 the research aim focused on sustainably integrate socio physical interdependence in regional water planning entail the definition of the management scheme in defining the economic models this definition is relevant to determine the role of stakeholders the control and state variables subject of analysis it is also assumed that actual water management system of central planning is kept the main interest of the environmental authority as a central planner is maximizing the net present economic value of the added benefit of water consumption it refers to the benefits in production for relevant agricultural crops environmental flow requirement and domestic groundwater demand function for sincelejo corozal sampuÃ©s morroa los palmitos and ovejas in sucre in addition to this the authority is interested in maintaining water units for other neighboring municipalities and ecosystems depending on ground and surface water therefore the optimal water extraction rates for the major types of beneficiaries should be chosen by the environmental authorities the economic model consists of two state variables given by the stock or water reserves denoted as s t and the height of the aquifer h t the dynamics of state variables are driven by the nature but are influenced by control variables as well extraction permits entitled to water petitioners who approach before the regional environmental corporation provide the mechanism of how control variables are chosen w d w m w y a and w y represent the extraction of water by domestic consumers maize yam and yucca producers respectively the extraction can take values less than or equal to the aquifer stock size thus 0 w d w m w y a w y s 0 s 0 correspond to initial exploitable 9 9 there exists an important difference in the type of aquifer reserves exploitable reserves is different from total reserves elastic reserves and stored reserves carsucre 2003 stock which is estimated in 3247 million m3 carsucre 2003 in addition it is assumed that this stock is stored in an irregular aquifer 10 10 the complex and heterogeneous nature of the aquifer hydrogeology must require a more detailed modeling of the optimization process for example treating as a multi cell aquifer with interconnections between them notwithstanding the analysis with a single cell can offer a good approximation to the study of the optimal extraction given the dynamics of geographic concentration of the users who most extract the natural resource from the underground in economic and physical terms the stock is constituted in a state variable that the hydrogeology defines as the total amount of water that is confined in the rocks and that can be drained or not according to characteristics like porosity the specific retention among others ideam 2014 as part of sustainability approach the environmental authority is concerned with the intergenerational justice and the common pool character of aquifer used by other neighbor municipalities consequently a minimum level of stock of the aquifers is considered so that total water availability is not jeopardized the randomness of rainfall as a source of aquifer recharges makes this issue worth noted 3 1 1 specification of economic models the functions of benefit for water used are specified for main agricultural activities and domestic users efficient and sustainable groundwater allocation to main water users represent one of the key policy instruments for environmental authorities pursuing sustainable use of groundwater reserves in table 1 a summary of function of benefits is presented for more details and explanation on the equations see annexes section 3 1 1 1 extraction cost function cost function is represented as a reserve dependent model for which krulce d roumasset j wilson 1997 is followed in this model h corresponds to the vertical distance between the level of the water table and the depth of the saturated thickness 11 11 the saturated thickness depends on whether it is a saturated unsaturated free or multi layered aquifer for confined aquifers the thickness is equal to the physical thickness of the aquifer between the aquicludes above and below it this applies to the confined parts of a free aquifer in both cases the saturated thickness is constant over time for cases of unconfined aquifers the thickness corresponds to the difference between the water table and the aquicludes of the aquifer this saturated thickness is the lower physical limit of the aquifer the lower the level the more costly the water withdrawal as the aquifer approaches exhaustion h t 0 the extraction costs grow rapidly in this sense the average cost of water extraction of the aquifers is modeled as a convex positive and decreasing function of the height of the aquifer as follows c h 0 c h 0 c h 0 lim h 0 c h so the total water extraction cost for w d w y w y a and w m summarized in w corresponds to c h w it is assumed that investment costs for boreholes and maintenance are lower compared to recurrent monthly energy costs besides when the aquifer is dry the costs lean towards infinite since there would be no available water and the energy cost and pumping time are increased therefore the cost function is adjusted by incorporating the energy costs c e n e r 6 c h c e n e r h o h t Î± i w t where h o is the initial height of the water table distance from land surface to water table Î± corresponds to the rate at which water table approaches zero for this case it is equal to 0 8 given the average actual water table declination speed h o 275 m is the average well depth observed in sincelejo morroa and corozal carsucre 2003 the cost of energy will be taken as a cost per kilowatt hour for the study area 3 1 1 2 state variable functions variables subject to rules of nature correspond to aquifer stock s t and the height h t of water table provencher and burt 1994b propose a recursive function given by s t 1 s t r t w t where the resource status depends on the recharge of the aquifer r t and extractions by different users image 1 the depth of the aquifer is represented by the following linear model 7 h i t s t w t h i r Î² s t i w t h i r refers to the distance between saturated thickness and actual water table for municipality i in time t h i r 100 m 500 m Î² represent a conversion factor to transform volume units into height units in this case Î² 3 82 x 10 8 s t refers to the aquifer stock over time initiating in s 0 4 results excel solver functionalities were utilized to run optimization model fig 1 shows a sort of a water stock efficiency gap the forecasted evolution of morroa aquifer stock is shown for the status quo situation and for the groundwater reserves under optimality circumstances the gap measures the groundwater foregone reserves which is a lost valuable opportunity in pursuing sustainable management of aquifer systems a steady widening efficiency gap is observed as the time passes stock decay has implications in water tables water table declination is spatially unevenly distributed municipalities placed over deeper saturated thickness may be benefitted from more productive water spots plan b incorporates differentiations in spatial and underground characteristics of water table in doing this the distance between surface water table h 0 and the distance between water table saturated thickness h r is used in the hydro economic model making this distinction is meaningful since more probably morroa aquifer is characterized as a synclinal one with deeper inclination to the east of sucre carsucre 2003 and in some moment in the future punches over the surface will result unfruitful while in other sites it still will result feasible for the former water sourcing alternatives shall be devised while in the latter there would be water available for them and for closer neighboring municipalities the steeper the h 0 h r index the quicker the water table gets farther from the surface and the quicker it approaches the saturated thickness consequently a steeper h 0 h r index represents a sort of a precipitous declination velocity this issue should not be overlooked if spatial differentiation in water tables is incorporated in groundwater extraction permits analysis assuming a continuous extraction of groundwater for agricultural domestic and industrial purposes this differentiated declination is part of the mode how socio physical interdependence in water consumption is made patent more importantly this spatial differentiation is crucial in understanding sustainability of groundwater resources if equitable water distribution is intended by environmental authorities extraction permits petitions by sparsely distributed water users should be consistent with the users needs and their water accessibility according to fig 2 at 20th year in sincelejo water table declination velocity from the surface would be 2 times quicker than the speed at which the saturated thickness is approached this speed relationship is fewer in morroa and corozal since declination speed is half and a third respect to sincelejo for sampuÃ©s los palmitos and ovejas municipalities the relationships are different the speed at which water table approaches the bottommost of the aquifer is quicker than it gets distant from the surface differences in declination speed have social implications as well water users are more interested in how many meters the aquifer static level is the feasibility of water extraction depends on how much building maintaining and operating a borehole cost a water user might be ignorant on different hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifer system notwithstanding the static level depth is uppermost in water users minds because it is closer to the price per meter that he she has paid to get waterwells built in order to avoid observed steady declinations in aquifer stock and water tables in status quo situation optimal extraction rates are suggested especially to agricultural users in fig 3 extraction paths for three staple crops are presented differences in optimal extraction rates are explained by the fact that different maximum efficiency of water use are obtained per crop following mercado et al 2014 trout and dejonge 2017 yao and gouÃ© 1992 maize gets a maximum at 4 m3 of water applied per hectare and at 108 m3 of water yucca crops reach a maximum in water use efficiency this is consistent with the fact cassava crops adapt well to water deficit de tafur et al 1998 and contrarily maize crops are sensitive to water stress steduto et al 2012 consequently at the margin yucca crops appear to be more nurtured with each water unit applied in comparison with maize crops optimal extraction in m 3 day hectare for the first year for maize yucca and yam producers correspond to 0 93 m3 3 8 m3 and 3 m3 for yam producers respectively on a daily or monthly basis this water volume might be unevenly distributed in rainy seasons less water would be abstracted from the underground while in the dry season a greater volume could be extracted for irrigating crops these water volumes per day per hectare might be used as policy instruments aimed at promoting efficiency extraction caps consequently a serious institutional setting to progressively make this water abstraction caps as part of sustainability action shall be looked for municipalities and farms lying over the less deep saturated thickness zones are demanded to be more productive in terms of water use efficiency conversely in case of business as usual scheme of water extractions continuing some projections are made in terms the effect of simultaneous punches over the surface by the action of neighbor municipalities five steps are included in these projections as shown in ilustration 1 1 actual well depth are based on carsucre 2003 2015 contralorÃ­a general departamental de sucre 2013 2014 contralorÃ­a municipal de sincelejo 2017 2 since population tend to increase and water table continue to decline new or deeper punches are expected from different municipalities relying on morroa aquifer system corozal and sincelejo are the ones suffering greater extractions since they concentrate most of departmental population 3 water table declination conformation of cones of depression would probably lead to punches made on close aquifer spots 4 the evolution of water table is based on h it s t w t h ir Î² s t i w t water stock s t incorporates the influence of multiple neighbor municipalities exercising extractions 5 extraction costs are projected for deepening water tables two municipalities are presented as an example for the way how additional extraction costs might spread over municipal water users namely domestic and agricultural producers alternatively in case of prohibitive extraction costs as shown in ilustration 1 municipalities might start to think of distant water sources such as other aquifers in sucre department in this case six municipalities sincelejo morroa corozal los palmitos sampuÃ©s and ovejas might need to invest financial resources to build new boreholes over tolu viejo aquifer and golfo de morrosquillo in the north west or la mojana aquifer in the south however these alternatives might result unfeasible for low income farmers and households since bringing water from 35 km or 43 km far see map 2 undoubtedly add transportation costs to extraction costs instead of costly alternatives shown in map 2 three scenarios are introduced to provide useful options for municipalities interested in finding sustainable options in managing scarcer groundwater under the pressing forces of climate change different scenarios configure the research results gradual changes are incorporated in the presented alternatives which are aimed at improving the efficiency of water supply and demand management large leaps in expected efficient supply management enhancement may result inconsistent within the contexts of developing countries where many financial and cultural challenges in water conservation overflow climate variability would be driven by forecasted reductions in precipitations in the area of sucre and the caribbean ideam et al 2017 and consequently scant recharge rates are expected for all scenarios consequently reductions in water volumes extracted and efficient use is demanded 4 1 scenario 0 status quo keeping water losses and increasing water stock efficiency gap if water users may keep actual water consumption behaviors water companies are asked to increase supply more water wells are punched in order to match population increase and non accounted water is taken as normal or part of the working social norms in place technical and commercial losses surround 50 of all water distributed from freshwater treatment plants reduced precipitations are assumed two key characteristics of this scenario are presented as follows o non accounted water losses surround 50 o wastewater is discharged to different creeks without any previous treatment to reduce chemical or biological load following ilustration 2 in this scenario a total extraction volume of 187 4 million m3 for next 20 years might be expected agricultural activities contribute with 43 while potable water production plants would extract more than 50 of this volume and 53 of the latter would get wasted due to technical and commercial losses circular analysis of water use in sucre is limited since wastewater treatment plants are practically inexistent see section 3 1 above in the status quo situation for the next 5 years between 2021 and 2030 there is a potential of 67 million m3 of wastewater been generated business as usual this volume in turn would be discharged to different creeks that cross the municipalities in circular economy terms this would be a degenerative and damaging by design process 4 2 scenario 1 audacious steps in the right direction increasing water use efficiency it focusses on maintaining the actual water supply capacity and progressive reductions of water losses groundwater outflows are carefully planned and relevant hydrogeological variables are monitored water volume outflows are treated as a valuable resource object of a circular logic by design special attention is paid to the urgent need to guarantee environmental flow requirements for ecosystems relying on surface water more specifically elements and assumptions shaping scenario 1 are presented as follows see ilustrations 3 and 4 o steady reductions of water losses between 5 and 10 per year for 10 years o wastewater treatment plants are built and operated o a halt shall be made in collecting water from ponds and marshlands and surface water is left for environmental flow requirement o public private investments in switching to more efficient irrigation techniques is demanded o adaptation measures to tackle scarcity are put in place e g rainwater harvesting sharing excess of water among farmers 67 million m3 of wastewater been generated in the status quo situation might be put to beneficial use a high potential in finding new sources of water for agricultural activities exists notwithstanding this potential would not straightforwardly be achieved audacious efforts materialized in financial investments must be exerted political resolution is demanded as a prerequisite to get waste water treatment plants built and put under operation similarly modifications in the distribution of municipal sewage water networks are needed since in the actual design the deployed ends of pipes discharge sewage water in the different creeks crossing sucre municipalities whether intended to circulation or not in the economy waste water flowing different creeks must get chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod reduced to levels that do not get riparian ecosystems impaired 4 3 scenario 2 stringent and feasible but urgent efficiency circularity it entails a reduction in water volumes extracted from morroa aquifer and progressively focusses on asking water users to reduce water consumption as much as possible to more efficient levels see ilustration 4 this scenario specifically includes o water treated in wastewater treatment plants circulated for agricultural purposes o halting the collection of water from ponds and marshlands and surface water is left for efr o reuse and recirculate water treated at industrial plants o adaptation measures to tackle scarcity are put in place rainwater harvesting sharing excess of water among farmers switching to more efficient irrigation techniques o a serious water conservation policy is put in place o autonomously devised cultural practices around cpr conservation are embedded among different communities respect to status quo situation a 22 of efficiency might be achieved in the next 20 years if an efficient and circular management model is endeavored multiple gains would be harvested for the benefit of water users and ecosystems relying on aquifers increased efficiency is mostly driven by 30 million m3 stemming from sewage water treatment water recirculated in agriculture would prevent aquifer extraction for agricultural activities 5 discussion actual models of water supply planning are based on isolated extraction activities by different water utilities and individual water users in the caribbean region of colombia since the intended or unintended competition for water resources is made patent in water table declination this would not avoid egoistic attitudes in extractions to continue therefore public municipal water managers may play a key role in activating regional and interdependent water supply planning for this aim awareness on common pool resource character of aquifer and hydrogeological conditions of shared aquifer systems are needed cpr character is not overtly incorporated in existing hydro economic models such as pulido velazquez et al 2016 srinivasan et al 2010 zhu et al 2015 existing hydro economic models incorporate utility consumer reservoirs groundwater tanker modules from a systemic approach srinivasan et al 2010 water conservation concern and options for extensions of infrastructure taking account of operational allocations under variable water availability rosenberg et al 2008 water supply state along the river system and the water demands by the various sectors using water resource ringler et al 2004 notwithstanding the common pool resource cpr nature of water resources especially groundwater are not observed in the extant analysis i suggest that ignoring the cpr character of aquifer and surface water systems may put long term water planning under risk since one municipality might be confident of expected water stocks while other competing municipalities and other users may accelerate extractions and running aquifer water table far from feasible access thus water supply planning for neighboring municipalities should no longer be performed in isolation but at a regional scale in which cpr character of water sources is incorporated collective planning demands a shifting in status quo among planners and users extant model of water planners role dedicated to match supply with demand represent the plan a conversely a plan b demands to introspective analysis in terms of how efficient the water consumption is key issue for efficiency analysis entails questioning to what extent the capacity of water applied to the agricultural and industrial processes is utilized to apprehend the maximum potential of water consumed efficiency and circularity might be sound criteria for sustainable regional water management for instance given actual degenerative situation of extant waste water management rooms for improvement exits for turning to regenerative by design waste water management waste water discharged to different surface water bodies do not fit into the definition of efficiency efficient water use refers to reaping the maximum benefit of each cubic meter of water waste water has a continued potential in water applications to agricultural and industrial processes however waste water treatment plants deployed over sucre are basically inexistent and political resolution might be a must since public goods such as water quality remains on public entities charge opportunities exist for associated water users endeavoring in investing in treatment plants as well to reduce the pressure on the aquifer morroa aquifer demand special attention since declination speed is threatening the aquifer stocks for the future new governance schemes led by extraction caps might help in groundwater conservation an area that can affect both water demand and supply is conservation conservation can reduce demand for a particular use enabling the saved water to be allocated to other uses in order to accomplish this water conservation measures need to be less expensive than the cost of the water saved booker et al 2012 similarly efficiency and common pool rationale should replace actual independent water planning and the collective thinking should be sparked from dared entrepreneurs interested in conservation and limiting extractions an alternative governance scheme led by extraction caps may be part of the urgent transition towards regenerative thinking and action and efficient water consumption in groundwater dependent regions quantitative data on optimal extraction rates may support decision making in extant institutional settings existing rules and institutions in groundwater governance systems should open the door to utilizing quantitative inputs due to the declining and exhaustible nature of groundwater resources however due to different sources of uncertainty the definition of optimal extraction rates should be cautiously prescribed as stated in burt 1964 noel and howitt 1982 provencher and burt 1994a this is optimal extraction paths for long horizons such as 70 80 or 90 years may result impractical due to that a lot of environmental alterations may occur and water users may shift extraction behaviors in the long term instead cautious and iterative calibrations of optimal extraction levels might be implemented we may refer to prescribing optimal rates for 35 or 50 years without take no notice of future generations a 50 years time horizon does not mean wittingly making aquifer depleted in 50 years instead as new data on hydrogeological conditions influencing water stocks and flows are produced updated optimal extraction rates might be calibrated for the subsequent 50 years this iterative process should always be performed under the limits of state variables such as exploitable stocks and similarly imposing constraints of abstractions to minimum stocks minimum levels of reserves may act as a precautionary principle long term perspective is needed while devising cautious short term water supply planning since traditional water supply forecast use to simply match demand with supply there exists an inertial supply management scheme in which water managers just rush for satisfying the demand in the politics of water planning water managers are told to bring abundant water to all who demand it zetland 2011 however business as usual water demand projections data tend to hide bad habits in water consumption degenerative waste water management inefficient water application to agricultural and industries and spendthrift attitudes instead inefficient and damaging water consumption customs should be overtly recognized and disclosed once stakeholders become aware of caveats risks detrimental actions and opportunities rooms for improvement should collectively be built based on efficiency and circularity principles circular economy of water should be a compulsory criterion for water supply and demand forecast in doing this different users would use reuse and recirculate water which in turn would reduce water demanded it does not only refer to an instrumental shift in water consumption but an awareness based shift towards sustainability a long term shift would imply a change in water use paradigm water should be utilized not as a simple input for agricultural domestic or industrial activities but as a valuable natural entity serving nature as well a circular and efficient model would be a cost effective strategy for climate variability adaptation otherwise since declinations in precipitations are expected up to 2100 ideam et al 2017 a deeper water table would place higher pressures on alternative water sources unless water users are willing to collect water around 1 km deeper well depths for differentiated water users will demand serious discussions on justice in water access rising water tables and rising energy costs would impose financial burdens on low income households and farmers conceivably further water tables might trigger new reconfigurations of livelihoods location and new punches over surface would be developed as trends on increasing urban sprawls have been observed relocations in urban areas shall be convenient reasons for rethinking the prevailing water supply planning scheme a new water governance deal led by extraction caps shall be needed a plan b water assessment applied to each municipalities and corresponding neighbors would be needed as an integrative model aimed at providing inputs for water resources planning in which the depletable and common pool character of aquifers is incorporated 6 conclusion this research was aimed at integrating the common pool resource and depletable character of aquifers in municipal water supply planning efficiency and circularity of water in the economy were two criteria used for seek sustainable consumption of water the term water productivity is kept when respective authors use it however the concept on water use efficiency is utilized in this research a hydro economic model was built it incorporates an optimization model aimed at calculating maximum efficiency in water applied to crops cultivated in the region of analysis optimal levels of extraction pretend to reap the maximum benefit of drops applied to three main crops namely yucca maize and yam optimal extraction was compared to status quo situation and an efficiency gap was found in more stringent scenario for the conceivable future an efficiency gain of 22 in water saved for the economy in actual situation there seems to be a degenerative by design waste water management since these waters are discharged directly to creeks crossing sucre territory reducing water pollution is urgent and beneficial since enhancement of surface water ecosystems is a must instead of discharging to surface water bodies recirculation of treated water in agricultural and industrial activities would reduce the pressures on aquifer in the order of 30 million m 3 this reduction would stem from sewage water treatment plants for the next 20 years in case they are built and operated hydro economic models entails different steps knowledge of waterwells location and the understanding of hydrogeology of aquifers are binding pre requisites the model presented in this research may result relevant for other contexts of declining aquifer systems as well overarching conceptual setting refers to the fact that in the foreseeable future neighbor municipalities interested in water extractions to supply water for different users might be planning to make punches over concurrent or adjacent surface spots in thinking and doing this some caveats should be made public future water sources do not simply refer to think horizontally but vertically as well this is the finding of new water sources due to water table declination should not only bear in mind horizontal distances in the vicinity of municipalities but the vertical distances to cones of depressions and to the inclination of aquifer systems for this aim a declination speed index is introduced in two senses the surface water table distance and water table saturated thickness distance this issue should not be overlooked if spatial differentiation in water tables is incorporated in groundwater extraction permits analysis declination speed has crucial social implications derived from differentiated extraction costs for users it is estimated that the exacerbation of water table declinations will accelerate the predicted externalities in cpr management an externality arising from the pumping costs and a strategic externality that emerges from the race between resource users to hold the groundwater stocks negri 1989 the economic theory predicts that each individual haste for mining the resource and consuming the majority in the present because the residual stock might not be available to each one in the future hardin 1968 negri 1989 this strategic behavior of competition for groundwater reserves lead to overexploitation of the resource negri 1989 rising awareness on this issue is needed among water planners and environmental authorities and consequently a regional planning might work better in seeking sustainable and equitable groundwater extraction this research applies to contexts of urban water supplied by municipalities that mainly rely on aquifers for freshwater provision and agricultural activities in addition to this private waterwells are built by individual households using electric pumps in urban areas and rural sectors demanding water for irrigation this combination of public and private provision of water is applicable for international contexts such as brazil and paraguay foster et al 2006 india patil k mahadev c bhat g manjunatha 2015 srinivasan et al 2010 mÃ©xico oecd 2015 sandoval 2004 western usa middle east israel oecd 2017b due to steady declinations of water tables inevitably water utilities and individual water users will be gradually forced to explore and exploit new water sources alternatively instead of thinking of searching for new water sources communities water managers and individual water users should make a halt in the inertial behavior of increasing consumption and instead increase efficiency in consumption of current water supply sources will become more mandatory as the climate change exacerbates its effects on water resources similarly a collective planning scheme might put to work since interdependent water extraction is made patent in the presence of externalities and every cubic meter extracted from one municipality may influence the extractions of neighbor municipalities and extraction costs of water as well consequently water users located over more productive spots might be hassle free while others might experience stressful situation due to costly water supply because of rapid water table declination especially in contexts of droughts however referring to regional planning must be treated with caution since the greater the regional scope of analysis the more complex and entangled the analysis might be notwithstanding water planners should make a halt in the inertial style of simply exploring how deep the waterwells could be exploited instead a reflexive interdisciplinary plan for efficient and sustainable use of existing and new water sources should be done for the foreseeable future 6 1 limitations location of every single water user was not possible at all however data for main water user was collected through different sources data for water consumed at industry level were scarce as well water quality issues were not fully discussed either which may indeed affect extraction volumes for all the activities due to actual covid 19 pandemic situation some additional data collection and pilot tests activities were not possible declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper annexes annex 1 a general overview of the region s water resources glancing at the hydrologic map of sucre colombia we may have a mixed impression in terms of water distribution six watersheds encompass the whole department some basins are shared with environmental authorities of other regions different from sucre northern basins correspond to different streams such as san antonio matatigre enmedio palmar el tigre cascajo y pechilÃ­n which mostly drain its waters to caribbean sea these are mostly seasonal streams since they use to run water flows during rainy seasons lasting for less than 3 months a year listed streams run over municipalities of sampuÃ©s sincelejo morroa corozal los palmitos and ovejas another basin is distributed over the middle part of the department it runs in direction northwest to southeast draining waters to some swamplands and san jorge river available surface water supply in the shared watersheds in the northern part in rainy years correspond to 1714 million m3 and it drops to 429 million m3 in drier years for low san jorge la mojana watershed water supply is much higher since it sums up to 11 932 million m3 for humid years and drops to 3068 million m3 in dry seasons carsucre 2018 however most water supply in sucre is provided by groundwater sources aquifer systems in sucre are represented in map 1 morroa

11893,most rivers in developing countries are facing water contamination problem therefore saving water quality by complying with the industrial drinking and agricultural allowable standard limits has been difficult this study aims to assess shatt al kufa water quality as one branch of the euphrates river by calculating three types of water quality indices in two cases excluding and including the phosphate po4 consentration as it was the parameter that most met the standard the used water quality indices are the weight arithmetic water quality index wawqi the canadian council of ministers of the environment water quality index ccmewqi and the oregon water quality index owqi fifteen parameters were analyzed including ph value biological oxygen demand turbidity total hardness orthophosphate sulphate nitrate alkalinity potassium sodium magnesium chloride dissolved oxygen calcium and total dissolved solids the results show that the average wawqi for three stations including po4 were 33 79 43 75 and 37 62 which is good water however in excluding po4 the water quality was characterized as very poor depending on the resulting values 86 62 88 86 and 91 91 respectively the ccmewqi values for three stations were 63 83 60 40 and 55 69 including po4 so the water quality was fair and marginal according to owqi the water quality for three stations was very poor in two cases since the owqi

index owqi owqi creates a score to evaluate general water quality the original owqi was designed after the nsfwqi where the delphi method was used for variable selection it expresses water quality status and trends for the legislatively mandated water quality status assessment the index is free from the arbitration in weighting the parameters and employs the concept of harmonic averaging the mathematical expression of this wqi method is given by eq 12 soumaila et al 2019 12 w q i n i 1 n 1 s i i 2 where n number of subindices si subindex of ith parameter nsi the water quality rating sub indexes calculation was based on best fit formulas to each parameter rating curve used to calculate the aggregated index al shujairi 2013 cude 2001 nasirian 2007 five categories have been suggested to categorize the water qualities for wawqi and ccmewqi summarized in table 2 5 results and discussion 5 1 water quality indices table 3 shows the concentration of the parameters used in the indices calculation from a comparison of the concentration of the parameter with the permissible limits for irrigation purpose it is evident that all studied parameters complied with iraqi irrigation acceptable standard except for turbidity hardness calcium magnesium and sulphate the turbidity is an expression of an optical property its average annual values at al kufa al manathera and al abbassia stations were 7 95 8 09 and 7 97 ntu respectively which is higher than the permissible value 5 ntu due to the presence of suspended particles in water through the scattering of light various suspended and colloidal materials such as silt clay microorganisms and finely dissolved organic and inorganic matter are responsible for water turbidity the annual average t h values at al kufa al manathera and al abbassia stations were 556 534 and 597 mg l respectively as indicated it is higher than the allowable irrigation limit of 100 mg l this may be attributed to geological formations with which it has been in contact it is also affected by the concentration of calcium ca and magnesium mg which were also higher than irrigation allowable limits of 100 and 20 mg l at all stations the high concentration of dissolved ca and to a lesser extent mg in water generally represented as the equivalent amount of caco3 and as a result increase hardness this higher unagreement with the allowable limits will cause an increased effect on k and wi value and as a result on wawqi value sulphate annual average concentration so4 2 was 397 613 and 344 mg l at al kufa al manathera and al abbassia stations respectively which are higher than the allowable limits 200 mg l this reflects the effect of industrial and municipal wastewater discharge near the stations and agricultural land from leaves fall in the river on the riversides in addition to natural sources like components dissolved in the rain as shown previously in water quality indices calculation the effect of the extent to which parameters concentration complying with allowable limits was involved especially in wawqi calculation therefore in this study the impact of phosphate on indices value was studied since it is the most parameter agree with allowable limits by comparing the concentration of the phosphate with the irrigation standards for all stations the phosphate percent agreement at al kufa al manathera and al abbassia stations were 0 125 0 253 and 0 162 respectively fig 4 and table 3 phosphorus is existing in inorganic forms such as phosphates and the major sources of it were detergents domestic sewage fertilizers and industrial wastewater phosphates are not toxic in nature to people or animals unless they are present in very high levels so it is possible to test its effect on water quality indices especially the indices that depend on weight wawqi ccmewqi and owqi were calculated with including and excluding phosphates concentration to obtain high standards agreement effect as shown in table 4 and figs 5 7 the wawqi values at al kufa al manathera and al abbassia stations was 33 79 43 75 and 37 62 respectively involving po4 2 concentration in this case the water quality at three stations is characterized as good since these wawqi between 26 and 50 with the phosphates exception case water quality is classified as very poor as the wawqi values at al kufa al manathera and al abbassia stations was 88 62 88 86 and 91 91 respectively which is between 75 and 100 this high change in two cases might be attributed to the wawqi calculation assumption and methodology which involve how much the parameters comply with standard by wi k calculation it was noticed that the water quality was not largely changed with the phosphates exception in ccmewqi calculation case with phosphate effect ccmewqi values at al kufa al manathera and al abbassia stations was 63 83 60 40 and 55 96 respectively thus water quality characterized as fair and marginal ccmewqi values without po4 2 effect was 61 53 57 89 and 52 74 at al kufa al manathera and al abbassia stations respectively so water quality characterized also as fair and marginal this may be attributed to the ccmewqi calculation equation not assigning any weighting factors assumptions and methodology take only the parameters that do not conform with the permissible limit in contrast with wawqi consider the extent to which each parameter matches or does not match the allowable limit as illustrate in k and wi calculation for owqi the computed values excluding and including po4 were between 0 59 for all stations this implies that the water is generally very poor and there are no differences between the two cases since the sub index does not depend on the standard parameters meeting this model eliminates the use of weight factors for the parameters when the weight factors are used in the model the parameter with a high statistical weight may significantly influence the water quality index even if it has a low degree impairment

one parameter is associated with a corresponding increase or decrease in the other values the correlation is positive when the increase in one parameter causes the increase in the other parameters it is negative when an increase in one parameter causes a decrease in the other parameter correlation analysis is a preliminary descriptive technique to estimate the degree of association among the variables involved this feature can help support the validity of the bonded parameters contribution to the water quality index shil et al 2019 pearson s correlation was used to reach a more analytical degree to recognize the relationship between every two parameters and the results for the three stations are presented in tables 5 7 the analysis appeared with bold text the conjunction between different parameters total hardness with total dissolved solid was noticed as two bonded parameters due to the hardness function in the water on dissolved ca ion this could be supported by the bonded between the tds and ca in the results islam et al 2016 the other ion na also had a good relation with tds as it dissolved ion however the two ions na and ca also appeared in good links as they founded in the same media 6 conclusion in this study wqi method was applied to assess the water quality in shatt al kufa river three water quality indices were computed twice including and excluding the phosphates in the water the results show that the phosphate was more in compliance with the standard and thus effect wawqi value calculated in case of its inclusion and exclusion and the water was rated as good and very poor water quality respectively however in case of using ccmewqi the phosphates exception does not largely change the water quality which is either fair or marginal for owqi the river is characterized as very poor in the two cases there are no differences between the two inclusion and exclusion cases since the sub index does not depend on meeting standard parameters finally the difference in water quality with and without phosphate inclusion may be attributed to the dependency of indexes on the parameter s weight and importance moreover pearson correlation in the three stations revealed a good correlation between most parameters especially total hardness and total dissolved solids with salts this supports the validity of the bonded parameters contribute to the water

acceptable standard except for turbidity hardness calcium magnesium and sulphate the turbidity is an expression of an optical property its average annual values at al kufa al manathera and al abbassia stations were 7 95 8 09 and 7 97 ntu respectively which is higher than the permissible value 5 ntu due to the presence of suspended particles in water through the scattering of light various suspended and colloidal materials such as silt clay microorganisms and finely dissolved organic and inorganic matter are responsible for water turbidity the annual average t h values at al kufa al manathera and al abbassia stations were 556 534 and 597 mg l respectively as indicated it is higher than the allowable irrigation limit of 100 mg l this may be attributed to geological formations with which it has been in contact it is also affected by the concentration of calcium ca and magnesium mg which were also higher than irrigation allowable limits of 100 and 20 mg l at all stations the high concentration of dissolved ca and to a lesser extent mg in water generally represented as the equivalent amount of caco3 and as a result increase hardness this higher unagreement with the allowable limits will cause an increased effect on k and wi value and as a result on wawqi value sulphate annual average concentration so4 2 was 397 613 and 344 mg l at al kufa al manathera and al abbassia stations respectively which are higher than the allowable limits 200 mg l this reflects the effect of industrial and municipal wastewater discharge near the stations and agricultural land from leaves fall in the river on the riversides in addition to natural sources like components dissolved in the rain as shown previously in water quality indices calculation the effect of the extent to which parameters concentration complying with allowable limits was involved especially in wawqi calculation therefore in this study the impact of phosphate on indices value was studied since it is the most parameter agree with allowable limits by comparing the concentration of the phosphate with the irrigation standards for all stations the phosphate percent agreement at al kufa al manathera and al abbassia stations were 0 125 0 253 and 0 162 respectively fig 4 and table 3 phosphorus is existing in inorganic forms such as phosphates and the major sources of it were detergents domestic sewage fertilizers and industrial wastewater phosphates are not toxic in nature to people or animals unless they are present in very high levels so it is possible to test its effect on water quality indices especially the indices that depend on weight wawqi ccmewqi and owqi were calculated with including and excluding phosphates concentration to obtain high standards agreement effect as shown in table 4 and figs 5 7 the wawqi values at al kufa al manathera and al abbassia stations was 33 79 43 75 and 37 62 respectively involving po4 2 concentration in this case the water quality at three stations is

ccmewqi values at al kufa al manathera and al abbassia stations was 63 83 60 40 and 55 96 respectively thus water quality characterized as fair and marginal ccmewqi values without po4 2 effect was 61 53 57 89 and 52 74 at al kufa al manathera and al abbassia stations respectively so water quality characterized also as fair and marginal this may be attributed to the ccmewqi calculation equation not assigning any weighting factors assumptions and methodology take only the parameters that do not conform with the permissible limit in contrast with wawqi consider the extent to which each parameter matches or does not match the allowable limit as illustrate in k and wi calculation for owqi the computed values excluding and including po4 were between 0 59 for all stations this implies that the water is generally very poor and there are no differences between the two cases since the sub index does not depend on the standard parameters meeting this model eliminates the use of weight factors

to enhance adsorption properties of produced bc while avoiding such digestive effects hence the presented study has focused on pre modification of lasia spinosa kohila bc by using nitric acid to improve its sorption capacity towards removal of methylene blue mb raw and pre modified bc abbreviated as rbc and pmbc respectively were produced at three different temperatures 300 500 and 700 c highest capacities were obtained for 300 c produced bc abbreviated as r300 and pm300 respectively the experimental data was best fitted to sips isotherm model with a maximum sips capacity of 9 58 mg g and 81 35 mg g at 30 c for r300 and pm300 respectively the enhanced capacity of pm300 could be attributed to the increased surface functionality and the reduced pore size which resulted in a feasible adsorptive removal of mb xps results showed a slight increase in nitrogen containing groups upon modification the adsorption kinetics accurately described the pseudo first order pfo behavior of pm300 and pseudo second order pso behavior of r300 the mb uptake of pmbc was governed by a pore filling mechanism whereas electrostatic attractions were predominant in the sorption process of rbc both bcs showed a spontaneous endothermic adsorption and the overall rate of the adsorption process was a combination of liquid film diffusion and intra particle diffusion after four cycles of regeneration the dynamic capacity of pmbc remained more than 50 of its initial value which was approximately twice of rbc pre modification caused an eight fold increase in mb adsorption capacity qualifying it to be a

effectiveness and remarkable adsorption properties ahmad et al 2014b the characteristics of bc vary with 1 feedstock selection 2 pyrolysis method 3 production temperature and 4 any value additions performed rajapaksha et al 2014 feedstock should be abundant and inexpensive for large scale industrial applications while the produced adsorbent should have the optimal combination of porosity and surface functionality to adsorb analytes of interest peiris et al 2020 among the numerous pyrolysis techniques slow pyrolysis is frequently used to produce bc due to its low cost and simplicity low temperature produced bcs are generally abundant in oxygenated and nitrogenated surface functional groups sfgs whereas high temperature produced bc is predominantly composed of arene functionalized surfaces even though bc production has been reported using various feedstocks there are many feasible novel feedstocks still available for experimentation depending on the feedstock type and the pyrolysis conditions of different bcs their adsorption capacities for an adsorbate of interest can be varied therefore value additions are incorporated to the pristine bc to enhance the adsorption efficiency of the bc for a given adsorbate s value addition of bc through physical or chemical treatments can 1 introduce new binding sites or alter existing binding sites 2 remove trapped constituents through demineralization and 3 disrupt pore walls to increase pore size yakout et al 2015 despite being a common value addition technique mineral acid post treatment suffers from the drawback of digesting the carbonaceous feedstock wathudura et al 2020 hence acid post treatments can cause a significant mass loss of produced bc making the value added product energetically and economically inefficient in contrast when pre modifications are performed on the feedstock no such loss of produced bc occurs upon treatment thus the energy and cost consumed to produce a unit mass of value added product is less compared to post modification therefore pre modification becomes a more energetically and economically feasible method of value addition lasia spinosa locally known as kohila is a vegetable plant which belongs to the araceae family has a creeping spiny rhizome and is found abundantly in most south asian countries in dumps marshy lands and deserted paddy fields kumar et al 2013 it is effortlessly grown and does not require external fertilizer or pesticides which makes it a suitable dedicated plant for the production of bc the rhizome has a highly porous structure and is a rich source of lignocellulose the first objective in the present study is to produce a novel bc from lasia rhizome to the best of our knowledge this is the first critique that centralizes on the production of bc using lasia the second objective of this study is the value addition of lasia bc through a simple nitric acid pre modification and evaluating the influence of the pre treatment on the adsorptive removal of mb thus the presented work is an attempt to address the void created by insufficient research focus on acid based pre modifications of bc for contaminant removal the findings could help reduce the production cost of value added bc while enabling the acid treatment of feedstock whose bc is readily digested when undergoing post modifications 2 materials and methods analytical grade reagents nitric acid and methanol were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo methylene blue hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide pellets were purchased from sisco research laboratories mumbai india 2 1 production and pre modification of bc lasia rhizomes collected from three different areas in sri lanka s western province wadduwa 6 6363 n 79 9528 e piliyandala 6 8018 n 79 9227 e and ja ela 7 0668 n 79 9041 e were cut into small pieces and sun dried until a constant mass was obtained dried biomass was packed into an airtight metal container and slow pyrolysed at 300 500 and 700 c r300 r500 and r700 for 3 h using a nabertherm gmbh germany muffle furnace at a rate of 7 c min 1 peiris et al 2019a pre modification was carried out by soaking lasia 60 g in a 50 nitric solution 200 ml for 4 h filtered and oven dried followed by pyrolysis to obtain pm300 pm500 and pm700 bc sahin et al 2017 raw bc and pre modified bc will hereafter be abbreviated as rbc and pmbc respectively it is important to note that upon nitric acid post modification a loss in bc yield of over 80 was observed peiris et al 2019 moreover the post modification resulted in a fine powder having a particle size smaller than the sieve size range used in the study 1 0 5 mm 2 2 characterization of bc scanning electron microscopic sem images were obtained from a jeol jsm 6500 f fesem instrument at 5 kv the surface areas of rbc and pmbc were examined using a tristar ii plus 3030 surface area analyzer using co2 bruner emmett teller bet adsorption isotherms the american society for testing and materials astm d2866 94 and d2867 17 methods were used to assess the ash and moisture components of bc respectively the ph drift method described by ferro garcia et al ferro garcia et al 1998 aided in determining the point of zero charge phpzc of all types of bc the total c h o and n content in bc was determined utilizing a ce 440 exeter analytical inc elemental analyzer aromaticity was calculated from h c ratios whereas the o c ratios coupled with the polarity indexes o n c ratios were considered to gauge the bc polarities an abb mb300d fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer switzerland with an attenuated total reflection atr probe was employed to collect atr ftir spectra of the dry bc between 4000 and 750 cm 1 at a resolution of 4 cm 1 employing 64 scans a monochromatic x ray source at 1486 6 ev al kÎ± line attached to a thermo scientific k alpha x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps system was utilized for xps analyses spot size 400 Î¼m2 corresponding to the overall sample s fractal particle surface photoelectrons were amassed from 900 take off angles and evaluated in the constant analyzer energy mode low resolution survey lr spectra and high resolution hr core level spectra were collected at 200 ev and 40 ev pass energies respectively the avantage v5 932 software was employed to analyze de convoluted xps data 2 3 batch sorption studies effect of ph on mb adsorption was evaluated with 20 mg l and 100 mg l of mb for rbc and pmbc under different ph 2 4 6 8 and 10 conditions the adsorption capacity and removal percentage were calculated using the equations adsorption capacity mg g c o c e m v removal percentage c o c e c o 100 where co is the initial mb concentration mg l ce is the equilibrium concentration mg l v is the volume of mb solution l and m is the mass of bc g equilibrium kinetics were assessed at initial concentrations of 100 mg l and 200 mg l of mb solutions for rbc and pmbc respectively at time intervals between 5 min and 3 h the filtrate was analyzed for mb using a uv visible spectrometer u 2910 hitachi tokyo japan at 663 nm pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso models were plotted to determine the chemisorptive and physisorptive nature as well as to evaluate the rates of adsorption to resolve the mechanism which controls the overall rate of the sorption intra particle diffusion model ipd was plotted data was further modeled by boyd external mass transfer and liquid film diffusion models for the further confirmation of the rate determining step boyd et al 1947 batch isotherm studies were carried out at the optimum ph ph 10 with varying mb concentrations ranging from 25 mg l to 250 mg l isotherm experiments were carried out at three different temperatures 293 k 303 k and 313 k to obtain the thermodynamic parameters of the adsorption process van t hoffs equations were used to calculate the gibbs free energy Î´ g enthalpy Î´ h and entropy Î´ s of the adsorption process the equation and the brief description of the van t hoff plot can be found in s4 and s11 respectively 2 4 column regeneration wet bc 2 g was packed into a 12 mm diameter column to a height of about 14 cm and 100 mg l mb solution was passed through the column at a flow rate of 5 ml min eluent of 25 ml portions were collected until its concentration was equivalent to the initial mb concentration desorption was done by passing 5 meoh through the column until washings became colorless and neutral to ph and washed again with di water to remove excess meoh four consecutive cycles were carried out for column studies 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the adsorbents 3 1 1 sem and bet analysis the sem images of feedstock pre treated feedstock r300 and pm300 at resolution 500 and 1000 are shown in figure 1 whereas sem images of r500 r700 pm500 and pm700 are shown in supplementary information s6 scanning electron microscope images provide information about the variations in the morphological changes in feedstock with respect to modification and pyrolysis ahmad et al 2012 2014a as evidenced by the sem images the appearance of porous surface on the pre treated feedstock was observed fig 1a d the high water content of biomass facilitates the production of porous bc during pyrolysis dehydration of the bc creates a porous structure leng et al 2020 fig 1 e and f however pm300 exhibits a heterogeneous structure as depicted in the sem images fig 1 g and h table 1 shows the surface area total pore volume and the average pore size of bc samples suggesting that its surface morphology is greatly influenced by the pyrolysis temperature hung et al 2017 when the pyrolysis temperature increased from 300 to 700 c the bet surface areas of rbc and pmbc sharply increased from 37 60 to 234 93 m2 g and from 85 12 to 207 60 m2 g respectively this could be ascribed to the loss of volatile organic compounds at higher temperatures and formation of more pores chowdhury et al 2016 the average pore size indicated that micropores predominate both rbc and pmbc average bc pore size is reduced after modification this can be attributed to the fixation of oxygen and nitrogen containing groups to pore walls thus converting mesopores to micropores yakout et al 2015 3 1 2 proximate analysis ash content decreased by 21 for rbc and 15 for pmbc when the pyrolysis temperature increased from 300 to 500 c however upon further increase of pyrolysis temperature to 700 c the ash content increased by 57 for rbc and 53 for pmbc table 1 a possible reason for the above observation could be the progressive concentration of minerals which could happen in two ways firstly the reduction of lignocellulosic matters through destructive volatilization secondly the partial de volatilization of produced inorganic oxides due to increase of temperature rafiq et al 2016 tsai et al 2012 yield decreased by approximately 23 for rbc 49 6 37 9 and 32 for pmbc 46 9 31 9 with increasing pyrolysis temperature 300 700 c the increased thermal degradation that takes place at elevated temperatures is held accountable for the decrease in yield observed demirbas 2004 hernandez mena et al 2014 the phpzc rose with increasing pyrolysis temperature and the corresponding values of all six bcs were in the range of 8 5 11 5 banik et al 2018 overall rbc and pmbc showed no significant change in yield ash and moisture contents when prepared at identical pyrolysis temperatures 3 1 3 elemental composition carbon content table 1 increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature by 51 36 76 32 and 87 09 for r300 r500 and r700 respectively compared to c in the feedstock this is due to the dehydration and depolymerization of plant biomass with increasing pyrolysis temperature resulting in the graphitization of c into organized layers ahmad et al 2012 chen et al 2008 the same pattern was observed for pmbc indicating higher carbonization at elevated temperatures however the c content in pmbc was lower than that of rbc which could be due to the erosive effect of nitric acid on carbon structures as reported in literature li et al 2014 a higher o content was obtained for pmbcs compared to rbc due to the production of oxygenated surface functional groups o sfgs upon nitric acid modification increased n content was significant in pmbcs from the formation of nitrogen containing groups or irreversible adsorption of nitrate ions shi et al 2014 however elemental n decreased in bcs with increasing carbonization temperature as the decomposition temperature of n is reported to be 200 c laird et al 2010 elemental h c and o c ratios were calculated to determine the aromaticity index and polarity respectively molar h c ratios decreased gradually from 0 93 to 0 32 in rbc and from 0 86 to 0 35 in pmbc when the pyrolysis temperature increased from 300 to 700 c lower h c ratios provides evidence to the extension of aromatic conjugation during the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to bc de jesus et al 2017 kim et al 2012 the molar o c ratios and molar o n c ratios of both rbc and pmbc tends to decrease with increasing carbonization temperature indicating higher aromaticity and lower polarity with an increase in pyrolysis temperature from 300 to 700 c the o c ratios decreased from 0 24 to 0 03 for rbc and from 0 88 to 0 12 for pmbc it is important to note that even though o c ratios of rbc and pmbc decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature o c of pmbc was greater than rbc when a particular temperature was considered lower polarity is due to de oxygenation at high temperature produced bcs ahmad et al 2012 3 1 4 ftir analysis fourier transform infrared ftir analysis was performed on rbc and pmbc to identify bc sfgs the spectra obtained for r300 r500 and r700 are depicted in s7 a a gradual decrease in sfg densities at higher temperatures could be due to the dehydration of cellulosic and ligneous contents and degradation of organic matter peiris et al 2019a spectra obtained for pm300 pm500 and pm700 are presented in s7 b reduced peak intensities were observed for both rbc and pmbc with increasing pyrolysis temperatures a comparison between ir spectra of r300 and pm300 is shown in fig 2 remarkable changes in spectra were observed upon modification two intense peaks observed at 1369 cm 1 and 1569 cm 1 were assigned to n o symmetric and n o asymmetric stretching respectively gokce and aktas 2014 a broad peak at 3100 3500 cm 1 corresponds to the o h stretching from alcohol groups and the peak at 1045 cm 1 was assigned to the c n stretching of the nitrate groups attached to the arene rings of the char surface 3 1 5 xps analysis the bc modifications or chemical changes were depicted from the xps spectra the o1s c1s and n1s high resolution envelopes were resolved they are listed and assigned in s8 and s1 s3 navarathna et al 2019 in pretreated feedstock co 9 2 15 0 and c o 4 4 8 9 were increased in contrast to the feedstock which is due to partial oxidation of the non aromatic regions in the feedstock s1 the oc oh r atomic percentage was higher in pretreated feedstock 4 3 versus the feedstock 1 7 however the carbonate content declined from 8 2 to 5 4 likely due to the dissolution of metal carbonates in nitric acid carbonyl co dropped from 21 4 to 15 2 however c o c n increased from 14 6 to 19 6 likely due to nitration the percentage of c c cc c h groups dropped from 23 to 18 2 indicating that surface oxidation takes place upon pre treatment the low temperature produced bc r300 showed a slight decrease in oc oh r co3 2 from 5 4 to 3 5 compared to the feedstock thus indicating decarboxylation however nitro and nitroxy percentages remained unchanged 2 6 after pyrolysis at 300 c at higher pyrolytic temperatures they decreased to 0 8 and 0 6 respectively s2 carboxylic percentage also decreased slightly 2 2 at 700 c upon pyrolysis of feedstock at 300 c the carbonyl groups showed a dramatic drop from 21 4 to 12 0 and further drops to 6 3 and 7 3 at 500 c and 700 c respectively due to decarboxylation the c c c c and c h groups showed a slight decrease from 23 to 20 2 at 300 c then increased to 50 4 and 63 3 at 500 c and 700 c respectively suggesting an increase in aromaticity and hydrophobicity pyridonic n declined from 1 0 feedstock to 0 8 0 8 and 0 6 respectively at 300 c 500 c and 700 c pyridinic n was only detected in high temperature pyrolysed char 500 c 0 3 and 700 c 0 7 which is evident for an increase in aromaticity and is consistent with c1s hr xps pyrolysis of feedstock at 300 c and higher temperatures further reduced the nitro and nitroxy quaternary n pm300 showed a slight increase in nitro or nitroso 4 3 groups s3 as compared to the feedstocks and their raw analogues when the temperature increased from 500 c to 700 c the percentage increased to 6 1 and dropped to 5 carboxyls carbonates were increased with increasing temperature 3 4 at 300 c 5 9 500 c and 10 8 700 c carbonyl groups showed a dramatic drop from 15 2 to 7 7 at 300 c further decreased to 4 7 500 c and 4 5 700 c the c o and c n groups decreased from 19 3 to 14 8 300 c and 14 4 500 c and 12 4 700 c respectively in contrast c c cc and c h groups showed an increase from 18 2 to 29 2 at 300 c and a further increase to 37 6 at 500 c and a decrease to 31 6 at 700 c due to the increase in aromaticity liu et al 2018 peiris et al 2019 it should be noted that xps data should be considered approximate 10 100 Ã¥ penetration and 400 Î¼m2 spot size and may not represent the bulk composition 3 2 proposed reaction schemes upon the pre modification process of feedstock nitric acid mainly acts as an oxidizing agent the possible reactions that could take place during the pre modification of lignocellulose rich biomass with nitric acid is shown in figure 3 fig 3 a illustrates the oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols to carboxylic acids a to a and ketones b to b the second reaction fig 3b is a demethylation followed by oxidation khabarov et al 2016 furthermore nitrogen containing groups can also be induced upon pre modification el hendawy 2003 peiris et al 2019a yakout et al 2015 3 3 effect of solution ph solution ph is a prime factor affecting the adsorption process because it can change the adsorbent surface charge and affect adsorbate ionization liu et al 2012 fig 4 a and b shows the effect of ph on the adsorption capacity of rbc and pmbc which were produced at three different temperatures 300 500 and 700 c the mb can exist in solutions in the cationic mb or undissociated form mb0 fig 4 c the predominant species at ph 3 is mb0 while both forms exist in equal concentrations when ph pka 3 8 and mb dominates at ph greater than 6 salazar rabago et al 2017 for batch adsorption with r300 the capacity was lowest at ph 2 relatively constant at ph 4 6 and 8 before increasing at ph 10 the minimal capacity observed at ph 2 could be due to the competition between the hydronium ions and mb for the same binding sites fan et al 2016 shi et al 2014 constant capacities over the ph range of 4 8 could be due to hydrogen bonding between the phenolic groups on the bc surface and mb molecules additionally Ï€ Ï€ electron donor acceptor eda interactions between the Ï€ accepting arene rings of mb and Ï€ donating arene rings of bc might have been a possible contributor to the stable capacities shown the maximum sorption capacity at ph 10 is due to the bc surface becoming negatively charged at ph above the phpzc 9 5 causing the electron density to increase resulting in strong electrostatic attractions with the positively charged amine moiety of mb ions doÄŸan et al 2004 2009 wang et al 2005 moreover cation Ï€ bonding Ï€ Ï€ eda interactions can occur between the positively charged n atom of mb and arene rings of bc it is also important to note that the h bonding between the mb molecules and phenolic groups pka 10 3 13 0 of bc can also be responsible for the adsorption a cumulative contribution of the aforementioned mechanisms enhance the adsorption capacity at higher ph similar observations were reported for mb adsorption on mixed sewage sludge and tea waste bc ball milled sugarcane bagasse bc and tea waste bc fan et al 2016 lyu et al 2018 uddin et al 2009 even though r500 and r700 followed the same pattern as r300 throughout the ph range studied their sorption capacities were significantly less than that of r300 this could be due to the decrease in polar moieties at higher pyrolysis temperatures which was also evident by the elemental composition and ftir analysis that resulted in reduced electrostatic attractions and hydrogen bonding angÄ±n 2013 kloss et al 2012 moreover it is important to note that there was no significant change in pore sizes of all three rbcs even though r500 and r700 had a higher surface area table 1 pmbc had a different trend varying ph from 2 to 10 mb uptake on pm300 showed nearly constant capacities suggesting the less contribution by o sfgs this phenomenon could be due to several mechanisms pore filling could impact sorption capacity the average pore size of pm300 is 8 6 Ã¥ which is close to the molecular depth dimension of mb 6 1 Ã¥ pelekani and snoeyink 2000 a decrease in pore size upon modification might favor the pore filling mechanism thus allowing mb molecules to enter pores with similar dimensions yakout et al 2015 this result is consistent with that of pelakini et al who used phenolic resin based micro porous activated carbon fibers to determine the influence of pore size distribution on mb adsorption pelekani and snoeyink 2000 moreover the negatively charged oxygen moieties can electrostatically attract the positively charged adsorbate in addition Ï€ Ï€ eda interactions can form between the protonated mb molecules and bc arene rings peiris et al 2020 since pm300 showed stable sorption capacities with varying ph it is concluded that the pore filling mechanisms govern the uptake of mb however an exact mechanism for the gradual decrease in sorption capacities of pm500 and pm700 is obscure pre modified bc showed significant enhancement in sorption capacities in comparison to rbc and it can be concluded that the decrease of pore size upon modification may have contributed to the higher sorption capacities shown by pmbc 3 4 adsorption kinetics taking linear regressions into account all rbc r300 r500 and r700 bc were best fitted into the pso model indicating dominant chemisorptive interactions between the adsorbent and adsorbate in contrast pm300 and pm700 were best fitted into the pfo model confirming the physisorptive process however pm500 was best fitted for the pso model s5 pm300 had the highest rate of reaction compared to r300 indicating faster adsorption s4 first second and third linear portions of a multi linear ipd plot attributes to the surface adsorption ipd and equilibrium respectively the straight lines obtained for ipd plot did not pass through the origin for all the bcs tested concluding that ipd is not the sole rate determining step in the adsorption process s9 and that boundary layer control could be responsible for the observed deviation kavitha and namasivayam 2007 boyd plots were linear but did not pass through the origin indicating that ipd is not the only rate limiting step akkaya and Ã¶zer 2005 banerjee et al 2014 senthil kumar et al 2014 the effective diffusion coefficient di also helps in distinguishing the rate limiting step the calculated di values for different bcs are given in s4 according to sing et al if the di values are in the range of 10 11 10 13 cm2 s 1 then ipd is considered to be the rate limiting step singh et al 2005 calculated di values in the present investigation are in the order of 10 8 10 9 indicating that ipd was not only the rate controlling step of the adsorption process banerjee et al 2014 higher linear regressions 0 88 0 98 obtained for external mass transfer and liquid film diffusion models further confirmed that the overall rate of the adsorption process is dictated by liquid film diffusion therefore it can be concluded that the overall rate of adsorption for both rbc and pmbc is a combination of liquid film diffusion and ipd 3 5 adsorption isotherms the adsorption equilibrium data for mb adsorption on rbc and pmbc were evaluated using two parameter isotherms langmuir and freundlich and three parameter isotherms sips and toth the best fitted model was determined based on the correlation coefficient as shown in table 2 the sips isotherm yields a better fit for both r300 and pm300 bcs with regression coefficients of 0 99 and 0 98 respectively the graphical representations of all isotherm models are presented in supplementary information s10 the sips isotherm is a combination of langmuir and freundlich isotherms thus predicts adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces at lower adsorbate concentration this model reduces to the freundlich model while at high adsorbate concentrations it predicts the langmuir model foo and hameed 2010 gÃ¼nay et al 2007 sips 1948 the sips model adsorption intensity values of both r300 and pm300 were found to be 1 04 and 1 01 respectively this suggests that the adsorption process conforms to langmuir model navarathna et al 2019 the maximum adsorption capacities obtained from the sips model for r300 and pm300 was found to be 9 58 mg g and 81 35 mg g respectively as depicted in fig 4 d the adsorption capacity has increased approximately by eight fold upon pre modification batch sorption experiments were not carried out on the raw feedstock for two reasons firstly the nature of the feedstock is such that it is difficult to obtain bc particles of similar size secondly the low density of the bc particles affects the reliability of the batch sorption experiments 3 6 thermodynamics of adsorption the adsorption of mb on rbc and pmbc was also investigated as a function of temperature to evaluate the enthalpy and entropy changes during adsorption experiments were conducted at temperatures below and above room temperature 293 k 303 k and 313 k as shown for the sips isotherms fig 4 d an increase in temperature resulted in increased sorption capacities for mb on both rbc and pmbc the highest sorption capacity was obtained at 313 k negative values obtained for gibbs free energy shows that the adsorption of mb on both r300 and pm300 was a spontaneous process at the temperature range studied table 2 generally Î´ h values are less than 20 kj mol 1 for a physisorptive process and for chemisorption it lies in the range of 80 200 kj mol 1 it was evident from the enthalpy values that adsorption was a physisorptive process for pm300 as Î´ h values were less than 20 kj mol 1 table 2 li et al 2010 however thermodynamic data did not confirm a chemisorptive process for r300 as the values did not lie in the enthalpy range of 80 200 kj mol 1 suggesting that a definite explanation behind this observation is obscure both r300 and pm300 showed positive values for enthalpy and entropy suggesting that the adsorption process was endothermic and the degree of randomness increased with increase of temperature 3 7 regeneration studies breakthrough capacities for the first cycle were 7 63 mg g and 53 30 mg g for r300 and pm300 respectively which is 79 and 65 of the theoretical batch sorption capacities respectively the capacities decreased over the next four cycles for r300 resulting in 83 60 44 and 24 of the initial column capacity respectively while pm300 showed 73 69 58 and 55 respectively fig 5 a and b regeneration adsorption capacities have shown a gradual decrease with increase in regeneration cycles fig 5c dai et al 2018 when the number of cycles increases the vacant sites available for dye adsorption decreases resulting in reduced adsorption capacities gan et al 2015 wang et al 2015 3 8 proposed mechanisms of adsorption the adsorption of mb on lasia bc is an intricate and complex process the sorption of mb on rbc was influenced by the solution ph whereas the sorption on pmbc was not schematic representations of the possible mechanisms are illustrated in fig 6 the highest adsorption capacity for r300 was observed at ph 10 it can be concluded that three main adsorption mechanisms are responsible for the above observation the first possible mechanism is shown in fig 6 a and is dominant when the ph phpzc 9 5 an increase of net negative charge on a bc surface at high solution ph favors electrostatic interactions between the bc surface and the positively charged adsorbate fig 6 b illustrates cation Ï€ bonding between the positively charged n atom of mb and the arene rings of bc the third possible mechanism is h bonding between the mb molecules and phenolic groups of bc fig 6c ahmed et al 2017 thus the electrostatic attractions fig 6 a are assumed to be dominant at basic ph the best fitted pso model indicated a chemisoptive governing process fig 6 e shows a pore filling mechanism which is expected to govern the higher sorption capacities obtained for pm300 as it showed stable capacities over the ph range the average pore size of pm300 was found to be close to the molecular depth of the mb molecule allowing mb molecules to access pores with similar size pelekani and snoeyink 2000 furthermore electrostatic attractions between the negatively charged o moieties and the positively charged mb molecule along with Ï€ Ï€ eda interactions between the protonated mb and arene rings of bc are also possible fig 6f and d a collaborative contribution of the aforementioned mechanisms might assist in the adsorption process of mb on pm300 the pfo kinetic model assumed the physisorptive nature of the adsorption process supporting the dominant pore filling mechanism of pm300 bc however equilibrium data was best fitted to the sips isotherm model showing that adsorption was heterogeneous for both r300 and pm300 4 conclusions the present investigation revealed that lasia is a potential source for bc production as it is abundantly found and effortlessly grown high ph favored adsorption on rbc with predominant electrostatic attractions whereas pmbc showed a physisorptive pore filling process the overall adsorption rate of rbc and pmbc is driven by a combination of liquid film diffusion and intra particle diffusion thermodynamic parameters showed that the adsorption of mb on rbc and pmbc was feasible spontaneous and endothermic for both rbc and pmbc low temperature produced bc had the highest capacities r300 9 58 mg g pm300 81 35 mg g an eight fold increase in adsorption capacity was observed with nitric acid pre modification thus pre modified lasia bc can be considered as a promising candidate for scavenging mb from aqueous solutions in conclusion acid pre modification is a simple effective yet energetically and economically efficient method to enhance adsorption properties of bcs however additional development is required for optimization before commercialization as the bc has successfully been produced in the laboratory and has shown promising results it has the potential to be utilized in the industry in order to commercialize bc it is necessary to carry out studies on bc that was produced and pre modified in large scale pyrolyzers this step is needed to evaluate the properties of the bc and in determining whether the same properties observed in laboratory made material are exhibited in industrially produced bc declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

11894,mineral acid post treatment is a common value addition method for biochar bc however it can cause digestion of the product thus reducing the yield acid treatment on raw feedstock is anticipated to enhance adsorption properties of produced bc while avoiding such digestive effects hence the presented study has focused on pre modification of lasia spinosa kohila bc by using nitric acid to improve its sorption capacity towards removal of methylene blue mb raw and pre modified bc abbreviated as rbc and pmbc respectively were produced at three different temperatures 300 500 and 700 c highest capacities were obtained for 300 c produced bc abbreviated as r300 and pm300 respectively the experimental data was best fitted to sips isotherm model with a maximum sips capacity of 9 58 mg g and 81 35 mg g at 30 c for r300 and pm300 respectively the enhanced capacity of pm300 could be attributed to the increased surface functionality and the reduced pore size which resulted in a feasible adsorptive removal of mb xps results showed a slight increase in nitrogen containing groups upon modification the adsorption kinetics accurately described the pseudo first order pfo behavior of pm300 and pseudo second order pso behavior of r300 the mb uptake of pmbc was governed by a pore filling mechanism whereas electrostatic attractions were predominant in the sorption process of rbc both bcs showed a spontaneous endothermic adsorption and the overall rate of the adsorption process was a combination of liquid film diffusion and intra particle diffusion after four cycles of regeneration the dynamic capacity of pmbc remained more than 50 of its initial value which was approximately twice of rbc pre modification caused an eight fold increase in mb adsorption capacity qualifying it to be a simple economically feasible and energetically effective technique for the value addition of bc graphical abstract image 1 keywords biochar acid pre modification methylene blue dye remediation 1 introduction methylene blue mb is a widely used organic cationic dye it is considered a common pollutant of natural water bodies after it enters living organisms mb can lead to neurotoxicity encephalopathy skin irritation kidney liver and brain dysfunction treating mb contaminated waterways is crucial in textile industries as it influences the overall cost of production of the textiles evidently efficient and cost effective remediation techniques reduce the overall cost of textile production biochar bc is a porous carbonaceous material mainly derived from the thermal decomposition of lignocellulose rich biomass under anaerobic or oxygen deficient conditions known as pyrolysis application of bc in water remediation has gained rapid research attention owing to its cost effectiveness and remarkable adsorption properties ahmad et al 2014b the characteristics of bc vary with 1 feedstock selection 2 pyrolysis method 3 production temperature and 4 any value additions performed rajapaksha et al 2014 feedstock should be abundant and inexpensive for large scale industrial applications while the produced adsorbent should have the optimal combination of porosity and surface functionality to adsorb analytes of interest peiris et al 2020 among the numerous pyrolysis techniques slow pyrolysis is frequently used to produce bc due to its low cost and simplicity low temperature produced bcs are generally abundant in oxygenated and nitrogenated surface functional groups sfgs whereas high temperature produced bc is predominantly composed of arene functionalized surfaces even though bc production has been reported using various feedstocks there are many feasible novel feedstocks still available for experimentation depending on the feedstock type and the pyrolysis conditions of different bcs their adsorption capacities for an adsorbate of interest can be varied therefore value additions are incorporated to the pristine bc to enhance the adsorption efficiency of the bc for a given adsorbate s value addition of bc through physical or chemical treatments can 1 introduce new binding sites or alter existing binding sites 2 remove trapped constituents through demineralization and 3 disrupt pore walls to increase pore size yakout et al 2015 despite being a common value addition technique mineral acid post treatment suffers from the drawback of digesting the carbonaceous feedstock wathudura et al 2020 hence acid post treatments can cause a significant mass loss of produced bc making the value added product energetically and economically inefficient in contrast when pre modifications are performed on the feedstock no such loss of produced bc occurs upon treatment thus the energy and cost consumed to produce a unit mass of value added product is less compared to post modification therefore pre modification becomes a more energetically and economically feasible method of value addition lasia spinosa locally known as kohila is a vegetable plant which belongs to the araceae family has a creeping spiny rhizome and is found abundantly in most south asian countries in dumps marshy lands and deserted paddy fields kumar et al 2013 it is effortlessly grown and does not require external fertilizer or pesticides which makes it a suitable dedicated plant for the production of bc the rhizome has a highly porous structure and is a rich source of lignocellulose the first objective in the present study is to produce a novel bc from lasia rhizome to the best of our knowledge this is the first critique that centralizes on the production of bc using lasia the second objective of this study is the value addition of lasia bc through a simple nitric acid pre modification and evaluating the influence of the pre treatment on the adsorptive removal of mb thus the presented work is an attempt to address the void created by insufficient research focus on acid based pre modifications of bc for contaminant removal the findings could help reduce the production cost of value added bc while enabling the acid treatment of feedstock whose bc is readily digested when undergoing post modifications 2 materials and methods analytical grade reagents nitric acid and methanol were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo methylene blue hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide pellets were purchased from sisco research laboratories mumbai india 2 1 production and pre modification of bc lasia rhizomes collected from three different areas in sri lanka s western province wadduwa 6 6363 n 79 9528 e piliyandala 6 8018 n 79 9227 e and ja ela 7 0668 n 79 9041 e were cut into small pieces and sun dried until a constant mass was obtained dried biomass was packed into an airtight metal container and slow pyrolysed at 300 500 and 700 c r300 r500 and r700 for 3 h using a nabertherm gmbh germany muffle furnace at a rate of 7 c min 1 peiris et al 2019a pre modification was carried out by soaking lasia 60 g in a 50 nitric solution 200 ml for 4 h filtered and oven dried followed by pyrolysis to obtain pm300 pm500 and pm700 bc sahin et al 2017 raw bc and pre modified bc will hereafter be abbreviated as rbc and pmbc respectively it is important to note that upon nitric acid post modification a loss in bc yield of over 80 was observed peiris et al 2019 moreover the post modification resulted in a fine powder having a particle size smaller than the sieve size range used in the study 1 0 5 mm 2 2 characterization of bc scanning electron microscopic sem images were obtained from a jeol jsm 6500 f fesem instrument at 5 kv the surface areas of rbc and pmbc were examined using a tristar ii plus 3030 surface area analyzer using co2 bruner emmett teller bet adsorption isotherms the american society for testing and materials astm d2866 94 and d2867 17 methods were used to assess the ash and moisture components of bc respectively the ph drift method described by ferro garcia et al ferro garcia et al 1998 aided in determining the point of zero charge phpzc of all types of bc the total c h o and n content in bc was determined utilizing a ce 440 exeter analytical inc elemental analyzer aromaticity was calculated from h c ratios whereas the o c ratios coupled with the polarity indexes o n c ratios were considered to gauge the bc polarities an abb mb300d fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer switzerland with an attenuated total reflection atr probe was employed to collect atr ftir spectra of the dry bc between 4000 and 750 cm 1 at a resolution of 4 cm 1 employing 64 scans a monochromatic x ray source at 1486 6 ev al kÎ± line attached to a thermo scientific k alpha x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps system was utilized for xps analyses spot size 400 Î¼m2 corresponding to the overall sample s fractal particle surface photoelectrons were amassed from 900 take off angles and evaluated in the constant analyzer energy mode low resolution survey lr spectra and high resolution hr core level spectra were collected at 200 ev and 40 ev pass energies respectively the avantage v5 932 software was employed to analyze de convoluted xps data 2 3 batch sorption studies effect of ph on mb adsorption was evaluated with 20 mg l and 100 mg l of mb for rbc and pmbc under different ph 2 4 6 8 and 10 conditions the adsorption capacity and removal percentage were calculated using the equations adsorption capacity mg g c o c e m v removal percentage c o c e c o 100 where co is the initial mb concentration mg l ce is the equilibrium concentration mg l v is the volume of mb solution l and m is the mass of bc g equilibrium kinetics were assessed at initial concentrations of 100 mg l and 200 mg l of mb solutions for rbc and pmbc respectively at time intervals between 5 min and 3 h the filtrate was analyzed for mb using a uv visible spectrometer u 2910 hitachi tokyo japan at 663 nm pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso models were plotted to determine the chemisorptive and physisorptive nature as well as to evaluate the rates of adsorption to resolve the mechanism which controls the overall rate of the sorption intra particle diffusion model ipd was plotted data was further modeled by boyd external mass transfer and liquid film diffusion models for the further confirmation of the rate determining step boyd et al 1947 batch isotherm studies were carried out at the optimum ph ph 10 with varying mb concentrations ranging from 25 mg l to 250 mg l isotherm experiments were carried out at three different temperatures 293 k 303 k and 313 k to obtain the thermodynamic parameters of the adsorption process van t hoffs equations were used to calculate the gibbs free energy Î´ g enthalpy Î´ h and entropy Î´ s of the adsorption process the equation and the brief description of the van t hoff plot can be found in s4 and s11 respectively 2 4 column regeneration wet bc 2 g was packed into a 12 mm diameter column to a height of about 14 cm and 100 mg l mb solution was passed through the column at a flow rate of 5 ml min eluent of 25 ml portions were collected until its concentration was equivalent to the initial mb concentration desorption was done by passing 5 meoh through the column until washings became colorless and neutral to ph and washed again with di water to remove excess meoh four consecutive cycles were carried out for column studies 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the adsorbents 3 1 1 sem and bet analysis the sem images of feedstock pre treated feedstock r300 and pm300 at resolution 500 and 1000 are shown in figure 1 whereas sem images of r500 r700 pm500 and pm700 are shown in supplementary information s6 scanning electron microscope images provide information about the variations in the morphological changes in feedstock with respect to modification and pyrolysis ahmad et al 2012 2014a as evidenced by the sem images the appearance of porous surface on the pre treated feedstock was observed fig 1a d the high water content of biomass facilitates the production of porous bc during pyrolysis dehydration of the bc creates a porous structure leng et al 2020 fig 1 e and f however pm300 exhibits a heterogeneous structure as depicted in the sem images fig 1 g and h table 1 shows the surface area total pore volume and the average pore size of bc samples suggesting that its surface morphology is greatly influenced by the pyrolysis temperature hung et al 2017 when the pyrolysis temperature increased from 300 to 700 c the bet surface areas of rbc and pmbc sharply increased from 37 60 to 234 93 m2 g and from 85 12 to 207 60 m2 g respectively this could be ascribed to the loss of volatile organic compounds at higher temperatures and formation of more pores chowdhury et al 2016 the average pore size indicated that micropores predominate both rbc and pmbc average bc pore size is reduced after modification this can be attributed to the fixation of oxygen and nitrogen containing groups to pore walls thus converting mesopores to micropores yakout et al 2015 3 1 2 proximate analysis ash content decreased by 21 for rbc and 15 for pmbc when the pyrolysis temperature increased from 300 to 500 c however upon further increase of pyrolysis temperature to 700 c the ash content increased by 57 for rbc and 53 for pmbc table 1 a possible reason for the above observation could be the progressive concentration of minerals which could happen in two ways firstly the reduction of lignocellulosic matters through destructive volatilization secondly the partial de volatilization of produced inorganic oxides due to increase of temperature rafiq et al 2016 tsai et al 2012 yield decreased by approximately 23 for rbc 49 6 37 9 and 32 for pmbc 46 9 31 9 with increasing pyrolysis temperature 300 700 c the increased thermal degradation that takes place at elevated temperatures is held accountable for the decrease in yield observed demirbas 2004 hernandez mena et al 2014 the phpzc rose with increasing pyrolysis temperature and the corresponding values of all six bcs were in the range of 8 5 11 5 banik et al 2018 overall rbc and pmbc showed no significant change in yield ash and moisture contents when prepared at identical pyrolysis temperatures 3 1 3 elemental composition carbon content table 1 increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature by 51 36 76 32 and 87 09 for r300 r500 and r700 respectively compared to c in the feedstock this is due to the dehydration and depolymerization of plant biomass with increasing pyrolysis temperature resulting in the graphitization of c into organized layers ahmad et al 2012 chen et al 2008 the same pattern was observed for pmbc indicating higher carbonization at elevated temperatures however the c content in pmbc was lower than that of rbc which could be due to the erosive effect of nitric acid on carbon structures as reported in literature li et al 2014 a higher o content was obtained for pmbcs compared to rbc due to the production of oxygenated surface functional groups o sfgs upon nitric acid modification increased n content was significant in pmbcs from the formation of nitrogen containing groups or irreversible adsorption of nitrate ions shi et al 2014 however elemental n decreased in bcs with increasing carbonization temperature as the decomposition temperature of n is reported to be 200 c laird et al 2010 elemental h c and o c ratios were calculated to determine the aromaticity index and polarity respectively molar h c ratios decreased gradually from 0 93 to 0 32 in rbc and from 0 86 to 0 35 in pmbc when the pyrolysis temperature increased from 300 to 700 c lower h c ratios provides evidence to the extension of aromatic conjugation during the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to bc de jesus et al 2017 kim et al 2012 the molar o c ratios and molar o n c ratios of both rbc and pmbc tends to decrease with increasing carbonization temperature indicating higher aromaticity and lower polarity with an increase in pyrolysis temperature from 300 to 700 c the o c ratios decreased from 0 24 to 0 03 for rbc and from 0 88 to 0 12 for pmbc it is important to note that even though o c ratios of rbc and pmbc decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature o c of pmbc was greater than rbc when a particular temperature was considered lower polarity is due to de oxygenation at high temperature produced bcs ahmad et al 2012 3 1 4 ftir analysis fourier transform infrared ftir analysis was performed on rbc and pmbc to identify bc sfgs the spectra obtained for r300 r500 and r700 are depicted in s7 a a gradual decrease in sfg densities at higher temperatures could be due to the dehydration of cellulosic and ligneous contents and degradation of organic matter peiris et al 2019a spectra obtained for pm300 pm500 and pm700 are presented in s7 b reduced peak intensities were observed for both rbc and pmbc with increasing pyrolysis temperatures a comparison between ir spectra of r300 and pm300 is shown in fig 2 remarkable changes in spectra were observed upon modification two intense peaks observed at 1369 cm 1 and 1569 cm 1 were assigned to n o symmetric and n o asymmetric stretching respectively gokce and aktas 2014 a broad peak at 3100 3500 cm 1 corresponds to the o h stretching from alcohol groups and the peak at 1045 cm 1 was assigned to the c n stretching of the nitrate groups attached to the arene rings of the char surface 3 1 5 xps analysis the bc modifications or chemical changes were depicted from the xps spectra the o1s c1s and n1s high resolution envelopes were resolved they are listed and assigned in s8 and s1 s3 navarathna et al 2019 in pretreated feedstock co 9 2 15 0 and c o 4 4 8 9 were increased in contrast to the feedstock which is due to partial oxidation of the non aromatic regions in the feedstock s1 the oc oh r atomic percentage was higher in pretreated feedstock 4 3 versus the feedstock 1 7 however the carbonate content declined from 8 2 to 5 4 likely due to the dissolution of metal carbonates in nitric acid carbonyl co dropped from 21 4 to 15 2 however c o c n increased from 14 6 to 19 6 likely due to nitration the percentage of c c cc c h groups dropped from 23 to 18 2 indicating that surface oxidation takes place upon pre treatment the low temperature produced bc r300 showed a slight decrease in oc oh r co3 2 from 5 4 to 3 5 compared to the feedstock thus indicating decarboxylation however nitro and nitroxy percentages remained unchanged 2 6 after pyrolysis at 300 c at higher pyrolytic temperatures they decreased to 0 8 and 0 6 respectively s2 carboxylic percentage also decreased slightly 2 2 at 700 c upon pyrolysis of feedstock at 300 c the carbonyl groups showed a dramatic drop from 21 4 to 12 0 and further drops to 6 3 and 7 3 at 500 c and 700 c respectively due to decarboxylation the c c c c and c h groups showed a slight decrease from 23 to 20 2 at 300 c then increased to 50 4 and 63 3 at 500 c and 700 c respectively suggesting an increase in aromaticity and hydrophobicity pyridonic n declined from 1 0 feedstock to 0 8 0 8 and 0 6 respectively at 300 c 500 c and 700 c pyridinic n was only detected in high temperature pyrolysed char 500 c 0 3 and 700 c 0 7 which is evident for an increase in aromaticity and is consistent with c1s hr xps pyrolysis of feedstock at 300 c and higher temperatures further reduced the nitro and nitroxy quaternary n pm300 showed a slight increase in nitro or nitroso 4 3 groups s3 as compared to the feedstocks and their raw analogues when the temperature increased from 500 c to 700 c the percentage increased to 6 1 and dropped to 5 carboxyls carbonates were increased with increasing temperature 3 4 at 300 c 5 9 500 c and 10 8 700 c carbonyl groups showed a dramatic drop from 15 2 to 7 7 at 300 c further decreased to 4 7 500 c and 4 5 700 c the c o and c n groups decreased from 19 3 to 14 8 300 c and 14 4 500 c and 12 4 700 c respectively in contrast c c cc and c h groups showed an increase from 18 2 to 29 2 at 300 c and a further increase to 37 6 at 500 c and a decrease to 31 6 at 700 c due to the increase in aromaticity liu et al 2018 peiris et al 2019 it should be noted that xps data should be considered approximate 10 100 Ã¥ penetration and 400 Î¼m2 spot size and may not represent the bulk composition 3 2 proposed reaction schemes upon the pre modification process of feedstock nitric acid mainly acts as an oxidizing agent the possible reactions that could take place during the pre modification of lignocellulose rich biomass with nitric acid is shown in figure 3 fig 3 a illustrates the oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols to carboxylic acids a to a and ketones b to b the second reaction fig 3b is a demethylation followed by oxidation khabarov et al 2016 furthermore nitrogen containing groups can also be induced upon pre modification el hendawy 2003 peiris et al 2019a yakout et al 2015 3 3 effect of solution ph solution ph is a prime factor affecting the adsorption process because it can change the adsorbent surface charge and affect adsorbate ionization liu et al 2012 fig 4 a and b shows the effect of ph on the adsorption capacity of rbc and pmbc which were produced at three different temperatures 300 500 and 700 c the mb can exist in solutions in the cationic mb or undissociated form mb0 fig 4 c the predominant species at ph 3 is mb0 while both forms exist in equal concentrations when ph pka 3 8 and mb dominates at ph greater than 6 salazar rabago et al 2017 for batch adsorption with r300 the capacity was lowest at ph 2 relatively constant at ph 4 6 and 8 before increasing at ph 10 the minimal capacity observed at ph 2 could be due to the competition between the hydronium ions and mb for the same binding sites fan et al 2016 shi et al 2014 constant capacities over the ph range of 4 8 could be due to hydrogen bonding between the phenolic groups on the bc surface and mb molecules additionally Ï€ Ï€ electron donor acceptor eda interactions between the Ï€ accepting arene rings of mb and Ï€ donating arene rings of bc might have been a possible contributor to the stable capacities shown the maximum sorption capacity at ph 10 is due to the bc surface becoming negatively charged at ph above the phpzc 9 5 causing the electron density to increase resulting in strong electrostatic attractions with the positively charged amine moiety of mb ions doÄŸan et al 2004 2009 wang et al 2005 moreover cation Ï€ bonding Ï€ Ï€ eda interactions can occur between the positively charged n atom of mb and arene rings of bc it is also important to note that the h bonding between the mb molecules and phenolic groups pka 10 3 13 0 of bc can also be responsible for the adsorption a cumulative contribution of the aforementioned mechanisms enhance the adsorption capacity at higher ph similar observations were reported for mb adsorption on mixed sewage sludge and tea waste bc ball milled sugarcane bagasse bc and tea waste bc fan et al 2016 lyu et al 2018 uddin et al 2009 even though r500 and r700 followed the same pattern as r300 throughout the ph range studied their sorption capacities were significantly less than that of r300 this could be due to the decrease in polar moieties at higher pyrolysis temperatures which was also evident by the elemental composition and ftir analysis that resulted in reduced electrostatic attractions and hydrogen bonding angÄ±n 2013 kloss et al 2012 moreover it is important to note that there was no significant change in pore sizes of all three rbcs even though r500 and r700 had a higher surface area table 1 pmbc had a different trend varying ph from 2 to 10 mb uptake on pm300 showed nearly constant capacities suggesting the less contribution by o sfgs this phenomenon could be due to several mechanisms pore filling could impact sorption capacity the average pore size of pm300 is 8 6 Ã¥ which is close to the molecular depth dimension of mb 6 1 Ã¥ pelekani and snoeyink 2000 a decrease in pore size upon modification might favor the pore filling mechanism thus allowing mb molecules to enter pores with similar dimensions yakout et al 2015 this result is consistent with that of pelakini et al who used phenolic resin based micro porous activated carbon fibers to determine the influence of pore size distribution on mb adsorption pelekani and snoeyink 2000 moreover the negatively charged oxygen moieties can electrostatically attract the positively charged adsorbate in addition Ï€ Ï€ eda interactions can form between the protonated mb molecules and bc arene rings peiris et al 2020 since pm300 showed stable sorption capacities with varying ph it is concluded that the pore filling mechanisms govern the uptake of mb however an exact mechanism for the gradual decrease in sorption capacities of pm500 and pm700 is obscure pre modified bc showed significant enhancement in sorption capacities in comparison to rbc and it can be concluded that the decrease of pore size upon modification may have contributed to the higher sorption capacities shown by pmbc 3 4 adsorption kinetics taking linear regressions into account all rbc r300 r500 and r700 bc were best fitted into the pso model indicating dominant chemisorptive interactions between the adsorbent and adsorbate in contrast pm300 and pm700 were best fitted into the pfo model confirming the physisorptive process however pm500 was best fitted for the pso model s5 pm300 had the highest rate of reaction compared to r300 indicating faster adsorption s4 first second and third linear portions of a multi linear ipd plot attributes to the surface adsorption ipd and equilibrium respectively the straight lines obtained for ipd plot did not pass through the origin for all the bcs tested concluding that ipd is not the sole rate determining step in the adsorption process s9 and that boundary layer control could be responsible for the observed deviation kavitha and namasivayam 2007 boyd plots were linear but did not pass through the origin indicating that ipd is not the only rate limiting step akkaya and Ã¶zer 2005 banerjee et al 2014 senthil kumar et al 2014 the effective diffusion coefficient di also helps in distinguishing the rate limiting step the calculated di values for different bcs are given in s4 according to sing et al if the di values are in the range of 10 11 10 13 cm2 s 1 then ipd is considered to be the rate limiting step singh et al 2005 calculated di values in the present investigation are in the order of 10 8 10 9 indicating that ipd was not only the rate controlling step of the adsorption process banerjee et al 2014 higher linear regressions 0 88 0 98 obtained for external mass transfer and liquid film diffusion models further confirmed that the overall rate of the adsorption process is dictated by liquid film diffusion therefore it can be concluded that the overall rate of adsorption for both rbc and pmbc is a combination of liquid film diffusion and ipd 3 5 adsorption isotherms the adsorption equilibrium data for mb adsorption on rbc and pmbc were evaluated using two parameter isotherms langmuir and freundlich and three parameter isotherms sips and toth the best fitted model was determined based on the correlation coefficient as shown in table 2 the sips isotherm yields a better fit for both r300 and pm300 bcs with regression coefficients of 0 99 and 0 98 respectively the graphical representations of all isotherm models are presented in supplementary information s10 the sips isotherm is a combination of langmuir and freundlich isotherms thus predicts adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces at lower adsorbate concentration this model reduces to the freundlich model while at high adsorbate concentrations it predicts the langmuir model foo and hameed 2010 gÃ¼nay et al 2007 sips 1948 the sips model adsorption intensity values of both r300 and pm300 were found to be 1 04 and 1 01 respectively this suggests that the adsorption process conforms to langmuir model navarathna et al 2019 the maximum adsorption capacities obtained from the sips model for r300 and pm300 was found to be 9 58 mg g and 81 35 mg g respectively as depicted in fig 4 d the adsorption capacity has increased approximately by eight fold upon pre modification batch sorption experiments were not carried out on the raw feedstock for two reasons firstly the nature of the feedstock is such that it is difficult to obtain bc particles of similar size secondly the low density of the bc particles affects the reliability of the batch sorption experiments 3 6 thermodynamics of adsorption the adsorption of mb on rbc and pmbc was also investigated as a function of temperature to evaluate the enthalpy and entropy changes during adsorption experiments were conducted at temperatures below and above room temperature 293 k 303 k and 313 k as shown for the sips isotherms fig 4 d an increase in temperature resulted in increased sorption capacities for mb on both rbc and pmbc the highest sorption capacity was obtained at 313 k negative values obtained for gibbs free energy shows that the adsorption of mb on both r300 and pm300 was a spontaneous process at the temperature range studied table 2 generally Î´ h values are less than 20 kj mol 1 for a physisorptive process and for chemisorption it lies in the range of 80 200 kj mol 1 it was evident from the enthalpy values that adsorption was a physisorptive process for pm300 as Î´ h values were less than 20 kj mol 1 table 2 li et al 2010 however thermodynamic data did not confirm a chemisorptive process for r300 as the values did not lie in the enthalpy range of 80 200 kj mol 1 suggesting that a definite explanation behind this observation is obscure both r300 and pm300 showed positive values for enthalpy and entropy suggesting that the adsorption process was endothermic and the degree of randomness increased with increase of temperature 3 7 regeneration studies breakthrough capacities for the first cycle were 7 63 mg g and 53 30 mg g for r300 and pm300 respectively which is 79 and 65 of the theoretical batch sorption capacities respectively the capacities decreased over the next four cycles for r300 resulting in 83 60 44 and 24 of the initial column capacity respectively while pm300 showed 73 69 58 and 55 respectively fig 5 a and b regeneration adsorption capacities have shown a gradual decrease with increase in regeneration cycles fig 5c dai et al 2018 when the number of cycles increases the vacant sites available for dye adsorption decreases resulting in reduced adsorption capacities gan et al 2015 wang et al 2015 3 8 proposed mechanisms of adsorption the adsorption of mb on lasia bc is an intricate and complex process the sorption of mb on rbc was influenced by the solution ph whereas the sorption on pmbc was not schematic representations of the possible mechanisms are illustrated in fig 6 the highest adsorption capacity for r300 was observed at ph 10 it can be concluded that three main adsorption mechanisms are responsible for the above observation the first possible mechanism is shown in fig 6 a and is dominant when the ph phpzc 9 5 an increase of net negative charge on a bc surface at high solution ph favors electrostatic interactions between the bc surface and the positively charged adsorbate fig 6 b illustrates cation Ï€ bonding between the positively charged n atom of mb and the arene rings of bc the third possible mechanism is h bonding between the mb molecules and phenolic groups of bc fig 6c ahmed et al 2017 thus the electrostatic attractions fig 6 a are assumed to be dominant at basic ph the best fitted pso model indicated a chemisoptive governing process fig 6 e shows a pore filling mechanism which is expected to govern the higher sorption capacities obtained for pm300 as it showed stable capacities over the ph range the average pore size of pm300 was found to be close to the molecular depth of the mb molecule allowing mb molecules to access pores with similar size pelekani and snoeyink 2000 furthermore electrostatic attractions between the negatively charged o moieties and the positively charged mb molecule along with Ï€ Ï€ eda interactions between the protonated mb and arene rings of bc are also possible fig 6f and d a collaborative contribution of the aforementioned mechanisms might assist in the adsorption process of mb on pm300 the pfo kinetic model assumed the physisorptive nature of the adsorption process supporting the dominant pore filling mechanism of pm300 bc however equilibrium data was best fitted to the sips isotherm model showing that adsorption was heterogeneous for both r300 and pm300 4 conclusions the present investigation revealed that lasia is a potential source for bc production as it is abundantly found and effortlessly grown high ph favored adsorption on rbc with predominant electrostatic attractions whereas pmbc showed a physisorptive pore filling process the overall adsorption rate of rbc and pmbc is driven by a combination of liquid film diffusion and intra particle diffusion thermodynamic parameters showed that the adsorption of mb on rbc and pmbc was feasible spontaneous and endothermic for both rbc and pmbc low temperature produced bc had the highest capacities r300 9 58 mg g pm300 81 35 mg g an eight fold increase in adsorption capacity was observed with nitric acid pre modification thus pre modified lasia bc can be considered as a promising candidate for scavenging mb from aqueous solutions in conclusion acid pre modification is a simple effective yet energetically and economically efficient method to enhance adsorption properties of bcs however additional development is required for optimization before commercialization as the bc has successfully been produced in the laboratory and has shown promising results it has the potential to be utilized in the industry in order to commercialize bc it is necessary to carry out studies on bc that was produced and pre modified in large scale pyrolyzers this step is needed to evaluate the properties of the bc and in determining whether the same properties observed in laboratory made material are exhibited in industrially produced bc declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
