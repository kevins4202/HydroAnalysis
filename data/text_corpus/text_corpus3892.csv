19460,as disinfection by products of parabens halogenated parabens are frequently detected in aquatic environments and exhibit higher persistence and toxicity than parabens themselves an interesting phenomenon was found that uv absorption redshift 45 nm occurs after halogenation of parabens at circumneutral ph leading to overlap with the spectrum of terrestrial sunlight this work presents the first evidence on the direct photodegradation of seven chlorinated and brominated parabens under simulated sunlight these halogenated parabens underwent rapid direct photodegradation distinguished from the negligible degradation of the parent compounds the photodegradation rate depended on their forms and substituents the deprotonation of halogenated parabens facilitated the direct photodegradation brominated parabens exhibited higher degradation efficiency than chlorinated parabens and mono halogenated parabens had higher degradation than di halogenated parabens the pseudo first order rate constants k obs for brominated parabens 0 075 0 120 min 1 were approximately 7 fold higher than those of chlorinated parabens 0 011 0 017 min 1 a quantitative structure activity relationship qsar model suggested that the photodegradation was linearly correlated with the c x bond energies electronic and steric effects of halogen substituents the photodegradation products were identified using qtof ms analyses and a degradation pathway was proposed the yeast two hybrid estrogenicity assay revealed that the estrogenic activities of the photoproducts were negligible these findings are important for the removal of halogenated parabens and predictions of their fate and potential impacts in surface waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords halogenated parabens direct

adverse effects on animal and human health brausch and rand 2011 gonzález mariño et al 2011 terasaki et al 2009a the extensive use and continuous release of parabens to environment has aroused the public concern in european union eu countries the allowable content of parabens in cosmetic products is 0 4 for single ester and 0 8 for mixtures of all parabens which have also been recommended by the governmental units of the united states and canada the danish government made more rigorous restriction in 2011 by banning the use of parabens in personal care products intended for children younger than 3 years of age błędzka et al 2014 recently various methods were tested for the removal of parabens such as ozone oxidation gomes et al 2017 tay et al 2010 direct uv photolysis błędzka et

plants chlorination is a popular disinfection method because of its ability to reduce waterborne diseases and low cost krasner et al 2009 sharma et al 2014 during chlorination parabens can readily react with free chlorine due to the phenolic hydroxyl group alvarez rivera et al 2014 canosa et al 2006 li et al 2015a westerhoff et al 2005 along with chlorinated disinfection bromination is also concurrent for the presence of bromide ions in wastewater echigo et al 2004 sharma et al 2014 yoom et al 2018 in fact both chlorinated and brominated parabens have been widely detected in wastewater treatment plants li et al 2015a tap water alvarez rivera et al 2014 swimming pools li et al 2015b terasaki and makino 2008 and rivers terasaki et al 2012 halogenation is reported to mask the apparent oestrogenic activity of the parent compounds terasaki et al 2009a however the chlorinated derivatives of parabens showed higher acute toxicity responses than the parent compounds in the tests of vibrio fischeri daphnia magna and ceriodaphnia dubia dobbins et al 2009 fatta kassinos et al 2013 terasaki et al 2015 2009b yamamoto et al 2011 moreover evidence has shown that brominated parabens are generally more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their chlorinated analogues echigo et al 2004 plewa et al 2000 sharma et al 2014 given the frequent presence of halogenated parabens in natural waters and their toxic properties understanding the environmental fate of halogenated parabens is critically important during the halogenation processes of aromatic compounds the halogen atoms substitute for hydrogen of phenyl rings which give rise to the p π conjugation between p electrons in the halogen substituent and π electrons in the aromatic ring the p π conjugation would enhance delocalization of π electrons in an aryl ring thus the introduction of halogen substituents into aryl rings enhances absorption at the range of visible light zhang et al 2017 in fact numerous studies have reported the redshift and hyperchromic effect after chlorination of organic compounds cai et al 2013 chang et al 2016 choi et al 2000 macneil et al 1976 merel et al 2010 pretsch et al 2009 zitko 2001 for parabens there is a characteristic uv absorption peak at 254 nm with a wide wavelength range until approximately 290 nm which is close to the lower wavelength limit of terrestrial sunlight after halogenation the parabens will be easier deprotonated due to the strong p π conjugation between the halogen atom and benzene ring yoom et al 2018 the deprotonation will cause a redshift of the uv vis spectrum chen et al 2008 pretsch et al 2009 thus the halogenation will result in the absorption bands of parabens shift to longer wavelength thereby allowing for the direct photodegradation of halogenated parabens therefore the disinfection process in wwtps is expected to affect the environmental fate of parabens via the variation of uv absorption spectra to our best knowledge few studies are focused on the direct photodegradation of halogenated pollutants under sunlight the aim of this work was the evaluation of the direct photolysis of halogenated parabens under simulated sunlight by experimental and quantum mechanical calculations based on density functional theory dft the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar of halogenated parabens was elucidated moreover the major photoproducts were identified using qtof ms and a photodegradation pathway was proposed the toxicity changes of halogenated parabens after photolysis were also determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 3

analytical reagent grade deionized water was used in all experiments hybrid yeast powder kit was obtained from aquality technology wuxi co ltd jiangsu china the primary chemical properties of parabens and halogenated parabens studied in this work are shown in table 1 2 2 photodegradation experiments the direct photolysis of parabens and halogenated parabens was performed in a 60 ml capped cylindrical pyrex vessel 40 mm i d containing 50 ml of solution the light source was a 150 w xenon short arc lamp with a constant current intensity of 8 0 a the scheme of the irradiation device is shown in fig s1 supporting information si the emission spectra of the xenon lamp are shown in fig s2 the irradiation below 300 nm was filtered by the pyrex glass to simulate the sunlight substrates at different ph 6 0 9 0 in phosphate 10 mm buffered solutions were irradiated and sample aliquots of 0 5 ml were withdrawn periodically from the reactor during the irradiation for analysis a series of quenching experiments were conducted to investigate the direct photodegradation mechanism of halogenated parabens isopropanol sodium azide nan3 and sorbic acid were used to examine the roles of hydroxyl radicals oh singlet oxygen 1o2 and the excited triplet state of halogenated paraben 3hpb for the direct photodegradation respectively caupos et al 2011 grebel et al 2011 jacobs et al 2011 besides direct photolysis experiments were also performed in n2 saturated solutions to evaluate the influence of dissolved o2 on the degradation three replicates were included in all photodegradation experiments 2 3 analytical methods the uv vis absorption spectra of parabens and halogenated parabens were recorded with an evolution 201 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific usa the concentration of each paraben was measured by a shimadzu essentia lc 15c hplc system japan equipped with a uv vis detector essentia spd 15c and a hc c18 column 5 μm 250 mm 4 6 mm agilent usa the measurement was performed in a mixture of acetonitrile and ph 2 5 kh2po4 buffer 10 mm with a ratio of 60 40 v v as mobile phase the flow rate was 1 0 ml min and the detection wavelength was 210 nm photoproducts of halogenated parabens were obtained at ph 7 0 the major photoproducts were identified on hybrid quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry qtof ms ms analysis for photoproducts identification was performed in negative ionization mode the esi source parameters were as follows dry gas flow rate 4 0 l min nitrogen nebulizer pressure 0 3 bar capillary voltage at 4500 v end plate offset at 500 v dry temperature at 200 c the structures of photoproducts were proposed based on accurate mass measurements provided by the tof analyzer the toxicity of halogenated parabens before and after direct photolysis was tested using a yeast two hybrid estrogenicity assay see details in si text s1 2 4 quantum calculation the quantum mechanical calculations of halogenated parabens were performed using gaussian 09 revision c 01 with the input structures created by gaussview 5 0 the geometry optimizations and vibrational frequencies of neutral anionic forms of halogenated parabens were calculated using the density functional theory dft at b3lyp 6 31g d basis set in order to mimic water environment the solvent effect was included with the polarisable continuum model pcm the carbon halogen bond energies bes were also calculated 3 results and discussion 3 1 redshift of the uv vis absorption spectra to better assess the halogenated parabens direct photolysis the comparison of the absorbance spectra of the target compounds at different ph values was performed the uv vis absorption spectra of the target compounds with neutral anionic forms are also computed using the td dft method which agrees well with the experimental studies fig s4 it can be seen in fig s4 that the absorption bands of deprotonated compounds shift to longer wavelength than the protonated ones which is consistent with the previous studies chen et al 2013 2008 as shown in fig 1 the main absorption bands of parabens mep and etp and monohalogenated parabens 3 clmep 3 brmep 3 cletp and 3 bretp shift from around 255 nm 300 nm as ph increases from 6 0 to 9 0 while the absorption spectra of dihalogenated parabens 3 5 diclmep 3 5 dibrmep and 3 5 dicletp have little change over the specified ph range at circumneutral ph 7 0 and 8 0 the halogenation of mep and etp led to an obvious redshift 45 nm of the uv vis absorption spectra of halogenated parabens fig 1b and c the redshift is mainly caused by the deprotonation of halogenated parabens which attribute to the strong p π conjugation between the halogen atom and benzene ring it can be found in table 1 that the pk a values of parabens decrease after halogenation depending on the values of pk a halogenated parabens dissociate totally or partially given the low pk a values 5 4 table 1 the dihalogenated parabens were almost fully deprotonated in the ph range of 6 0 9 0 fig s3c thus the absorption spectra of dihalogenated parabens show a main peak at around 300 nm at ph 6 0 9 0 however the parabens pk a 8 3 and monohalogenated parabens pk a 6 8 will be present in various ratios of both protonated and deprotonated forms over the specified ph range 6 0 9 0 fig s3a and s3b which explains the observed spectral changes accordingly at ph 7 0 8 0 the absorption spectra of mep and etp mainly present in protonated forms show a main peak at around 255 nm while the halogenated parabens mainly present in deprotonated forms have a large molar absorption coefficient at around 300 nm fig 1b and c previous studies have shown that mep and etp do not undergo noticeable direct photodegradation under simulated sunlight since their absorption wavelengths are lower than 300 nm at circumneutral ph 6 5 8 5 feng et al 2014 gmurek et al 2015 the redshift increased the spectrum overlap between halogenated parabens light absorption and simulated sunlight which may favor the direct photodegradation of halogenated parabens besides the halogenated parabens with pk a values of 5 3 6 9 were estimated to be in the anionic form in the water matrix which is more reactive and photolabile czaplicka 2006 wang et al 2017b 3 2 direct photolysis kinetics of halogenated parabens the degradation kinetics of parabens and halogenated parabens under simulated sunlight are shown in fig s5 the direct photolysis data at ph 7 0 were fitted to a pseudo first order kinetic model as can be seen mep and etp were hardly degraded under simulated sunlight most likely due to the low photodegradation quantum efficiency and sunlight absorption haman et al 2015 in contrast rapid degradation was observed for halogenated parabens the direct photolysis of halogenated parabens is caused by their significant absorption of simulated sunlight fig 1b the extensive light absorption is related to their halogen substitution on the phenyl rings the degradation rates of halogenated parabens followed the order 3 bretp 3 brmep 3 5 dibrmep 3 cletp 3 clmep 3 5 dicletp 3 5 diclmep the pseudo first order degradation rate constants of brominated parabens 0 075 0 120 min 1 were 7 fold higher than those of chlorinated parabens 0 011 0 017 min 1 indicating that brominated parabens are more photoreactive compared to chlorinated parabens under sunlight irradiation from the chemical bond perspective the strengths of c x bonds depend largely on the electronegativity of halogen atoms the bond force of c br is weaker than that of c cl and thus the cleavages of c br bonds is easier liu et al 2017 wang et al 2017a this phenomenon is consistent with the direct photolysis of the halogenated haloacetic acids abusallout and hua 2016 wang et al 2017a 3 3 effect of ph and quantum yield determination the direct photodegradation of halogenated parabens in aqueous solutions was performed in the ph range of 6 0 9 0 fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the degradation rates of monohalogenated parabens increased sharply with increasing ph from 6 0 to 8 0 and varied only slightly between ph 8 0 and 9 0 in contrast the degradation rates of dihalogenated parabens almost remained unchanged in the ph range of 6 0 9 0 previous studies have reported that the direct photodegradation of some typical ppcps was speciation dependent and was predominantly correlated with the fraction of deprotonated forms bao and niu 2015 chen et al 2013 2012 2008 luo et al 2018 in this study the pk a value of monohalogenated parabens was around 6 8 table 1 and the dissociated fraction of monohalogenated parabens increases rapidly with increasing ph from 6 0 to 8 0 fig s3b the deprotonation of monohalogenated parabens facilitated their direct photodegradation similar results were also observed for the photodegradation of tetracycline and estriol chen et al 2013 2008 meanwhile the increase of solution ph also resulted in redshift of the uv vis absorption spectra of monohalogenated parabens fig 1 the redshift enhanced the ability of these compounds to absorb light at wavelength higher than 300 nm thereby favoring the direct photodegradation of monohalogenated parabens as for dihalogenated parabens with pk a value of around 5 4 table 1 they are almost fully deprotonated at ph 6 0 9 0 fig s3c the uv vis absorption spectra of dihalogenated parabens remained unchanged with increasing ph from 6 0 to 9 0 fig 1 accordingly no obvious change was observed for the direct photodegradation of dihalogenated parabens fig 2 the direct photodegradation quantum yields ϕ of halogenated parabens were determined under xenon lamp irradiation λ 300 nm using p nitroanisole and pyridine as the chemical actinometers chen et al 2009 see details in si text s2 the calculated values are reported in table s1 as can be seen the quantum yields for 3 5 dibrmep 3 5 diclmep and 3 5 dicletp at ph 7 0 were calculated to be 0 054 0 008 and 0 011 respectively and the ph values have little effect on the quantum yields of dihalogenated parabens as for monohalogenated parabens higher ph values disfavor the quantum yields the quantum yields for 3 brmep 3 bretp 3 clmep and 3 cletp at ph 7 0 were calculated to be 0 120 0 139 0 018 and 0 020 respectively the monohalogenated parabens have higher quantum yields than the dihalogenated ones with identical halogen types indicating that higher halogenation degrees inhibit the photodegradation the quantum yields of brominated parabens are higher than that of chlorinated ones with the same number of halogen substitutions which can be attributed to the fact that the c br bond is less stable than the c cl bond 3 4 quantitative structure activity relationship qsar due to the concern about the proliferating number of dbps in water and the associated financial and technical burden researchers have recently begun to develop qsar models to investigate the toxicity formation property and removal of dbps chen et al 2015 in order to extend the photolysis trends to other halogenated parabens a qsar model was herein established according to an empirical equation see details in si text s3 wang et al 2017a xiao et al 2014 the logarithms of measured pseudo first order rate constants logk obs are correlated with a number of molecular descriptors by simple and multiple linear regressions analysis based on previous studies the effects of halogen species on dbps photodegradation can be explained in part by the c x bonds dissociation energies which decrease with increasing halogen molecular weights abusallout and hua 2016 besides the steric and electronic effects of halogen substituents may also play an important role in the photosensitive cleavage of c x bonds chen et al 2015 2010 therefore the bond energies bes of c x bonds electronic effect constants σ and steric effect constants e s were selected as three molecular descriptors which determine the chemical reactivity of the target compounds based on previous studies 0 47 and 0 42 were obtained as the σ values and 0 96 and 1 16 were obtained as the e s values for chloride and bromide respectively chen et al 2015 2010 xiao et al 2014 the descriptors of halogenated parabens used to establish qsar models are presented in table s2 the results obtained by using both singular and multiple linear regressions models are summarized in table 2 when one or two descriptors are correlated with logk obs regression coefficients r2 are lower than 0 84 in all cases the highest correlation was achieved by a combination of three descriptors be e s and σ with r2 0 979 model no 7 in table 2 indicating that these three molecular descriptors have a combined effect on the photodegradation of halogenated parabens the qsar predicted logk p model no 7 and the difference between logk obs and logk p are presented in table s2 the correspondence between logk obs and logk p is also illustrated in fig 3 as can be seen qsar predicted values agree well with the experimental results the average deviation between logk obs and logk p was only 0 040 for qsar model no 7 and the maximum deviation was 0 075 table 2 the qsar model suggests that the photodegradation is correlated with the c x bonds dissociation energies the steric and electronic effects of halogen substituents 3 5 photodegradation mechanisms a series of quenching experiments for direct photodegradation of halogenated parabens were performed to probe the reaction mechanisms the first order rate constants k obs of halogenated parabens with different quenching agents are summarized in table s3 as shown in fig 4 the results of quenching experiments were similar for the seven halogenated parabens the addition of the oh quencher isopropanol did not suppress the photodegradation of halogenated parabens similarly the presence of the 1o2 quencher nan3 exhibited negligible effect on the direct photodegradation fig 4 and table s3 although there are also literature reporting that isopropanol and nan3 are not specific quenchers for oh and 1o2 bedini et al 2012 maddigapu et al 2010 roberts et al 1998 the negligible effect of these quenchers on the photodegradation of halogenated parabens excluded the role of oh and 1o2 in the direct photodegradation in this study as a scavenger of excited triplet states sorbic acid was added in the reaction solutions for further insight into the photoreaction mechanism grebel et al 2011 fig 4 shows that the addition of sorbic acid markedly inhibited the photodegradation of halogenated parabens indicating that 3hpb was a significant reactive species involved in the direct photodegradation moreover the e t1 values of halogenated parabens in their anionic forms are lower than those in the neutral forms table s4 this is in agreement with the fact that the photodegradation rates of monohalogenated parabens increased with increasing ph from 6 0 neutral forms to 8 0 anionic forms fig 2 in addition n2 sparging deoxygenation experiments were also carried out since oxygen is another quencher of excited triplet states of organic compounds chen et al 2017 makunina et al 2015 the results showed a noticeable decrease in the k obs values fig 4 although the removal of o2 may increase the steady state concentrations of 3hpb the degradation rates of halogenated parabens decreased it is likely that oxygen was involved in the photolysis reaction therefore the direct photodegradation of halogenated parabens in the air saturated solution was related to 3hpb and o2 3 6 photoproducts and degradation pathway in order to understand the pathway of halogenated parabens photodegradation it was essential to identify the products formed during the irradiation therefore the photodegradation products of the 3 clmep 3 brmep 3 5 diclmep and 3 5 dibrmep were analyzed using qtof ms fig s7 s10 all the identified photoproducts formed during the direct photolysis of halogenated parabens are summarized in table s5 the low values of the absolute error of determination of masses of all ions indicated that their identification is reliable as can be seen in table s5 three masses m h m z 158 9824 156 9739 and 177 0841 were detected as the photoproducts of the four substrates the occurrence of similar photoproducts of chlorinated and brominated parabens suggests that the halogenated parabens undergo similar pathways during the direct photolysis due to the inductive and mesomeric effects of oh and halogen groups the cl or br atom in the ortho position is strongly electro attractive and favorable to cleavage czaplicka 2006 thus the c cl c br bond cleavage occurs at the first stage of the reaction and then a c oh bond is formed two intermediates at m h m z 200 9872 and 244 9315 were observed for the photolysis of 3 5 diclmep and 3 5 dibrmep respectively which might correspond to the substitution of halogen atom by hydroxyl the hydroxylated intermediates can be further attacked by dissolved o2 leading to the cleavage of the benzene ring and the formation of an intermediate at m h m z 177 0841 the intermediate found at m h m z 123 0053 corresponds to the oxygenation of the benzene ring of the hydroxylated intermediates and it is further oxidized during the irradiation process to intermediate at m h m z 112 9824 the intermediate found at m h m z 156 9739 resulted from the addition of hydroxyl to the benzene ring and the cleavage of a c c bond based on the identified photoproducts and the analysis of the reaction intermediates the proposed degradation pathways photo dehalogenation and oxygenation under simulated sunlight irradiation are shown in fig 5 3 7 toxicity evaluation estrogenic activity of halogenated parabens and their irradiated samples were evaluated with a yeast two hybrid estrogenicity assay using yeast cells into which the herα had been introduced terasaki et al 2009a the dose response curves for the compounds in the herα assays are shown in fig 6 as can be seen parabens and their monohalogenated derivatives conformed to s shaped dose response relationships the estrogenic activities ec50 of mep 3 clmep 3 brmep etp 3 cletp and 3 bretp were 150 0 253 0 553 8 61 4 58 7 and 204 6 μm respectively when the activities of different halogenated species were compared chlorinated derivatives exhibited greater activity than the corresponding brominated derivatives this result was similar to the activity of halogenated estrogens and bisphenol a nakamura et al 2006 terasaki et al 2011 besides no estrogenic activity was detected for dihalogenated parabens in the studied concentration range fig 6 this result may be explained by the fact that the halogen atoms at the ortho position of phenolic rings inhibit the interaction of the phenolic hydroxyl group with the estrogen receptor nakamura et al 2006 terasaki et al 2009a thus the estrogenic activities of halogenated parabens were weaker than the corresponding parent compounds which is consistent with a previous study terasaki et al 2009a after direct photolysis the estrogenic activities of halogenated parabens were not detected fig 6 the results suggest that the direct photolysis may quickly decrease the capacity of halogenated parabens to bind the estrogen receptor therefore the estrogenic activities of the photoproducts are negligible and there is no secondary risk to increase the estrogenic activity as a result of the direct photodegradation of halogenated parabens in water 4 conclusions chlorination is a common disinfection method used in wastewater treatment plants the halogenated disinfection by products dbps are likely ubiquitous in aquatic environments this work presents the uv vis absorption redshift 45 nm after halogenation of parabens at circumneutral ph leading to overlap with the spectrum of terrestrial sunlight the halogenated parabens underwent rapid direct photodegradation distinguished from the negligible degradation of the parent compounds the deprotonation of halogenated parabens facilitated the direct photodegradation and the photodegradation rate depended on their forms and substituents brominated parabens exhibited higher degradation efficiency than chlorinated parabens and mono halogenated parabens had higher degradation than di halogenated parabens a quantitative structure activity relationship qsar model suggested that the photodegradation was linearly correlated with the c x bond energies electronic and steric effects of halogen substituents the photodegradation products were identified using qtof ms analyses and a degradation pathway was proposed the yeast two hybrid estrogenicity assay revealed that the estrogenic activities of the photoproducts were negligible the knowledge of the photolysis kinetics and mechanism presented by this work is helpful for predicting the migration and transformation behaviors of halogenated parabens in natural water the direct photolysis of halogenated dbps likely occurs universally in aquatic environment which constitutes an important fate of halogenated compounds the prediction from the qsar model would be useful for providing insights into the photolysis ability of halogenated dbps and assessment of the risk associated with these compounds in surface waters acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation

the parabens will be easier deprotonated due to the strong p π conjugation between the halogen atom and benzene ring yoom et al 2018 the deprotonation will cause a redshift of the uv vis spectrum chen et al 2008 pretsch et al 2009 thus the halogenation will result in the absorption bands of parabens shift to longer wavelength thereby allowing for the direct photodegradation of halogenated parabens therefore the disinfection process in wwtps is expected to affect the environmental fate of parabens via the variation of uv absorption spectra to our best knowledge few studies are focused on the direct photodegradation of halogenated pollutants under sunlight the aim of this work was the evaluation of the direct photolysis of halogenated parabens under simulated sunlight by experimental and quantum mechanical calculations based on density functional theory dft the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar of halogenated parabens was elucidated moreover the major photoproducts were identified using qtof ms and a photodegradation pathway was proposed the toxicity changes of halogenated parabens after photolysis were also determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 3

analytical reagent grade deionized water was used in all experiments hybrid yeast powder kit was obtained from aquality technology wuxi co ltd jiangsu china the primary chemical properties of parabens and halogenated parabens studied in this work are shown in table 1 2 2 photodegradation experiments the direct photolysis of parabens and halogenated parabens was performed in a 60 ml capped cylindrical pyrex vessel 40 mm i d containing 50 ml of solution the light source was a 150 w xenon short arc lamp with a constant current intensity of 8 0 a the scheme of the irradiation device is shown in fig s1 supporting information si the emission spectra of the xenon lamp are shown in fig s2 the irradiation below 300 nm was filtered by the pyrex glass to simulate the sunlight substrates at different ph 6 0 9 0 in phosphate 10 mm buffered solutions were irradiated and sample aliquots of 0 5 ml were withdrawn periodically from the reactor during the irradiation for analysis a series of quenching experiments were conducted to investigate the direct photodegradation mechanism of halogenated parabens isopropanol sodium azide nan3 and sorbic acid were used to examine the roles of hydroxyl radicals oh singlet oxygen 1o2 and the excited triplet state of halogenated paraben 3hpb for the direct photodegradation respectively caupos et al 2011 grebel et al 2011 jacobs et al 2011 besides direct photolysis experiments were also performed in n2 saturated solutions to evaluate the influence of dissolved o2 on the degradation three replicates were included in all photodegradation experiments 2 3 analytical methods the uv vis absorption spectra of parabens and halogenated parabens were recorded with an evolution 201 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific usa the concentration of each paraben was measured by a shimadzu essentia lc 15c hplc system japan equipped with a uv vis detector essentia spd 15c and a hc c18 column 5 μm 250 mm 4 6 mm agilent usa the measurement was performed in a mixture of acetonitrile and ph 2 5 kh2po4 buffer 10 mm with a ratio of 60 40 v v as mobile phase the flow rate was 1 0 ml min and the detection wavelength was 210 nm photoproducts of halogenated parabens were obtained at ph 7 0 the major photoproducts were identified on hybrid quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry qtof ms ms analysis for photoproducts identification was performed in negative ionization mode the esi source parameters were as follows dry gas flow rate 4 0 l min nitrogen nebulizer pressure 0 3 bar capillary voltage at 4500 v end plate offset at 500 v dry temperature at 200 c the structures of photoproducts were proposed based on accurate mass measurements provided by the tof analyzer the toxicity of halogenated parabens before and after direct photolysis was tested using a yeast two hybrid estrogenicity assay see details in si text s1 2 4 quantum calculation the quantum mechanical calculations of halogenated parabens were performed using gaussian 09 revision c 01 with the input structures created by gaussview 5 0 the geometry optimizations and vibrational frequencies of neutral anionic forms of halogenated parabens were calculated using the density functional theory dft at b3lyp 6 31g d basis set in order to mimic water environment the solvent effect was included with the polarisable continuum model pcm the carbon halogen bond energies bes were also calculated 3 results and discussion 3 1 redshift of the uv vis absorption spectra to better assess the halogenated parabens direct photolysis the comparison of the absorbance spectra of the target compounds at different ph values was performed the uv vis absorption spectra of the target compounds with neutral anionic forms are also computed using the td dft method which agrees well with the experimental studies fig s4 it can be seen in fig s4 that the absorption bands of deprotonated compounds shift to longer wavelength than the protonated ones which is consistent with the previous studies chen et al 2013 2008 as shown in fig 1 the main absorption bands of parabens mep and etp and monohalogenated parabens 3 clmep 3 brmep 3 cletp and 3 bretp shift from around 255 nm 300 nm as ph increases from 6 0 to 9 0 while the absorption spectra of dihalogenated parabens 3 5 diclmep 3 5 dibrmep and 3 5 dicletp have little change over the specified ph range at circumneutral ph 7 0 and 8 0 the halogenation of mep and etp led to an obvious redshift 45 nm of the uv vis absorption spectra of halogenated parabens fig 1b and c the redshift is mainly caused by the deprotonation of halogenated parabens which attribute to the strong p π conjugation between the halogen atom and benzene ring it can be found in table 1 that the pk a values of parabens decrease after halogenation depending on the values of pk a halogenated parabens dissociate totally or partially given the low pk a values 5 4 table 1 the dihalogenated parabens were almost fully deprotonated in the ph range of 6 0 9 0 fig s3c thus the absorption spectra of dihalogenated parabens show a main peak at around 300 nm at ph 6 0 9 0 however the parabens pk a 8 3 and monohalogenated parabens pk a 6 8 will be present in various ratios of both protonated and deprotonated forms over the specified ph range 6 0 9 0 fig s3a and s3b which explains the observed spectral changes accordingly at ph 7 0 8 0 the absorption spectra of mep and etp mainly present in protonated forms show a main peak at around 255 nm while the halogenated parabens mainly present in deprotonated forms have a large molar absorption coefficient at around 300 nm fig 1b and c previous studies have shown that mep and etp do not undergo noticeable direct photodegradation under simulated sunlight since their absorption wavelengths are lower than 300 nm at circumneutral ph 6 5 8 5 feng et al 2014 gmurek et al 2015 the redshift increased the spectrum overlap between halogenated parabens light absorption and simulated sunlight which may favor the direct photodegradation of halogenated parabens besides the halogenated parabens with pk a values of 5 3 6 9 were estimated to be in the anionic form in the water matrix which is more reactive and photolabile czaplicka 2006 wang et al 2017b 3 2 direct photolysis kinetics of halogenated parabens the degradation kinetics of parabens and halogenated parabens under simulated sunlight are shown in fig s5 the direct photolysis data at ph 7 0 were fitted to a pseudo first order kinetic model as can be seen mep and etp were hardly degraded under simulated sunlight most likely due to the low photodegradation quantum efficiency and sunlight absorption haman et al 2015 in contrast rapid degradation was observed for halogenated parabens the direct photolysis of halogenated parabens is caused by their significant absorption of simulated sunlight fig 1b the extensive light absorption is related to their halogen substitution on the phenyl rings the degradation rates of halogenated parabens followed the order 3 bretp 3 brmep 3 5 dibrmep 3 cletp 3 clmep 3 5 dicletp 3 5 diclmep the pseudo first order degradation rate constants of brominated parabens 0 075 0 120 min 1 were 7 fold higher than those of chlorinated parabens 0 011 0 017 min 1 indicating that brominated parabens are more photoreactive compared to chlorinated parabens under sunlight irradiation from the chemical bond perspective the strengths of c x bonds depend largely on the electronegativity of halogen atoms the bond force of c br is weaker than that of c cl and thus the cleavages of c br bonds is easier liu et al 2017 wang et al 2017a this phenomenon is consistent with the direct photolysis of the halogenated haloacetic acids abusallout and hua 2016 wang et al 2017a 3 3 effect of ph and quantum yield determination the direct photodegradation of halogenated parabens in aqueous solutions was performed in the ph range of 6 0 9 0 fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the degradation rates of monohalogenated parabens increased sharply with increasing ph from 6 0 to 8 0 and varied only slightly between ph 8 0 and 9 0 in contrast the degradation rates of dihalogenated parabens almost remained unchanged in the ph range of 6 0 9 0 previous studies have reported that the direct photodegradation of some typical ppcps was speciation dependent and was predominantly correlated with the fraction of deprotonated forms bao and niu 2015 chen et al 2013 2012 2008 luo et al 2018 in this study the pk a value of monohalogenated parabens was around 6 8 table 1 and the dissociated fraction of monohalogenated parabens increases rapidly with increasing ph from 6 0 to 8 0 fig s3b the deprotonation of monohalogenated parabens facilitated their direct photodegradation similar results were also observed for the photodegradation of tetracycline and estriol chen et al 2013 2008 meanwhile the increase of solution ph also resulted in redshift of the uv vis absorption spectra of monohalogenated parabens fig 1 the redshift enhanced the ability of these compounds to absorb light at wavelength higher than 300 nm thereby favoring the direct photodegradation of monohalogenated parabens as for dihalogenated parabens with pk a value of around 5 4 table 1 they are almost fully deprotonated at ph 6 0 9 0 fig s3c the uv vis absorption spectra of dihalogenated parabens remained unchanged with increasing ph from 6 0 to 9 0 fig 1 accordingly no obvious change was observed for the direct photodegradation of dihalogenated parabens fig 2 the direct photodegradation quantum yields ϕ of halogenated parabens were determined under xenon lamp irradiation λ 300 nm using p nitroanisole and pyridine as the chemical actinometers chen et al 2009 see details in si text s2 the calculated values are reported in table s1 as can be seen the quantum yields for 3 5 dibrmep 3 5 diclmep and 3 5 dicletp at ph 7 0 were calculated to be 0 054 0 008 and 0 011 respectively and the ph values have little effect on the quantum yields of dihalogenated parabens as for monohalogenated parabens higher ph values disfavor the quantum yields the quantum yields for 3 brmep 3 bretp 3 clmep and 3 cletp at ph 7 0 were calculated to be 0 120 0 139 0 018 and 0 020 respectively the monohalogenated parabens have higher quantum yields than the dihalogenated ones with identical halogen types indicating that higher halogenation degrees inhibit the photodegradation the quantum yields of brominated parabens are higher than that of chlorinated ones with the same number of halogen substitutions which can be attributed to the fact that the c br bond is less stable than the c cl bond 3 4 quantitative structure activity relationship qsar due to the concern about the proliferating number of dbps in water and the associated financial and technical burden researchers have recently begun to develop qsar models to investigate the toxicity formation property and removal of dbps chen et al 2015 in order to extend the photolysis trends to other halogenated parabens a qsar model was herein established according to an empirical equation see details in si text s3 wang et al 2017a xiao et al 2014 the logarithms of measured pseudo first order rate constants logk obs are correlated with a number of molecular descriptors by simple and multiple linear regressions analysis based on previous studies the effects of halogen species on dbps photodegradation can be explained in part by the c x bonds dissociation energies which decrease with increasing halogen molecular weights abusallout and hua 2016 besides the steric and electronic effects of halogen substituents may also play an important role in the photosensitive cleavage of c x bonds chen et al 2015 2010 therefore the bond energies bes of c x bonds electronic effect constants σ and steric effect constants e s were selected as three molecular descriptors which determine the chemical reactivity of the target compounds based on previous studies 0 47 and 0 42 were obtained as the σ values and 0 96 and 1 16 were obtained as the e s values for chloride and bromide respectively chen et al 2015 2010 xiao et al 2014 the descriptors of halogenated parabens used to establish qsar models are presented in table s2 the results obtained by using both singular and multiple linear regressions models are summarized in table 2 when one or two descriptors are correlated with logk obs regression coefficients r2 are lower than 0 84 in all cases the highest correlation was achieved by a combination of three descriptors be e s and σ with r2 0 979 model no 7 in table 2 indicating that these three molecular descriptors have a combined effect on the photodegradation of halogenated parabens the qsar predicted logk p model no 7 and the difference between logk obs and logk p are presented in table s2 the correspondence between logk obs and logk p is also illustrated in fig 3 as can be seen qsar predicted values agree well with the experimental results the average deviation between logk obs and logk p was only 0 040 for qsar model no 7 and the maximum deviation was 0 075 table 2 the qsar model suggests that the photodegradation is correlated with the c x bonds dissociation energies the steric and electronic effects of halogen substituents 3 5 photodegradation mechanisms a series of quenching experiments for direct photodegradation of halogenated parabens were performed to probe the reaction mechanisms the first order rate constants k obs of halogenated parabens with different quenching agents are summarized in table s3 as shown in fig 4 the results of quenching experiments were similar for the seven halogenated parabens the addition of the oh quencher isopropanol did not suppress the photodegradation of halogenated parabens similarly the presence of the 1o2 quencher nan3 exhibited negligible effect on the direct photodegradation fig 4 and table s3 although there are also literature reporting that isopropanol and nan3 are not specific quenchers for oh and 1o2 bedini et al 2012 maddigapu et al 2010 roberts et al 1998 the negligible effect of these quenchers on the photodegradation of halogenated parabens excluded the role of oh and 1o2 in the direct photodegradation in this study as a scavenger of excited triplet states sorbic acid was added in the reaction solutions for further insight into the photoreaction mechanism grebel et al 2011 fig 4 shows that the addition of sorbic acid markedly inhibited the photodegradation of halogenated parabens indicating that 3hpb was a significant reactive species involved in the direct photodegradation moreover the e t1 values of halogenated parabens in their anionic forms are lower than those in the neutral forms table s4 this is in agreement with the fact that the photodegradation rates of monohalogenated parabens increased with increasing ph from 6 0 neutral forms to 8 0 anionic forms fig 2 in addition n2 sparging deoxygenation experiments were also carried out since oxygen is another quencher of excited triplet states of organic compounds chen et al 2017 makunina et al 2015 the results showed a noticeable decrease in the k obs values fig 4 although the removal of o2 may increase the steady state concentrations of 3hpb the degradation rates of halogenated parabens decreased it is likely that oxygen was involved in the photolysis reaction therefore the direct photodegradation of halogenated parabens in the air saturated solution was related to 3hpb and o2 3 6 photoproducts and degradation pathway in order to understand the pathway of halogenated parabens photodegradation it was essential to identify the products formed during the irradiation therefore the photodegradation products of the 3 clmep 3 brmep 3 5 diclmep and 3 5 dibrmep were analyzed using qtof ms fig s7 s10 all the identified photoproducts formed during the direct photolysis of halogenated parabens are summarized in table s5 the low values of the absolute error of determination of masses of all ions indicated that their identification is reliable as can be seen in table s5 three masses m h m z 158 9824 156 9739 and 177 0841 were detected as the photoproducts of the four substrates the occurrence of similar photoproducts of chlorinated and brominated parabens suggests that the halogenated parabens undergo similar pathways during the direct photolysis due to the inductive and mesomeric effects of oh and halogen groups the cl or br atom in the ortho position is strongly electro attractive and favorable to cleavage czaplicka 2006 thus the c cl c br bond cleavage occurs at the first stage of the reaction and then a c oh bond is formed two intermediates at m h m z 200 9872 and 244 9315 were observed for the photolysis of 3 5 diclmep and 3 5 dibrmep respectively which might correspond to the substitution of halogen atom by hydroxyl the hydroxylated intermediates can be further attacked by dissolved o2 leading to the cleavage of the benzene ring and the formation of an intermediate at m h m z 177 0841 the intermediate found at m h m z 123 0053 corresponds to the oxygenation of the benzene ring of the hydroxylated intermediates and it is further oxidized during the irradiation process to intermediate at m h m z 112 9824 the intermediate found at m h m z 156 9739 resulted from the addition of hydroxyl to the benzene ring and the cleavage of a c c bond based on the identified photoproducts and the analysis of the reaction intermediates the proposed degradation pathways photo dehalogenation and oxygenation under simulated sunlight irradiation are shown in fig 5 3 7 toxicity evaluation estrogenic activity of halogenated parabens and their irradiated samples were evaluated with a yeast two hybrid estrogenicity assay using yeast cells into which the herα had been introduced terasaki et al 2009a the dose response curves for the compounds in the herα assays are shown in fig 6 as can be seen parabens and their monohalogenated derivatives conformed to s shaped dose response relationships the estrogenic activities ec50 of mep 3 clmep 3 brmep etp 3 cletp and 3 bretp were 150 0 253 0 553 8 61 4 58 7 and 204 6 μm respectively when the activities of different halogenated species were compared chlorinated derivatives exhibited greater activity than the corresponding brominated derivatives this result was similar to the activity of halogenated estrogens and bisphenol a nakamura et al 2006 terasaki et al 2011 besides no estrogenic activity was detected for dihalogenated parabens in the studied concentration range fig 6 this result may be explained by the fact that the halogen atoms at the ortho position of phenolic rings inhibit the interaction of the phenolic hydroxyl group with the estrogen receptor nakamura et al 2006 terasaki et al 2009a thus the estrogenic activities of halogenated parabens were weaker than the corresponding parent compounds which is consistent with a previous study terasaki et al 2009a after direct photolysis the estrogenic activities of halogenated parabens were not detected fig 6 the results suggest that the direct photolysis may quickly decrease the capacity of halogenated parabens to bind the estrogen receptor therefore the estrogenic activities of the photoproducts are negligible and there is no secondary risk to increase the estrogenic activity as a result of the direct photodegradation of halogenated parabens in water 4 conclusions chlorination is a common disinfection method used in wastewater treatment plants the halogenated disinfection by products dbps are likely ubiquitous in aquatic environments this work presents the uv vis absorption redshift 45 nm after halogenation of parabens at circumneutral ph leading to overlap with the spectrum of terrestrial sunlight the halogenated parabens underwent rapid direct photodegradation distinguished from the negligible degradation of the parent compounds the deprotonation of halogenated parabens facilitated the direct photodegradation and the photodegradation rate depended on their forms and substituents brominated parabens exhibited higher degradation efficiency than chlorinated parabens and mono halogenated parabens had higher degradation than di halogenated parabens a quantitative structure activity relationship qsar model suggested that the photodegradation was linearly correlated with the c x bond energies electronic and steric effects of halogen substituents the photodegradation products were identified using qtof ms analyses and a degradation pathway was proposed the yeast two hybrid estrogenicity assay revealed that the estrogenic activities of the photoproducts were negligible the knowledge of the photolysis kinetics and mechanism presented by this work is helpful for predicting the migration and transformation behaviors of halogenated parabens in natural water the direct photolysis of halogenated dbps likely occurs universally in aquatic environment which constitutes an important fate of halogenated compounds the prediction from the qsar model would be useful for providing insights into the photolysis ability of halogenated dbps and assessment of the risk associated with these compounds in surface waters acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation

19461,in this study the iwa activated sludge model no 2d asm2d was expanded to identify the most important mechanisms leading to the anoxic nitrous oxide n2o production in the combined nitrogen n and phosphorus p removal activated sludge systems the new model adopted a three stage denitrification concept and was evaluated against the measured data from one two phase batch experiments carried out with activated sludge withdrawn from a local large scale biological nutrient removal wastewater treatment plant the experiments were focused on investigating the effects of different external carbon sources acetate ethanol and electron acceptors nitrite nitrate on the mechanisms of n2o production in enhanced biological p removal by polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos and external carbon based denitrification by ordinary heterotrophic organisms ohos the experimental results explicitly showed that n2o production was predominantly governed by the presence of nitrite in the reactor regardless of the examined carbon source and the ratio cod n in the reactor the model was capable of accurately predicting with r2 0 9 the behavior of not only n2o n but also no3 n no2 n soluble cod and po4 p the simulation results revealed that only ohos were responsible for n2o production whereas the present denitrifying paos reduced only nitrate to nitrite graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrous oxide denitrification ebpr carbon source biological nutrient removal mathematical model 1 inroduction due to a very high global warming potential nitrous oxide n2o has received a lot of attention in the municipal wastewater treatment sector in recent years furthermore n2o has also been identified as an important intermediate or end product of several pathways of the nitrogen removal processes including autotrophic nitrification and denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification in the latter case n2o is an obligatory intermediate but under normal operating conditions in anoxic compartments nitrate no3 n and nitrite no2 n are instantaneously reduced to nitrogen gas n2 without any observed n2o accumulation this behavior results from the fact that the reduction rate of nitrous oxide reductase n2or is approximately four times faster compared to nitrate reductase nar and nitrite reductase nir law et al 2012 hence n2o accumulation only occurs as a result of an imbalance in the reduction activity of those enzymes which may be caused by either acceleration of the preceding reduction step i e no2 n reduction or inhibition of n2or it has been found in several studies that the increasing loads of no2 n in anoxic reactors inhibited the activity of n2or and led to n2o accumulation hanaki et al 1992 lemaire et al 2006 alinsafi et al 2008 adouani et al 2010 gong et al 2012 du et al 2016 zhou et al 2008 emphasized that n2o accumulation could be attributed to the n2o reduction inhibition by free nitrous acid fna rather than the electron competition between nir and n2or the type of organic carbon source substrate may also be another important factor affecting n2o production in the heterotrophic denitrification process ni and yuan 2015 the activity of denitrifying enzymes varies in terms of specific substrates leading to different amounts of n2o produced li et al 2008 zhu and chen 2011 until now only a few studies have focused on the impact of specific carbon sources on n2o production park et al 2000 reported that the addition of methanol as an external carbon source led to a substantial reduction of n2o emission from 4 5 to 0 2 of the total n load in the case of acetate results with respect to its effect on n2o accumulation are ambiguous belmonte et al 2012 did not find any n2o production in the denitrification experiments with acetate li et al 2008 reported that acetate was a better carbon source for promoting denitrification efficiency and reducing n2o production in comparison with glucose or sucrose in contrast acetate contributed to a higher n2o production in comparison with other sole carbon sources such as ethanol adouani et al 2010 as well as glucose and soluble starch hu et al 2013 it should be emphasized that acetate is also an appropriate substrate for the metabolism of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos whereas ethanol would not be utilized by paos under anaerobic conditions hu et al 2016 unless the organisms are acclimated to that specific substrate puig et al 2008 this differentiation is important as zhou et al 2008 and liu et al 2015 observed that n2o could be produced as an important intermediate of denitrification during the anoxic enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr process a few other studies wang et al 2011 li et al 2013 ribera guardia et al 2016 marques et al 2018 also reported non negligible n2o production by enriched pao cultures grown on single or dual substrates in laboratory sbrs table s7 in the supplementary material mathematical models are a powerful tool for testing hypotheses related to the mechanisms of n2o production and developing appropriate process optimization techniques for the n2o mitigation strategies in wastewater treatment plants wwtps in the literature several models describing n2o dynamics during denitrification can be found these models are extensions of the general activated sludge models and can be divided into two groups including the indirect and direct approaches to coupling carbon oxidation and nitrogen reduction ni and yuan 2015 the latter approach is predominant and the existing models within that group include either four step models taking into account all the denitrification intermediates hiatt and grady 2008 ni et al 2011 read daily and nerenberg 2011 samie et al 2011 pan et al 2013 or simplified three step models combining reduction of nitrite no2 n and nitric oxide no into one step von schulthess and gujer 1996 pavissich et al 2012 however these models have two serious limitations which make them inappropriate in the present form for the combined n p removal systems first only the effect of electron acceptors in the sequential denitrification steps was considered whereas the effect of different electron donors types of substrate was not taken into account secondly a model describing the pao metabolism was neglected liu et al 2015 developed a new denitrifying ebpr model to describe n2o production in this process particularly during the anoxic polyhydroxyalkanoates pha utilization phase the model was successfully evaluated against four data sets originating from laboratory scale anaerobic anoxic sequencing batch reactors sbrs the authors linked n2o production entirely with the pao metabolism however the primary deficiency of that study was the lack of experiments with no2 n as an anoxic electron acceptor and consequently the lack of model validation under such conditions in contrast hu et al 2016 carried out experiments with no2 n and found that the anoxic uptake of po4 p was completely inhibited by no2 n whereas the denitrification rate with no2 n as an electron acceptor was only slightly affected in comparison with the rates observed in the experiments with no3 n this finding could suggest that ordinary heterotrophic organisms ohos may play a more important role than paos in n2o production in the combined n p removal systems in order to verify this hypothesis the present study focused on the model based investigation of the mechanisms of n2o production in ebpr by paos and external carbon based denitrification by ohos for this purpose the model of hu et al 2016 was subject to a further expansion using a three stage denitrification concept with respect to the anoxic growth of ohos the relevant experimental data for model calibration validation were collected by investigating the combined effects of both different carbon sources acetate vs ethanol and anoxic electron acceptors nitrate vs nitrite on n2o and po4 p dynamics 2 materials and methods 2 1 developed model origin the batch experiments were carried out with non acclimated activated sludge originating from the wschod east wwtp located in the city of gdansk northern poland the plant is a large facility 860 000 pe performing biological nutrient removal bnr in the a2o type process configuration the effluent standards meet the eu urban wastewater directive 91 21 eec i e total n 10 mg n l 1 and total p 1 mg p l 1 fresh samples of the activated sludge were withdrawn from the last nitrification compartment of the bioreactor approximately 2 h before starting the experiments 2 2 experimental set up and on line measurements all the experiments were carried out in a batch reactor with the working volume of 4 l the reactor was equipped with an on line monitoring system for dissolved oxygen do and n2o concentrations ph and redox potential n2o measurements in the liquid phase were conducted using a clark type n2o r microsensor with a mounted cap connected to a monometer unisense aarhus denmark before the experiments the n2o microsensor was polarized and calibrated according to nitrous oxide sensor user manual the recorded data were collected by free sensortrace basic software unisense aarhus denmark on line measurements of ph and redox were conducted using blueline ph electrode schott instruments mainz germany the recorded data from the electrode were collected by historical data access system 9 5 0 invensys system inc 2005 the batch reactor was also equipped with a water coat coupled with julabo f12 heater julabo seelbach germany to maintain a desired setpoint temperature t 20 c during all the experiments mixing was applied by a mechanical stirrer heidolph rzr 2021 heidolph instruments gmbh schwabach germany with a small paddle diameter size of 5 cm and the mixing intensity was set to approximately 200 rev min during all the tests 2 3 laboratory experiments in order to investigate n2o production during denitrification four different anoxic conditions were considered in terms of both electron acceptors nitrate vs nitrite and carbon sources acetate vs ethanol revealing different effects on the anoxic behavior of pao four one phase anoxic and four two phase anaerobic anoxic batch experiments were carried out in a similar way to the study of hu et al 2016 which however did not include n2o measurements the rationale for planning the separate one phase and two phase experiments was a different po4 p behavior observed in earlier studies makinia et al 2009 at the beginning of the anoxic phase with and without the preceding anaerobic phase in the one phase experiments the carbon source for denitrification originated from the addition of supplemental carbon acetate ethanol whereas both supplemental carbon and anaerobically synthesized pha served as carbon sources in the two phase experiments one phase experiments the experiments consisted of one anoxic phase lasting 4 9 h comprising the whole period of n2o production at the beginning of the test kno3 721 mg or nano2 480 mg was added to raise the initial nitrogen concentration by approximately 25 mg n l 1 simultaneously one of the examined carbon sources was added in the following amounts 770 mg of sodium acetate or 0 38 ml of 95 ethanol to increase the initial cod concentration up to approximately 150 mg cod l 1 two phase experiments the experiment consisted of an anaerobic phase lasting 2 5 h followed by an anoxic phase lasting 5 10 h comprising the entire phase of anoxic n2o production at the beginning of the test 666 7 mg of sodium acetate was added in order to internally store pha by paos at the beginning of the anoxic phase kno3 631 mg or nano2 460 mg was added to raise the initial nitrogen concentration by approximately 25 mg n l 1 simultaneously one of the examined carbon sources was added in the same amounts as in the one phase experiments i e 673 mg of sodium acetate or 0 33 ml of 95 ethanol 2 4 model development calibration and validation the new model presented in this study was developed based on two subsequent extensions table s1 in the supplementary material of the iwa activated sludge model no 2d asm2d henze et al 2000 swinarski et al 2012 hu et al 2016 the new model incorporates nitrous oxide sn2o as a new state variable in the model of hu et al 2016 as a consequence denitrification by ohos is considered as a three step process i e the sequential reduction of nitrate sno3 to sn2o via nitrite sno2 and ultimately to nitrogen gas sn2 with this approach no as an intermediate state variable was neglected resulting in a simpler model structure and no need for model calibration validation in terms of no behavior a comparison of the concepts of denitrification in the model of hu et al 2016 and the new model are illustrated in fig 1 the proposed expansion of the model of hu et al 2016 including nine processes is shown in the supplementary material table s2 stoichiometric matrix and table s3 kinetic rate expressions the complete stoichiometric matrix and process rate equations with respect to the new carbon source sa 1 and no2 n sno2 as the electron acceptor were presented by hu et al 2016 in contrast to the model of liu et al 2015 the pao contribution to n2o production is neglected based on two rationales first experimental results suggested that n2o production was primarily attributed to the activity of ohos see results and discussion secondly negligible n2o production was reported in a few studies where pha was used a sole carbon source zhou et al 2012 as a consequence with only one group of bacteria responsible for n2o production the model structure became simpler and the number parameters to be estimated was smaller the developed model structure was specifically adopted to the observed po4 p no2 n and n2o n behavior the structure can further be expanded by including n2o production consumption by pao as described by liu et al 2015 and massara et al 2018 a procedure for development calibration and validation of the expanded model consisted of five main consecutive steps as presented in fig 2 the model of hu et al 2016 was first validated against the experimental data obtained in the present study without predicting the n2o behavior step 1 the kinetic and stoichiometric parameters responsible for the po4 p behavior were adopted from that model and excluded from further modifications the new model for a batch reactor was implemented in the simulation platform gps x 6 4 hydromantis canada using a special utility called model developer step 2 in order to determine the most influential kinetic parameters in the model expansion sensitivity analysis was performed using one variable at a time approach a correlation matrix between the most influential parameters was subsequently developed to evaluate potential overparametrization of the model step 3 the calibration and validation procedure step 4 was organized in a similar manner as described in the work of hu et al 2016 taking into account the selected influential kinetic parameters the model was first calibrated based on the experimental data from the two phase batch tests parameter estimation was performed sequentially starting with the parameters related to the dynamics of sno3 then sno2 and finally sn2o values of the parameters were adjusted by minimizing the error between the measured variables i e no3 n no2 n n2o n soluble cod and po4 p concentrations and model predictions for this purpose the nelder mead simplex method was used with the maximum likelihood as an objective function the parameter confidence was quantified with the 95 intervals and calculated from the parameter estimation error covariance matrix the details on the computational methods can be found in the gps x technical reference hydromantis canada the expanded model was validated based on the results of remaining one phase batch experiments in order to evaluate the goodness of fit between the observed data and model predictions the coefficients of determination r2 were determined for each measured variable ultimately the expanded model was validated based on full scale dynamic data swinarski et al 2012 in terms of the po4 p and no3 n behavior furthermore the n2o n concentrations in the effluent from the anoxic zone were predicted and compared with the corresponding results of the batch experiments 2 5 analytical methods and calculations samples were withdrawn from the batch reactor with a set frequency of 2 30 min filtered under vacuum pressure on the whatman gf c filter and analyzed for po4 p cod no3 n no2 n their concentrations were determined using xion 500 spectrophotometer dr lange gmbh berlin germany mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss in the reactor were measured using a gravimetric method according to standard methods 2540d and 2540e apha 2005 fna concentrations were calculated from the widely accepted formula of anthonisen et al 1976 1 f n a s n o 2 e 2300 273 t c 10 p h where the input ph was introduced based on the actual readings of the ph electrode 3 results and discussion 3 1 observed n2o production and ebpr in the batch experiments the behavior of po4 p cod no3 n no2 n and n2o in the one and two phase batch experiments are presented in figs 3 4 table s4 in the supplementary material contains a summary of the observed accumulations of n2o during the tests and the ratios of n2o formed to no3 n no2 n added one phase kinetic experiments during the one phase experiments with no3 n only small n2o production was observed in response to dosing acetate fig 3a n2o production appeared after approximately an hour from the beginning of the experiment and the maximum n2o concentration approximately 0 5 mg n l 1 was reached after another 0 5 h the delayed n2o accumulation may be attributed to a relatively high initial cod n ratio of approximately 6 0 the production and accumulation of n2o began only when this ratio decreased considerably or specifically when the cod concentration decreased below 30 mg cod l 1 in this case the n2o accumulation resulted from the limitation of n2or activity due to a competition for electrons between the four reduction reactions in the overall denitrification process similar findings at the cod n ratios below 3 5 were reported in several studies hanaki et al 1992 itokawa et al 2001 adouani et al 2010 zhou et al 2012 the nature of different carbon sources has a significant effect on n2o production during the denitrification process kargi and uygur 2003 indeed in the experiments with ethanol no n2o accumulation was observed in the reactor fig 3b because of ethanol was not completely utilized throughout the experiment by denitrifying heterotrophs and the cod n ratio remained relatively high consequently the denitrification rate was lower in comparison with the experiment with acetate and neither phosphate release nor n2o production was observed lu and chandran 2010 also found only marginal n2o production in denitrifying cultures inoculated with ethanol and methanol in comparison with no3 n much higher and longer n2o accumulation was observed in the experiments with no2 n fig 3c d n2o accumulation began immediately and persisted approximately 6 6 5 h the maximum n2o concentration reached 13 8 mg n l 1 and 17 8 mg n l 1 respectively in the case of acetate and ethanol these findings suggest that no2 n is a very strong inhibitor of n2or and even low concentrations of this compound can lead to high n2o accumulation regardless of the current cod n ratio in the reactor in general high no2 n concentrations result in lower denitrification rates and subsequent accumulation of n2o for comparison n2o accumulation was observed in other studies at no2 n concentrations higher than 10 mg n l 1 hanaki et al 1992 von schulthess et al 1995 alinsafi et al 2008 gong et al 2012 du et al 2016 two phase kinetic experiments results of the two phase experiments are shown in fig 4 in general the observed n2o behavior in the anoxic phase followed similar trends as in the corresponding one phase experiments after the addition of ethanol with no3 n hardly any n2o production was observed fig 4b whereas a short and small n2o accumulation up to 0 6 mg n2o n l 1 was observed after approximately 1 5 h from the beginning of the anoxic phase in the experiment with acetate and no3 n fig 4a then the accumulated n2o was immediately reduced it should be emphasized that the peak n2o concentration coincided with the complete removal of no3 n the two phase experiments with no2 n revealed much higher magnitude of n2o concentrations in the liquid phase approximately 20 times higher compared to the respective test with no3 n in fig 4c which represents the test with acetate n2o accumulation lasted 5 h and the maximum concentration reached 13 5 mg n l 1 during the test with ethanol fig 4d n2o concentration reached 14 8 mg n l 1 and the accumulation persisted 4 h in the two tests with no2 n high initial cod n ratios in the anoxic phase did not prevent from n2o accumulation since no2 n acted as a very strong inhibitor of n2or n2o reduction only began after the complete no2 n removal at the rate of approximately 7 5 mg n l 1 h 1 3 2 model calibration and validation for the anoxic n2o production and ebpr model predictions of the batch experiments with no3 n and no2 n are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively for comparison consistent predictions of those experiments were also obtained by the validated model of hu et al 2016 without the n2o dynamics as shown in the supplementary material fig s1 and fig s2 based on the results of sensitivity analysis table s5 in the supplementary material 9 influential kinetic parameters were identified in the proposed asm2d expansion with respect to n2o production taking into account those parameters the expanded model was calibrated based on the results of two phase experiments with both examined external carbon sources fig 4 values of the adjusted parameters along their confidential intervals are listed in table 1 whereas table s7 in the supplementary material presents the parameters adopted from the literature some of the new parameters revealed relatively large confidence intervals which implied rather poor parameter estimation in those cases e g k no3 h 14 5 2 86 or η n o 3 h 0 41 0 17 in order to explain the large confidence intervals the correlation matrix between pairs of the new estimated parameters was developed and analyzed table 2 according to the classification proposed by zhu et al 2015 if the correlation coefficient of any parameter pair is high enough r 0 95 then such parameter combinations are classified as highly correlated parameters in the present study the highly correlated parameter pairs comprised only three parameters including kno2 h vs kno2 h3 r 0 987 kn2o h vs kno2 h3 r 0 996 kno2 h vs kn2o h r 0 996 such strong correlations between those parameters suggest that unique estimates for the new parameters could not be found unambiguously and in practice only one of those three parameters could be optimized during model calibration nevertheless it should be emphasized that all optimization trials using different initial parameter estimates converged to the same optimal parameter set the model predictions in the calibration phase matched very accurately all the experimental data r2 0 9 the six anoxic reduction factors for ohos were adjusted to fit the observed and predicted substrate consumption rates in the experiments the values for ηno3 h ηno2 h ηn2o h ηno2 h1 ηno3 h1 and ηn2o h1 were set to 0 41 0 31 0 12 and 0 21 0 30 0 17 respectively the estimated sno2 inhibition constants for sn2o reduction for ethanol and acetate kno2 h3 14 5 mg n l 1 were slightly lower in comparison with the value kno2 h3 17 mg n l 1 used in the work of von schulthess and gujer 1996 it should be emphasized that even small no2 concentrations caused inhibition of the n2or activity which resulted in high n2o accumulation the sno2 and sn2o affinity constants were estimated as kno2 h 0 855 mg n l 1 and kn2o h 0 0038 mg n l 1 and these values are close to the ones reported by von schulthess and gujer 1996 the other parameters which were not adjusted during calibration were assumed based on the available literature data von schulthess and gujer 1996 henze et al 2000 ni et al 2011 swinarski et al 2012 hu et al 2016 it should be emphasized that a few kinetic parameters in the asm2d for paos were earlier estimated by hu et al 2016 and those values were adopted in the present study without any further adjustments the expanded model was first validated based on the results of the one phase batch experiments and the simulation results showed very good prediction fits the average value of r2 0 9 subsequently in step 5 the model was further validated with respect to the behavior of po4 p and no3 n based on the results of a 96 h measurement campaign in the full scale bioreactor at the studied wwtp swinarski et al 2012 the po4 p and no3 n concentrations in the full scale bioreactor were matched accurately r2 0 82 0 90 by the model predictions fig 5 a b furthermore those predictions were very similar to the simulation results obtained by swinarski et al 2012 with r2 ranging from 0 83 to 0 89 as shown in fig s3 in the supplementary material the predicted liquid n2o concentrations in the anoxic zone effluent fig 5c followed a diurnal pattern with the maximum values reaching the levels of approximately 0 8 mg n l 1 which were similar to the anoxic maxima observed during the one and two phase experiments with acetate 3 3 rationale for the assumed model concept for the anoxic n2o production in the present study the pao activity and n2o production appeared to be strongly affected by both type of carbon source and anoxic electron acceptor however an explicit relationship between the pao activity and n2o production could not be established unambiguously in the one phase experiment with acetate and no3 n the initial release of po4 p continued until the readily biodegradable substrate was present in the solution as indicated by the cod behavior regardless of the no3 n concentrations fig 3a this observation is in accordance with the conclusion of guerrero et al 2011 that the simultaneous presence of no3 n and carbon source acetate did not prevent po4 p release when acetate was completely consumed the conditions became favorable for denitrification by paos with intracellular pha as sole organic carbon source however the observed n2o production during po4 p uptake remained insignificant an order of magnitude smaller in comparison with the corresponding experiments with no2 n and closely related to no2 n reduction in general high no2 n concentrations lead to a lower denitrification rate coupled with n2o accumulation kampschreur et al 2009 results of the study of tayà et al 2013 showed the key role of no2 n in the activity of pao even though the behavior of n2o was not specifically investigated based on their work faster po4 p uptakes in the experiments with no3 n may be explained by the fact that no3 n is a common electron acceptor for two different types of most common denitrifying paos dpaos candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis revealing different denitrification capabilities i e reduction of either no3 n or no2 n type i or reduction of only no2 n type ii tayà et al 2013 in the present study n2o production was strongly related to the no2 n reduction process therefore stable po4 p concentrations maintaining in the anoxic phase after the addition of no2 n fig 4c d may suggest that type ii dpaos were absent in the studied wwtp and paos did not contribute to n2o production indeed in the study of hu et al 2016 all the anoxic reduction factors for paos related to no2 n had to be set to 0 to describe the negligible po4 p uptake observed for no2 n as the electron acceptor as a consequence substantial n2o production observed in the present study in the experiments with no2 n could exclusively be attributed to denitrification by ohos this hypothesis could be justified by two findings first if the appropriate substrate acetate was present in the reactor the release of po4 p by paos continued in the anoxic phase which implied that simultaneously paos did not denitrify and n2o could not be produced as an intermediate of the denitrification process secondly in the experiments with ethanol paos did not contribute to denitrification due to the fact that po4 p concentrations remained at a very low level throughout the one phase experiments or remained stable in the anoxic phase of the two phase experiments after po4 p release in the anaerobic phase these observations led to the principal model assumption that only ohos were responsible for n2o production in the studied full scale wwtp it should be noted that liu et al 2015 did not consider the denitrification process by ohos in their model at all this simplification was justified by the fact that the cultures in all the studied laboratory reactors were operated under the alternating anaerobic anoxic conditions to enrich denitrifying paos which largely limited the growth of ohos furthermore the model was not validated in the experiments with no2 n addition only in the present study all the anoxic growth processes of heterotrophs were modelled with the inhibitory effect of no2 n which was expressed by the switching function kno2 hi kno2 hi sno2 table s3 in the supplementary material the values of kno2 hi where i 1 to 3 coefficients ranged from 11 3 to 14 5 mg n l 1 which means that all the anoxic growth process rates were similarly reduced i e by approximately 62 68 at the beginning of the anoxic phases zhou et al 2008 investigated the inhibitory effects of no2 n on n2o reduction under various ph conditions using the denitrifying ebpr sludge the degree of inhibition was better correlated with the fna concentration in comparison with the no2 n concentration the complete inhibition occurred when the fna concentration was higher than 0 004 mg hno2 n l 1 for comparison in the present study the calculated peak fna concentrations varied in the range of approximately 0 0015 0 0055 mg hno2 n l 1 fig 6 the higher levels 0 004 0 0055 mg hno2 n l 1 estimated for the experiments with ethanol could indeed imply partial inhibition of n2o reduction on the other hand however very similar n2o accumulation was observed in the experiments with acetate despite significantly lower levels of fna 0 0015 0 002 mg hno2 n l 1 this means that the accumulation was due to high concentrations of no2 similar in all the experiments rather than specifically caused by fna also in the developed model of liu et al 2015 the inhibition of fna on the n2or activity of denitrifying paos was not included even though the fna concentrations up to 0 005 mg hno2 n l 1 could impose inhibitory effects on the no2 n reduction process 4 conclusions the model developed in the present study overcomes the limitation of the existing model of n2o production in denitrifying ebpr and extends its potential application for predicting n2o production in the general combined n p removal systems including the systems with addition of external carbon sources for supporting denitrification the new model was capable of accurately predicting with r2 0 9 the behavior of not only n2o n but also no3 n no2 n soluble cod and po4 p in the batch experiments with the full scale process biomass furthermore the model was successfully validated in terms of the po4 p and no3 n behavior in the full scale bioreactor the experimental and simulation results explicitly showed that n2o production at the studied wwtp was specifically attributed to ohos the production was predominantly governed by the presence of nitrite in the reactor regardless of the examined carbon source and the ratio cod n in the reactor the observed inability of paos to produce n2o should be verified in other full scale ebpr systems as pao enriched cultures have been capable of n2o production in a few laboratory systems on the other hand the simulation results revealed that only ohos were responsible for n2o production whereas dpaos were capable of reducing only nitrate to nitrite i type pao acknowledgement this study has been financially supported by national science center for research and development within the polish german sustainability

19461,in this study the iwa activated sludge model no 2d asm2d was expanded to identify the most important mechanisms leading to the anoxic nitrous oxide n2o production in the combined nitrogen n and phosphorus p removal activated sludge systems the new model adopted a three stage denitrification concept and was evaluated against the measured data from one two phase batch experiments carried out with activated sludge withdrawn from a local large scale biological nutrient removal wastewater treatment plant the experiments were focused on investigating the effects of different external carbon sources acetate ethanol and electron acceptors nitrite nitrate on the mechanisms of n2o production in enhanced biological p removal by polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos and external carbon based denitrification by ordinary heterotrophic organisms ohos the experimental results explicitly showed that n2o production was predominantly governed by the presence of nitrite in the reactor regardless of the examined carbon source and the ratio cod n in the reactor the model was capable of accurately predicting with r2 0 9 the behavior of not only n2o n but also no3 n no2 n soluble cod and po4 p the simulation results revealed that only ohos were responsible for n2o production whereas the present denitrifying paos reduced only nitrate to nitrite graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrous oxide denitrification ebpr carbon source biological nutrient removal mathematical model 1 inroduction due to a very high global warming potential nitrous oxide n2o has received a lot of attention in the municipal wastewater treatment sector in recent years furthermore n2o has also been identified as an important intermediate or end product of several pathways of the nitrogen removal processes including autotrophic nitrification and denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification in the latter case n2o is an obligatory intermediate but under normal operating conditions in anoxic compartments nitrate no3 n and nitrite no2 n are instantaneously reduced to nitrogen gas n2 without any observed n2o accumulation this behavior results from the fact that the reduction rate of nitrous oxide reductase n2or is approximately four times faster compared to nitrate reductase nar and nitrite reductase nir law et al 2012 hence n2o accumulation only occurs as a result of an imbalance in the reduction activity of those enzymes which may be caused by either acceleration of the preceding reduction step i e no2 n reduction or inhibition of n2or it has been found in several studies that the increasing loads of no2 n in anoxic reactors inhibited the activity of n2or and led to n2o accumulation hanaki et al 1992 lemaire et al 2006 alinsafi et al 2008 adouani et al 2010 gong et al 2012 du et al 2016 zhou et al 2008 emphasized that n2o accumulation could be attributed to the n2o reduction inhibition by free nitrous acid fna rather than the electron competition between nir and n2or the type of organic carbon source substrate may also be another important factor affecting n2o production in the heterotrophic denitrification process ni and yuan 2015 the activity of denitrifying enzymes varies in terms of specific substrates leading to different amounts of n2o produced li et al 2008 zhu and chen 2011 until now only a few studies have focused on the impact of specific carbon sources on n2o production park et al 2000 reported that the addition of methanol as an external carbon source led to a substantial reduction of n2o emission from 4 5 to 0 2 of the total n load in the case of acetate results with respect to its effect on n2o accumulation are ambiguous belmonte et al 2012 did not find any n2o production in the denitrification experiments with acetate li et al 2008 reported that acetate was a better carbon source for promoting denitrification efficiency and reducing n2o production in comparison with glucose or sucrose in contrast acetate contributed to a higher n2o production in comparison with other sole carbon sources such as ethanol adouani et al 2010 as well as glucose and soluble starch hu et al 2013 it should be emphasized that acetate is also an appropriate substrate for the metabolism of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos whereas ethanol would not be utilized by paos under anaerobic conditions hu et al 2016 unless the organisms are acclimated to that specific substrate puig et al 2008 this differentiation is important as zhou et al 2008 and liu et al 2015 observed that n2o could be produced as an important intermediate of denitrification during the anoxic enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr process a few other studies wang et al 2011 li et al 2013 ribera guardia et al 2016 marques et al 2018 also reported non negligible n2o production by enriched pao cultures grown on single or dual substrates in laboratory sbrs table s7 in the supplementary material mathematical models are a powerful tool for testing hypotheses related to the mechanisms of n2o production and developing appropriate process optimization techniques for the n2o mitigation strategies in wastewater treatment plants wwtps in the literature several models describing n2o dynamics during denitrification can be found these models are extensions of the general activated sludge models and can be divided into two groups including the indirect and direct approaches to coupling carbon oxidation and nitrogen reduction ni and yuan 2015 the latter approach is predominant and the existing models within that group include either four step models taking into account all the denitrification intermediates hiatt and grady 2008 ni et al 2011 read daily and nerenberg 2011 samie et al 2011 pan et al 2013 or simplified three step models combining reduction of nitrite no2 n and nitric oxide no into one step von schulthess and gujer 1996 pavissich et al 2012 however these models have two serious limitations which make them inappropriate in the present form for the combined n p removal systems first only the effect of electron acceptors in the sequential denitrification steps was considered whereas the effect of different electron donors types of substrate was not taken into account secondly a model describing the pao metabolism was neglected liu et al 2015 developed a new denitrifying ebpr model to describe n2o production in this process particularly during the anoxic polyhydroxyalkanoates pha utilization phase the model was successfully evaluated against four data sets originating from laboratory scale anaerobic anoxic sequencing batch reactors sbrs the authors linked n2o production entirely with the pao metabolism however the primary deficiency of that study was the lack of experiments with no2 n as an anoxic electron acceptor and consequently the lack of model validation under such conditions in contrast hu et al 2016 carried out experiments with no2 n and found that the anoxic uptake of po4 p was completely inhibited by no2 n whereas the denitrification rate with no2 n as an electron acceptor was only slightly affected in comparison with the rates observed in the experiments with no3 n this finding could suggest that ordinary heterotrophic organisms ohos may play a more important role than paos in n2o production in the combined n p removal systems in order to verify this hypothesis the present study focused on the model based investigation of the mechanisms of n2o production in ebpr by paos and external carbon based denitrification by ohos for this purpose the model of hu et al 2016 was subject to a further expansion using a three stage denitrification concept with respect to the anoxic growth of ohos the relevant experimental data for model calibration validation were collected by investigating the combined effects of both different carbon sources acetate vs ethanol and anoxic electron acceptors nitrate vs nitrite on n2o and po4 p dynamics 2 materials and methods 2 1 developed model origin the batch experiments were carried out with non acclimated activated sludge originating from the wschod east wwtp located in the city of gdansk northern poland the plant is a large facility 860 000 pe performing biological nutrient removal bnr in the a2o type process configuration the effluent standards meet the eu urban wastewater directive 91 21 eec i e total n 10 mg n l 1 and total p 1 mg p l 1 fresh samples of the activated sludge were withdrawn from the last nitrification compartment of the bioreactor approximately 2 h before starting the experiments 2 2 experimental set up and on line measurements all the experiments were carried out in a batch reactor with the working volume of 4 l the reactor was equipped with an on line monitoring system for dissolved oxygen do and n2o concentrations ph and redox potential n2o measurements in the liquid phase were conducted using a clark type n2o r microsensor with a mounted cap connected to a monometer unisense aarhus denmark before the experiments the n2o microsensor was polarized and calibrated according to nitrous oxide sensor user manual the recorded data were collected by free sensortrace basic software unisense aarhus denmark on line measurements of ph and redox were conducted using blueline ph electrode schott instruments mainz germany the recorded data from the electrode were collected by historical data access system 9 5 0 invensys system inc 2005 the batch reactor was also equipped with a water coat coupled with julabo f12 heater julabo seelbach germany to maintain a desired setpoint temperature t 20 c during all the experiments mixing was applied by a mechanical stirrer heidolph rzr 2021 heidolph instruments gmbh schwabach germany with a small paddle diameter size of 5 cm and the mixing intensity was set to approximately 200 rev min during all the tests 2 3 laboratory experiments in order to investigate n2o production during denitrification four different anoxic conditions were considered in terms of both electron acceptors nitrate vs nitrite and carbon sources acetate vs ethanol revealing different effects on the anoxic behavior of pao four one phase anoxic and four two phase anaerobic anoxic batch experiments were carried out in a similar way to the study of hu et al 2016 which however did not include n2o measurements the rationale for planning the separate one phase and two phase experiments was a different po4 p behavior observed in earlier studies makinia et al 2009 at the beginning of the anoxic phase with and without the preceding anaerobic phase in the one phase experiments the carbon source for denitrification originated from the addition of supplemental carbon acetate ethanol whereas both supplemental carbon and anaerobically synthesized pha served as carbon sources in the two phase experiments one phase experiments the experiments consisted of one anoxic phase lasting 4 9 h comprising the whole period of n2o production at the beginning of the test kno3 721 mg or nano2 480 mg was added to raise the initial nitrogen concentration by approximately 25 mg n l 1 simultaneously one of the examined carbon sources was added in the following amounts 770 mg of sodium acetate or 0 38 ml of 95 ethanol to increase the initial cod concentration up to approximately 150 mg cod l 1 two phase experiments the experiment consisted of an anaerobic phase lasting 2 5 h followed by an anoxic phase lasting 5 10 h comprising the entire phase of anoxic n2o production at the beginning of the test 666 7 mg of sodium acetate was added in order to internally store pha by paos at the beginning of the anoxic phase kno3 631 mg or nano2 460 mg was added to raise the initial nitrogen concentration by approximately 25 mg n l 1 simultaneously one of the examined carbon sources was added in the same amounts as in the one phase experiments i e 673 mg of sodium acetate or 0 33 ml of 95 ethanol 2 4 model development calibration and validation the new model presented in this study was developed based on two subsequent extensions table s1 in the supplementary material of the iwa activated sludge model no 2d asm2d henze et al 2000 swinarski et al 2012 hu et al 2016 the new model incorporates nitrous oxide sn2o as a new state variable in the model of hu et al 2016 as a consequence denitrification by ohos is considered as a three step process i e the sequential reduction of nitrate sno3 to sn2o via nitrite sno2 and ultimately to nitrogen gas sn2 with this approach no as an intermediate state variable was neglected resulting in a simpler model structure and no need for model calibration validation in terms of no behavior a comparison of the concepts of denitrification in the model of hu et al 2016 and the new model are illustrated in fig 1 the proposed expansion of the model of hu et al 2016 including nine processes is shown in the supplementary material table s2 stoichiometric matrix and table s3 kinetic rate expressions the complete stoichiometric matrix and process rate equations with respect to the new carbon source sa 1 and no2 n sno2 as the electron acceptor were presented by hu et al 2016 in contrast to the model of liu et al 2015 the pao contribution to n2o production is neglected based on two rationales first experimental results suggested that n2o production was primarily attributed to the activity of ohos see results and discussion secondly negligible n2o production was reported in a few studies where pha was used a sole carbon source zhou et al 2012 as a consequence with only one group of bacteria responsible for n2o production the model structure became simpler and the number parameters to be estimated was smaller the developed model structure was specifically adopted to the observed po4 p no2 n and n2o n behavior the structure can further be expanded by including n2o production consumption by pao as described by liu et al 2015 and massara et al 2018 a procedure for development calibration and validation of the expanded model consisted of five main consecutive steps as presented in fig 2 the model of hu et al 2016 was first validated against the experimental data obtained in the present study without predicting the n2o behavior step 1 the kinetic and stoichiometric parameters responsible for the po4 p behavior were adopted from that model and excluded from further modifications the new model for a batch reactor was implemented in the simulation platform gps x 6 4 hydromantis canada using a special utility called model developer step 2 in order to determine the most influential kinetic parameters in the model expansion sensitivity analysis was performed using one variable at a time approach a correlation matrix between the most influential parameters was subsequently developed to evaluate potential overparametrization of the model step 3 the calibration and validation procedure step 4 was organized in a similar manner as described in the work of hu et al 2016 taking into account the selected influential kinetic parameters the model was first calibrated based on the experimental data from the two phase batch tests parameter estimation was performed sequentially starting with the parameters related to the dynamics of sno3 then sno2 and finally sn2o values of the parameters were adjusted by minimizing the error between the measured variables i e no3 n no2 n n2o n soluble cod and po4 p concentrations and model predictions for this purpose the nelder mead simplex method was used with the maximum likelihood as an objective function the parameter confidence was quantified with the 95 intervals and calculated from the parameter estimation error covariance matrix the details on the computational methods can be found in the gps x technical reference hydromantis canada the expanded model was validated based on the results of remaining one phase batch experiments in order to evaluate the goodness of fit between the observed data and model predictions the coefficients of determination r2 were determined for each measured variable ultimately the expanded model was validated based on full scale dynamic data swinarski et al 2012 in terms of the po4 p and no3 n behavior furthermore the n2o n concentrations in the effluent from the anoxic zone were predicted and compared with the corresponding results of the batch experiments 2 5 analytical methods and calculations samples were withdrawn from the batch reactor with a set frequency of 2 30 min filtered under vacuum pressure on the whatman gf c filter and analyzed for po4 p cod no3 n no2 n their concentrations were determined using xion 500 spectrophotometer dr lange gmbh berlin germany mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss in the reactor were measured using a gravimetric method according to standard methods 2540d and 2540e apha 2005 fna concentrations were calculated from the widely accepted formula of anthonisen et al 1976 1 f n a s n o 2 e 2300 273 t c 10 p h where the input ph was introduced based on the actual readings of the ph electrode 3 results and discussion 3 1 observed n2o production and ebpr in the batch experiments the behavior of po4 p cod no3 n no2 n and n2o in the one and two phase batch experiments are presented in figs 3 4 table s4 in the supplementary material contains a summary of the observed accumulations of n2o during the tests and the ratios of n2o formed to no3 n no2 n added one phase kinetic experiments during the one phase experiments with no3 n only small n2o production was observed in response to dosing acetate fig 3a n2o production appeared after approximately an hour from the beginning of the experiment and the maximum n2o concentration approximately 0 5 mg n l 1 was reached after another 0 5 h the delayed n2o accumulation may be attributed to a relatively high initial cod n ratio of approximately 6 0 the production and accumulation of n2o began only when this ratio decreased considerably or specifically when the cod concentration decreased below 30 mg cod l 1 in this case the n2o accumulation resulted from the limitation of n2or activity due to a competition for electrons between the four reduction reactions in the overall denitrification process similar findings at the cod n ratios below 3 5 were reported in several studies hanaki et al 1992 itokawa et al 2001 adouani et al 2010 zhou et al 2012 the nature of different carbon sources has a significant effect on n2o production during the denitrification process kargi and uygur 2003 indeed in the experiments with ethanol no n2o accumulation was observed in the reactor fig 3b because of ethanol was not completely utilized throughout the experiment by denitrifying heterotrophs and the cod n ratio remained relatively high consequently the denitrification rate was lower in comparison with the experiment with acetate and neither phosphate release nor n2o production was observed lu and chandran 2010 also found only marginal n2o production in denitrifying cultures inoculated with ethanol and methanol in comparison with no3 n much higher and longer n2o accumulation was observed in the experiments with no2 n fig 3c d n2o accumulation began immediately and persisted approximately 6 6 5 h the maximum n2o concentration reached 13 8 mg n l 1 and 17 8 mg n l 1 respectively in the case of acetate and ethanol these findings suggest that no2 n is a very strong inhibitor of n2or and even low concentrations of this compound can lead to high n2o accumulation regardless of the current cod n ratio in the reactor in general high no2 n concentrations result in lower denitrification rates and subsequent accumulation of n2o for comparison n2o accumulation was observed in other studies at no2 n concentrations higher than 10 mg n l 1 hanaki et al 1992 von schulthess et al 1995 alinsafi et al 2008 gong et al 2012 du et al 2016 two phase kinetic experiments results of the two phase experiments are shown in fig 4 in general the observed n2o behavior in the anoxic phase followed similar trends as in the corresponding one phase experiments after the addition of ethanol with no3 n hardly any n2o production was observed fig 4b whereas a short and small n2o accumulation up to 0 6 mg n2o n l 1 was observed after approximately 1 5 h from the beginning of the anoxic phase in the experiment with acetate and no3 n fig 4a then the accumulated n2o was immediately reduced it should be emphasized that the peak n2o concentration coincided with the complete removal of no3 n the two phase experiments with no2 n revealed much higher magnitude of n2o concentrations in the liquid phase approximately 20 times higher compared to the respective test with no3 n in fig 4c which represents the test with acetate n2o accumulation lasted 5 h and the maximum concentration reached 13 5 mg n l 1 during the test with ethanol fig 4d n2o concentration reached 14 8 mg n l 1 and the accumulation persisted 4 h in the two tests with no2 n high initial cod n ratios in the anoxic phase did not prevent from n2o accumulation since no2 n acted as a very strong inhibitor of n2or n2o reduction only began after the complete no2 n removal at the rate of approximately 7 5 mg n l 1 h 1 3 2 model calibration and validation for the anoxic n2o production and ebpr model predictions of the batch experiments with no3 n and no2 n are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively for comparison consistent predictions of those experiments were also obtained by the validated model of hu et al 2016 without the n2o dynamics as shown in the supplementary material fig s1 and fig s2 based on the results of sensitivity analysis table s5 in the supplementary material 9 influential kinetic parameters were identified in the proposed asm2d expansion with respect to n2o production taking into account those parameters the expanded model was calibrated based on the results of two phase experiments with both examined external carbon sources fig 4 values of the adjusted parameters along their confidential intervals are listed in table 1 whereas table s7 in the supplementary material presents the parameters adopted from the literature some of the new parameters revealed relatively large confidence intervals which implied rather poor parameter estimation in those cases e g k no3 h 14 5 2 86 or η n o 3 h 0 41 0 17 in order to explain the large confidence intervals the correlation matrix between pairs of the new estimated parameters was developed and analyzed table 2 according to the classification proposed by zhu et al 2015 if the correlation coefficient of any parameter pair is high enough r 0 95 then such parameter combinations are classified as highly correlated parameters in the present study the highly correlated parameter pairs comprised only three parameters including kno2 h vs kno2 h3 r 0 987 kn2o h vs kno2 h3 r 0 996 kno2 h vs kn2o h r 0 996 such strong correlations between those parameters suggest that unique estimates for the new parameters could not be found unambiguously and in practice only one of those three parameters could be optimized during model calibration nevertheless it should be emphasized that all optimization trials using different initial parameter estimates converged to the same optimal parameter set the model predictions in the calibration phase matched very accurately all the experimental data r2 0 9 the six anoxic reduction factors for ohos were adjusted to fit the observed and predicted substrate consumption rates in the experiments the values for ηno3 h ηno2 h ηn2o h ηno2 h1 ηno3 h1 and ηn2o h1 were set to 0 41 0 31 0 12 and 0 21 0 30 0 17 respectively the estimated sno2 inhibition constants for sn2o reduction for ethanol and acetate kno2 h3 14 5 mg n l 1 were slightly lower in comparison with the value kno2 h3 17 mg n l 1 used in the work of von schulthess and gujer 1996 it should be emphasized that even small no2 concentrations caused inhibition of the n2or activity which resulted in high n2o accumulation the sno2 and sn2o affinity constants were estimated as kno2 h 0 855 mg n l 1 and kn2o h 0 0038 mg n l 1 and these values are close to the ones reported by von schulthess and gujer 1996 the other parameters which were not adjusted during calibration were assumed based on the available literature data von schulthess and gujer 1996 henze et al 2000 ni et al 2011 swinarski et al 2012 hu et al 2016 it should be emphasized that a few kinetic parameters in the asm2d for paos were earlier estimated by hu et al 2016 and those values were adopted in the present study without any further adjustments the expanded model was first validated based on the results of the one phase batch experiments and the simulation results showed very good prediction fits the average value of r2 0 9 subsequently in step 5 the model was further validated with respect to the behavior of po4 p and no3 n based on the results of a 96 h measurement campaign in the full scale bioreactor at the studied wwtp swinarski et al 2012 the po4 p and no3 n concentrations in the full scale bioreactor were matched accurately r2 0 82 0 90 by the model predictions fig 5 a b furthermore those predictions were very similar to the simulation results obtained by swinarski et al 2012 with r2 ranging from 0 83 to 0 89 as shown in fig s3 in the supplementary material the predicted liquid n2o concentrations in the anoxic zone effluent fig 5c followed a diurnal pattern with the maximum values reaching the levels of approximately 0 8 mg n l 1 which were similar to the anoxic maxima observed during the one and two phase experiments with acetate 3 3 rationale for the assumed model concept for the anoxic n2o production in the present study the pao activity and n2o production appeared to be strongly affected by both type of carbon source and anoxic electron acceptor however an explicit relationship between the pao activity and n2o production could not be established unambiguously in the one phase experiment with acetate and no3 n the initial release of po4 p continued until the readily biodegradable substrate was present in the solution as indicated by the cod behavior regardless of the no3 n concentrations fig 3a this observation is in accordance with the conclusion of guerrero et al 2011 that the simultaneous presence of no3 n and carbon source acetate did not prevent po4 p release when acetate was completely consumed the conditions became favorable for denitrification by paos with intracellular pha as sole organic carbon source however the observed n2o production during po4 p uptake remained insignificant an order of magnitude smaller in comparison with the corresponding experiments with no2 n and closely related to no2 n reduction in general high no2 n concentrations lead to a lower denitrification rate coupled with n2o accumulation kampschreur et al 2009 results of the study of tayà et al 2013 showed the key role of no2 n in the activity of pao even though the behavior of n2o was not specifically investigated based on their work faster po4 p uptakes in the experiments with no3 n may be explained by the fact that no3 n is a common electron acceptor for two different types of most common denitrifying paos dpaos candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis revealing different denitrification capabilities i e reduction of either no3 n or no2 n type i or reduction of only no2 n type ii tayà et al 2013 in the present study n2o production was strongly related to the no2 n reduction process therefore stable po4 p concentrations maintaining in the anoxic phase after the addition of no2 n fig 4c d may suggest that type ii dpaos were absent in the studied wwtp and paos did not contribute to n2o production indeed in the study of hu et al 2016 all the anoxic reduction factors for paos related to no2 n had to be set to 0 to describe the negligible po4 p uptake observed for no2 n as the electron acceptor as a consequence substantial n2o production observed in the present study in the experiments with no2 n could exclusively be attributed to denitrification by ohos this hypothesis could be justified by two findings first if the appropriate substrate acetate was present in the reactor the release of po4 p by paos continued in the anoxic phase which implied that simultaneously paos did not denitrify and n2o could not be produced as an intermediate of the denitrification process secondly in the experiments with ethanol paos did not contribute to denitrification due to the fact that po4 p concentrations remained at a very low level throughout the one phase experiments or remained stable in the anoxic phase of the two phase experiments after po4 p release in the anaerobic phase these observations led to the principal model assumption that only ohos were responsible for n2o production in the studied full scale wwtp it should be noted that liu et al 2015 did not consider the denitrification process by ohos in their model at all this simplification was justified by the fact that the cultures in all the studied laboratory reactors were operated under the alternating anaerobic anoxic conditions to enrich denitrifying paos which largely limited the growth of ohos furthermore the model was not validated in the experiments with no2 n addition only in the present study all the anoxic growth processes of heterotrophs were modelled with the inhibitory effect of no2 n which was expressed by the switching function kno2 hi kno2 hi sno2 table s3 in the supplementary material the values of kno2 hi where i 1 to 3 coefficients ranged from 11 3 to 14 5 mg n l 1 which means that all the anoxic growth process rates were similarly reduced i e by approximately 62 68 at the beginning of the anoxic phases zhou et al 2008 investigated the inhibitory effects of no2 n on n2o reduction under various ph conditions using the denitrifying ebpr sludge the degree of inhibition was better correlated with the fna concentration in comparison with the no2 n concentration the complete inhibition occurred when the fna concentration was higher than 0 004 mg hno2 n l 1 for comparison in the present study the calculated peak fna concentrations varied in the range of approximately 0 0015 0 0055 mg hno2 n l 1 fig 6 the higher levels 0 004 0 0055 mg hno2 n l 1 estimated for the experiments with ethanol could indeed imply partial inhibition of n2o reduction on the other hand however very similar n2o accumulation was observed in the experiments with acetate despite significantly lower levels of fna 0 0015 0 002 mg hno2 n l 1 this means that the accumulation was due to high concentrations of no2 similar in all the experiments rather than specifically caused by fna also in the developed model of liu et al 2015 the inhibition of fna on the n2or activity of denitrifying paos was not included even though the fna concentrations up to 0 005 mg hno2 n l 1 could impose inhibitory effects on the no2 n reduction process 4 conclusions the model developed in the present study overcomes the limitation of the existing model of n2o production in denitrifying ebpr and extends its potential application for predicting n2o production in the general combined n p removal systems including the systems with addition of external carbon sources for supporting denitrification the new model was capable of accurately predicting with r2 0 9 the behavior of not only n2o n but also no3 n no2 n soluble cod and po4 p in the batch experiments with the full scale process biomass furthermore the model was successfully validated in terms of the po4 p and no3 n behavior in the full scale bioreactor the experimental and simulation results explicitly showed that n2o production at the studied wwtp was specifically attributed to ohos the production was predominantly governed by the presence of nitrite in the reactor regardless of the examined carbon source and the ratio cod n in the reactor the observed inability of paos to produce n2o should be verified in other full scale ebpr systems as pao enriched cultures have been capable of n2o production in a few laboratory systems on the other hand the simulation results revealed that only ohos were responsible for n2o production whereas dpaos were capable of reducing only nitrate to nitrite i type pao acknowledgement this study has been financially supported by national science center for research and development within the polish german sustainability

19462,a hybrid algal photosynthesis and ion exchange hapix process was developed that uses natural zeolite chabazite and wild type algae to treat high ammonium nh4 strength wastewater in the hapix process nh4 is temporarily adsorbed from the liquid which reduces the free ammonia fa concentration below the inhibitory level for algal growth the slow release of adsorbed nh4 subsequently supports the continuous growth of algae in this study a hapix reactor reduced nh4 n concentrations in centrate from an anaerobic digester from 1180 mg l 1 to below 10 mg l 1 without dilution chabazite doses of 60 g l 1 produced more algal biomass with higher protein and starch contents than doses of 150 g l 1 and 250 g l 1 approximately 67 70 of fatty acids in the algal biomass harvested from hapix reactors were unsaturated a mathematical framework that couples a homogeneous surface diffusion model with a co limitation algal kinetic growth model reasonably predicted the algal biomass production and nh4 n concentrations in the hapix reactors the hapix process has the potential to serve a two fold purpose of high nh4 n strength wastewater treatment and agricultural or commercial biopolymer production graphical abstract image 1 keywords ion exchange algal photosynthesis high ammonium strength wastewater mathematical modeling intracellular contents of algae 1 introduction management of the nitrogen n cycle was identified by the national academy of engineering as one of the grand challenges of the 21st century a major source of n is high ammonium nh4 strength wastewaters such as industrial wastewaters e g food processing fertilizer plastic industries landfill leachate source separated urine and centrate from anaerobic digestion these wastewater streams are challenging and expensive to treat kjeldsen et al 2002 udert et al 2003 anaerobic digestion centrate is of particular interest since anaerobic digestion technology is being promoted for stabilization and bioenergy recovery from waste resources such as sewage sludge and food waste cantrell et al 2008 the high nh4 strength centrate is often recycled back to the head of the wastewater treatment plant resulting in high irregular nutrient loads that can upset mainstream biological n removal bnr processes and increase costs fux et al 2006 wett and alex 2003 although a number of advanced bnr processes such as shortcut n removal nitritation denitritation and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox have been developed to reduce the energy and chemical costs of high nh4 strength wastewater treatment kotay et al 2013 lackner et al 2014 third et al 2005 utilization of algae for treatment of these wastewater presents an opportunity for co production of biofuels high value chemicals and animal feeds li et al 2011 park et al 2010 rusten and sahu 2011 wang and park 2015 wang et al 2015 the high nutrient concentrations in these wastewaters also have the potential to support higher algal biomass densities than low strength wastewaters e g secondary tertiary effluent resulting in lower downstream costs for thickening and dewatering halfhide et al 2014 however nh4 n concentrations greater than 200 300 mg l 1 are known to inhibit algae growth due to the uncoupling effect of free ammonia fa on the photosynthetic processes in chloroplasts crofts 1966 lin et al 2007 park et al 2010 prior studies have addressed this issue by dilution with fresh water or low strength wastewater or using a fed batch bioreactor approach wang et al 2010 2015 yuan et al 2012 strategies to reduce the fa toxicity are needed to promote the implementation of algae cultivation in high nh4 strength wastewater zeolites are natural hydrated aluminosilicate materials with a high affinity for nh4 ions malovanyy et al 2013 rožić et al 2000 compared with the polymeric cation exchange resins natural zeolites have a lower cost per gram of n removed in addition shrinking and swelling in polymeric resins can occur depending on the extent of polymer cross linking these changes are insignificant for natural zeolites and are less likely to have an impact which is an important consideration since some extracellular polymeric substance can deposit on the surface of the ix media tarpeh et al 2017 common forms of natural zeolite include clinoptilolite mordenite phillipsite chabazite stilbite analcime and laumontite wang and peng 2010 clinoptilolite is the most abundant and lowest cost natural zeolite material however its nh4 capacity is low compared with chabazite amini et al 2017 aponte morales 2015 prior studies of biological treatment of high nh4 strength wastewaters have successfully used the ion exchange ix capacity of natural zeolites to reduce the toxicity of fa to nitrifying prokaryotes aponte morales et al 2016 2018 martins et al 2017 tada et al 2005 biological processes such as nitrification will consume nh4 in the aqueous phase and promote desorption of nh4 from the solid phase the zeolite can therefore be biologically regenerated thus less chemicals are required to regenerate the spent zeolite prior research showed that a chabazite amended sequencing batch reactor was able to treat anaerobically digested swine waste without loss of ix efficiency for over 40 cycles of operation aponte morales et al 2016 combining the ix process with algae cultivation has the potential to treat high nh4 strength wastewater without dilution the adsorbed nh4 in the solid phase will be desorbed to support continuous algal growth when the nh4 in the aqueous phase is consumed in addition no prior studies have presented a mathematical description of ix combined with algal photosynthesis such a study can improve the understanding of the underlying physical chemical and biological mechanisms several prior studies have focused on surface diffusion models of ix in zeolites and microporous materials auerbach et al 2003 krishna and wesselingh 1997 lito et al 2014 or algal photosynthesis kinetics juneja et al 2013 lee and zhang 2016 however coupling ix and algal photosynthesis kinetics into a mathematical framework has not previously been investigated a prior study in our research group demonstrated that a fickian based continuum scale model the homogenous surface diffusion model hsdm combined with a kinetic model of fa inhibited nitrification the andrew s model described ix assisted nitrification and bioregeneration aponte morales et al 2018 however microalgae growth is influenced by different factors than nitrification including temperature light availability ph and the concentrations of nutrients such as n and phosphorus p juneja et al 2013 a comprehensive review of the various models of microalgae growth kinetics is presented elsewhere lee and zhang 2016 in general models of microalgae growth kinetics can be categorized as single limitation or co limitation approaches in single limitation models it is commonly assumed that algal growth kinetics is either limited by a single substrate n p co2 or light intensity for co limitation models either a threshold or multiplicative conceptualization is adopted lee and zhang 2016 in this study we propose a novel hybrid algal photosynthesis and ion exchange hapix process to recover nutrients from high nh4 strength wastewater it is hypothesized that nh4 in the wastewater will be absorbed by the zeolite and exchanged with cations such as na and k adsorption of nh4 will reduce fa concentrations in the liquid phase to below inhibitory levels for algae growth moreover algae grown under n depleted conditions tend to accumulate lipids while algae grown in high n wastewater tend to have a higher protein content shifrin and chisholm 1981 solovchenko et al 2008 we hypothesize that by controlling the zeolite dosages the aqueous phase nh4 concentrations are regulated which will tune the intracellular contents of harvested algae for example low ix doses will result in algae with a high protein content which can be used as a biofertilizer while high ix doses will produce algae with a high lipid content which can be used for biofuel production to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to combine ix with algal photosynthesis for high nh4 strength wastewater treatment benefits of the hapix process are to 1 reduce the toxicity of high strength nh4 wastewater on microalgae 2 handle the shock load by the hybrid ix process and enhance system stability jorgensen and weatherley 2003 3 regulate the production of intracellular products by varying zeolite dosages the specific objectives of this study are to 1 evaluate the impact of zeolite dosage on the nh4 removal efficiencies 2 assess the impact of zeolite dosages on intracellular compounds of harvested algal biomass 3 develop a mathematical model to predict nh4 removal and algal biomass growth in the hapix reactor 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of anaerobic digester centrate centrate used in this study was obtained from a pilot anaerobic digester treating waste activated sludge from an enhanced biological n and p removal treatment facility tampa florida the anaerobic digester had a working volume of 24 l and was operated for over 100 days under thermophilic 45 55 c conditions with a solids residence time srt of 20 days effluent from the digester was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min the supernatant from this initial solid liquid separation step was further filtered through 1 5 μm filter paper 934 ah whatman characteristics of the centrate are summarized in table 1 2 2 hapix reactor setup wild type algae chlorella 95 of the total cells originally harvested from a local wastewater treatment plant were enriched in diluted anaerobic digester centrate for this study halfhide et al 2014 algae were settled for 24 h and the settled algae were collected as the inoculum for the hapix reactors the chlorophyll a and dry weight of the algal inoculum was 81 1 2 5 mg l 1 and 5412 159 mg l 1 respectively the algal inoculum was washed three times with di water to remove residuals from the diluted sludge centrate before seeding the hapix reactors bowie chabazite a type of zeolite product code azlb ca from st cloud mine new mexico was sieved to obtain a particle size between 1 0 and 1 4 mm chabazite particles were washed with di five times to remove fine particles washed chabazite was placed in 500 ml erlenmeyer flasks with di water and shaken at 110 rpm for 24 h the pretreated chabazite was dried at 100 c in an oven for the following experiments chabazite dosages evaluated were 60 ia 60 150 ia 150 and 250 ia 250 g l 1 based on isotherm and kinetics studies s1 the operational strategy of the hapix reactors is shown in fig 1 briefly 1 l erlenmeyer flasks were set up with 500 ml of centrate and various chabazite dosages reactors were set up in duplicate in a 21 2 c constant temperature room a shaking table set at 100 10 rpm provided mixing for all the reactors after 24 h adsorption when the nh4 concentration was reduced below 200 mg l 1 40 ml of pre washed algae inoculum was added to each flask which was recorded as day 0 of the hapix process di water was added as needed to account for water evaporation the reactors were continuously illuminated at 121 6 μmol m 2 s 1 by three 35 w commercial electric white led lights chabazite always remained resident at the bottom of reactors due to its high density the hapix reactors were operated in three phases fig 1 during phase 1 algae were grown in the centrate after ix suspended algae were harvested by centrifugation at 3800 rpm for 10 min when the algal biomass concentrations reached stationary state supernatant after algae harvesting was replaced into the original reactors for the continuous growth of algae during phase 2 and phase 3 reactors with only algal biomass were also set up as controls a control chabazite at the same dosages as hapix reactors without the addition of algae were set up as the ix controls ix 60 ix 150 and ix 250 the ix controls were covered with parafilm and aluminum foil to reduce the potential biological activity 2 3 analytical methods algal biomass dry weight total suspended solids tss total

assay kits interchim france the lipid contents were analysis by a commercial laboratory eurofins scientific us according to the aoac method 996 06 2 4 statistical analysis the statistical differences of the nitrogen removal and intracellular contents of algae at different zeolite dosages were evaluated by anova p 0 05 using excel 2013 microsoft us 3 mathematical modeling a mathematical model was developed to test the hypothesis that ix and photosynthetic growth of algae captures the processes of nh4 removal and algal biomass production in the hapix reactors the model considers the limiting diffusion process as intraparticle surface diffusion which is characterized by probabilistically rare hops of ions between ix sites in the zeolite framework auerbach et al 2003 for ionic fluxes based on fickian diffusion the flux term is given by 1 j n h 4 ρ d s q n h 4 r r r where j n h 4 meq m 2 h 1 is the flux of nh4 ions ρ g m 3 is the density of the chabazite particles d s m2 h 1 is the

mass balance is given by 2 q n h 4 t d s r 2 r r 2 q n h 4 r where r m is the radial coordinate within the solid material q n h 4 meq g 1 is the solid phase nh4 concentration meq g 1 t d is time and d s m2 d 1 is the surface diffusion coefficient key limiting factors of algal growth are light co2 n and p lee and zhang 2016 recently lee and zhang 2016 showed that for nh4 n concentrations 150 mg l 1 a co limitation model without inhibition provided a reasonable growth prediction in comparison to experimental chlorella growth data therefore we adopted a monod expression for the n utilization rate light and temperature factors were expressed using the chalker model combined with the arrhenius equation which leads to the following rate equation 3 r a μ max c n h 4 x a y a k s n h 4 c n h 4 θ t

the average irradiance term i av μmol photon m 2 d 1 is included to account for light attenuation in the hapix reactor caused by self shading by algal biomass and is given by 4 i a v i 0 k d x a 1 exp k d x a where i 0 μmol photon m 2 d 1 is the incident light intensity k m2 g 1 is the light attenuation coefficient and d m is the reactor diameter assuming the temporal dynamics of the aqueous phase nh4 n concentration is driven by ix and algal biosynthesis we combined a fickian surface diffusion flux term eq 1 and the algae kinetic rate expression eq 3 to get the following expression for the aqueous phase nh4 n concentration 5 d c n h 4 d t 3 m r v d s q n h 4 r r r μ max c n h 4 x a y a k s n h 4 c n h 4 θ t 20 tanh i a v i k where m g is the mass of zeolite r is the radius of a

provided the starting point for the simulation of the hapix phase the following equations describe the initial conditions used for the solid phase 7 q n h 4 t 0 r 0 for the ix phase 8 q n h 4 t 0 r q h p x for the hapix phase where q n h 4 meq g 1 is initialized to have no adsorbed ions during the first 24 h of the experiment designated as the ix phase and q hpx meq g 1 is initial solid phase

na and q meq g 1 and k dimensionless are constants in the ix isotherm related to maximum adsorption capacity and affinity for the exchanger eq 9 imposes a symmetry boundary condition at the center of a chabazite particle and eq 10 assumes that at the surface of the zeolite the aqueous and sorbed phase concentrations of nh4 are in equilibrium the initial conditions for species in the aqueous phase

experimental conditions the model was implemented in matlab 2016 mathworks us details on the numerical implementation of the hapix model are discussed in the supplementary information s2 4 results and discussion 4 1 nh4 removal in hapix reactors cation concentration results from all hapix reactors showed that na was the major cation exchanged with nh4 fig 2 k in the centrate was also adsorbed by the chabazite prior studies have shown that the cation affinity sequence for chabazite is k nh4 na ca2 mg2 hedström 2001 the presence of k will compete with nh4 for ix sites wang and peng 2010 however nh4 concentrations 84 meq l 1 in the centrate were eight times higher than k concentrations 10 meq l 1 thus the effect of competition between k and nh4 was negligible during the initial 24 h of the ix process zeolite dosages of 60 150 and 250 g l 1 reduced the nh4 n concentrations from 1180 mg l 1 to 184 40 107 7 and 53 15 mg l 1 after adsorption respectively fig 2 the fa concentration which was affected by total ammonia nitrogen tan nh3 n nh4 n concentration ph and temperature was calculated according to eq 12 anthonisen et al 1976 kim et al 2008 12 n h 3 n t a n 10 p h exp 6334 273 t 10 p h where nh3 n mg n l 1 is the concentration of fa tan mg l 1 is the concentration of total ammonia nitrogen and t c is temperature the fa concentration of centrate used in this study was 65 8 mg l 1 which is much higher than the threshold inhibition level of algae of 28 mg l 1 källqvist and svenson 2003 addition of zeolite at 60 150 and 250 g l 1 reduced the fa concentrations to 2 5 0 7 and 1 mg l 1 respectively below the inhibitory level for algae the growth of algae in ia 60 ia 150 and ia 250 reactors during phase 1 further reduced the aqueous nh4 n concentrations to 47 3 11 9 10 5 2 8 and 5 5 0 2 mg l 1 respectively however nh4 n concentrations in ix controls without algae remained constant at 140 10 50 10 and 22 6 mg l 1 for ix 60 ix 150 and ix 250 respectively s3 figure s3 harvesting algae and recycling the supernatant in phases 2 and 3 supported continued growth of algae and maintained stable low nh4 n concentrations in the hapix reactors the nh4 n concentrations of ia 60 ia 150 and ia 250 were reduced to 10 1 0 8 6 5 0 2 and 6 5 1 1 mg l 1 at the end of phase 3 the 60 g l 1 zeolite dosage resulted in significantly higher final nh4 n concentration p 0 003 than dosages of 150 and 250 g l 1 while final nh4 n concentrations with zeolite dosages of 150 ad 250 g l 1 were not significantly different p 1 nh4 initially adsorbed in the solid phase of the chabazite was desorbed to support the continuous growth of algae assuming the n content in the algal biomass is 9 2 wang et al 2015 the n assimilated by algae during the three phases in ia 60 ia 150 and ia 250 were 146 115 and 109 mg respectively however the nh4 n removed from aqueous phase which is the difference of nh4 n mass after adsorption and the final effluent at the end of phase 3 were 87 48 and 23 mg for ia 60 ia 150 and ia 250 respectively the nh4 n assimilated by algae was higher than that removed from aqueous phase indicating desorption of nh4 from the solid phase supported the growth of algae note that nitrification and denitrification may have played a small role in n removal in the systems the inoculum used in this study was enriched in algal biomass in addition the hapix reactors were continuously illuminated which favors the growth of algae over nitrifiers only a small amount of nitrification and denitrification was observed during the first 24 h of adsorption however no nitrite or nitrate was detected 2 days after algae addition 4 2 temporal variation of cations in hapix reactors the overall cation concentrations in all the hapix reactors showed decreasing trends besides ix onto chabazite several physical chemical and biological mechanisms may contribute to changes in aqueous phase cation concentrations the increase in ph from 7 5 to 9 5 10 1 on day 9 likely induced precipitation of ca2 and mg2 which contributed to the decrease in liquid phase cations and conductivity s4 figure s4 similar results were observed by wang et al 2016 whereby precipitation contributed to ca2 and mg2 removal in an algal system used to treat reverse osmosis concentrate in addition to chemical precipitation cell surface adsorption and intracellular accumulation of metals by algae may have contributed to the decrease in cations suresh kumar et al 2015 the cell wall of algae consists of polysaccharides proteins lipids and functional groups such as carboxyl cooh hydroxyl oh phosphate po3 diphosphorus trioxide p2o3 amino nh2 sulfhydryl sh amide primary amine group halide group and aliphatic alkyl group which lead to a negative charge of the algal cell surface and a high affinity for cations most of the sites bind with na ca2 and mg2 at high ph gonzález dávila 1995 which may have contributed to the decrease in cations furthermore algae have been shown to favor assimilation of k over na schaedle and jacobson 1967 in this study a slight decrease in na was observed during phase 2 after day 13 the algae biomass most likely started to uptake na from solution when the k was depleted barber and shieh 1973 the presence of anionic complexing ligands or organic matter in the centrate may have also affected the ix capacity of the zeolite the ligands may compete with the surface for coordination reactions with metal ions suresh kumar et al 2015 the presence of organic matter may reduce the surface tension of the aqueous phase thereby enhancing the access of ions in the bulk liquid to the pores within the exchanger jorgensen and weatherley 2003 further research on cation transport and uptake by algae is needed to identify the mechanisms involved which will be helpful to understand the fate of cations in hapix reactors 4 3 algal biomass production as discussed in section 4 1 the addition of chabazite decreased the fa concentration below the toxic level for algae at all dosages algal biomass in all the hapix reactors increased from 500 mg l 1 to over 1500 mg l 1 by day 8 prior to harvesting fig 3 however inhibition of algae growth due to the high nh4 concentrations of the centrate 1000 mg n l 1 was observed in the algal control reactor without chabazite addition algae in ia 60 and ia 150 reached peak biomass concentrations on day 8 however algae in ia 250 reached steady state after only 6 days due to the relatively lower nh4 concentrations in the aqueous phase during phase 3 a longer lag period for the algae growth was observed due to the constant low nh4 concentrations in the aqueous phase the total algal biomass harvested over the three phases from ia 60 ia 150 and ia 250 were 1587 mg 1248 mg and 1187 mg respectively more algal biomass was harvested from the reactor with lower chabazite dosage supernatant was recycled in the reactors during phases 2 and 3 thus less cations were available for ix with nh4 adsorbed in the solid phase introducing fresh centrate with selective cations and creating a concentration gradient between the aqueous and solid phases may increase the selective reversal of nh4 desorption to the aqueous phase additionally the growth of biofilms on the surface of the chabazite during the latter periods of phases 2 and 3 may have inhibited mass transfer of nh4 from the chabazite to the aqueous phase a longer lag period is required to stimulate algae growth when less nh4 is available in the aqueous phase 4 4 effect of zeolite dosages on intracellular contents of algal biomass the intercellular contents of algae were regulated by the nh4 concentrations which could be controlled by modifying chabazite dosages in hapix reactors in this study protein contents of the harvested algal biomass ranged from 27 7 to 57 1 by dry weight and were much higher than starch or lipid contents at all chabazite dosages fig 4 algae grown in ia 60 had a significantly higher protein content 43 9 and 53 7 for phase 1 and phase 3 respectively in the algal biomass than ia 150 and ia 250 in contrast differences between protein contents of algae harvested with chabazite dosages of 150 g l 1 and 250 g l 1 were not significant p 0 73 due to the similar nh4 n concentration in the liquid phase the nh4 n concentrations of ia 150 and ia 250 at the end of phase 1 were 10 5 2 8 and 5 5 0 2 mg l 1 respectively which were close to that of ia 60 47 3 11 9 mg l 1 the nh4 n concentration of ia 150 and ia 250 at the end of phase 3 were 6 5 0 2 and 6 5 1 1 mg l 1 respectively the differences in the nh4 n concentrations of ia 150 and ia 250 were not high enough to result in significant differences in the protein contents of the algal biomass prior studies have shown that proteins in algae are mainly enzymatic proteins which could be useful as an animal feed source becker 2007 the starch contents of algal biomass in ia 60 ia 150 and ia 250 during phase 1 were 6 8 4 8 and 2 8 by dry weight respectively the starch contents of ia 60 and ia 150 in phase 3 increased to 11 2 and 8 9 by dry weight respectively while the starch content of algal biomass in ia 250 was the same as phase 1 probably due to the increase in ash content of the algal biomass in phase 3 the vss to tss ratio of ia 250 in phase 3 was only 54 15 while the vss to tss ratio of algal biomass harvested in ia 60 and ia 150 were 80 8 and 80 1 respectively in general the starch contents decreased with increasing zeolite dosages the total lipid as triacylglycerides tag were less than 10 by dry weight for all the chabazite dosages fig 4 algae harvested in phase 3 had higher tag content than phase 1 at dosages of 60 g l 1 ia 60 and 150 g l 1 ia 150 due to the low aqueous nh4 concentrations in phase 3 however the tag content of ia 250 in phase 3 was lower than that of phase 1 because of the high ash content of the algal biomass harvested in phase 3 as described earlier algae grown in wastewater with a high n content tend to have a low lipid content c vulgaris grown at 247 mg n l 1 had lipid content of 5 9 by dry weight converti et al 2009 chlorella grown in centrate from an activated sludge thickening process had a fatty acid methyl ester content of 9 98 11 04 by total vss li et al 2011 algae accumulate tag under n starvation conditions by activate acyltransferase shifrin and chisholm 1981 solovchenko et al 2008 sukenik and livne 1991 for example scenedesmus sp accumulated as high as 30 lipid under nitrogen limited conditions 2 5 mg l 1 xin et al 2010a deficiency of n from 1 4 mg l 1 to 0 31 mg l 1 triggered the accumulation of lipid content from 14 to 31 xin et al 2010b although the hapix reactors significantly reduced the nh4 n concentration of the anaerobically digested centrate to 6 5 10 mg l 1 at the end of phase 3 the n concentration was still not low enough to induce lipid accumulation in the algal biomass however using the hapix reactors to treat low strength wastewater such as primary or secondary effluent may create n deficient conditions that could accumulate high lipid contents in algae for biofuel production the lipid content of algae mainly consisted of tag which are composed of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids wang et al 2010 approximately 67 70 of fatty acids in the algal biomass harvested from hapix reactors were unsaturated of which 43 54 were polyunsaturated fatty acids table 2 the fatty acids are mainly composed of c16 0 c16 1 c18 0 c18 2 and c18 3 among which palmitic acid c16 0 oleic acid c18 1 linoleic acid c 18 2 and linolenic acid c 18 3 were the dominant fatty acids similar results were found by wang et al 2012 where the dominant fatty acids produced by chlorella were hexadecanoic acid c 16 0 linoleic acid c 18 2 and linolenic acid c 18 3 although the unsaturated fatty acids are an ideal feedstock to produce biofuels the low fatty acid content in the algae from the hapix reactors treating high nh4 strength wastewater 1000 mg n l 1 make them less economically viable for biofuel production 4 5 assessment of mathematical model for hapix 4 5 1 hapix model parameter determination application of the mathematical model requires determination of parameters related to both ix and algal photosynthetic processes the experimental data for a chabazite dose of 150 g l 1 was used for model calibration while the doses of 60 g l 1 and 250 g l 1 were used for model validation estimation of the parameters for ix was performed in two steps i the maximum ion exchange capacity q and the selectivity coefficient k were fit to batch isotherm data in s1 ii the surface diffusion coefficient d s was determined by fitting the hsdm to experimental kinetic data in s1 a limitation of the ix isotherm used in the model is that it considers exchange strictly between nh4 and na however a wastewater that contains other background cations especially k would reduce the rate of uptake of nh4 ions onto chabazite which would affect the ix capacity q and selectivity coefficient k parameters determined in the model thus a future research direction that would enhance the model s applicability in a full scale system would be to incorporate the effect of k ions on the ix process estimation of the parameters related to algal photosynthesis was done using the following approach i a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the most sensitive parameters ii the most sensitive parameters were calibrated whereas the least sensitive parameters were determined from the literature the sensitivity analysis was conducted using an automated algorithm that uses a gauss newton levenberg marquadt method doherty 2010 the algorithm calculates a dimensionless composite sensitivity value which is a measure of the impact a change in a parameter value has on model output doherty 2010 results table 3 indicated that the two most sensitive parameters were the light attenuation constant k m2 g 1 and the maximum specific growth rate μ max d 1 calibration of k from 0 2 to 0 8 m2 g 1 and μ max from 0 96 to 0 5 d 1 in the developed model led to a good fit of the experimental data fig 5 a shows the concentration history of nh4 n in the aqueous phase using the parameters shown in table 3 the model captures the processes within hapix reactor as shown by the removal of most of the nh4 within the first 4 h followed by a period of relatively constant concentrations fig 5b shows the experimental data and simulated algal biomass concentration the model simulation shows an increase in algal biomass concentration corresponding with a decrease in the nh4 n the r2 value of 0 85 suggests that the growth process assuming light and nh4 as limiting factors is sufficient to predict the observed microalgae growth dynamics 4 5 2 prediction of nh4 concentrations in aqueous phase simulated temporal variations of the nh4 n concentration and experimental data for dosages of 60 and 250 g l 1 are shown in fig 6 note that the simulation results only show model correspondence to phase 1 of the experimental data since the periodic algal harvesting and recycling of supernatant introduced external factors that may affect the ix process thus it was infeasible to appropriately specify the solid phase nh4 concentrations in phases 2 and 3 which are required for assigning quantitative initial conditions in the model the model is in reasonable agreement r2 0 83 and r2 0 7 with the observed concentrations showing that most of the removal occurs within the first 100 h of the hapix process the nh4 removal rates markedly increased with the increase of zeolite dosage within the first 50 h of the hapix process because high zeolite dosages have more available ix sites for nh4 adsorption overall for each dosage the model provides a reasonable description of the experimental data in general the model predicted lower nh4 concentrations than were observed in the effluent most likely because mass transfer resistance due to algal biomass growth was neglected in this study the chabazite sank to the bottom of the reactors where limited light was available for the algal biofilm growth on the surface of the chabazite however there is more surface area of the highest chabazite dosage 250 g l 1 for algal biofilm growth incorporating mass transfer resistance caused by the presence of a biofilm on the zeolite surface would reduce the rate at which ions diffuse into the zeolite which would lead to an improved representation of the data however a caveat is that an additional parameter a mass transfer coefficient would need to be introduced which would require further experimental justification model and experimental microalgae growth results for phase 1 of hapix operation for dosages of 60 and 250 g l 1 are shown in fig 7 a and b the model prediction is in good agreement r2 0 98 with the experimental data for a dose of 60 g l 1 however for a dose 250 g l 1 the model does not predict as rapid a rate of biomass growth observed experimentally r2 0 58 this slower growth rate predicted by the model is most likely because the highest dosage resulted in lowest aqueous phase nh4 concentrations so less n was available to support algal growth nevertheless the model captures the trend of the algae growth data showing linear growth characteristics this positive trend corresponds with the utilization of nh4 n in solution and conversion of light nutrients and co2 to new algal cells the model behavior is consistent with recent findings from the model developed by lee and zhang 2016 which was fit to experimental algal biomass growth for centrate of various characteristics 5 conclusions this research demonstrated that the hapix process is suitable for treatment of high nh4 strength wastewater 1000 mg n l 1 without dilution zeolite dosages of 60 150 and 250 g l 1 resulted in stable nh4 n concentrations lower than 10 1 0 8 mg l 1 in the effluent algae control reactors without zeolite addition showed no algae growth the ix process reduced the fa of the centrate from 4 7 mm to 0 18 mm and promoted algae growth different dosages of zeolite resulted in different nh4 n concentrations in the aqueous phase and different protein and starch contents of the algal biomass zeolite dosages at 60 g l 1 resulted in higher protein and starch contents in the algal biomass than doses of 150 g l 1 and 250 g l 1 valuable products may be extracted from the harvested algal biomass due to the high protein content 27 57 by dry weight about 67 70 of the fatty acid in the algal biomass were unsaturated fatty acids the lipid contents in all the cultures were lower than 10 which are not economically feasible to produce biofuels a mathematical model describing the hapix process was developed that predicts the fate of nh4 n and algal biomass growth over time the light attenuation constant k and the maximum specific growth rate μ max were the most sensitive parameters in the model calibration of k from 0 2 to 0 8 m2 g 1 and μ max from 0 96 to 0 5 d 1 in the developed model led to a good fit of the experimental data the hapix process serves a two fold purpose treatment of high nh4 n strength wastewater and production of agricultural and commercial biopolymers the main limitation of the modeling framework is that the model does not account for algal biomass growth on the zeolite with time future work could be focused on accounting for both suspended and attached growth into the model moreover the model can be integrated with computational fluid

19462,a hybrid algal photosynthesis and ion exchange hapix process was developed that uses natural zeolite chabazite and wild type algae to treat high ammonium nh4 strength wastewater in the hapix process nh4 is temporarily adsorbed from the liquid which reduces the free ammonia fa concentration below the inhibitory level for algal growth the slow release of adsorbed nh4 subsequently supports the continuous growth of algae in this study a hapix reactor reduced nh4 n concentrations in centrate from an anaerobic digester from 1180 mg l 1 to below 10 mg l 1 without dilution chabazite doses of 60 g l 1 produced more algal biomass with higher protein and starch contents than doses of 150 g l 1 and 250 g l 1 approximately 67 70 of fatty acids in the algal biomass harvested from hapix reactors were unsaturated a mathematical framework that couples a homogeneous surface diffusion model with a co limitation algal kinetic growth model reasonably predicted the algal biomass production and nh4 n concentrations in the hapix reactors the hapix process has the potential to serve a two fold purpose of high nh4 n strength wastewater treatment and agricultural or commercial biopolymer production graphical abstract image 1 keywords ion exchange algal photosynthesis high ammonium strength wastewater mathematical modeling intracellular contents of algae 1 introduction management of the nitrogen n cycle was identified by the national academy of engineering as one of the grand challenges of the 21st century a major source of n is high ammonium nh4 strength wastewaters such as industrial wastewaters e g food processing fertilizer plastic industries landfill leachate source separated urine and centrate from anaerobic digestion these wastewater streams are challenging and expensive to treat kjeldsen et al 2002 udert et al 2003 anaerobic digestion centrate is of particular interest since anaerobic digestion technology is being promoted for stabilization and bioenergy recovery from waste resources such as sewage sludge and food waste cantrell et al 2008 the high nh4 strength centrate is often recycled back to the head of the wastewater treatment plant resulting in high irregular nutrient loads that can upset mainstream biological n removal bnr processes and increase costs fux et al 2006 wett and alex 2003 although a number of advanced bnr processes such as shortcut n removal nitritation denitritation and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox have been developed to reduce the energy and chemical costs of high nh4 strength wastewater treatment kotay et al 2013 lackner et al 2014 third et al 2005 utilization of algae for treatment of these wastewater presents an opportunity for co production of biofuels high value chemicals and animal feeds li et al 2011 park et al 2010 rusten and sahu 2011 wang and park 2015 wang et al 2015 the high nutrient concentrations in these wastewaters also have the potential to support higher algal biomass densities than low strength wastewaters e g secondary tertiary effluent resulting in lower downstream costs for thickening and dewatering halfhide et al 2014 however nh4 n concentrations greater than 200 300 mg l 1 are known to inhibit algae growth due to the uncoupling effect of free ammonia fa on the photosynthetic processes in chloroplasts crofts 1966 lin et al 2007 park et al 2010 prior studies have addressed this issue by dilution with fresh water or low strength wastewater or using a fed batch bioreactor approach wang et al 2010 2015 yuan et al 2012 strategies to reduce the fa toxicity are needed to promote the implementation of algae cultivation in high nh4 strength wastewater zeolites are natural hydrated aluminosilicate materials with a high affinity for nh4 ions malovanyy et al 2013 rožić et al 2000 compared with the polymeric cation exchange resins natural zeolites have a lower cost per gram of n removed in addition shrinking and swelling in polymeric resins can occur depending on the extent of polymer cross linking these changes are insignificant for natural zeolites and are less likely to have an impact which is an important consideration since some extracellular polymeric substance can deposit on the surface of the ix media tarpeh et al 2017 common forms of natural zeolite include clinoptilolite mordenite phillipsite chabazite stilbite analcime and laumontite wang and peng 2010 clinoptilolite is the most abundant and lowest cost natural zeolite material however its nh4 capacity is low compared with chabazite amini et al 2017 aponte morales 2015 prior studies of biological treatment of high nh4 strength wastewaters have successfully used the ion exchange ix capacity of natural zeolites to reduce the toxicity of fa to nitrifying prokaryotes aponte morales et al 2016 2018 martins et al 2017 tada et al 2005 biological processes such as nitrification will consume nh4 in the aqueous phase and promote desorption of nh4 from the solid phase the zeolite can therefore be biologically regenerated thus less chemicals are required to regenerate the spent zeolite prior research showed that a chabazite amended sequencing batch reactor was able to treat anaerobically digested swine waste without loss of ix efficiency for over 40 cycles of operation aponte morales et al 2016 combining the ix process with algae cultivation has the potential to treat high nh4 strength wastewater without dilution the adsorbed nh4 in the solid phase will be desorbed to support continuous algal growth when the nh4 in the aqueous phase is consumed in addition no prior studies have presented a mathematical description of ix combined with algal photosynthesis such a study can improve the understanding of the underlying physical chemical and biological mechanisms several prior studies have focused on surface diffusion models of ix in zeolites and microporous materials auerbach et al 2003 krishna and wesselingh 1997 lito et al 2014 or algal photosynthesis kinetics juneja et al 2013 lee and zhang 2016 however coupling ix and algal photosynthesis kinetics into a mathematical framework has not previously been investigated a prior study in our research group demonstrated that a fickian based continuum scale model the homogenous surface diffusion model hsdm combined with a kinetic model of fa inhibited nitrification the andrew s model described ix assisted nitrification and bioregeneration aponte morales et al 2018 however microalgae growth is influenced by different factors than nitrification including temperature light availability ph and the concentrations of nutrients such as n and phosphorus p juneja et al 2013 a comprehensive review of the various models of microalgae growth kinetics is presented elsewhere lee and zhang 2016 in general models of microalgae growth kinetics can be categorized as single limitation or co limitation approaches in single limitation models it is commonly assumed that algal growth kinetics is either limited by a single substrate n p co2 or light intensity for co limitation models either a threshold or multiplicative conceptualization is adopted lee and zhang 2016 in this study we propose a novel hybrid algal photosynthesis and ion exchange hapix process to recover nutrients from high nh4 strength wastewater it is hypothesized that nh4 in the wastewater will be absorbed by the zeolite and exchanged with cations such as na and k adsorption of nh4 will reduce fa concentrations in the liquid phase to below inhibitory levels for algae growth moreover algae grown under n depleted conditions tend to accumulate lipids while algae grown in high n wastewater tend to have a higher protein content shifrin and chisholm 1981 solovchenko et al 2008 we hypothesize that by controlling the zeolite dosages the aqueous phase nh4 concentrations are regulated which will tune the intracellular contents of harvested algae for example low ix doses will result in algae with a high protein content which can be used as a biofertilizer while high ix doses will produce algae with a high lipid content which can be used for biofuel production to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to combine ix with algal photosynthesis for high nh4 strength wastewater treatment benefits of the hapix process are to 1 reduce the toxicity of high strength nh4 wastewater on microalgae 2 handle the shock load by the hybrid ix process and enhance system stability jorgensen and weatherley 2003 3 regulate the production of intracellular products by varying zeolite dosages the specific objectives of this study are to 1 evaluate the impact of zeolite dosage on the nh4 removal efficiencies 2 assess the impact of zeolite dosages on intracellular compounds of harvested algal biomass 3 develop a mathematical model to predict nh4 removal and algal biomass growth in the hapix reactor 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of anaerobic digester centrate centrate used in this study was obtained from a pilot anaerobic digester treating waste activated sludge from an enhanced biological n and p removal treatment facility tampa florida the anaerobic digester had a working volume of 24 l and was operated for over 100 days under thermophilic 45 55 c conditions with a solids residence time srt of 20 days effluent from the digester was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min the supernatant from this initial solid liquid separation step was further filtered through 1 5 μm filter paper 934 ah whatman characteristics of the centrate are summarized in table 1 2 2 hapix reactor setup wild type algae chlorella 95 of the total cells originally harvested from a local wastewater treatment plant were enriched in diluted anaerobic digester centrate for this study halfhide et al 2014 algae were settled for 24 h and the settled algae were collected as the inoculum for the hapix reactors the chlorophyll a and dry weight of the algal inoculum was 81 1 2 5 mg l 1 and 5412 159 mg l 1 respectively the algal inoculum was washed three times with di water to remove residuals from the diluted sludge centrate before seeding the hapix reactors bowie chabazite a type of zeolite product code azlb ca from st cloud mine new mexico was sieved to obtain a particle size between 1 0 and 1 4 mm chabazite particles were washed with di five times to remove fine particles washed chabazite was placed in 500 ml erlenmeyer flasks with di water and shaken at 110 rpm for 24 h the pretreated chabazite was dried at 100 c in an oven for the following experiments chabazite dosages evaluated were 60 ia 60 150 ia 150 and 250 ia 250 g l 1 based on isotherm and kinetics studies s1 the operational strategy of the hapix reactors is shown in fig 1 briefly 1 l erlenmeyer flasks were set up with 500 ml of centrate and various chabazite dosages reactors were set up in duplicate in a 21 2 c constant temperature room a shaking table set at 100 10 rpm provided mixing for all the reactors after 24 h adsorption when the nh4 concentration was reduced below 200 mg l 1 40 ml of pre washed algae inoculum was added to each flask which was recorded as day 0 of the hapix process di water was added as needed to account for water evaporation the reactors were continuously illuminated at 121 6 μmol m 2 s 1 by three 35 w commercial electric white led lights chabazite always remained resident at the bottom of reactors due to its high density the hapix reactors were operated in three phases fig 1 during phase 1 algae were grown in the centrate after ix suspended algae were harvested by centrifugation at 3800 rpm for 10 min when the algal biomass concentrations reached stationary state supernatant after algae harvesting was replaced into the original reactors for the continuous growth of algae during phase 2 and phase 3 reactors with only algal biomass were also set up as controls a control chabazite at the same dosages as hapix reactors without the addition of algae were set up as the ix controls ix 60 ix

of the nitrogen removal and intracellular contents of algae at different zeolite dosages were evaluated by anova p 0 05 using excel 2013 microsoft us 3 mathematical modeling a mathematical model was developed to test the hypothesis that ix and photosynthetic growth of algae captures the processes of nh4 removal and algal biomass production in the hapix reactors the model considers the limiting diffusion process as intraparticle surface diffusion which is characterized by probabilistically rare hops of ions between ix sites in the zeolite framework auerbach et al 2003 for ionic fluxes based on fickian diffusion the flux term is given by 1 j n h 4 ρ d s q n h 4 r r r where j n h 4 meq m 2 h 1 is the flux of nh4 ions ρ g m 3 is the density of the chabazite particles d s m2 h 1 is the surface diffusivity r m is the radial coordinate within the solid material q n h 4 meq g 1 is the solid phase nh4 concentration and r m is the radius of a chabazite particle in the solid phase the mass balance is given by 2 q n h 4 t d s r 2 r r 2 q n h 4 r where r m is the radial coordinate within the solid material q n h 4 meq g 1 is the solid phase nh4 concentration meq g 1 t d is time and d s m2 d 1 is the surface diffusion coefficient key limiting factors of algal growth are light co2 n and p lee and zhang 2016 recently lee and zhang 2016 showed that for nh4 n concentrations 150 mg l 1 a co limitation model without inhibition provided a reasonable growth prediction in comparison to experimental chlorella growth data therefore we adopted a monod expression for the n utilization rate light and temperature factors were expressed using the chalker model combined with the arrhenius equation which leads to the following rate equation 3 r a μ max c n h 4 x a y a k s n h 4 c n h 4 θ t 20 tanh i a v i k where μ max d 1 is the maximum specific growth rate x a g l 1 is the algal biomass concentration y a is the yield coefficient dimensionless k s n h 4 meq l 1 is the half saturation

the average irradiance term i av μmol photon m 2 d 1 is included to account for light attenuation in the hapix reactor caused by self shading by algal biomass and is given by 4 i a v i 0 k d x a 1 exp k d x a where i 0 μmol photon m 2 d 1 is the incident light intensity k m2 g 1 is the light attenuation coefficient and d m is the reactor diameter assuming the temporal dynamics of the aqueous phase nh4 n concentration is driven by ix and algal biosynthesis we combined a fickian surface diffusion flux term eq 1 and the algae kinetic rate expression eq 3 to get the following expression for the aqueous phase nh4 n concentration 5 d c n h 4 d t 3 m r v d s q n h 4 r r r μ max c n h 4 x a y a k s n h 4 c n h 4 θ t 20 tanh i a v i k where m g is the mass of zeolite r is the radius of a chabazite particle m and v is the volume of liquid l we assume no algal biomass decay so that the phototrophic biomass growth rate can be obtained from the rate equation for algal photosynthesis 6 d x a d t y a r a to complete the mathematical model initial conditions are required to solve the hapix system represented by eqs 5 and 6 to simulate the experimental conditions during the 24 h adsorption phase no nh4 was assumed to initially be present in the zeolite when algae were added after the ix phase both ix and nh4 assimilation by algae occurred hapix phase the end of the adsorption phase provided the starting point for the simulation of the hapix phase the following equations describe the initial conditions used for the solid phase 7 q n h 4 t 0 r 0 for the ix phase 8 q n h 4 t 0 r q

experimental conditions the model was implemented in matlab 2016 mathworks us details on the numerical implementation of the hapix model are discussed in the supplementary information s2 4 results and discussion 4 1 nh4 removal in hapix reactors cation concentration results from all hapix reactors showed that na was the major cation exchanged with nh4 fig 2 k in the centrate was also adsorbed by the chabazite prior studies have shown that the cation affinity sequence for chabazite is k nh4 na ca2 mg2 hedström 2001 the presence of k will compete with nh4 for ix sites wang and peng 2010 however nh4 concentrations 84 meq l 1 in the centrate were eight times higher than k concentrations 10 meq l 1 thus the effect of competition between k and nh4 was negligible during the initial 24 h of the ix process zeolite dosages of 60 150 and 250 g l 1 reduced the nh4 n concentrations from 1180 mg l 1 to 184 40 107 7 and 53 15 mg l 1 after adsorption respectively fig 2 the fa concentration which was affected by total ammonia nitrogen tan nh3 n nh4 n concentration ph and temperature was calculated according to eq 12 anthonisen et al 1976 kim et al 2008 12 n h 3 n t a n 10 p h exp 6334 273 t 10 p h where nh3 n mg n l 1 is the concentration of fa tan mg l 1 is the concentration of total ammonia nitrogen and t c is temperature the fa concentration of centrate used in this study was 65 8 mg l 1 which is much higher than the threshold inhibition level of algae of 28 mg l 1 källqvist and svenson 2003 addition of zeolite at 60 150 and 250 g l 1 reduced the fa concentrations to 2 5 0 7 and 1 mg l 1 respectively below the inhibitory level for algae the growth of algae in ia 60 ia 150 and ia 250 reactors during phase 1 further reduced the aqueous nh4 n concentrations to 47 3 11 9 10 5 2 8 and 5 5 0 2 mg l 1 respectively however nh4 n concentrations in ix controls without algae remained constant at 140 10 50 10 and 22 6 mg l 1 for ix 60 ix 150 and ix 250 respectively s3 figure s3 harvesting algae and recycling the supernatant in phases 2 and 3 supported continued growth of algae and maintained stable low nh4 n concentrations in the hapix reactors the nh4 n concentrations of ia 60 ia 150 and ia 250 were reduced to 10 1 0 8 6 5 0 2 and 6 5 1 1 mg l 1 at the end of phase 3 the 60 g l 1 zeolite dosage resulted in significantly higher final nh4 n concentration p 0 003 than dosages of 150 and 250 g l 1 while final nh4 n concentrations with zeolite dosages of 150 ad 250 g l 1 were not significantly different p 1 nh4 initially adsorbed in the solid phase of the chabazite was desorbed to support the continuous growth of algae assuming the n content in the algal biomass is 9 2 wang et al 2015 the n assimilated by algae during the three phases in ia 60 ia 150 and ia 250 were 146 115 and 109 mg respectively however the nh4 n removed from aqueous phase which is the difference of nh4 n mass after adsorption and the final effluent at the end of phase 3 were 87 48 and 23 mg for ia 60 ia 150 and ia 250 respectively the nh4 n assimilated by algae was higher than that removed from aqueous phase indicating desorption of nh4 from the solid phase supported the growth of algae note that nitrification and denitrification may have played a small role in n removal in the systems the inoculum used in this study was enriched in algal biomass in addition the hapix reactors were continuously illuminated which favors the growth of algae over nitrifiers only a small amount of nitrification and denitrification was observed during the first 24 h of adsorption however no nitrite or nitrate was detected 2 days after algae addition 4 2 temporal variation of cations in hapix reactors the overall cation concentrations in all the hapix reactors showed decreasing trends besides ix onto chabazite several physical chemical and biological mechanisms may contribute to changes in aqueous phase cation concentrations the increase in ph from 7 5 to 9 5 10 1 on day 9 likely induced precipitation of ca2 and mg2 which contributed to the decrease in liquid phase cations and conductivity s4 figure s4 similar results were observed by wang et al 2016 whereby precipitation contributed to ca2 and mg2 removal in an algal system used to treat reverse osmosis concentrate in addition to chemical precipitation cell surface adsorption and intracellular accumulation of metals by algae may have contributed to the decrease in cations suresh kumar et al 2015 the cell wall of algae consists of polysaccharides proteins lipids and functional groups such as carboxyl cooh hydroxyl oh phosphate po3 diphosphorus trioxide p2o3 amino nh2 sulfhydryl sh amide primary amine group halide group and aliphatic alkyl group which lead to a negative charge of the algal cell surface and a high affinity for cations most of the sites bind with na ca2 and mg2 at high ph gonzález dávila 1995 which may have contributed to the decrease in cations furthermore algae have been shown to favor assimilation of k over na schaedle and jacobson 1967 in this study a slight decrease in na was observed during phase 2 after day 13 the algae biomass most likely started to uptake na from solution when the k was depleted barber and shieh 1973 the presence of anionic complexing ligands or organic matter in the centrate may have also affected the ix capacity of the zeolite the ligands may compete with the surface for coordination reactions with metal ions suresh kumar et al 2015 the presence of organic matter may reduce the surface tension of the aqueous phase thereby enhancing the access of ions in the bulk liquid to the pores within the exchanger jorgensen and weatherley 2003 further research on cation transport and uptake by algae is needed to identify the mechanisms involved which will be helpful to understand the fate of cations in hapix reactors 4 3 algal biomass production as discussed in section 4 1 the addition of chabazite decreased the fa concentration below the toxic level for algae at all dosages algal biomass in all the hapix reactors increased from 500 mg l 1 to over 1500 mg l 1 by day 8 prior to harvesting fig 3 however inhibition of algae growth due to the high nh4 concentrations of the centrate 1000 mg n l 1 was observed in the algal control reactor without chabazite addition algae in ia 60 and ia 150 reached peak biomass concentrations on day 8 however algae in ia 250 reached steady state after only 6 days due to the relatively lower nh4 concentrations in the aqueous phase during phase 3 a longer lag period for the algae growth was observed due to the constant low nh4 concentrations in the aqueous phase the total algal biomass harvested over the three phases from ia 60 ia 150 and ia 250 were 1587 mg 1248 mg and 1187 mg respectively more algal biomass was harvested from the reactor with lower chabazite dosage supernatant was recycled in the reactors during phases 2 and 3 thus less cations were available for ix with nh4 adsorbed in the solid phase introducing fresh centrate with selective cations and creating a concentration gradient between the aqueous and solid phases may increase the selective reversal of nh4 desorption to the aqueous phase additionally the growth of biofilms on the surface of the chabazite during the latter periods of phases 2 and 3 may have inhibited mass transfer of nh4 from the chabazite to the aqueous phase a longer lag period is required to stimulate algae growth when less nh4 is available in the aqueous phase 4 4 effect of zeolite dosages on intracellular contents of algal biomass the intercellular contents of algae were regulated by the nh4 concentrations which could be controlled by modifying chabazite dosages in hapix reactors in this study protein contents of the harvested algal biomass ranged from 27 7 to 57 1 by dry weight and were much higher than starch or lipid contents at all chabazite dosages fig 4 algae grown in ia 60 had a significantly higher protein content 43 9 and 53 7 for phase 1 and phase 3 respectively in the algal biomass than ia 150 and ia 250 in contrast differences between protein contents of algae harvested with chabazite dosages of 150 g l 1 and 250 g l 1 were not significant p 0 73 due to the similar nh4 n concentration in the liquid phase the nh4 n concentrations of ia 150 and ia 250 at the end of phase 1 were 10 5 2 8 and 5 5 0 2 mg l 1 respectively which were close to that of ia 60 47 3 11 9 mg l 1 the nh4 n concentration of ia 150 and ia 250 at the end of phase 3 were 6 5 0 2 and 6 5 1 1 mg l 1 respectively the differences in the nh4 n concentrations of ia 150 and ia 250 were not high enough to result in significant differences in the protein contents of the algal biomass prior studies have shown that proteins in algae are mainly enzymatic proteins which could be useful as an animal feed source becker 2007 the starch contents of algal biomass in ia 60 ia 150 and ia 250 during phase 1 were 6 8 4 8 and 2 8 by dry weight respectively the starch contents of ia 60 and ia 150 in phase 3 increased to 11 2 and 8 9 by dry weight respectively while the starch content of algal biomass in ia 250 was the same as phase 1 probably due to the increase in ash content of the algal biomass in phase 3 the vss to tss ratio of ia 250 in phase 3 was only 54 15 while the vss to tss ratio of algal biomass harvested in ia 60 and ia 150 were 80 8 and 80 1 respectively in general the starch contents decreased with increasing zeolite dosages the total lipid as triacylglycerides tag were less than 10 by dry weight for all the chabazite dosages fig 4 algae harvested in phase 3 had higher tag content than phase 1 at dosages of 60 g l 1 ia 60 and 150 g l 1 ia 150 due to the low aqueous nh4 concentrations in phase 3 however the tag content of ia 250 in phase 3 was lower than that of phase 1 because of the high ash content of the algal biomass harvested in phase 3 as described earlier algae grown in wastewater with a high n content tend to have a low lipid content c vulgaris grown at 247 mg n l 1 had lipid content of 5 9 by dry weight converti et al 2009 chlorella grown in centrate from an activated sludge thickening process had a fatty acid methyl ester content of 9 98 11 04 by total vss li et al 2011 algae accumulate tag under n starvation conditions by activate acyltransferase shifrin and chisholm 1981 solovchenko et al 2008 sukenik and livne 1991 for example scenedesmus sp accumulated as high as 30 lipid under nitrogen limited conditions 2 5 mg l 1 xin et al 2010a deficiency of n from 1 4 mg l 1 to 0 31 mg l 1 triggered the accumulation of lipid content from 14 to 31 xin et al 2010b although the hapix reactors significantly reduced the nh4 n concentration of the anaerobically digested centrate to 6 5 10 mg l 1 at the end of phase 3 the n concentration was still not low enough to induce lipid accumulation in the algal biomass however using the hapix reactors to treat low strength wastewater such as primary or secondary effluent may create n deficient conditions that could accumulate high lipid contents in algae for biofuel production the lipid content of algae mainly consisted of tag which are composed of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids wang et al 2010 approximately 67 70 of fatty acids in the algal biomass harvested from hapix reactors were unsaturated of which 43 54 were polyunsaturated fatty acids table 2 the fatty acids are mainly composed of c16 0 c16 1 c18 0 c18 2 and c18 3 among which palmitic acid c16 0 oleic acid c18 1 linoleic acid c 18 2 and linolenic acid c 18 3 were the dominant fatty acids similar results were found by wang et al 2012 where the dominant fatty acids produced by chlorella were hexadecanoic acid c 16 0 linoleic acid c 18 2 and linolenic acid c 18 3 although the unsaturated fatty acids are an ideal feedstock to produce biofuels the low fatty acid content in the algae from the hapix reactors treating high nh4 strength wastewater 1000 mg n l 1 make them less economically viable for biofuel production 4 5 assessment of mathematical model for hapix 4 5 1 hapix model parameter determination application of the mathematical model requires determination of parameters related to both ix and algal photosynthetic processes the experimental data for a chabazite dose of 150 g l 1 was used for model calibration while the doses of 60 g l 1 and 250 g l 1 were used for model validation estimation of the parameters for ix was performed in two steps i the maximum ion exchange capacity q and the selectivity coefficient k were fit to batch isotherm data in s1 ii the surface diffusion coefficient d s was determined by fitting the hsdm to experimental kinetic data in s1 a limitation of the ix isotherm used in the model is that it considers exchange strictly between nh4 and na however a wastewater that contains other background cations especially k would reduce the rate of uptake of nh4 ions onto chabazite which would affect the ix capacity q and selectivity coefficient k parameters determined in the model thus a future research direction that would enhance the model s applicability in a full scale system would be to incorporate the effect of k ions on the ix process estimation of the parameters related to algal photosynthesis was done using the following approach i a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the most sensitive parameters ii the most sensitive parameters were calibrated whereas the least sensitive parameters were determined from the literature the sensitivity analysis was conducted using an automated algorithm that uses a gauss newton levenberg marquadt method doherty 2010 the algorithm calculates a dimensionless composite sensitivity value which is a measure of the impact a change in a parameter value has on model output doherty 2010 results table 3 indicated that the two most sensitive parameters were the light attenuation constant k m2 g 1 and the maximum specific growth rate μ max d 1 calibration of k from 0 2 to 0 8 m2 g 1 and μ max from 0 96 to 0 5 d 1 in the developed model led to a good fit of the experimental data fig 5 a shows the concentration history of nh4 n in the aqueous phase using the parameters shown in table 3 the model captures the processes within hapix reactor as shown by the removal of most of the nh4 within the first 4 h followed by a period of relatively constant concentrations fig 5b shows the experimental data and simulated algal biomass concentration the model simulation shows an increase in algal biomass concentration corresponding with a decrease in the nh4 n the r2 value of 0 85 suggests that the growth process assuming light and nh4 as limiting factors is sufficient to predict the observed microalgae growth dynamics 4 5 2 prediction of nh4 concentrations in aqueous phase simulated temporal variations of the nh4 n concentration and experimental data for dosages of 60 and 250 g l 1 are shown in fig 6 note that the simulation results only show model correspondence to phase 1 of the experimental data since the periodic algal harvesting and recycling of supernatant introduced external factors that may affect the ix process thus it was infeasible to appropriately specify the solid phase nh4 concentrations in phases 2 and 3 which are required for assigning quantitative initial conditions in the model the model is in reasonable agreement r2 0 83 and r2 0 7 with the observed concentrations showing that most of the removal occurs within the first 100 h of the hapix process the nh4 removal rates markedly increased with the increase of zeolite dosage within the first 50 h of the hapix process because high zeolite dosages have more available ix sites for nh4 adsorption overall for each dosage the model provides a reasonable description of the experimental data in general the model predicted lower nh4 concentrations than were observed in the effluent most likely because mass transfer resistance due to algal biomass growth was neglected in this study the chabazite sank to the bottom of the reactors where limited light was available for the algal biofilm growth on the surface of the chabazite however there is more surface area of the highest chabazite dosage 250 g l 1 for algal biofilm growth incorporating mass transfer resistance caused by the presence of a biofilm on the zeolite surface would reduce the rate at which ions diffuse into the zeolite which would lead to an improved representation of the data however a caveat is that an additional parameter a mass transfer coefficient would need to be introduced which would require further experimental justification model and experimental microalgae growth results for phase 1 of hapix operation for dosages of 60 and 250 g l 1 are shown in fig 7 a and b the model prediction is in good agreement r2 0 98 with the experimental data for a dose of 60 g l 1 however for a dose 250 g l 1 the model does not predict as rapid a rate of biomass growth observed experimentally r2 0 58 this slower growth rate predicted by the model is most likely because the highest dosage resulted in lowest aqueous phase nh4 concentrations so less n was available to support algal growth nevertheless the model captures the trend of the algae growth data showing linear growth characteristics this positive trend corresponds with the utilization of nh4 n in solution and conversion of light nutrients and co2 to new algal cells the model behavior is consistent with recent findings from the model developed by lee and zhang 2016 which was fit to experimental algal biomass growth for centrate of various characteristics 5 conclusions this research demonstrated that the hapix process is suitable for treatment of high nh4 strength wastewater 1000 mg n l 1 without dilution zeolite dosages of 60 150 and 250 g l 1 resulted in stable nh4 n concentrations lower than 10 1 0 8 mg l 1 in the effluent algae control reactors without zeolite addition showed no algae growth the ix process reduced the fa of the centrate from 4 7 mm to 0 18 mm and promoted algae growth different dosages of zeolite resulted in different nh4 n concentrations in the aqueous phase and different protein and starch contents of the algal biomass zeolite dosages at 60 g l 1 resulted in higher protein and starch contents in the algal biomass than doses of 150 g l 1 and 250 g l 1 valuable products may be extracted from the harvested algal biomass due to the high protein content 27 57 by dry weight about 67 70 of the fatty acid in the algal biomass were unsaturated fatty acids the lipid contents in all the cultures were lower than 10 which are not economically feasible to produce biofuels a mathematical model describing the hapix process was developed that predicts the fate of nh4 n and algal biomass growth over time the light attenuation constant k and the maximum specific growth rate μ max were the most sensitive parameters in the model calibration of k from 0 2 to 0 8 m2 g 1 and μ max from 0 96 to 0 5 d 1 in the developed model led to a good fit of the experimental data the hapix process serves a two fold purpose treatment of high nh4 n strength wastewater and production of agricultural and commercial biopolymers the main limitation of the modeling framework is that the model does not account for algal biomass growth on the zeolite with time future work could be focused on accounting for both suspended and attached growth into the model moreover the model can be integrated with computational fluid dynamics models to simulate the performance of the hapix process for a full scale system acknowledgements this material is based upon work supported by the national science foundation under grant nos

19463,sludge disposal such as land application is suspected as a significant source of microplastic mp pollution in the environment to examine such a hypothesis the present study was conducted to investigate the occurrence of mps in sludge by analyzing 79 sewage sludge samples collected from 28 wastewater treatment plants wwtps in 11 chinese provinces mp concentrations in the sludge samples ranged from 1 60 56 4 103 particles per kilogram of dry sludge with an average of 22 7 12 1 103 particles per kilogram of dry sludge thereinto the sludge based mp contents were greater in eastern china than in western china and varied during different months their colors and types were mainly white 59 6 and fibers 63 respectively microscope fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that most of mps belonged to polyolefin acrylic fibers polyethylene and polyamide some wwtp parameters such as servicing area proportion of industrial wastewater secondary treatment and sludge dewatering may have affected mp concentrations in sludge based on the total sludge production in china the average amount of sludge based mps entering into natural environmental was estimated to be 1 56 1014 particles per year the findings confirmed that sewage sludge discharge is an important source of mp pollution in the environment further evaluation of the associated environmental hazards with mps is deemed necessary graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastic pollutants sludge disposal land application wwtp parameters spatial distribution temporal distribution 1 introduction plastic pollution in aquatic habitats has been well studied and given considerable attention for a number of decades derraik 2002 jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 pruter 1987 in recent years small plastic particles known as microplastics mps have also started receiving much attention andrady 2011 mps are plastics which are less than 5 mm in size murphy et al 2016 and are subdivided into primary and secondary mps primary mps are plastics that are produced and enter the environment with small sizes such as microbeads in personal care and cosmetics products cheung and fok 2017 eerkes medrano et al 2015 whereas secondary mps originate from the breakdown of larger plastic debris in the environment due to exposure to sunlight wind water and other environment stressors murphy et al 2016 song et al 2017 mps are ingested by biota and get accumulated within organisms resulting in physical harm such as internal abrasions and blockages wright et al 2013 meanwhile ingested mps release toxic contaminants such as monomers and plastic additives which can lead to carcinogenesis and disrupt the endocrine system wright and kelly 2017 furthermore mps can adsorb and concentrate hydrophobic organic contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons organochlorine pesticides polychlorinated biphenyls and heavy metals such as cadmium zinc nickel and lead holmes et al 2012 koelmans et al 2013 2016 rochman et al 2014 wright and kelly 2017 ziajahromi et al 2016 after ingestion or inhalation of mps the accumulated chemical contaminants may be released and leached into the gastrointestinal tract of aquatic organisms or the lungs of humans adversely impacting human health and ecosystems wright and kelly 2017 in addition mps can increase the bioaccumulation of the released contaminants besseling et al 2013 leading to chronic toxicity mps have been widely found in natural environment including marine freshwater sediment and terrestrial environments andrady 2011 eerkes medrano et al 2015 lwanga et al 2016 rillig 2012 van cauwenberghe et al 2013 even in polar regions lusher et al 2014 recent studies showed that effluent of wastewater treatment plant wwtp is an important source of mps carr et al 2016 mccormick et al 2014 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 ziajahromi et al 2016 microbeads used in facial scrubs toothpaste and other personal care products and synthetic textile fibers from washing of clothes are transported from the raw wastewater to wwtps and may bypass the wwtps and enter the aquatic environment due to their small size browne et al 2011 chang 2015 fendall and sewell 2009 murphy et al 2016 estimated that a wwtp population equivalent 650 000 releases 65 million mps into the receiving water every day cheung and fok 2017 reported that 209 7 trillion microbeads 306 9 tones are emitted into the aquatic environment in mainland china every year and more than 80 of the emissions originate from wwtp effluents in fact the wwtps are effective in removing the mps from municipal effluents and the removal rate reaches to 98 41 murphy et al 2016 in other words most of mps in the raw wastewater retain in sewage sludge magnusson and norén 2014 ziajahromi et al 2016 studies have found the presence of high concentrations of mps in wwtp sludge samples bayo et al 2016 brandsma et al 2013 carr et al 2016 habib et al 1998 lassen et al 2015 magnusson and norén 2014 mahon et al 2017 mahon et al 2017 found that the mp concentration isolated from the sludge ranges from 4 20 15 4 103 particles kg 1 dry sludge lassen et al 2015 reported that sludge from the wwtps in germany contains 1 00 24 0 103 mp particles 10 μm per kg of dry sludge however these reports are often based on limited sludge samples from some wwtps and systematic investigation is presently lacking about mp characteristics in dewatered sewage sludge such as its spatial temporal distribution and possible affecting factors especially in china the total sludge production in china in 2015 was calculated to be around 40 million tons moisture content 80 with increase in the daily wastewater treatment capacity and the number of wwtps the total sludge production has also steadily increased with an annual growth of about 13 yang et al 2015 it has been predicted that it will achieve more than 60 million tons in 2020 land application is one of the commonest sludge disposal methods and its development is encouraged by the ministry of housing and urban rural development china yang et al 2015 however the widespread application of sewage sludge from wwtps to farmlands is likely a major input of mps to soils with unknown consequences to sustainability and food security nizzetto et al 2016a 2016b in addition research has shown that high proportion of sewage sludge is dumping improperly in china yang et al 2015 leading to high amounts of mps in the sludge reaching soil and freshwater environment mahon et al 2017 even suggested that sludge after treatment may also introduce mps in the natural environment therefore it is very significant to investigate the characteristics of mps in sludge from the wwtps of china for comprehensively understanding potential risk of sludge based mps on soil or other natural pollution and human or livestock health the objectives of this study are to 1 analyze the concentration classification and morphological characteristics of mps extracted from sewage sludge in 28 wwtps of china 2 investigate spatial and temporal distribution of mps in wwtp sludge and 3 explore the effect of wwtp parameters such as treatment capacity and secondary treatment on mp concentrations in sewage sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and analysis a total of 79 dewatered sewage sludge samples were collected from 28 wwtps in 11 provinces of china during 2014 and 2015 basic information of the investigated wwtps in regard to treatment capacity servicing population servicing area proportion of industrial wastewater in the influent secondary treatment process discharge standard of the effluent and sludge dewatering process is given in table s1 of the si spatial distribution and number of sludge samples collected from the wwtps are shown in fig s1 of the si in addition these samples cover each month although only one sample is collected in november and december other information of the sludge samples is outlined in table s2 of the si after collection the samples were stored in 20 c prior to analysis total solid content of the sludge samples was determined by drying the samples at 105 c for 24 h while volatile solid content was measured by heating the sample at 600 c for 1 h in a muffle furnace li et al 2014 the total solid contents range from 11 8 to 51 1 and vs contents are 18 2 72 3 table s2 of the si implying that properties of the sludge samples are distinctive in different sampling location and time and the samples can represent characteristics of sewage sludge from wwtps in china 2 2 extraction of mps in dewatered sewage sludge all sludge samples were homogenized before subsampling for extraction and before analysis of their dry weights to extract the mps the method of thompson et al 2004 was followed with slightly adapted in brief 20 g of sludge was added to an erlenmeyer flask with 300 ml deionized water in which sodium chloride nacl had been added to saturation 1 2 g ml 1 after stirring for 15 min the mixture was settled for 2 h then the top water layer was filtered in a vacuum filtration unit using a sieve with pore size of 37 μm the extraction was conducted in triplicate and thus all the extracts were collected in the sieve the sieve in the vacuum filtration unit was then washed with more than 600 ml distilled water to remove any salt residues the extract in the sieve was sequentially treated with 100 ml hydrogen peroxide solution h2o2 30 which was performed overnight in order to remove the soft and easily disintegrating organic materials the mixture was poured into 200 ml of distilled water vacuum filtrated through glass fiber filters rinsed again severed time with deionized water and dried in a desiccator for 3 days klein et al 2015 2 3 quantification of mps in dewatered sewage sludge each extract was inspected and counted using a stemi 508 stereomicroscope carl zeiss jena germany equipped with an axiocam 506 color digital camera the mp particles were classified according to their types into categories fiber shaft film flake and sphere free et al 2014 su et al 2016 and colors into categories white red green black orange blue and others the particle concentration is given as number of particles kg 1 dry sludge all particles were examined carefully for remaining natural organic during microscopic analysis talvitie et al 2017 obvious residual natural debris were excluded with microforceps or a dental explorer suspected particles was separated with the tip of a dental explorer and determined for hardness 2 4 quality assurance and control qa qc of the mp extraction to assess the separation power of the methods recovery experiments with clean sludge and polymer standards were performed clean sludge was from the sludge after the mps were extracted polystyrene ps polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp were used to simulate the mp portion of the sludge sample each polymer was picked two sizes i e 380 830 and 75 μm each polymer particle was marked with a blue marker to ensure the accuracy of the determination fifty polymer particles were added to 20 g of clean sludge and spiked for 15 min then the extraction and quantification of polymer particles were conducted according the above methods the number of particles separated from the sludge matrix was counted and then percentage efficiency of the extraction was determined results show that average extraction efficiency for three kinds of mp particles ranged from 67 to 98 si table s4 which increased with increasing particle size the relative standard deviations were 0 9 4 5 indicating that the repeatability of the mp measurements was excellent during all steps of sample treatment openings were wrapped using aluminum foil to avoid contamination with other particles or fibers synthetic clothing was avoided and working surfaces were cleaned with alcohol prior to use when analyzing filter papers a blank filter paper was placed in the open laboratory conditions to evaluate the possibility of air borne contamination 2 5 morphology and identification of mps pictures for representative mp particles were taken with the axiocam 506 color digital camera scanning electron microscopy sem was used to investigate the surface structures of mps in the sludge samples mahon et al 2017 a selection of mp samples 10 extracted from the sludge were gold coated emitecg k550 quorum technologies ltd uk and were observed using a scanning electron microscope hitachi su 1500 hitachi high technologies corp japan at beam energies between 2 kv and 30 kv chemical composition of the mp particles from the sludge samples was analyzed with microscopes fourier transform infrared spectrometer m ftir ir nicoletin10 mx thermo fisher scientific ma usa about 10 of the potential mp particles were randomly chosen for further identification mahon et al 2017 particles were hand sorted from the filters with fine tip tweezers under the stereomicroscope they were then carefully rinsed with deionized water to eliminate the attached organic matter leslie et al 2017 after air drying the rinsed particles were put onto kbr windows for m ftir analysis thermo scientific hummel polymer and additives ftir library and synthetic fibers by microscope ftir library were used to analyze the spectra and then the mp types were determined and percentage of mp in potential mp particles for each wwtp was estimated 2 6 data analysis the sludge samples were classified to different groups as required they were divided into eleven groups based on sampling location provinces to explore spatial distribution of mp concentration in the sludge while the samples were classified into twelve groups on the basis of sampling month in order to investigate temporal distribution of sludge based mp contents in addition the samples were divided into 3 5 groups according to different wwtp parameters to investigate effect of the processing parameters on mp concentration in the sludge details are given in the si and table s3 to analyze possible factors influencing on spatial and temporal distribution of mp concentration in the sludge the relevant information of eleven provinces investigated was collected from china statistical yearbook 2015 nbsc 2016 which includes population densities total investment in fixed assets the area of afforested land and average temperature and rainfall analysis of correlation between average mp concentration and these parameters was carried out using graphpad prism 6 graphpad software inc usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 reliability of extraction methods ten percent of the suspected mp particles was randomly collected in the extracted particles and further analyzed by m ftir in order to investigate the mp percentage the result showed that the mp percentages in the samples from the 28 wwtps ranged from 66 7 to 100 si table s5 and the average was 78 27 9 83 in general the current method for mp quantification are acceptable and reliable 3 2 characteristics of mps the concentrations of mp particles in the sludge samples were 1 60 56 4 103 particles kg 1 dry sludge with an average of 22 7 12 1 103 particles kg 1 dry sludge table 1 the sludge samples contained one or two orders higher concentrations of mps than freshwater sediment from china germany and italy table 2 that is because wastewater is enriched with vast mps and then most of them are retained in the sludge carr et al 2016 nizzetto et al 2016a previous studies in europe and the united states obtained mps extracted from sludge in the range of 0 370 24 0 103 particles kg 1 dry sludge table 2 which were slightly lower than those obtained in the present study this is possibly attributed to lower population densities and better waste management systems in high income countries e g europe and the united states than in low income countries e g china jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 the colors of mps were white 59 6 black 17 6 red 9 0 orange 3 3 green 2 3 blue 1 7 and others 6 5 fig 1 a meanwhile fibers comprised a predominant portion of the mps 63 followed by shafts 15 films 14 flakes 7 3 and spheres 1 3 fig 1b they show that the predominance of white and fiber mps in the present study is similar to the results obtained by mahon et al 2017 talvitie et al 2015 and magnusson and norén 2014 fibers may have principally originated from washing of clothes and discharge of the fiber manufacturing industry mahon et al 2017 while mp flakes are related to plastic production lechner and ramler 2015 therefore the results imply that laundry and plastic industry wastewater may be the main source of mps in the sewage sludge the sludge based mps are mainly composed of polyolefin fibers and shafts acrylic fibers fibers polyethylene films polyamide films alkyd resin flakes and polystyrene spheres fig 2 and si fig s2 the mps belong to low density plastics in this study because high density mps such as polyvinylchloride pvc density 1 14 1 56 g ml 1 or polyethylene terephthalate pet density 1 32 1 41 g ml 1 cannot be extracted using concentrated sodium chloride nacl solution klein et al 2015 in addition sem analysis shows that the surface morphologies of the mps are highly abrasive and the structures appear brittle and hackly fig 3 these findings are consistent with those previously reported mahon et al 2017 zubris and richards 2005 it is well known that decontamination of sludge is mandatory before disposal due to the presence of organic contaminants heavy metal and pathogenic microorganisms liu 2016 however the hackly surface of mps allows the contaminants in sewage sludge to concentrate on the surface holmes et al 2012 koelmans et al 2013 2016 rochman et al 2014 wright and kelly 2017 ziajahromi et al 2016 the enrichment effect of mps may enhance the risks of sludge disposal on agricultural land and this attribute of sludge based mps deserves further investigations 3 3 spatial and temporal distribution of mps in sludge as shown in fig 4 the concentrations of mps are variable with sampling locations sewage sludge samples from jiangsu province and shandong province contained the highest average concentrations of mps at 29 0 103 and 30 7 103 particles kg 1 dry sludge respectively while those from yunnan province contained the lowest average mp content 7 70 103 particles kg 1 dry sludge in the 11 provinces the results imply the greater concentrations of mps in east china than in west china possibly resulting from higher population density and total investment in fixed assets and lower area of afforested land si table s6 correlation analysis between the parameters and average mp concentrations in sludge was carried out on the data from ten provinces except shanghai city si table s7 shanghai city is a municipality directly under the central government and its population density and total investment in fixed assets are much higher but area of afforested land is much lower compared with other provinces and thus the data of the three parameters from shanghai city were excluded for the correlation analysis correlation analysis shows that the average mp concentrations in sludge are significantly positively correlated with population density and total investment in fixed assets p 0 05 but is significantly negatively correlated with area of afforested land p 0 01 the results indicate that the three parameters have a key influence on the spatial distribution of mp concentration in sludge some studies about coasts estuaries and rivers have shown that population density is an important factor influencing on mp concentrations browne et al 2011 jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 yonkos et al 2014 the possible reason is that higher population density in east china leads to higher consumption of personal care products and larger amount of laundry wastewater and thus more discharges of mps carr et al 2016 jambeck et al 2015 talvitie et al 2015 ziajahromi et al 2016 secondly higher total investment in fixed assets for east china imply more infrastructure and industrial activity and thus more industrial mps from plastic and relevant industries is generated causing greater amounts of industrial mps to be discharged and retained in the sewage sludge in addition larger afforested land in west china may be related to lower population density less impervious surfaces and fewer storm drains yonkos et al 2014 implying lower mp concentration in rainwater and lower surface runoff and thus less discharge of stormwater based mps as most drainage systems within the sampling locations are a combination of wastewater and rainwater drains table s1 of si larger afforested land may contribute to lower mp contents in sludge from west china therefore the results imply that urbanization economic prosperity and forest cover as an indicator of urban development in a catchment are controlling factors in the spatial distribution of mp in sludge of china temporal distribution in mp concentration from sewage sludge are shown in fig 5 the average mp concentration in sewage sludge increased initially and then decreased during the year of 2014 2015 except for february and october si fig s3 the results show that mp contents in sewage sludge are considerably seasonal in china excluding february and october meanwhile monthly temperatures and rainfalls at capitals of the eleven provinces during 2014 2015 are also outlined in si table s8 according to china statistical yearbook 2015 surprisingly the average temperature and rainfalls have similar changing tendency with average mp concentrations in sludge as the sampling time si fig s3 if sampling time of all the sludge samples is added by two month corresponding average mp concentration will be strongly correlated with the average temperature p 0 05 and rainfall p 0 01 these results imply that temperature and rainfall have important influence on the temporal variability of mp concentrations in sewage sludge in accordance to the previous studies about the inputs of river based plastics to ocean andrady 2011 lebreton et al 2017 yonkos et al 2014 the results demonstrate the spatial and temporal variabilities of mp concentrations in sludge thus sludge treatment and disposal technologies should be designed to tailor regional and seasonal needs for example land application of sludge may be required to reevaluate in regions with high mp concentrations additionally anaerobic digestion can lower mp concentrations in sludge and therefore is necessary before sludge land application mahon et al 2017 3 4 effect of wwtp parameters on the mp concentration the influence of wwtp processes on mp concentration in wastewater has been investigated carr et al 2016 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 2017 but their effect on mp concentration in sewage sludge remains largely unknown mahon et al 2017 reported that sludge treatment processes can affect mp concentration in the sludge this suggests that other wwtp parameters may also impact mp concentration in sewage sludge in this study the sludge samples were divided into different groups according to the wwtp parameters si table s3 and mp concentrations for each group are shown in fig 6 there is little difference in average mp concentration among groups by treatment capacity and servicing population fig 6a and b suggesting that the parameters have limited effect on mp concentration in the sewage sludge however they can have an effect on the sludge production and then indirectly affect the release of sludge based mps from wwtps to soils or other natural environments in addition the discharge standard of effluent also has little relation with average mp concentration in the sludge fig 6f previous studies found that the majority of mps in the wwtps is removed during the early skimming and settling stages of primary treatment carr et al 2016 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 in this study all the wwtps have primary and secondary treatment all the effluents are of high quality reaching better than second levels according to the chinese discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant gb 18918 2002 thus the groups based on the discharge standard of effluent are similar in the average mp concentration average mp concentration in sewage sludge has a decreasing tendency with the servicing area implying that the parameter has an adverse effect on sludge based mp content fig 6c it is well known that the servicing area of the wwtp depends on the servicing population of wwtp and population density of the coverage if the servicing population of wwtp is certain the higher population density of coverage is the less wwtp servicing area will be as the population density is positively correlated with the mp concentration browne et al 2011 jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 yonkos et al 2014 it is reasonable that the average mp concentration decreases with increase in servicing area of wwtp fig 6c in addition the average mp concentration tends to increase with increase in the industrial wastewater in wwtp influent fig 6d implying that the addition of industrial wastewater can cause the enhancement of mp in the sludge previous studies reported that one of the primary mp sources entering aquatic systems is industrial manufactures such as plastic resin powders or pellets used in airblasting and feedstocks used in manufacturing plastic products eerkes medrano et al 2015 lechner and ramler 2015 ziajahromi et al 2016 lechner and ramler 2015 found that industrial raw materials account for 79 of mps in the danube river the results are additionally supported by the above results that average mp concentrations significantly correlate with total investment in fixed assets relating to infrastructure and industrial manufactures si table s7 as for secondary treatment the group that went through anaerobic aerobic a o processes and their modifications has higher average mp concentrations than the groups that was treated by oxidation ditch and other processes such as sequencing batch reactor fig 6e showing that different wastewater biological treatment process results in different change in mp concentration in the sludge both of the a o and oxidation ditch processes have the anaerobic and anoxic zones in order to gain favorable nitrogen removal efficiency mohurd 2011 a pilot study showed that the plastic can be decomposed to produce biogas in anaerobic digesters talvitie et al 2015 and thus part of mps may be decomposed by microbe through the activity of exoenzymes promoting depolymerization during the a o and oxidation ditch processes mahon et al 2017 shah et al 2008 yoshida et al 2016 in general compared with the a o process the oxidation ditch process has longer hydraulic retention time hrt more than 16 h and sludge retention time srt more than 15 days causing that it might have greater influence on sludge based mps and thus the average mp concentration in sludge from the wwtps with the oxidation ditch is lower than that using the a o process fig 6e in addition the mp difference between the processes might be also linked to the difference in settling efficiencies of sludge due to their diverse srt it deserves to further investigate possible reasons through controlled experiment fig 6g shows that the plate frame group has lower average mp concentration than the centrifuged group followed by filter pressure and belt type groups indicating that the sludge from different dewatering has different mp concentration it is well known that different sludge dewatering methods have different operating principles belt type filter pressure and plate frame methods remove the water in sewage sludge through extrusion while centrifugation dewaters sewage sludge based on the density difference between water and sludge part of the low density mps during centrifugation of the sludge may be released back into the water thereby causing the sewage sludge using centrifugation dewatering to have lower average mp concentration in addition high drying degree of dewatering is often used for emergency treatment of the wwtp sludge by plate frame filter pressing in china to date in order to gain low moisture content of sludge less than 60 vase lime is often added during the process the wwtp marked as w25 may have adopted the process the s71 sludge sample from this wwtp holds hard character and low moisture 51 1 which supports this assumption however the presence of vase lime in the samples may disturb the analysis for the mp concentration and thus the s71 sample had the lowest concentration of mps only 1 60 103 particles kg 1 dry sludge in all the sludge samples in general the results show that some wwtp parameters have an important influence on mp concentrations in sewage sludge indicating that it is possible to control mp pollution in dewatered sewage sludge by improving the wwtp parameters 3 5 implication and limitation of this study it was estimated that eight million tons of dry sludge are generated in china in 2015 mepc 2017 meanwhile yang et al 2015 reported that 83 6 of the sludge are dumped improperly and 2 4 of the sludge goes to land application thus 86 0 of the sludge is released to the soil and other natural environments therefore according to the average mp concentration in the sludge about 1 56 1014 particles of sludge based mps are discharged into the soil or other natural environments in 2015 the amount approximates the estimate emission of plastic microbeads from facial scrubs in mainland china cheung and fok 2017 but surpasses the accumulated number of mp particles 15 51 trillion entering the global oceans from surface waters van sebille et al 2015 in fact the mp emission amount will increase with increasing sludge production due to the enhanced wastewater treatment capacity and numbers of wwtps yang et al 2015 action plans for preventing and controlling water pollution were issued by the chinese government in 2015 mepc 2015 one of the aims is to enhance the decontamination rate of sewage sludge in cities up to 90 plus percent by 2020 therefore to achieve this goal it needs to pay much attention to sludge based mp pollution and its control techniques due to its potential risk to food and human health besseling et al 2013 holmes et al 2012 koelmans et al 2013 2016 rochman et al 2014 wright and kelly 2017 wright et al 2013 ziajahromi et al 2016 the limitations of this study are as follows first the mp concentration in the sludge is based on small sampling volumes and the nacl solution extraction although the extraction and quantification method of mps in dewatered sludge is acceptable in this study it should be further optimized due to the presence of the bias second the analysis about mp spatial temporal distribution and the effect of wwtp parameters on the mp concentrations are conducted through classifying the sludge samples according to the corresponding parameters si table s3 however each sludge sample contains multiple information causing that the significant difference is not be found among the groups p 0 05 clearly controlled experiments are needed in the near future to complement and confirm the findings 4 conclusions mps in the sewage sludge from wwtps in china exceed that in freshwater sediment by one or two orders of magnitude and also are higher than that from sludge in europe and the united states their main source is from laundry and industry applications and their surface morphology may act as a significant vector for toxic heavy metals and organic pollutants spatial distribution of sludge based mps is controlled by urbanization economic prosperity and forest cover in china while temperature and rainfall may affect mp temporal variability sludge treatment and disposal technologies should be designed to tailor regional and seasonal needs in terms of reducing possible mp pollution in addition it may be feasible to control mp concentration in sewage sludge through improving some wwtp parameters such as sludge dewatering methods in china hundred trillion particles of sludge based mps are discharged into the soil or other natural environments per year and thus significant attention should be paid to sludge based mp pollution and research effort invested into control techniques acknowledgements the work was financially supported by the foundation of key laboratory of yangtze river water environment

19463,sludge disposal such as land application is suspected as a significant source of microplastic mp pollution in the environment to examine such a hypothesis the present study was conducted to investigate the occurrence of mps in sludge by analyzing 79 sewage sludge samples collected from 28 wastewater treatment plants wwtps in 11 chinese provinces mp concentrations in the sludge samples ranged from 1 60 56 4 103 particles per kilogram of dry sludge with an average of 22 7 12 1 103 particles per kilogram of dry sludge thereinto the sludge based mp contents were greater in eastern china than in western china and varied during different months their colors and types were mainly white 59 6 and fibers 63 respectively microscope fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that most of mps belonged to polyolefin acrylic fibers polyethylene and polyamide some wwtp parameters such as servicing area proportion of industrial wastewater secondary treatment and sludge dewatering may have affected mp concentrations in sludge based on the total sludge production in china the average amount of sludge based mps entering into natural environmental was estimated to be 1 56 1014 particles per year the findings confirmed that sewage sludge discharge is an important source of mp pollution in the environment further evaluation of the associated environmental hazards with mps is deemed necessary graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastic pollutants sludge disposal land application wwtp parameters spatial distribution temporal distribution 1 introduction plastic pollution in aquatic habitats has been well studied and given considerable attention for a number of decades derraik 2002 jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 pruter 1987 in recent years small plastic particles known as microplastics mps have also started receiving much attention andrady 2011 mps are plastics which are less than 5 mm in size murphy et al 2016 and are subdivided into primary and secondary mps primary mps are plastics that are produced and enter the environment with small sizes such as microbeads in personal care and cosmetics products cheung and fok 2017 eerkes medrano et al 2015 whereas secondary mps originate from the breakdown of larger plastic debris in the environment due to exposure to sunlight wind water and other environment stressors murphy et al 2016 song et al 2017 mps are ingested by biota and get accumulated within organisms resulting in physical harm such as internal abrasions and blockages wright et al 2013 meanwhile ingested mps release toxic contaminants such as monomers and plastic additives which can lead to carcinogenesis and disrupt the endocrine system wright and kelly 2017 furthermore mps can adsorb and concentrate hydrophobic organic contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons organochlorine pesticides polychlorinated biphenyls and heavy metals such as cadmium zinc nickel and lead holmes et al 2012 koelmans et al 2013 2016 rochman et al 2014 wright and kelly 2017 ziajahromi et al 2016 after ingestion or inhalation of mps the accumulated chemical contaminants may be released and leached into the gastrointestinal tract of aquatic organisms or the lungs of humans adversely impacting human health and ecosystems wright and kelly 2017 in addition mps can increase the bioaccumulation of the released contaminants besseling et al 2013 leading to chronic toxicity mps have been widely found in natural environment including marine freshwater sediment and terrestrial environments andrady 2011 eerkes medrano et al 2015 lwanga et al 2016 rillig 2012 van cauwenberghe et al 2013 even in polar regions lusher et al 2014 recent studies showed that effluent of wastewater treatment plant wwtp is an important source of mps carr et al 2016 mccormick et al 2014 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 ziajahromi et al 2016 microbeads used in facial scrubs toothpaste and other personal care products and synthetic textile fibers from washing of clothes are transported from the raw wastewater to wwtps and may bypass the wwtps and enter the aquatic environment due to their small size browne et al 2011 chang 2015 fendall and sewell 2009 murphy et al 2016 estimated that a wwtp population equivalent 650 000 releases 65 million mps into the receiving water every day cheung and fok 2017 reported that 209 7 trillion microbeads 306 9 tones are emitted into the aquatic environment in mainland china every year and more than 80 of the emissions originate from wwtp effluents in fact the wwtps are effective in removing the mps from municipal effluents and the removal rate reaches to 98 41 murphy et al 2016 in other words most of mps in the raw wastewater retain in sewage sludge magnusson and norén 2014 ziajahromi et al 2016 studies have found the presence of high concentrations of mps in wwtp sludge samples bayo et al 2016 brandsma et al 2013 carr et al 2016 habib et al 1998 lassen et al 2015 magnusson and norén 2014 mahon et al 2017 mahon et al 2017 found that the mp concentration isolated from the sludge ranges from 4 20 15 4 103 particles kg 1 dry sludge lassen et al 2015 reported that sludge from the wwtps in germany contains 1 00 24 0 103 mp particles 10 μm per kg of dry sludge however these reports are often based on limited sludge samples from some wwtps and systematic investigation is presently lacking about mp characteristics in dewatered sewage sludge such as its spatial temporal distribution and possible affecting factors especially in china the total sludge production in china in 2015 was calculated to be around 40 million tons moisture content 80 with increase in the daily wastewater treatment capacity and the number of wwtps the total sludge production has also steadily increased with an annual growth of about 13 yang et al 2015 it has been predicted that it will achieve more than 60 million tons in 2020 land application is one of the commonest sludge disposal methods and its development is encouraged by the ministry of housing and urban rural development china yang et al 2015 however the widespread application of sewage sludge from wwtps to farmlands is likely a major input of mps to soils with unknown consequences to sustainability and food security nizzetto et al 2016a 2016b in addition research has shown that high proportion of sewage sludge is dumping improperly in china yang et al 2015 leading to high amounts of mps in the sludge reaching soil and freshwater environment mahon et al 2017 even suggested that sludge after treatment may also introduce mps in the natural environment therefore it is very significant to investigate the characteristics of mps in sludge from the wwtps of china for comprehensively understanding potential risk of sludge based mps on soil or other natural pollution and human or livestock health the objectives of this study are to 1 analyze the concentration classification and morphological characteristics of mps extracted from sewage sludge in 28 wwtps of china 2 investigate spatial and temporal distribution of mps in wwtp sludge and 3 explore the effect of wwtp parameters such as treatment capacity and secondary treatment on mp concentrations in sewage sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and analysis a total of 79 dewatered sewage sludge samples were collected from 28 wwtps in 11 provinces of china during 2014 and 2015 basic information of the investigated wwtps in regard to treatment capacity servicing population servicing area proportion of industrial wastewater in the influent secondary treatment process discharge standard of the effluent and sludge dewatering process is given in table s1 of the si spatial distribution and number of sludge samples collected from the wwtps are shown in fig s1 of the si in addition these samples cover each month although only one sample is collected in november and december other information of the sludge samples is outlined in table s2 of the si after collection the samples were stored in 20 c prior to analysis total solid content of the sludge samples was determined by drying the samples at 105 c for 24 h while volatile solid content was measured by heating the sample at 600 c for 1 h in a muffle furnace li et al 2014 the total solid contents range from 11 8 to 51 1 and vs contents are 18 2 72 3 table s2 of the si implying that properties of the sludge samples are distinctive in different sampling location and time and the samples can represent characteristics of sewage sludge from wwtps in china 2 2 extraction of mps in dewatered sewage sludge all sludge samples were homogenized before subsampling for extraction and before analysis of their dry weights to extract the mps the method of thompson et al 2004 was followed with slightly adapted in brief 20 g of sludge was added to an erlenmeyer flask with 300 ml deionized water in which sodium chloride nacl had been added to saturation 1 2 g ml 1 after stirring for 15 min the mixture was settled for 2 h then the top water layer was filtered in a vacuum filtration unit using a sieve with pore size of 37 μm the extraction was conducted in triplicate and thus all the extracts were collected in the sieve the sieve in the vacuum filtration unit was then washed with more than 600 ml distilled water to remove any salt residues the extract in the sieve was sequentially treated with 100 ml hydrogen peroxide solution h2o2 30 which was performed overnight in order to remove the soft and easily disintegrating organic materials the mixture was poured into 200 ml of distilled water vacuum filtrated through glass fiber filters rinsed again severed time with deionized water and dried in a desiccator for 3 days klein et al 2015 2 3 quantification of mps in dewatered sewage sludge each extract was inspected and counted using a stemi 508 stereomicroscope carl zeiss jena germany equipped with an axiocam 506 color digital camera the mp particles were classified according to their types into categories fiber shaft film flake and sphere free et al 2014 su et al 2016 and colors into categories white red green black orange blue and others the particle concentration is given as number of particles kg 1 dry sludge all particles were examined carefully for remaining natural organic during microscopic analysis talvitie et al 2017 obvious residual natural debris were excluded with microforceps or a dental explorer suspected particles was separated with the tip of a dental explorer and determined for hardness 2 4 quality assurance and control qa qc of the mp extraction to assess the separation power of the methods recovery experiments with clean sludge and polymer standards were performed clean sludge was from the sludge after the mps were extracted polystyrene ps polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp were used to simulate the mp portion of the sludge sample each polymer was picked two sizes i e 380 830 and 75 μm each polymer particle was marked with a blue marker to ensure the accuracy of the determination fifty polymer particles were added to 20 g of clean sludge and spiked for 15 min then the extraction and quantification of polymer particles were conducted according the above methods the number of particles separated from the sludge matrix was counted and then percentage efficiency of the extraction was determined results show that average extraction efficiency for three kinds of mp particles ranged from 67 to 98 si table s4 which increased with increasing particle size the relative standard deviations were 0 9 4 5 indicating that the repeatability of the mp measurements was excellent during all steps of sample treatment openings were wrapped using aluminum foil to avoid contamination with other particles or fibers synthetic clothing was avoided and working surfaces were cleaned with alcohol prior to use when analyzing filter papers a blank filter paper was placed in the open laboratory conditions to evaluate the possibility of air borne contamination 2 5 morphology and identification of mps pictures for representative mp particles were taken with the axiocam 506 color digital camera scanning electron microscopy sem was used to investigate the surface structures of mps in the sludge samples mahon et al 2017 a selection of mp samples 10 extracted from the sludge were gold coated emitecg k550 quorum technologies ltd uk and were observed using a scanning electron microscope hitachi su 1500 hitachi high technologies corp japan at beam energies between 2 kv and 30 kv chemical composition of the mp particles from the sludge samples was analyzed with microscopes fourier transform infrared spectrometer m ftir ir nicoletin10 mx thermo fisher scientific ma usa about 10 of the potential mp particles were randomly chosen for further identification mahon et al 2017 particles were hand sorted from the filters with fine tip tweezers under the stereomicroscope they were then carefully rinsed with deionized water to eliminate the attached organic matter leslie et al 2017 after air drying the rinsed particles were put onto kbr windows for m ftir analysis thermo scientific hummel polymer and additives ftir library and synthetic fibers by microscope ftir library were used to analyze the spectra and then the mp types were determined and percentage of mp in potential mp particles for each wwtp was estimated 2 6 data analysis the sludge samples were classified to different groups as required they were divided into eleven groups based on sampling location provinces to explore spatial distribution of mp concentration in the sludge while the samples were classified into twelve groups on the basis of sampling month in order to investigate temporal distribution of sludge based mp contents in addition the samples were divided into 3 5 groups according to different wwtp parameters to investigate effect of the processing parameters on mp concentration in the sludge details are given in the si and table s3 to analyze possible factors influencing on spatial and temporal distribution of mp concentration in the sludge the relevant information of eleven provinces investigated was collected from china statistical yearbook 2015 nbsc 2016 which includes population densities total investment in fixed assets the area of afforested land and average temperature and rainfall analysis of correlation between average mp concentration and these parameters was carried out using graphpad prism 6 graphpad software inc usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 reliability of extraction methods ten percent of the suspected mp particles was randomly collected in the extracted particles and further analyzed by m ftir in order to investigate the mp percentage the result showed that the mp percentages in the samples from the 28 wwtps ranged from 66 7 to 100 si table s5 and the average was 78 27 9 83 in general the current method for mp quantification are acceptable and reliable 3 2 characteristics of mps the concentrations of mp particles in the sludge samples were 1 60 56 4 103 particles kg 1 dry sludge with an average of 22 7 12 1 103 particles kg 1 dry sludge table 1 the sludge samples contained one or two orders higher concentrations of mps than freshwater sediment from china germany and italy table 2 that is because wastewater is enriched with vast mps and then most of them are retained in the sludge carr et al 2016 nizzetto et al 2016a previous studies in europe and the united states obtained mps extracted from sludge in the range of 0 370 24 0 103 particles kg 1 dry sludge table 2 which were slightly lower than those obtained in the present study this is possibly attributed to lower population densities and better waste management systems in high income countries e g europe and the united states than in low income countries e g china jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 the colors of mps were white 59 6 black 17 6 red 9 0 orange 3 3 green 2 3 blue 1 7 and others 6 5 fig 1 a meanwhile fibers comprised a predominant portion of the mps 63 followed by shafts 15 films 14 flakes 7 3 and spheres 1 3 fig 1b they show that the predominance of white and fiber mps in the present study is similar to the results obtained by mahon et al 2017 talvitie et al 2015 and magnusson and norén 2014 fibers may have principally originated from washing of clothes and discharge of the fiber manufacturing industry mahon et al 2017 while mp flakes are related to plastic production lechner and ramler 2015 therefore the results imply that laundry and plastic industry wastewater may be the main source of mps in the sewage sludge the sludge based mps are mainly composed of polyolefin fibers and shafts acrylic fibers fibers polyethylene films polyamide films alkyd resin flakes and polystyrene spheres fig 2 and si fig s2 the mps belong to low density plastics in this study because high density mps such as polyvinylchloride pvc density 1 14 1 56 g ml 1 or polyethylene terephthalate pet density 1 32 1 41 g ml 1 cannot be extracted using concentrated sodium chloride nacl solution klein et al 2015 in addition sem analysis shows that the surface morphologies of the mps are highly abrasive and the structures appear brittle and hackly fig 3 these findings are consistent with those previously reported mahon et al 2017 zubris and richards 2005 it is well known that decontamination of sludge is mandatory before disposal due to the presence of organic contaminants heavy metal and pathogenic microorganisms liu 2016 however the hackly surface of mps allows the contaminants in sewage sludge to concentrate on the surface holmes et al 2012 koelmans et al 2013 2016 rochman et al 2014 wright and kelly 2017 ziajahromi et al 2016 the enrichment effect of mps may enhance the risks of sludge disposal on agricultural land and this attribute of sludge based mps deserves further investigations 3 3 spatial and temporal distribution of mps in sludge as shown in fig 4 the concentrations of mps are variable with sampling locations sewage sludge samples from jiangsu province and shandong province contained the highest average concentrations of mps at 29 0 103 and 30 7 103 particles kg 1 dry sludge respectively while those from yunnan province contained the lowest average mp content 7 70 103 particles kg 1 dry sludge in the 11 provinces the results imply the greater concentrations of mps in east china than in west china possibly resulting from higher population density and total investment in fixed assets and lower area of afforested land si table s6 correlation analysis between the parameters and average mp concentrations in sludge was carried out on the data from ten provinces except shanghai city si table s7 shanghai city is a municipality directly under the central government and its population density and total investment in fixed assets are much higher but area of afforested land is much lower compared with other provinces and thus the data of the three parameters from shanghai city were excluded for the correlation analysis correlation analysis shows that the average mp concentrations in sludge are significantly positively correlated with population density and total investment in fixed assets p 0 05 but is significantly negatively correlated with area of afforested land p 0 01 the results indicate that the three parameters have a key influence on the spatial distribution of mp concentration in sludge some studies about coasts estuaries and rivers have shown that population density is an important factor influencing on mp concentrations browne et al 2011 jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 yonkos et al 2014 the possible reason is that higher population density in east china leads to higher consumption of personal care products and larger amount of laundry wastewater and thus more discharges of mps carr et al 2016 jambeck et al 2015 talvitie et al 2015 ziajahromi et al 2016 secondly higher total investment in fixed assets for east china imply more infrastructure and industrial activity and thus more industrial mps from plastic and relevant industries is generated causing greater amounts of industrial mps to be discharged and retained in the sewage sludge in addition larger afforested land in west china may be related to lower population density less impervious surfaces and fewer storm drains yonkos et al 2014 implying lower mp concentration in rainwater and lower surface runoff and thus less discharge of stormwater based mps as most drainage systems within the sampling locations are a combination of wastewater and rainwater drains table s1 of si larger afforested land may contribute to lower mp contents in sludge from west china therefore the results imply that urbanization economic prosperity and forest cover as an indicator of urban development in a catchment are controlling factors in the spatial distribution of mp in sludge of china temporal distribution in mp concentration from sewage sludge are shown in fig 5 the average mp concentration in sewage sludge increased initially and then decreased during the year of 2014 2015 except for february and october si fig s3 the results show that mp contents in sewage sludge are considerably seasonal in china excluding february and october meanwhile monthly temperatures and rainfalls at capitals of the eleven provinces during 2014 2015 are also outlined in si table s8 according to china statistical yearbook 2015 surprisingly the average temperature and rainfalls have similar changing tendency with average mp concentrations in sludge as the sampling time si fig s3 if sampling time of all the sludge samples is added by two month corresponding average mp concentration will be strongly correlated with the average temperature p 0 05 and rainfall p 0 01 these results imply that temperature and rainfall have important influence on the temporal variability of mp concentrations in sewage sludge in accordance to the previous studies about the inputs of river based plastics to ocean andrady 2011 lebreton et al 2017 yonkos et al 2014 the results demonstrate the spatial and temporal variabilities of mp concentrations in sludge thus sludge treatment and disposal technologies should be designed to tailor regional and seasonal needs for example land application of sludge may be required to reevaluate in regions with high mp concentrations additionally anaerobic digestion can lower mp concentrations in sludge and therefore is necessary before sludge land application mahon et al 2017 3 4 effect of wwtp parameters on the mp concentration the influence of wwtp processes on mp concentration in wastewater has been investigated carr et al 2016 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 2017 but their effect on mp concentration in sewage sludge remains largely unknown mahon et al 2017 reported that sludge treatment processes can affect mp concentration in the sludge this suggests that other wwtp parameters may also impact mp concentration in sewage sludge in this study the sludge samples were divided into different groups according to the wwtp parameters si table s3 and mp concentrations for each group are shown in fig 6 there is little difference in average mp concentration among groups by treatment capacity and servicing population fig 6a and b suggesting that the parameters have limited effect on mp concentration in the sewage sludge however they can have an effect on the sludge production and then indirectly affect the release of sludge based mps from wwtps to soils or other natural environments in addition the discharge standard of effluent also has little relation with average mp concentration in the sludge fig 6f previous studies found that the majority of mps in the wwtps is removed during the early skimming and settling stages of primary treatment carr et al 2016 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 in this study all the wwtps have primary and secondary treatment all the effluents are of high quality reaching better than second levels according to the chinese discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant gb 18918 2002 thus the groups based on the discharge standard of effluent are similar in the average mp concentration average mp concentration in sewage sludge has a decreasing tendency with the servicing area implying that the parameter has an adverse effect on sludge based mp content fig 6c it is well known that the servicing area of the wwtp depends on the servicing population of wwtp and population density of the coverage if the servicing population of wwtp is certain the higher population density of coverage is the less wwtp servicing area will be as the population density is positively correlated with the mp concentration browne et al 2011 jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 yonkos et al 2014 it is reasonable that the average mp concentration decreases with increase in servicing area of wwtp fig 6c in addition the average mp concentration tends to increase with increase in the industrial wastewater in wwtp influent fig 6d implying that the addition of industrial wastewater can cause the enhancement of mp in the sludge previous studies reported that one of the primary mp sources entering aquatic systems is industrial manufactures such as plastic resin powders or pellets used in airblasting and feedstocks used in manufacturing plastic products eerkes medrano et al 2015 lechner and ramler 2015 ziajahromi et al 2016 lechner and ramler 2015 found that industrial raw materials account for 79 of mps in the danube river the results are additionally supported by the above results that average mp concentrations significantly correlate with total investment in fixed assets relating to infrastructure and industrial manufactures si table s7 as for secondary treatment the group that went through anaerobic aerobic a o processes and their modifications has higher average mp concentrations than the groups that was treated by oxidation ditch and other processes such as sequencing batch reactor fig 6e showing that different wastewater biological treatment process results in different change in mp concentration in the sludge both of the a o and oxidation ditch processes have the anaerobic and anoxic zones in order to gain favorable nitrogen removal efficiency mohurd 2011 a pilot study showed that the plastic can be decomposed to produce biogas in anaerobic digesters talvitie et al 2015 and thus part of mps may be decomposed by microbe through the activity of exoenzymes promoting depolymerization during the a o and oxidation ditch processes mahon et al 2017 shah et al 2008 yoshida et al 2016 in general compared with the a o process the oxidation ditch process has longer hydraulic retention time hrt more than 16 h and sludge retention time srt more than 15 days causing that it might have greater influence on sludge based mps and thus the average mp concentration in sludge from the wwtps with the oxidation ditch is lower than that using the a o process fig 6e in addition the mp difference between the processes might be also linked to the difference in settling efficiencies of sludge due to their diverse srt it deserves to further investigate possible reasons through controlled experiment fig 6g shows that the plate frame group has lower average mp concentration than the centrifuged group followed by filter pressure and belt type groups indicating that the sludge from different dewatering has different mp concentration it is well known that different sludge dewatering methods have different operating principles belt type filter pressure and plate frame methods remove the water in sewage sludge through extrusion while centrifugation dewaters sewage sludge based on the density difference between water and sludge part of the low density mps during centrifugation of the sludge may be released back into the water thereby causing the sewage sludge using centrifugation dewatering to have lower average mp concentration in addition high drying degree of dewatering is often used for emergency treatment of the wwtp sludge by plate frame filter pressing in china to date in order to gain low moisture content of sludge less than 60 vase lime is often added during the process the wwtp marked as w25 may have adopted the process the s71 sludge sample from this wwtp holds hard character and low moisture 51 1 which supports this assumption however the presence of vase lime in the samples may disturb the analysis for the mp concentration and thus the s71 sample had the lowest concentration of mps only 1 60 103 particles kg 1 dry sludge in all the sludge samples in general the results show that some wwtp parameters have an important influence on mp concentrations in sewage sludge indicating that it is possible to control mp pollution in dewatered sewage sludge by improving the wwtp parameters 3 5 implication and limitation of this study it was estimated that eight million tons of dry sludge are generated in china in 2015 mepc 2017 meanwhile yang et al 2015 reported that 83 6 of the sludge are dumped improperly and 2 4 of the sludge goes to land application thus 86 0 of the sludge is released to the soil and other natural environments therefore according to the average mp concentration in the sludge about 1 56 1014 particles of sludge based mps are discharged into the soil or other natural environments in 2015 the amount approximates the estimate emission of plastic microbeads from facial scrubs in mainland china cheung and fok 2017 but surpasses the accumulated number of mp particles 15 51 trillion entering the global oceans from surface waters van sebille et al 2015 in fact the mp emission amount will increase with increasing sludge production due to the enhanced wastewater treatment capacity and numbers of wwtps yang et al 2015 action plans for preventing and controlling water pollution were issued by the chinese government in 2015 mepc 2015 one of the aims is to enhance the decontamination rate of sewage sludge in cities up to 90 plus percent by 2020 therefore to achieve this goal it needs to pay much attention to sludge based mp pollution and its control techniques due to its potential risk to food and human health besseling et al 2013 holmes et al 2012 koelmans et al 2013 2016 rochman et al 2014 wright and kelly 2017 wright et al 2013 ziajahromi et al 2016 the limitations of this study are as follows first the mp concentration in the sludge is based on small sampling volumes and the nacl solution extraction although the extraction and quantification method of mps in dewatered sludge is acceptable in this study it should be further optimized due to the presence of the bias second the analysis about mp spatial temporal distribution and the effect of wwtp parameters on the mp concentrations are conducted through classifying the sludge samples according to the corresponding parameters si table s3 however each sludge sample contains multiple information causing that the significant difference is not be found among the groups p 0 05 clearly controlled experiments are needed in the near future to complement and confirm the findings 4 conclusions mps in the sewage sludge from wwtps in china exceed that in freshwater sediment by one or two orders of magnitude and also are higher than that from sludge in europe and the united states their main source is from laundry and industry applications and their surface morphology may act as a significant vector for toxic heavy metals and organic pollutants spatial distribution of sludge based mps is controlled by urbanization economic prosperity and forest cover in china while temperature and rainfall may affect mp temporal variability sludge treatment and disposal technologies should be designed to tailor regional and seasonal needs in terms of reducing possible mp pollution in addition it may be feasible to control mp concentration in sewage sludge through improving some wwtp parameters such as sludge dewatering methods in china hundred trillion particles of sludge based mps are discharged into the soil or other natural environments per year and thus significant attention should be paid to sludge based mp pollution and research effort invested into control techniques acknowledgements the work was financially supported by the foundation of key laboratory of yangtze river water environment

19464,although ultrafiltration uf membranes are highly beneficial for removing algae the removal process causes serious uf membrane fouling to avoid the unfavorable effects of algal cells that have been damaged by oxidants our previous study reported a novel moderate pre oxidation method kmno4 fe ii process that aimed to achieve a balance between the release of intracellular organic matter and enhanced algae removal this study further investigated the performance of a uf membrane with kmno4 fe ii pretreatment in the presence of algae laden reservoir water after a long running time we found that algae could be completely removed membrane fouling was significantly alleviated and the overall performance was much better than that of fe iii coagulation alone the transmembrane pressure tmp during fe iii coagulation increased to 42 8 kpa however that of the kmno4 fe ii process only increased to 25 1 kpa for after running for 90 d the slower transmembrane pressure was attributed to the larger floc size higher surface activity and inactivation of algae although there was little effect on microorganism development lower microorganism abundance 20 7 was observed during the kmno4 fe ii process than during coagulation alone 44 9 due to the release of extracellular polymeric substances we also found that the floc cake layer was easily removed by washing and many of the original membrane pores were clearly observed further analysis demonstrated that the effluent quality was excellent especially its turbidity chromaticity and mn and fe concentrations based on the outstanding uf membrane performance it may be concluded that the kmno4 fe ii process exhibits considerable potential for application in the treatment of algae laden water graphical abstract image 1 keywords ultrafiltration membrane algae laden reservoir water moderate kmno4 fe ii pre oxidation fouling alleviation 1 introduction the worldwide occurrence of algal blooms in water has caused great concern among the public the penetration of algal cells and release of odorous and toxic substances frequently cause water quality to deteriorate li et al 2012 wert et al 2014 algal organic matter aom serves as a precursor for the formation of disinfection by products dbps during disinfection wei et al 2011 zhou et al 2014 as a result the presence of algae poses a substantial risk to aquatic health and therefore it is vital that algae is removed effectively during water treatment due to the negative surface charge high motility diverse morphology and low specific density of algae traditional coagulation treatment cannot achieve a satisfactory removal efficiency ma et al 2007 takaara et al 2010 retained algae can be nourished in treatment reactors and sedimentation and filtration tanks and microorganisms can be nourished by the algal cells that have penetrated filtration tanks through sparge pipes and secondary water supply facilities such as service pipes plummer and edzwald 2001 as a result the residual chlorine at the end of the pipe network is gradually depleted further nourishing the microorganisms and deteriorating water quality ma et al 2012 to prevent these adverse effects various pretreatment methods to enhance the removal efficiency of algae during water treatment have been investigated including increasing the coagulant dosage electrocoagulation air flotation pre chlorination oxidation and ultrafiltration uf although increasing the coagulant dosage can improve the algal removal efficiency the dosage usually requires a dual fold increase ma et al 2012 for electrocoagulation the frequent changing polarity and electrode passivation limit its application on a wide scale mollah et al 2004 most water treatment plants lack the appropriate equipment for air floatation thus they require expensive reconstruction ma et al 2012 pre chlorination oxidation i e cl2 o3 has a considerable advantage as it inactivates algae however algal cells can easily be damaged by excessive oxidant dosages resulting in the release of intracellular organic matter iom and increased effluent water risk garzon sanabria et al 2013 to overcome these disadvantages we developed a novel moderate pre oxidation method kmno4 fe ii process that achieves a balance between the release of iom and a high algal removal efficiency ma et al 2012 2014 qi et al 2016a 2016b we demonstrated that algae microcystis aeruginosa are moderately inactivated by the sequential introduction of kmno4 and fe ii the subsequent dose of fe ii not only effectively halts the kmno4 reaction but also further transforms into in situ fe iii which has a larger reactive surface area than traditional preformed fe iii a lower concentration of fe results in the effluent as a by product of the kmno4 fe ii process than as a by product of fe ii coagulation ma et al 2012 based on cell integrity and residual manganese the optimized molar ratio of kmno4 to fe ii was 1 3 and the appropriate dosing interval time was 5 min in addition the suspension ability of the flocs formed during the kmno4 fe ii process is high resulting in low deposition and rendering the process suitable for long term transportation pipelines qi et al 2016b the use of uf membranes in drinking water treatment is a promising technology and has continued to expand owing the excellent resultant water quality and small scale land use huang et al 2009 drioli et al 2011 miao et al 2017 these membranes can completely remove micro algae during filtration as their pores have small diameters mouchet and bonnelye 1998 liang et al 2008 slade and bauen 2013 miao et al 2014 however the deposition of algal cells and extracellular organic matter eom on uf membrane surfaces causes serious fouling resulting in the formation of a dense cake layer this is independent of the pore diameter and surface hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of the membrane liang et al 2008 li et al 2014 qu et al 2014 to date three different processes have been investigated to alleviate membrane fouling including pre adsorption direct filtration and integrated filtration ma et al 2017 the integrated filtration process is considered particularly advantageous in water treatment as it requires little land and exhibits a high removal efficiency during operation zhang et al 2016 ma et al 2017 to better resolve algae related water problems our novel kmno4 fe ii pretreatment process was integrated with uf membranes kmno4 and fe ii were sequentially injected into the membrane tank and fecl3 6h2o was also directly injected for comparison to fully investigate the practicality of this integrated process raw water was collected from the miyun reservoir n 40 29 e 116 49 which is the main drinking water source for beijing china owing to the reduced water quality and high water temperature during summer the reservoir faces the risk of algal pollution su et al 2015 2017 in this study we aimed to 1 investigate the uf membrane fouling behavior during the kmno4 fe ii process in the presence of algae laden water 2 compare the performance of the uf membrane between the kmno4 fe ii process and fecl3 6h2o coagulation and 3 evaluate the practicality of the integrated uf process after long term operation based on effluent water quality parameters including its turbidity chromaticity and mn and fe concentrations 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of raw water the raw water was used immediately after collection from the miyun reservoir and its specific properties are presented in table 1 the concentration of algae was measured by a flow cytometer accrui c6 bd biosciences usa and ranged from 1 99 107 to 2 67 107 cells l table 2 shows the proportions of the different algal species and microcystis was found to be predominant 2 2 kmno4 fe ii process optimization tests all chemical reagents were of analytical grade sinopharm chemical regent beijing co ltd china and included kmno4 feso4 7h2o and fecl3 6h2o stock solutions were prepared using deionized di water millipore milli q usa to generate a proper dosage of fe ii during the test flat sheet polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf uf membranes motimo china were used with a molecular weight cutoff of 100 kda all membranes were immersed in di water for 24 h to remove any impurities a millipore stirred uf cell amicon 8400 usa was used to maintain a stable pressure 0 1 mpa during filtration by applying nitrogen gas to maintain a constant membrane flux 300 ml of di water was first filtrated through all fresh membranes in the pre oxidation tests kmno4 was added to 300 ml of raw water and mixed at 100 rpm for 5 min after pre oxidation feso4 7h2o was added and mixed at 300 rpm for 1 min and 50 rpm for a further 15 min qi et al 2016b the mixture was then filtrated directly the normalized flux j j0 as a function of time was used to determine the uf membrane performance with j0 representing the initial membrane flux 2 3 filtration process to explore the effects of kmno4 fe ii pretreatment after a long running time the performance of the integrated uf membrane was investigated figs s1 and s2 for comparison coagulation by fecl3 6h2o alone at the same dosage as feso4 7h2o was also studied raw water was fed into the membrane tank using a peristaltic pump and a pvdf hollow fiber membrane 100 kda motimo china module was immersed into the membrane tank which had an inner diameter and height of 64 and 800 mm respectively the effluent from the membrane module was pumped at a rate of 1 l h by a peristaltic pump and the filtration cycle was 30 min with 1 min of backwashing at a rate of 2 l h yu et al 2013 to fully use the flocs a micro porous aerator 40 mm diameter was placed at the bottom of the membrane tank coagulation and flocculation were gradual and the flocs were well suspended in the membrane tank with continuous aeration the freshly formed flocs exhibited a large potential for adsorbing pollutants owing to their strong activity chen et al 2015 during filtration membrane fouling was indicated by the corresponding transmembrane pressure tmp which was monitored by pressure sensors the total hydraulic retention time was 2 2 h and sludge was discharged once every 10 d water production rate 99 7 to understand the contributions of cake layer formation and pore blockage constriction the membrane module was carefully removed and washed with tap water beijing china after 10 or 90 d of operation scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 7401f jeol ltd japan was used to capture images of the membrane s morphology which were further analyzed by imagej software ajmani et al 2012 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms 7500a agilent technology usa was employed to measure the concentrations of mn and fe before and after filtration 2 4 characteristics of flocs in the membrane tank to minimize the influence of impurities and accurately characterize the flocs floc samples were collected from 2 cm below the water s surface on day one floc images were captured with a ccd camera on a microscope ge 5 aigo china after transferring the sample onto a slide the surface charge of the flocs was analyzed using a nano particle size and zeta potential analyzer beckman coulter ltd usa 2 5 dna extraction and high throughput sequencing high throughput sequencing was used to determine the composition of microorganisms in the sludge at the end of the experiment dna from the sludge was extracted using a fast dna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals france following the manufacturer s procedures and then stored at 20 c bcd 248wdpm haier china prior to use the dna samples were analyzed by pyrosequencing the v3 and v4 regions of the 16s rdna gene using the illumina miseq pe 300 platform genewiz inc china after pyrosequencing the raw data were filtered to discard short and low quality sequences under the following principles 1 forward primer and barcode of the sequences trimmomatic v0 3 2 bases with trailing quality scores below 20 and sequences shorter than 400 bp trimmomatic v0 3 and 3 chimera sequences usearch v8 0 clean data with 97 similarity were clustered into one operational taxonomic unit otu using qiime v1 7 and the sequences were assigned to taxonomic groups using the silva database silva 111 16s rrna database 2 6 measurement of extracellular polymeric substances eps in sludge issues with water treatment include the gradual release of eom by algae and the continued nourishment of microorganisms in membrane tanks even after moderate pre oxidation during filtration here a traditional heating and extraction method was used to extract the eom eps from the sludge morgan et al 1990 sun et al 2012 the solution was heated for 30 min at 80 c and centrifuged for 5 min at 20 000 rpm the supernatant was then collected for eom eps analysis zhang et al 1999 proteins and polysaccharides the two main components of eom eps were analyzed following modified bradford peterson 1977 and phenol sulfuric acid methods dubios et al 1956 respectively 3 results 3 1 dosage optimization of fe ii according to previous studies ma et al 2012 2014 qi et al 2016a 2016b the optimized molar ratio of kmno4 to fe ii to maintain cell integrity and control residual manganese in effluent is 1 3 thus different dosages of fe ii were initially used to investigate the uf membrane fouling at a rkmno4 fe ii of 1 3 as shown in fig 1 severe uf membrane fouling occurred with raw water alone and j j0 was significantly reduced to 0 42 after 500 s of operation however membrane fouling was gradually alleviated with the subsequent addition of kmno4 and fe ii the membrane fouling alleviation rate slowed when the dose of fe ii exceeded 18 μm without pretreatment the j j0 was 0 42 and it increased to 0 56 with 18 μm of feso4 7h2o 6 μm kmno4 after 500 s of operation however it only increased to 0 61 when the fe ii dosage reached 90 μm 30 μm kmno4 at 500 s previous studies have demonstrated that kmno4 doses below 20 μm have little effect on algal cells and mainly reacted with surface absorbed aom rather than directly damaging the algae xie et al 2013 qi et al 2016b moreover almost all algae were removed by the uf membrane both with and without pretreatment data not shown thus the 18 μm dosage of feso4 7h2o 6 μm kmno4 was selected as the optimum concentration during further testing the concentrations of mn and fe in the effluent fig s3 were much lower than that required by the environmental protection agency epa usa which is 0 3 mg l for both mn and fe frisbie et al 2002 wasserman et al 2006 3 2 variation in tmp development after long term operation to further investigate the uf membrane s performance hollow fiber membranes were analyzed with pretreatment using 6 μm of kmno4 and 18 μm of feso4 7h2o over 100 d of operation and 18 μm fecl3 6h2o was used alone for comparison as shown in fig 2 the raw water caused serious uf membrane fouling the tmp significantly increased to 70 3 kpa after 10 d of operation but decreased to 48 1 kpa after the membrane s surface was carefully washed with tap water however membrane fouling was significantly alleviated after the addition of fe ii and fe iii uf membrane fouling was also significantly alleviated by the kmno4 fe ii process during fe iii coagulation the tmp gradually increased to 42 8 kpa after 90 d of operation but decreased to 27 2 kpa after washing during the kmno4 fe ii process the tmp only increased to 25 1 kpa after 90 d of operation and decreased to 11 4 kpa after washing the contribution of the cake layer increased especially during the kmno4 fe ii process the cake layer contribution was 31 6 without pretreatment which increased to 36 4 and 54 6 with fe iii coagulation and kmno4 fe ii pretreatment respectively in addition the tmp development exhibited two different phases rapid phase i day 0 30 and slow growth phases phase ii day 31 90 3 3 variation in sem images before and after cake layer washing owing to the continuous floc formation cake layers gradually formed on the membrane s surfaces here sem images were captured to investigate the morphology of the cake layer before and after washing with tap water fig 3 in comparison to the virgin hollow fiber uf membrane fig s4 eom eps like substances were found on the membrane s surface fig 3a many residual eom eps like substances were also observed on the uf membrane s surface even after washing with tap water fig 3b similar results have been reported previously wang et al 2018 the eom eps like substances on the surface of the membrane with fe iii coagulation were more visible than the cake layer that formed under the synergistic effects of the kmno4 fe ii process yellow area fig 3c and e owing to the looseness of the fe based flocs the cake layer was easily removed by tap water especially the layer formed during the kmno4 fe ii process this was consistent with the number of open pores observed on the two fouled membranes which was quantified using imagej as seen in fig 3g a higher percentage of pores with a wide size range was present with moderate pre oxidation the average membrane pore size without pretreatment after washing with tap water was 7 28 0 17 nm which increased to 16 59 0 32 and 20 34 0 21 nm after fecl3 6h2o coagulation and kmno4 fe ii pretreatment respectively 3 4 microorganism development under different pretreatments owing to the moderate pre oxidation eom eps like substances were also observed on the membrane s surface fig 3e thus microorganism activity was further investigated fig 4 as shown in fig 4a 505 microorganism species were identified in the sludge following fe iii coagulation and 504 microorganism species were identified in the sludge after 90 d following kmno4 fe ii pretreatment little difference was found regarding the species of microorganisms with 481 species being the same under both processes to further understand the effects of moderate pre oxidation the detected microorganisms were classified fig 4b both proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were predominant as shown in fig 4b bacteroidetes was the main bacterial phylum after fe iii coagulation whereas proteobacteria was the main phylum after kmno4 fe ii pretreatment the abundance of firmicutes was higher during the kmno4 fe ii process while the abundances of all other species were similar under both pretreatments fig 4c shows the concentrations of proteins and polysaccharides in the sludge on days 30 and 90 during filtration the protein and polysaccharide concentrations after 90 d of operation were higher than those after 30 d under both fe iii coagulation and kmno4 fe ii pretreatment the protein and polysaccharide concentrations were both lower under the kmno4 fe ii process than those under fe iii coagulation alone additionally the concentration of proteins was higher than that of polysaccharides indicating that proteins were the main pollutant causing membrane fouling the protein and polysaccharide concentrations were consistent with the physical results that we discussed previously fig 3c and e indicating that the chance of observing eom eps like substances on the membrane s surface after fe iii coagulation was higher than that after kmno4 fe ii pretreatment 3 5 variation in effluent water quality the effluent water quality was further investigated based on the raw water characteristics table 1 as shown in fig 5 the doc removal efficiency without pretreatment was 39 7 after 10 d of operation after 90 d of operation however the corresponding removal efficiencies increased to 53 7 and 63 8 after fe iii coagulation and kmno4 fe ii pretreatment respectively fig s5 indicates that the removal efficiency of doc was stable throughout operation thus the higher the doc removal efficiency the higher the pretreatment removal ability the mw distribution varied along with the removal of doc the peak value of raw water was 9864 1 da but this decreased to 8630 9 da 10 d after filtration after fe iii coagulation and kmno4 fe ii pretreatment the peak values further decreased to 8442 2 90 d and 8259 6 da 90 d respectively furthermore other effluent water quality characteristics were also excellent as shown in fig s6 there was little variation in turbidity and chromaticity before and after filtration the concentrations of mn and fe in the effluent were also tested as a function of time fig s7 and were also well below than the corresponding epa criteria frisbie et al 2002 wasserman et al 2006 4 discussion previous studies have demonstrated that pore constriction and pore blocking and cake layer formation are the main causes of uf membrane fouling wang and tarabara 2008 to investigate the membrane performance without coagulation the particle size distribution of raw water was investigated fig 6 and ranged from 0 15 to 2 5 μm the particle size of raw water was much larger than the average membrane pore diameter 30 nm indicating that there was little chance for pore blocking however severe flat sheet uf membrane fouling occurred without pretreatment due to the formation of a dense cake layer figs s8a and s8b with kmno4 fe ii pretreatment however a loose cake layer gradually formed figs s8c and s8d which alleviated membrane fouling however the membrane fouling alleviation rate slowed when the dosage of feso4 7h2o exceeded 18 μm 6 μm kmno4 this could be because a thicker cake layer was formed under high feso4 7h2o doses resulting in greater cake fouling resistance thus based on the uf membrane s performance and effluent quality 6 μm of kmno4 and 18 μm of feso4 7h2o were used for the further experimentation for the continuous flow experiment using the hollow fiber membrane severe uf membrane fouling also occurred due to the formation of a dense cake layer fig 3a however the tmp only decreased from 70 3 to 48 1 kpa after washing fig 2 this could be caused by the strong viscidity generated by the algae and eom eps as confirmed using sem fig 3a and b with the injection of fecl3 6h2o most algae were easily adsorbed by flocs during filtration fig 7 a and b with little chance of directly reaching the membrane s surface and tmp development slowed however the uf membrane could still be polluted by non adsorbed algae thus the tmp increased to 42 8 kpa after 90 d but decreased to 27 2 kpa after washing with tap water as the loose cake layer was easily removed after kmno4 pre oxidation in the presence of feso4 7h2o the development of tmp was alleviated to a greater extent than its development under fecl3 6h2o alone which could be ascribed to the following reasons table s1 shows that both the raw water and flocs were negatively charged at ph 8 5 thus the floc size played an important role in alleviating membrane fouling the sizes of flocs formed by 18 μm of fecl3 6h2o were smaller than those formed by 18 μm of feso4 7h2o in the presence of 6 μm of kmno4 this may be due to the formation of mno2 which could serve as a condensation nucleus qi et al 2016b the average floc size formed by fecl3 6h2o was 189 7 19 3 μm but was 241 6 27 2 μm during the kmno4 fe ii process larger flocs resulted in a looser cake layer in addition floc activity was lower during fe iii coagulation than during the kmno4 fe ii process due to the synergistic effects of surface hydroxyl and in situ formed mno2 ma et al 2012 this resulted in a higher algae adsorption ability fig 7b and c furthermore the activity of algae became weaker after kmno4 pre oxidation and fewer eom eps like substances were released therefore the tmp development was slow researching 25 1 kpa after 90 d of operation due to the formation of a loose cake layer the tmp dramatically decreased to 11 4 kpa after washing with tap water and the cake layer s contribution increased fig 2 moreover the algal cells were not damaged by moderate pre oxidation and their morphology was very similar before and after treatment fig 7b and c which is consistent with previously reported results qi et al 2016a fig 7 although the particle sizes of the algae and flocs were much larger than the average uf membrane pore size different tmp development rates occurred over time fig 2 the rapid growth phase phase i day 0 30 could have occurred because algae could still reach the membrane s surface especially at the beginning and the cake layer gradually expanded resulting in cake resistance and a relatively rapid increase in tmp this caused the tmp to grow rapidly during this phase during the slow growth phase phase ii day 31 90 a loose and stable cake layer formed on the membrane s surface as observed in other studies lin et al 2010 wang et al 2018 owing to the high surface activity of flocs formed during the kmno4 fe ii process more algae and eom eps like substances were rejected adsorbed before they reached the membrane s surface thus the average membrane pore size under the kmno4 fe ii process was larger than that under fe iii coagulation after washing fig 3g although moderate pre oxidation had little influence on microorganism development fig 4a the relative abundance of microorganisms significantly varied fig 4b the total abundances of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were almost the same however proteobacteria exhibited a higher tolerance to oxidation conditions than bacteroidetes gomez alvarez et al 2012 thus the main bacterial phylum during the kmno4 fe ii process was proteobacteria while bacteroidetes was the main bacterial phylum during fe iii coagulation fig 4b a previous study demonstrated that oxygen can stimulate the growth of firmicutes due to aerobic denitrification zhou et al 2016 therefore the abundance of firmicutes was higher during the kmno4 fe ii process 8 37 than that during fe iii coagulation 3 44 although microorganisms developed the microorganism species population was small under the two membrane processes and was only one third of that found in membrane bio reactors ma et al 2013 sato et al 2016 owing to the strong anabolic ability of the proteins and polysaccharides of bacteroidetes lin et al 2014 the concentration of eps under fe iii coagulation was higher than that under the kmno4 fe ii process moreover polysaccharides are more easily degraded than proteins due to their molecular structure wardle 1992 which increased the concentration of proteins in the sludge fig 4c for effluent water quality higher removal efficiency of doc and larger variation in peak values were observed fig 5 due to the strong adsorption rejection abilities of the flocs formed by the kmno4 fe ii process the effluent quality parameters were also satisfactory due to the excellent removal rejection effects which included the turbidity chromaticity and concentrations of mn and fe figs s6 and s7 considering these observations the algae laden water caused serious uf membrane fouling due to its viscosity at the membrane s surface or the release of eom eps like substances over time however most algae or their released substances could be adsorbed rejected by the flocs reducing their chance of reaching the membrane s surface and resulting in the formation of a loose cake layer as a result membrane fouling was less severe following the kmno4 fe ii process most algae were inactivated and the microorganism abundance relating to severe membrane fouling was reduced resulting in the release of less eom eps in addition a loose cake layer was also formed as the fe based flocs were larger with higher surface activity than those formed by fecl3 6h2o thus membrane fouling was further alleviated by reducing the possibilities of algae and eom eps like substances reaching the membrane s surface the specific fouling mechanism is illustrated in fig 8 5 conclusions to help resolve algae related water problems a novel kmno4 fe ii pretreatment method was integrated with a uf membrane and compared to fe iii coagulation we found that the uf membrane was seriously fouled without pretreatment while fouling was alleviated on coagulation especially with moderate pre oxidation the algae exhibited a strong adsorption ability to the membrane s surface however the cake layer formed by the flocs was loose resulting in many of the original pores remaining after washing especially after the kmno4 fe ii process although the development of microorganisms was influenced very little by pretreatment the abundance of different microorganisms varied markedly with moderate pre oxidation the abundance of microorganisms related to severe membrane fouling was significantly reduced thus fewer eps were released after the kmno4 fe ii process furthermore the concentration of proteins was higher than that of polysaccharides due to differences in their molecular structures in addition due to the outstanding removal efficiency of the integrated uf membrane process the quality parameters of the effluent including its turbidity chromaticity and the concentrations of mn and fe were also excellent based on the membrane performance exhibited during coagulation the integrated uf membrane and kmno4 fe ii process has considerable potential for application in the treatment of algae laden

19464,although ultrafiltration uf membranes are highly beneficial for removing algae the removal process causes serious uf membrane fouling to avoid the unfavorable effects of algal cells that have been damaged by oxidants our previous study reported a novel moderate pre oxidation method kmno4 fe ii process that aimed to achieve a balance between the release of intracellular organic matter and enhanced algae removal this study further investigated the performance of a uf membrane with kmno4 fe ii pretreatment in the presence of algae laden reservoir water after a long running time we found that algae could be completely removed membrane fouling was significantly alleviated and the overall performance was much better than that of fe iii coagulation alone the transmembrane pressure tmp during fe iii coagulation increased to 42 8 kpa however that of the kmno4 fe ii process only increased to 25 1 kpa for after running for 90 d the slower transmembrane pressure was attributed to the larger floc size higher surface activity and inactivation of algae although there was little effect on microorganism development lower microorganism abundance 20 7 was observed during the kmno4 fe ii process than during coagulation alone 44 9 due to the release of extracellular polymeric substances we also found that the floc cake layer was easily removed by washing and many of the original membrane pores were clearly observed further analysis demonstrated that the effluent quality was excellent especially its turbidity chromaticity and mn and fe concentrations based on the outstanding uf membrane performance it may be concluded that the kmno4 fe ii process exhibits considerable potential for application in the treatment of algae laden water graphical abstract image 1 keywords ultrafiltration membrane algae laden reservoir water moderate kmno4 fe ii pre oxidation fouling alleviation 1 introduction the worldwide occurrence of algal blooms in water has caused great concern among the public the penetration of algal cells and release of odorous and toxic substances frequently cause water quality to deteriorate li et al 2012 wert et al 2014 algal organic matter aom serves as a precursor for the formation of disinfection by products dbps during disinfection wei et al 2011 zhou et al 2014 as a result the presence of algae poses a substantial risk to aquatic health and therefore it is vital that algae is removed effectively during water treatment due to the negative surface charge high motility diverse morphology and low specific density of algae traditional coagulation treatment cannot achieve a satisfactory removal efficiency ma et al 2007 takaara et al 2010 retained algae can be nourished in treatment reactors and sedimentation and filtration tanks and microorganisms can be nourished by the algal cells that have penetrated filtration tanks through sparge pipes and secondary water supply facilities such as service pipes plummer and edzwald 2001 as a result the residual chlorine at the end of the pipe network is gradually depleted further nourishing the microorganisms and deteriorating water quality ma et al 2012 to prevent these adverse effects various pretreatment methods to enhance the removal efficiency of algae during water treatment have been investigated including increasing the coagulant dosage electrocoagulation air flotation pre chlorination oxidation and ultrafiltration uf although increasing the coagulant dosage can improve the algal removal efficiency the dosage usually requires a dual fold increase ma et al 2012 for electrocoagulation the frequent changing polarity and electrode passivation limit its application on a wide scale mollah et al 2004 most water treatment plants lack the appropriate equipment for air floatation thus they require expensive reconstruction ma et al 2012 pre chlorination oxidation i e cl2 o3 has a considerable advantage as it inactivates algae however algal cells can easily be damaged by excessive oxidant dosages resulting in the release of intracellular organic matter iom and increased effluent water risk garzon sanabria et al 2013 to overcome these disadvantages we developed a novel moderate pre oxidation method kmno4 fe ii process that achieves a balance between the release of iom and a high algal removal efficiency ma et al 2012 2014 qi et al 2016a 2016b we demonstrated that algae microcystis aeruginosa are moderately inactivated by the sequential introduction of kmno4 and fe ii the subsequent dose of fe ii not only effectively halts the kmno4 reaction but also further transforms into in situ fe iii which has a larger reactive surface area than traditional preformed fe iii a lower concentration of fe results in the effluent as a by product of the kmno4 fe ii process than as a by product of fe ii coagulation ma et al 2012 based on cell integrity and residual manganese the optimized molar ratio of kmno4 to fe ii was 1 3 and the appropriate dosing interval time was 5 min in addition the suspension ability of the flocs formed during the kmno4 fe ii process is high resulting in low deposition and rendering the process suitable for long term transportation pipelines qi et al 2016b the use of uf membranes in drinking water treatment is a promising technology and has continued to expand owing the excellent resultant water quality and small scale land use huang et al 2009 drioli et al 2011 miao et al 2017 these membranes can completely remove micro algae during filtration as their pores have small diameters mouchet and bonnelye 1998 liang et al 2008 slade and bauen 2013 miao et al 2014 however the deposition of algal cells and extracellular organic matter eom on uf membrane surfaces causes serious fouling resulting in the formation of a dense cake layer this is independent of the pore diameter and surface hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of the membrane liang et al 2008 li et al 2014 qu et al 2014 to date three different processes have been investigated to alleviate membrane fouling including pre adsorption direct filtration and integrated filtration ma et al 2017 the integrated filtration process is considered particularly advantageous in water treatment as it requires little land and exhibits a high removal efficiency during operation zhang et al 2016 ma et al 2017 to better resolve algae related water problems our novel kmno4 fe ii pretreatment process was integrated with uf membranes kmno4 and fe ii were sequentially injected into the membrane tank and fecl3 6h2o was also directly injected for comparison to fully investigate the practicality of this integrated process raw water was collected from the miyun reservoir n 40 29 e 116 49 which is the main drinking water source for beijing china owing to the reduced water quality and high water temperature during summer the reservoir faces the risk of algal pollution su et al 2015 2017 in this study we aimed to 1 investigate the uf membrane fouling behavior during the kmno4 fe ii process in the presence of algae laden water 2 compare the performance of the uf membrane between the kmno4 fe ii process and fecl3 6h2o coagulation and 3 evaluate the practicality of the integrated uf process after long term operation based on effluent water quality parameters including its turbidity chromaticity and mn and fe concentrations 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of raw water the raw water was used immediately after collection from the miyun reservoir and its specific properties are presented in table 1 the concentration of algae was measured by a flow cytometer accrui c6 bd biosciences usa and ranged from 1 99 107 to 2 67 107 cells l table 2 shows the proportions of the different algal species and microcystis was found to be predominant 2 2 kmno4 fe ii process optimization tests all chemical reagents were of analytical grade sinopharm chemical regent beijing co ltd china and included kmno4 feso4 7h2o and fecl3 6h2o stock solutions were prepared using deionized di water millipore milli q usa to generate a proper dosage of fe ii during the test flat sheet polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf uf membranes motimo china were used with a molecular weight cutoff of 100 kda all membranes were immersed in di water for 24 h to remove any impurities a millipore stirred uf cell amicon 8400 usa was used to maintain a stable pressure 0 1 mpa during filtration by applying nitrogen gas to maintain a constant membrane flux 300 ml of di water was first filtrated through all fresh membranes in the pre oxidation tests kmno4 was added to 300 ml of raw water and mixed at 100 rpm for 5 min after pre oxidation feso4 7h2o was added and mixed at 300 rpm for 1 min and 50 rpm for a further 15 min qi et al 2016b the mixture was then filtrated directly the normalized flux j j0 as a function of time was used to determine the uf membrane performance with j0 representing the initial membrane flux 2 3 filtration process to explore the effects of kmno4 fe ii pretreatment after a long running time the performance of the integrated uf membrane was investigated figs s1 and s2 for comparison coagulation by fecl3 6h2o alone at the same dosage as feso4 7h2o was also studied raw water was fed into the membrane tank using a peristaltic pump and a pvdf hollow fiber membrane 100 kda motimo china module was immersed into the membrane tank which had an inner diameter and height of 64 and 800 mm respectively the effluent from the membrane module was pumped at a rate of 1 l h by a peristaltic pump and the filtration cycle was 30 min with 1 min of backwashing at a rate of 2 l h yu et al 2013 to fully use the flocs a micro porous aerator 40 mm diameter was placed at the bottom of the membrane tank coagulation and flocculation were gradual and the flocs were well suspended in the membrane tank with continuous aeration the freshly formed flocs exhibited a large potential for adsorbing pollutants owing to their strong activity chen et al 2015 during filtration membrane fouling was indicated by the corresponding transmembrane pressure tmp which was monitored by pressure sensors the total hydraulic retention time was 2 2 h and sludge was discharged once every 10 d water production rate 99 7 to understand the contributions of cake layer formation and pore blockage constriction the membrane module was carefully removed and washed with tap water beijing china after 10 or 90 d of operation scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 7401f jeol ltd japan was used to capture images of the membrane s morphology which were further analyzed by imagej software ajmani et al 2012 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms 7500a agilent technology usa was employed to measure the concentrations of mn and fe before and after filtration 2 4 characteristics of flocs in the membrane tank to minimize the influence of impurities and accurately characterize the flocs floc samples were collected from 2 cm below the water s surface on day one floc images were captured with a ccd camera on a microscope ge 5 aigo china after transferring the sample onto a slide the surface charge of the flocs was analyzed using a nano particle size and zeta potential analyzer beckman coulter ltd usa 2 5 dna extraction and high throughput sequencing high throughput sequencing was used to determine the composition of microorganisms in the sludge at the end of the experiment dna from the sludge was extracted using a fast dna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals france following the manufacturer s procedures and then stored at 20 c bcd 248wdpm haier china prior to use the dna samples were analyzed by pyrosequencing the v3 and v4 regions of the 16s rdna gene using the illumina miseq pe 300 platform genewiz inc china after pyrosequencing the raw data were filtered to discard short and low quality sequences under the following principles 1 forward primer and barcode of the sequences trimmomatic v0 3 2 bases with trailing quality scores below 20 and sequences shorter than 400 bp trimmomatic v0 3 and 3 chimera sequences usearch v8 0 clean data with 97 similarity were clustered into one operational taxonomic unit otu using qiime v1 7 and the sequences were assigned to taxonomic groups using the silva database silva 111 16s rrna database 2 6 measurement of extracellular polymeric substances eps in sludge issues with water treatment include the gradual release of eom by algae and the continued nourishment of microorganisms in membrane tanks even after moderate pre oxidation during filtration here a traditional heating and extraction method was used to extract the eom eps from the sludge morgan et al 1990 sun et al 2012 the solution was heated for 30 min at 80 c and centrifuged for 5 min at 20 000 rpm the supernatant was then collected for eom eps analysis zhang et al 1999 proteins and polysaccharides the two main components of eom eps were analyzed following modified bradford peterson 1977 and phenol sulfuric acid methods dubios et al 1956 respectively 3 results 3 1 dosage optimization of fe ii according to previous studies ma et al 2012 2014 qi et al 2016a 2016b the optimized molar ratio of kmno4 to fe ii to maintain cell integrity and control residual manganese in effluent is 1 3 thus different dosages of fe ii were initially used to investigate the uf membrane fouling at a rkmno4 fe ii of 1 3 as shown in fig 1 severe uf membrane fouling occurred with raw water alone and j j0 was significantly reduced to 0 42 after 500 s of operation however membrane fouling was gradually alleviated with the subsequent addition of kmno4 and fe ii the membrane fouling alleviation rate slowed when the dose of fe ii exceeded 18 μm without pretreatment the j j0 was 0 42 and it increased to 0 56 with 18 μm of feso4 7h2o 6 μm kmno4 after 500 s of operation however it only increased to 0 61 when the fe ii dosage reached 90 μm 30 μm kmno4 at 500 s previous studies have demonstrated that kmno4 doses below 20 μm have little effect on algal cells and mainly reacted with surface absorbed aom rather than directly damaging the algae xie et al 2013 qi et al 2016b moreover almost all algae were removed by the uf membrane both with and without pretreatment data not shown thus the 18 μm dosage of feso4 7h2o 6 μm kmno4 was selected as the optimum concentration during further testing the concentrations of mn and fe in the effluent fig s3 were much lower than that required by the environmental protection agency epa usa which is 0 3 mg l for both mn and fe frisbie et al 2002 wasserman et al 2006 3 2 variation in tmp development after long term operation to further investigate the uf membrane s performance hollow fiber membranes were analyzed with pretreatment using 6 μm of kmno4 and 18 μm of feso4 7h2o over 100 d of operation and 18 μm fecl3 6h2o was used alone for comparison as shown in fig 2 the raw water caused serious uf membrane fouling the tmp significantly increased to 70 3 kpa after 10 d of operation but decreased to 48 1 kpa after the membrane s surface was carefully washed with tap water however membrane fouling was significantly alleviated after the addition of fe ii and fe iii uf membrane fouling was also significantly alleviated by the kmno4 fe ii process during fe iii coagulation the tmp gradually increased to 42 8 kpa after 90 d of operation but decreased to 27 2 kpa after washing during the kmno4 fe ii process the tmp only increased to 25 1 kpa after 90 d of operation and decreased to 11 4 kpa after washing the contribution of the cake layer increased especially during the kmno4 fe ii process the cake layer contribution was 31 6 without pretreatment which increased to 36 4 and 54 6 with fe iii coagulation and kmno4 fe ii pretreatment respectively in addition the tmp development exhibited two different phases rapid phase i day 0 30 and slow growth phases phase ii day 31 90 3 3 variation in sem images before and after cake layer washing owing to the continuous floc formation cake layers gradually formed on the membrane s surfaces here sem images were captured to investigate the morphology of the cake layer before and after washing with tap water fig 3 in comparison to the virgin hollow fiber uf membrane fig s4 eom eps like substances were found on the membrane s surface fig 3a many residual eom eps like substances were also observed on the uf membrane s surface even after washing with tap water fig 3b similar results have been reported previously wang et al 2018 the eom eps like substances on the surface of the membrane with fe iii coagulation were more visible than the cake layer that formed under the synergistic effects of the kmno4 fe ii process yellow area fig 3c and e owing to the looseness of the fe based flocs the cake layer was easily removed by tap water especially the layer formed during the kmno4 fe ii process this was consistent with the number of open pores observed on the two fouled membranes which was quantified using imagej as seen in fig 3g a higher percentage of pores with a wide size range was present with moderate pre oxidation the average membrane pore size without pretreatment after washing with tap water was 7 28 0 17 nm which increased to 16 59 0 32 and 20 34 0 21 nm after fecl3 6h2o coagulation and kmno4 fe ii pretreatment respectively 3 4 microorganism development under different pretreatments owing to the moderate pre oxidation eom eps like substances were also observed on the membrane s surface fig 3e thus microorganism activity was further investigated fig 4 as shown in fig 4a 505 microorganism species were identified in the sludge following fe iii coagulation and 504 microorganism species were identified in the sludge after 90 d following kmno4 fe ii pretreatment little difference was found regarding the species of microorganisms with 481 species being the same under both processes to further understand the effects of moderate pre oxidation the detected microorganisms were classified fig 4b both proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were predominant as shown in fig 4b bacteroidetes was the main bacterial phylum after fe iii coagulation whereas proteobacteria was the main phylum after kmno4 fe ii pretreatment the abundance of firmicutes was higher during the kmno4 fe ii process while the abundances of all other species were similar under both pretreatments fig 4c shows the concentrations of proteins and polysaccharides in the sludge on days 30 and 90 during filtration the protein and polysaccharide concentrations after 90 d of operation were higher than those after 30 d under both fe iii coagulation and kmno4 fe ii pretreatment the protein and polysaccharide concentrations were both lower under the kmno4 fe ii process than those under fe iii coagulation alone additionally the concentration of proteins was higher than that of polysaccharides indicating that proteins were the main pollutant causing membrane fouling the protein and polysaccharide concentrations were consistent with the physical results that we discussed previously fig 3c and e indicating that the chance of observing eom eps like substances on the membrane s surface after fe iii coagulation was higher than that after kmno4 fe ii pretreatment 3 5 variation in effluent water quality the effluent water quality was further investigated based on the raw water characteristics table 1 as shown in fig 5 the doc removal efficiency without pretreatment was 39 7 after 10 d of operation after 90 d of operation however the corresponding removal efficiencies increased to 53 7 and 63 8 after fe iii coagulation and kmno4 fe ii pretreatment respectively fig s5 indicates that the removal efficiency of doc was stable throughout operation thus the higher the doc removal efficiency the higher the pretreatment removal ability the mw distribution varied along with the removal of doc the peak value of raw water was 9864 1 da but this decreased to 8630 9 da 10 d after filtration after fe iii coagulation and kmno4 fe ii pretreatment the peak values further decreased to 8442 2 90 d and 8259 6 da 90 d respectively furthermore other effluent water quality characteristics were also excellent as shown in fig s6 there was little variation in turbidity and chromaticity before and after filtration the concentrations of mn and fe in the effluent were also tested as a function of time fig s7 and were also well below than the corresponding epa criteria frisbie et al 2002 wasserman et al 2006 4 discussion previous studies have demonstrated that pore constriction and pore blocking and cake layer formation are the main causes of uf membrane fouling wang and tarabara 2008 to investigate the membrane performance without coagulation the particle size distribution of raw water was investigated fig 6 and ranged from 0 15 to 2 5 μm the particle size of raw water was much larger than the average membrane pore diameter 30 nm indicating that there was little chance for pore blocking however severe flat sheet uf membrane fouling occurred without pretreatment due to the formation of a dense cake layer figs s8a and s8b with kmno4 fe ii pretreatment however a loose cake layer gradually formed figs s8c and s8d which alleviated membrane fouling however the membrane fouling alleviation rate slowed when the dosage of feso4 7h2o exceeded 18 μm 6 μm kmno4 this could be because a thicker cake layer was formed under high feso4 7h2o doses resulting in greater cake fouling resistance thus based on the uf membrane s performance and effluent quality 6 μm of kmno4 and 18 μm of feso4 7h2o were used for the further experimentation for the continuous flow experiment using the hollow fiber membrane severe uf membrane fouling also occurred due to the formation of a dense cake layer fig 3a however the tmp only decreased from 70 3 to 48 1 kpa after washing fig 2 this could be caused by the strong viscidity generated by the algae and eom eps as confirmed using sem fig 3a and b with the injection of fecl3 6h2o most algae were easily adsorbed by flocs during filtration fig 7 a and b with little chance of directly reaching the membrane s surface and tmp development slowed however the uf membrane could still be polluted by non adsorbed algae thus the tmp increased to 42 8 kpa after 90 d but decreased to 27 2 kpa after washing with tap water as the loose cake layer was easily removed after kmno4 pre oxidation in the presence of feso4 7h2o the development of tmp was alleviated to a greater extent than its development under fecl3 6h2o alone which could be ascribed to the following reasons table s1 shows that both the raw water and flocs were negatively charged at ph 8 5 thus the floc size played an important role in alleviating membrane fouling the sizes of flocs formed by 18 μm of fecl3 6h2o were smaller than those formed by 18 μm of feso4 7h2o in the presence of 6 μm of kmno4 this may be due to the formation of mno2 which could serve as a condensation nucleus qi et al 2016b the average floc size formed by fecl3 6h2o was 189 7 19 3 μm but was 241 6 27 2 μm during the kmno4 fe ii process larger flocs resulted in a looser cake layer in addition floc activity was lower during fe iii coagulation than during the kmno4 fe ii process due to the synergistic effects of surface hydroxyl and in situ formed mno2 ma et al 2012 this resulted in a higher algae adsorption ability fig 7b and c furthermore the activity of algae became weaker after kmno4 pre oxidation and fewer eom eps like substances were released therefore the tmp development was slow researching 25 1 kpa after 90 d of operation due to the formation of a loose cake layer the tmp dramatically decreased to 11 4 kpa after washing with tap water and the cake layer s contribution increased fig 2 moreover the algal cells were not damaged by moderate pre oxidation and their morphology was very similar before and after treatment fig 7b and c which is consistent with previously reported results qi et al 2016a fig 7 although the particle sizes of the algae and flocs were much larger than the average uf membrane pore size different tmp development rates occurred over time fig 2 the rapid growth phase phase i day 0 30 could have occurred because algae could still reach the membrane s surface especially at the beginning and the cake layer gradually expanded resulting in cake resistance and a relatively rapid increase in tmp this caused the tmp to grow rapidly during this phase during the slow growth phase phase ii day 31 90 a loose and stable cake layer formed on the membrane s surface as observed in other studies lin et al 2010 wang et al 2018 owing to the high surface activity of flocs formed during the kmno4 fe ii process more algae and eom eps like substances were rejected adsorbed before they reached the membrane s surface thus the average membrane pore size under the kmno4 fe ii process was larger than that under fe iii coagulation after washing fig 3g although moderate pre oxidation had little influence on microorganism development fig 4a the relative abundance of microorganisms significantly varied fig 4b the total abundances of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were almost the same however proteobacteria exhibited a higher tolerance to oxidation conditions than bacteroidetes gomez alvarez et al 2012 thus the main bacterial phylum during the kmno4 fe ii process was proteobacteria while bacteroidetes was the main bacterial phylum during fe iii coagulation fig 4b a previous study demonstrated that oxygen can stimulate the growth of firmicutes due to aerobic denitrification zhou et al 2016 therefore the abundance of firmicutes was higher during the kmno4 fe ii process 8 37 than that during fe iii coagulation 3 44 although microorganisms developed the microorganism species population was small under the two membrane processes and was only one third of that found in membrane bio reactors ma et al 2013 sato et al 2016 owing to the strong anabolic ability of the proteins and polysaccharides of bacteroidetes lin et al 2014 the concentration of eps under fe iii coagulation was higher than that under the kmno4 fe ii process moreover polysaccharides are more easily degraded than proteins due to their molecular structure wardle 1992 which increased the concentration of proteins in the sludge fig 4c for effluent water quality higher removal efficiency of doc and larger variation in peak values were observed fig 5 due to the strong adsorption rejection abilities of the flocs formed by the kmno4 fe ii process the effluent quality parameters were also satisfactory due to the excellent removal rejection effects which included the turbidity chromaticity and concentrations of mn and fe figs s6 and s7 considering these observations the algae laden water caused serious uf membrane fouling due to its viscosity at the membrane s surface or the release of eom eps like substances over time however most algae or their released substances could be adsorbed rejected by the flocs reducing their chance of reaching the membrane s surface and resulting in the formation of a loose cake layer as a result membrane fouling was less severe following the kmno4 fe ii process most algae were inactivated and the microorganism abundance relating to severe membrane fouling was reduced resulting in the release of less eom eps in addition a loose cake layer was also formed as the fe based flocs were larger with higher surface activity than those formed by fecl3 6h2o thus membrane fouling was further alleviated by reducing the possibilities of algae and eom eps like substances reaching the membrane s surface the specific fouling mechanism is illustrated in fig 8 5 conclusions to help resolve algae related water problems a novel kmno4 fe ii pretreatment method was integrated with a uf membrane and compared to fe iii coagulation we found that the uf membrane was seriously fouled without pretreatment while fouling was alleviated on coagulation especially with moderate pre oxidation the algae exhibited a strong adsorption ability to the membrane s surface however the cake layer formed by the flocs was loose resulting in many of the original pores remaining after washing especially after the kmno4 fe ii process although the development of microorganisms was influenced very little by pretreatment the abundance of different microorganisms varied markedly with moderate pre oxidation the abundance of microorganisms related to severe membrane fouling was significantly reduced thus fewer eps were released after the kmno4 fe ii process furthermore the concentration of proteins was higher than that of polysaccharides due to differences in their molecular structures in addition due to the outstanding removal efficiency of the integrated uf membrane process the quality parameters of the effluent including its turbidity chromaticity and the concentrations of mn and fe were also excellent based on the membrane performance exhibited during coagulation the integrated uf membrane and kmno4 fe ii process has considerable potential for application in the treatment of algae laden
