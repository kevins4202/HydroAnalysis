12690,in order to remove cd ii from waste water a highly effective hydrogel named microcrystalline cellulose bentonite grafted polyacrylic acid mcc ben g paa was synthesized using microcrystalline cellulose mcc and bentonite ben as raw materials with ammonium persulfate aps as the initiators and n n methylene bisacrylamide mba acting as the crosslinker the adsorbent was characterized by sem ftir xps tg and the results showed that the mcc ben g paa contains abundant c and o containing surface groups which are favorable for the adsorption of cd ii batch experiments showed that the adsorption of cd ii could reach a peak of 242 53 mg g under the optimal conditions with the dosage of 1 g l at ph 6 and the cd ii initial concentration of 50 800 mg l the adsorption kinetics fitted the pseudo second order dynamics and the adsorption isotherm followed the freundlich model indicating that the cd ii adsorption by mcc ben g paa was a chemisorption based multi layer process mainly controlled by intraparticle diffusion ion competition experiments showed that the adsorbent was highly selective with removal rates higher than 95 for cd ii in presence of various cations and anions regeneration experiment showed that the adsorbent maintained a cd ii removal rate of 88 37 after 10 cycles therefore the mcc ben g paa is an easily prepared remarkably effective and highly reusable adsorbent which is rather promising for the treatment of heavy metal containing wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cellulose hydrogel bentonite cd ii adsorption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction heavy metal contamination in waters has become a serious environmental issue in recent years 1 2 of all heavy metals cadmium cd is one of the most common cations widely used in the sintering of ores the smelting of non ferrous metals alloy batteries nickel cadmium batteries dyes fertilizers metal plating communications engineering and the aerospace industry 3 9 high concentrations of cd in industrial effluents and chemical wastes can cause serious water pollution organic pollution loads and even toxicity cytotoxicity mutagenicity and genotoxicity 10 if the cadmium contaminated food is consumed for a long time people may suffer from painful diseases such as dysfunctions of the kidney tubules causing protein loss from the body to urine and they may gradually develop chondromalacia and spontaneous fractures 11 13 as stipulated in 2018 who guidelines on drinking water the maximum allowable concentration of cadmium should be 0 003 mg l in drinking water therefore the elimination of heavy metals from water is essential effective methods of removing heavy metals from water include membrane separation techniques adsorption chemical precipitation and ion exchange techniques 14 17 adsorption is considered to be a low cost and highly effective way of treating heavy metal pollution and it has been widely applied because it is also environmentally friendly typical sorbents include carbon based materials metal organic frameworks oxides and hydrogels etc 18 20 in recent years hydrogels have been adopted as adsorbent materials they are prepared with biomass materials chitosan cellulose konjac and alginate acting as raw materials which are further to be cross linked and polymerized for producing soft and net like structured polymers the unique network structure and active functional groups make them rather promising in the purification of waste water 21 22 pathways of synthesizing hydrogels are numerous including physical crosslinking intermolecular hydrogen bonding electrostatic coupling van der waals attraction etc chemical crosslinking monomer copolymer crosslinking water soluble polymer compound crosslinking and graft copolymerization 23 the extreme instability of the hydrogel network formed by a single physical cross link combined with the poor ability to recover after adsorption can limit the application of hydrogels 24 traditional methods for preparing hydrogel are tedious and costly the way in which the hydrogel is cross linked determines its function and use compared with other alternatives the graft copolymerization method boasts the advantages of low costs without the drawbacks of operational difficulty nor the secondary pollution of water bodies 25 microcrystalline cellulose mcc can be grafted and copolymerized to enhance the removal of heavy metal ions in addition to its wide availability and imperviousness to water it is also endowed with good renewable properties and a large number of hydroxyl groups that can undergo chemical reactions such as etherification esterification oxidation and graft copolymerization and can form hydrogen bonds with ionic groups in solution thus forming a strong gel system 26 bentonite ben a mineral component based on montmorillonite can be stored in large quantities in nature and is inexpensive its porous structure enables it to be efficient in ion exchange and displace heavy metal ions in solution 27 moreover the graft copolymers can be mixed with montmorillonite to increase the hydrogel spatial capacity 28 researches have shown that organic inorganic hybrid composites such as cellulose clay minerals 29 cellulose acetate nanofibers hydroxyapatite 30 and bentonite biopolymer composites 31 are effective in removing pollutants from wastewater currently most cellulose based hydrogel adsorbents have such a low adsorption capacity that they fail to remove high concentrations of cd ii from industrial wastewater which may be due to the cellulose s low activity in its adsorption sites therefore it is particularly important to develop organic inorganic composite materials mixed with cellulose and clay minerals to improve the adsorption and reusability of the adsorbent in this paper with ammonium persulphate aps acting as the initiator and the n n methylene bisacrylamide mba as the crosslinker microcrystalline cellulose and bentonite were used as raw materials to form a green microcrystalline cellulose bentonite grafted polyacrylic acid mcc ben g paa hydrogel adsorbent by polymerization reaction with acrylic acid aa the effects of different factors ph cd ii concentration adsorbent dosage adsorption time and temperature on the adsorption by hydrogel adsorbents were investigated to determine the optimum adsorption parameters the adsorption mechanisms were delved into through adsorption kinetics isotherms intraparticle diffusion and thermodynamic models competitive ion adsorption was conducted to understand the selectivity of the new developed adsorbent for cd ii and regenerative adsorption test was carried out to understand its regenerative adsorption performance and practical value 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials microcrystalline cellulose mcc used in this study were purchased from tianjin berens biotechnology co ltd molecular formula c6h10o5 molecular weight 162 06n particle size 20 100 μm bentonite ben is a kind of natural montmorillonite while in this study we mainly exploited the sodium based bentonite provided by xi an wenye trading co ltd besides other materials including cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate cd no3 2 4h2o ammonium persulphate aps n n methylenebisacrylamide mba acrylic acid aa hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh were all purchased from xi an chemical reagent factory in xi an of china it should be pointed out that all chemicals were analytical reagent grade and did not require further purification before use 2 2 preparation of mcc ben g paa hydrogel adsorbent first 1 g of microcrystalline cellulose was dissolved in naoh urea h2o mass ratio being 7 12 81 solution to obtain the cellulose solution 32 then 0 5

subsequent 30 min of stirring 0 02 g of mba was added with subsequent 1 h of stirring the mixture was then placed in a water bath at 333 k for 4 h to form the mcc ben g paa hydrogel after that the hydrogel was rinsed with deionized water and freeze dried at 253 k for 24 h at last the mcc ben g paa hydrogel was further dried in a vacuum desiccator for another 48 h 2 3 mcc ben g paa

analyzed through fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer ftir thermofisher nicolet is 5 the elemental composition of mcc ben g paa was analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermofisherk 250xi the surface charge property of mcc ben g paa was determined through a zeta potential analyzer zeta zetapals brookhaven the thermal stability of mcc ben g paa was analyzed through thermogravimetric analysis tg ger sta 449 f3 2 4 batch adsorption the cd ii solutions was obtained by dissolving solid cd no3 2 4h2o the mcc ben g paa was added to a certain level of cd ii solution at 1 g l the solution ph was regulated with 0 1 mol l hcl and naoh the ambient temperature was controlled by a constant temperature shaking incubator and shaking for 24 h to reach adsorption equilibrium residual cd ii concentrations were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry with three replicates the effects of ph 3 8 cd ii concentration 50 200 mg l adsorbent dosage 0 6 1 6 g l temperature 298 318 k and adsorption time 0 5 24 h on the adsorption ability were tested the adsorption capacity can be calculated as follows 1 qe v c 0 c m where c 0 mg l is the initial concentration of cd ii c mg l is the final concentration of cd ii q e mg g is the equilibrium adsorption capacity v l represents the volume of the solution m g represents the amount of mcc ben g paa 2 5 ionic competition experiments in order to simulate the adsorption in sewage treatment no3 po4 3 co3 2 pb2 ni2 and ca2 were selected as competing ions their effects on the removal of cd ii were verified by setting the concentrations of cd ii and other competing ions at 100 mg l and at 50 mg l respectively the dosage of mcc ben g paa was set at 1 g l the adsorption capacity was determined by shaking them for 24 h at 298 k 2 6 regenerative adsorption experiments the concentration of cd ii was 100 mg l the dosage of mcc ben g paa was 1 g l the cd ii removal capacity was measured by shaking them for 24 h at ph 6 and temperature of 298 k upon recovery mcc ben g paa was desorbed with 0 1 mol l hcl regenerated with 0 1 mol l naoh rinsed with deionized water and placed in an oven at 323 k for 4 h before being taken out and tested again for adsorption 3 results and discussion 3 1 mcc ben g paa characterization fig 1 shows the morphology of mcc ben g paa before and after cd ii adsorption the surface was rough and inhomogeneous though observation under low magnification forming an oriented streamlined framework structure suggesting that the addition of cellulose could generate a solid gel system fig 1a at high magnification it was more clearly observed that the hydrogel formed a framework structure with a network distribution fig 1b according to this study the sem eds mapping analysis of cd ii adsorption on mcc g paa ben revealed that the c and o groups were uniformly distributed in this adsorbent with a wide range of adsorption sites fig 1c after the adsorption the surface structure was essentially unchanged and cd ii was homogeneously adsorbed on the material further demonstrating that the 2 adsorption sites were homogeneous for cd ii fig 2 provides us with the ftir spectrum of mcc ben g paa before and after the adsorption of cd ii the characteristic peaks of mcc ben g paa at 3352 cm 1 2934 cm 1 and 1621 cm 1 could be explained as the oh ch and co stretching vibrations respectively 33 35 the peaks at 1550 cm 1 and 1449 cm 1 were the bending of co in the cooh and coor groups 36 in addition cn and co bending vibration peaked at 1276 cm 1and 1164 cm 1 accordingly 37 the characteristic peak at 1019 cm 1 may be ascribed to si oh stretching vibrations in the bentonite 38 the characteristic peak at 792 cm 1 was the sio tetrahedral and alo octahedral skeletal vibrational characteristic peak 39 upon the adsorption of cd ii the vibrational peak of oh at 3353 cm 1 became 3340 cm 1 and its characteristic peak was weakened by the stretching of the oh which can manifest the key role played by oh in adsorbing cd ii 40 the weak variations in the characteristic peaks of co cooh cn and ch showed that these functional groups were involved in the adsorption reaction of cd ii 41 the xps spectra of mcc ben g paa hydrogels before and after adsorption were shown in fig 3a mcc ben g paa mainly contains c n o and na there were new peaks of cd3d3 2 and cd3d5 2 after the adsorption of cd ii and at the same time the binding energy of c1s n1s and o1s ascended slightly which could demonstrate the effective adsorption of cd ii by mcc ben g paa fig 3b shows the c1s diagram of mcc ben g paa hydrogels before adsorption c1s had four major peaks specifically the peak at 284 6 ev as a c c c h peak the peak at 285 1 ev as a c o c c n peak the peak at 287 1 ev as a co peak and the peak at 288 7 ev as an o c o peak 42 43 in fig 3c of o1s diagram of mcc ben g paa before adsorption the peaks at 531 6 ev and 532 7 ev represent the co and co peaks respectively 44 the slightly increased binding energy of c1s o1s and cc c o c o c o co and co after the adsorption fig 3d indicated that the electron deficient cd metal cation may cripple the electron cloud density around the c and o atoms further suggesting that mcc ben g paa was effective in the adsorption of cd ii 45 among the peaks of cd3d appeared after the adsorption the peaks at 406 1 ev and 411 8 ev were cd3d3 2 and cd3d5 2 respectively fig 3f which also demonstrated the effective adsorption of cd ii 25 to further investigate the adsorption performance thermal stability measurements of mcc ben g paa were carried out by tg the weight loss before the adsorption of cd ii was divided into three stages fig 4a specifically the first stage at 0 k to 423 k with a weight loss of 2 mainly caused by evaporation and the detachment of water 17 the second stage at 423 k to 528 k mainly featured the decomposition of cellulose at high temperatures which was probably due to the breakage of cc bonds and the decomposition of groups such as cooh and oh on the cellulose chain with the weight loss of 29 the third stage at 528 k to 773 k with a weight loss of 34 could be caused by thermal decomposition of the polymer backbone in the graft copolymer 46 the weight loss following cd ii adsorption was also composed of three stages fig 4b the first stage at 0 k to 423 k was only 2 mainly caused by the evaporation of water molecules adsorbed on the surface the second stage from 423 k to 528 k climbed to 14 which could probably find its roots in the splitting of cellulose chains and the loss of unabsorbed functional groups from the reaction 45 the third stage from 528 k to 773 k reached 34 probably due to the thermal decomposition of the polymer backbone in the graft copolymer and the breaking of bonds bound to heavy metals 35 when the tg was compared before and after the adsorption it can be found that the weight loss of the adsorbent after adsorption of cd ii was less than that before adsorption probably due to the stronger hydrogen bonding of the adsorbent after the adsorption of cd ii making the polymer s main chain structure more stable 47 in contrast different rates of the thermal degradation indicated that the interchain cross linking reaction would result in good thermal stability of mcc ben g paa both before and after the adsorption 48 3 2 cd ii adsorption by mcc ben g paa 3 2 1 adsorbent dosage solution ph initial cd ii concentration and time the adsorbent dosage is a crucial parameter in the study of adsorption and its influence on adsorption capacity is mainly reflected in the sites where the adsorption occurs in this study the ph was 6 and the concentration of cd ii was 100 mg l the effects of adsorbents with varying dosages on the adsorption and removal rate of cd ii were investigated ranging from 0 6 to 1 6 g l for mcc ben g paa dosages fig 5a the results showed that the adsorption and removal of cd ii tended to increase when the adsorbent dosage was within the range of 0 6 1 g l this is because if we introduced lower doses of this adsorbent its adsorption effect and removal rate of cd ii could become more pronounced as we increased its dosage with the adsorption sites increased 49 when the adsorbent dosage was in the range of 1 1 6 g l the adsorption of cd ii showed a downward trend while the removal rate remained unchanged therefore in an attempt to give full play to the efficiency of the adsorbent the adsorption reaction seems to be optimal when the mcc ben g paa reaches 1 g l 29 the ph affects the form in which the metal ions are present in the solution and the surface properties of mcc ben g paa and it has been considered as an essential factor during adsorption 50 in the study the default setting was a adsorbent dosage of 1 g l cd ii concentration of 100 mg l and a ph of 3 8 in the ph range 3 6 the adsorption of cd ii by mcc ben g paa increased with increasing ph before peaking at ph 6 fig 5b this is because under strongly acidic conditions the hydrogel adsorbent surface could be covered with h with which cd2 would compete for adsorption sites resulting in lower adsorption capacity as the ph continued to increase the h concentration decreased and the capacity of ion exchange and the adsorption increased accordingly 51 in addition the ph value could also affect the surface charge density of the hydrogel adsorbent as shown in fig 5c the zero charge point of mcc ben g paa almost bottomed at 1 6 phzcp when ph phzcp the zeta potential of the adsorbent was negative the charge density at the adsorbent surface increased as the ph continued to rise the cation of cd ii in solution was adsorbed onto the negatively charged adsorbent surface it was driven by the electric adsorption force when the ph was lower there was less negative charge on the surface of the adsorbent therefore the solution with low ph were not conducive to cd ii adsorption 52 generally as the concentration of cd ii increases the adsorption can be affected by the potential energy generated by the concentration difference between the solution and the adsorbent 53 also the adsorption time is an essential element of the adsorption reaction the study set the adsorbent dosage to 1 g l ph 6 cd ii concentration to 50 200 mg l and adsorption time to 0 5 24 h our results showed that the adsorption reaction reached equilibrium within 10 h fig 6a the adsorption amount increased with increasing cd ii concentration while the cd ii removal rates tended to decrease with increasing cd ii concentration fig 6a and b with given dosage of adsorbent dosage the mcc ben g paa failed to adsorb more cd ii when the binding sites on the adsorbent were saturated as a result the adsorbent dosage was enhanced to improve the removal amount of cd ii in the treatment of the sewage with higher concentrations 54 3 2 2 adsorption kinetics and intraparticle diffusion models to investigate the rapidity of solute adsorption rates by mcc ben g paa the experiment was set at 298 k ph 6 and cd ii concentration was 50 mg l the amount of mcc ben g paa was 1 g l and the adsorption time was 0 5 24 h the data were fitted and analyzed through kinetic models 55 pseudo first order kinetic model equation 2 qt qe 1 exp k 1 t pseudo second order kinetic model equation 3 qt q e 2 k 2 t 1 qek 2 t where q t mg g is the volume adsorbed at moment t q e mg g is the equilibrium adsorption volume t min is the adsorption duration k 1 min 1 is the pseudo first order kinetic rate constant k 2 g mg min is the pseudo second order kinetic rate constant the results are presented in fig 7a and table 1 respectively fig 7a indicates that the adsorption reaction reached the adsorption equilibrium after approximately 10 h which complied with the pseudo second order kinetic model according to the model fitting parameters in table 1 it could be seen that r 2 2 0 990 for pseudo second order kinetics was higher than r 1 2 0 955 for pseudo first order kinetics and q e 50 34 mg g for pseudo second order kinetics was closer to the actual maximum adsorption amount q max 51 31 mg g 48 the pseudo second order kinetic model was shown to be a more sensible explanation for the process of cd ii adsorption by mcc ben g paa it also indicated that during the adsorption process the chemisorption and physical adsorption worked together 56 to further investigate the controlling factors in the adsorption process an intraparticle diffusion model was introduced to analyze the adsorption of cd ii by mcc ben g paa the model equation for intraparticle diffusion is as follows 4 q t k id t 0 5 c where q t mg g refers to the adsorption capacity at time t t h is the adsorption time k id mg g min0 5 is a constant for the internal particle diffusivity c is the model constant the fitting results are illustrated in fig 7b and table 2 which revealed that three steps were involved during the adsorption process the first stage was the surface diffusion stage 0 1h when the mcc ben g paa surface contained numerous adsorption sites and the mass transfer power and the adsorption rates increased due to the differences in the concentration between the solution and the adsorbent with the increasing cd ii concentration the mass transfer power accelerated and the adsorption rates increased which could prove that the k 1 value in table 2 could rise with the increasing cd ii concentration 53 the controlling factor in the second stage was membrane diffusion 1 6 h with the adsorption sites gradually occupied what paralleled the decrease in cd ii solubility were the abatement of mass transfer kinetics and the drop in adsorption rates thus demonstrating that the k 2 value in table 2 was less than the k 1 value 42 the third stage was the final equilibrium stage 6 24 h in which the adsorption sites were saturated and the rates of adsorption were essentially the same as those of desorption 55 the fitted lines for the first two stages did not cross the origin which may indicate that the diffusion process could be influenced by a number of factors 3 2 3 adsorption isotherms and thermodynamics the concentration of cd ii was 50 800 mg l the dosage of mcc ben g paa was 1 g l and ph 6 the temperature was 298 k 318 k and the adsorption time was 24 h the langmuir and freundlich model were used to study the sorption of cd ii by mcc ben g paa at different temperatures and ph 6 in order to calculate the number of molecular layers and the maximum adsorption capacity 57 langmuir model equation 5 q e k l q max c e 1 k l c e freundlich model equation 6 q e k f c e 1 n where q e mg g is the adsorption amount at equilibrium q max mg g is the maximum adsorption volumes c e mg l is the concentration of cd ii in solution at adsorption equilibrium k l l mg is the langmuir constant k f mg g mg l 1 n and n is the freundlich constant the results are shown in fig 8 and table 3 fig 8 indicated that the adsorption process was consistent with the freundlich model the fitting results showed that the r2 of the freundlich model was all greater than that of the langmuir model which proved that the freundlich model could be a better interpretation on the adsorption of cd ii by mcc ben g paa 44 thus the type of adsorption belonged to the multi molecular layer adsorption according to table 3 the parameter n 1 confirming that the adsorption reaction was readily performed 41 by comparing the adsorption capacity of cd ii with different hydrogel adsorbents reported in the literature table 4 mcc ben g paa prepared in this study was found to outperform other counterparts it could be contributed to the intercalated bentonite on the graft copolymerized polymer 57 the thermodynamics of adsorption is a more in depth study of the adsorption process the free energy of adsorption δg kj mol the heat of adsorption δh kj mol and the entropy of adsorption δs kj k mol of the adsorption process can be obtained through these equations 58 7 δg rt ln k a 8 δg δh tδs 9 ln k a δs r δh rt where r j mol k is the ideal gas number t k is the thermodynamic temperature and k α is the thermodynamic equilibrium constant as shown in table 5 the free energy δg was negative and decreased with increasing temperature meaning that the adsorption reaction could proceed more easily at higher temperatures 55 the heat of adsorption δh was positive which indicated that during the adsorption process heat could be absorbed the entropy of adsorption δs was positive which testified that the adsorption was an irreversible process driven by the entropy of adsorption and there were slim chances of desorption 51 3 3 ion competition and regenerative adsorption experiments in sewage treatment there might be various coexisting cations and anions with cd ii no3 po4 3 co3 2 pb2 ni2 and ca2 were selected as test competing ions for cd ii adsorption the removal of cd ii with the presence of no3 po4 3 and co3 2 respectively was up to 99 97 99 87 and 99 83 which were greater than that of ck fig 9a thus addition of such anions could facilitate the adsorption of cd ii with the addition of no3 no3 could form metal complexes with cd ii 59 addition of po4 3 resulted in the formation of cdhpo4 60 while co3 2 also leaded to cadmium precipitates those processes may account for the enhanced adsorption of cd ii 61 the removal rates of cd ii with the presence of pb2 ni2 and ca2 were 98 74 96 18 and 95 37 respectively which were lower than that of ck co existing of cations reduced the removal efficiencies probably caused by competition for adsorption sites the hydration radius and electronegativity of cations also influenced the adsorption process more electronegative cations showed stronger binding ability and were more likely to be captured by the adsorbent 62 63 compared to cd2 1755 kj mol ca2 1505 kj mol had a lower hydration energy and could be more easily trapped by the adsorbent that is why the presence of ca2 resulted in the lowest cd ii removal rate 64 recycling is of great importance in practical applications the present study was carried out on mcc g paa ben for 10 cycles of adsorption experiments in the adsorption desorption regeneration experiments desorption with 0 1 mol l hcl regeneration with 0 1 mol l naoh it can be reused for the next round adsorption in the first cyclic adsorption the cd ii removal was 97 31 in cycles 2 7 the cd ii removal rate decreased probably due to incomplete desorption of cd ii and destruction of c and o adsorption sites during the desorption process 53 the cd ii removal rate was stable at around 88 37 over 8 10 cycles fig 9b 10 cycles of adsorption only decreased the cd ii removal rate by 9 which demonstrated that the adsorbent had good regenerative adsorption performance therefore practical use of mcc ben g paa in sewage treatment is promising 3 4 adsorption mechanism from the adsorption kinetics adsorption diffusion and adsorption isotherm modeling results it can be seen that the adsorption of cd ii by mcc ben g paa was mainly a chemisorption based integrated physical chemical process which was a heterogeneous adsorption of multi molecular layers 48 sem eds mapping analysis of mcc g paa ben after adsorption of cd ii showed that the c and o groups were uniformly distributed in this adsorbent with a wide range of adsorption sites fig 1c after the adsorption reaction the surface structure remained essentially unchanged and cd ii was adsorbed uniformly onto the material further demonstrating that the 2 adsorption sites were homogeneous for cd ii zeta potential analysis also showed that mcc ben g paa was negatively charged at ph 1 6 mainly related to the formation of c and o o and coo adsorption of cd ii via electrostatic attraction 51 the results of ftir analysis before and after adsorption showed that the vibrational peak of oh was at 3353 cm 1 which changed to 3340 cm 1 after the adsorption of cd ii an obvious change could be seen during this process and this indicated that there could be hydrogen bonding between oh and cd ii and its hydroxyl and carboxyl groups acted adsorbed cd ii through hydrogen bonding 39 in addition the cn absorption peak changed indicating that cn was ionically complexed with cd ii 52 the xps results showed the appearance of cd3d after adsorption indicating an effective adsorption of cd ii by comparing the full spectra before and after adsorption it can be found that the na1s spectral peaks were significantly reduced which indicated that cation exchange occurred between the bentonite layers and promoted the adsorption of cd ii furthermore c1s and o1s showed a marginal growth in binding energies suggesting that the carbon oxygen functional groups may be the main active sites for the adsorption of cd ii by mcc ben g paa 44 it turned out that the adsorption of cd ii by mcc ben g paa was realized mainly through hydrogen bonding electrostatic attraction ion complexation and physical adsorption fig 10 4 conclusion with the purpose of efficiently removing cd ii from waste water a novel and efficient hydrogel adsorbent mcc ben g paa was synthesized with cellulose and bentonite as raw materials the performance characterization revealed that mcc ben g paa features a rough and inhomogeneous network framework structure with many carbon oxygen adsorption groups which favors the adsorption of cd ii adsorption tests show the maximum adsorption capacity of mcc ben g paa for cd ii could reach 242 53 mg g much higher than other counterparts the adsorption of cd ii by mcc ben g paa was heat absorbing and spontaneous during which chemical multilayer adsorption occurred the removal rate with multiple competing ions around could reached as high as 95 37 demonstrating the high selectivity of mcc ben g paa for cd ii the main adsorption mechanisms of cd ii on mcc ben g paa include electrostatic interaction ion complexation physical adsorption and hydrogen bonding in addition the mcc ben g paa could maintain a removal rate of 88 37 after 10 cycles of adsorption and desorption with reusable performance therefore mcc ben g paa showed high adsorption performance highly selective and reusable hydrogel adsorbent in the present study bentonite by intercalation to increase the spatial capacity of the hydrogel has provided a new path of hydrogel preparation and

12690,in order to remove cd ii from waste water a highly effective hydrogel named microcrystalline cellulose bentonite grafted polyacrylic acid mcc ben g paa was synthesized using microcrystalline cellulose mcc and bentonite ben as raw materials with ammonium persulfate aps as the initiators and n n methylene bisacrylamide mba acting as the crosslinker the adsorbent was characterized by sem ftir xps tg and the results showed that the mcc ben g paa contains abundant c and o containing surface groups which are favorable for the adsorption of cd ii batch experiments showed that the adsorption of cd ii could reach a peak of 242 53 mg g under the optimal conditions with the dosage of 1 g l at ph 6 and the cd ii initial concentration of 50 800 mg l the adsorption kinetics fitted the pseudo second order dynamics and the adsorption isotherm followed the freundlich model indicating that the cd ii adsorption by mcc ben g paa was a chemisorption based multi layer process mainly controlled by intraparticle diffusion ion competition experiments showed that the adsorbent was highly selective with removal rates higher than 95 for cd ii in presence of various cations and anions regeneration experiment showed that the adsorbent maintained a cd ii removal rate of 88 37 after 10 cycles therefore the mcc ben g paa is an easily prepared remarkably effective and highly reusable adsorbent which is rather promising for the treatment of heavy metal containing wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cellulose hydrogel bentonite cd ii adsorption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction heavy metal contamination in waters has become a serious environmental issue in recent years 1 2 of all heavy metals cadmium cd is one of the most common cations widely used in the sintering of ores the smelting of non ferrous metals alloy batteries nickel cadmium batteries dyes fertilizers metal plating communications engineering and the aerospace industry 3 9 high concentrations of cd in industrial effluents and chemical wastes can cause serious water pollution organic pollution loads and even toxicity cytotoxicity mutagenicity and genotoxicity 10 if the cadmium contaminated food is consumed for a long time people may suffer from painful diseases such as dysfunctions of the kidney tubules causing protein loss from the body to urine and they may gradually develop chondromalacia and spontaneous fractures 11 13 as stipulated in 2018 who guidelines on drinking water the maximum allowable concentration of cadmium should be 0 003 mg l in drinking water therefore the elimination of heavy metals from water is essential effective methods of removing heavy metals from water include membrane separation techniques adsorption chemical precipitation and ion exchange techniques 14 17 adsorption is considered to be a low cost and highly effective way of treating heavy metal pollution and it has been widely applied because it is also environmentally friendly typical sorbents include carbon based materials metal organic frameworks oxides and hydrogels etc 18 20 in recent years hydrogels have been adopted as adsorbent materials they are prepared with biomass materials chitosan cellulose konjac and alginate acting as raw materials which are further to be cross linked and polymerized for producing soft and net like structured polymers the unique network structure and active functional groups make them rather promising in the purification of waste water 21 22 pathways of synthesizing hydrogels are numerous including physical crosslinking intermolecular hydrogen bonding electrostatic coupling van der waals attraction etc chemical crosslinking monomer copolymer crosslinking water soluble polymer compound crosslinking and graft copolymerization 23 the extreme instability of the hydrogel network formed by a single physical cross link combined with the poor ability to recover after adsorption can limit the application of hydrogels 24 traditional methods for preparing hydrogel are tedious and costly the way in which the hydrogel is cross linked determines its function and use compared with other alternatives the graft copolymerization method boasts the advantages of low costs without the drawbacks of operational difficulty nor the secondary pollution of water bodies 25 microcrystalline cellulose mcc can be grafted and copolymerized to enhance the removal of heavy metal ions in addition to its wide availability and imperviousness to water it is also endowed with good renewable properties and a large number of hydroxyl groups that can undergo chemical reactions such as etherification esterification oxidation and graft copolymerization and can form hydrogen bonds with ionic groups in solution thus forming a strong gel system 26 bentonite ben a mineral component based on montmorillonite can be stored in large quantities in nature and is inexpensive its porous structure enables it to be efficient in ion exchange and displace heavy metal ions in solution 27 moreover the graft copolymers can be mixed with montmorillonite to increase the hydrogel spatial capacity 28 researches have shown that organic inorganic hybrid composites such as cellulose clay minerals 29 cellulose acetate nanofibers hydroxyapatite 30 and bentonite biopolymer composites 31 are effective in removing pollutants from wastewater currently most cellulose based hydrogel adsorbents have such a low adsorption capacity that they fail to remove high concentrations of cd ii from industrial wastewater which may be due to the cellulose s low activity in its adsorption sites therefore it is particularly important to develop organic inorganic composite materials mixed with cellulose and clay minerals to improve the adsorption and reusability of the adsorbent in this paper with ammonium persulphate aps acting as the initiator and the n n methylene bisacrylamide mba as the crosslinker microcrystalline cellulose and bentonite were used as raw materials to form a green microcrystalline cellulose bentonite grafted polyacrylic acid mcc ben g paa hydrogel adsorbent by polymerization

thermogravimetric analysis tg ger sta 449 f3 2 4 batch adsorption the cd ii solutions was obtained by dissolving solid cd no3 2 4h2o the mcc ben g paa was added to a certain level of cd ii solution at 1 g l the solution ph was regulated with 0 1 mol l hcl and naoh the ambient temperature was controlled by a constant temperature shaking incubator and shaking for 24 h to reach adsorption equilibrium

temperature 298 318 k and adsorption time 0 5 24 h on the adsorption ability were tested the adsorption capacity can be calculated as follows 1 qe v c 0 c m where c 0 mg l is the initial concentration of cd ii c mg l is the final concentration of cd ii q e mg g is the equilibrium adsorption capacity v l represents the volume of the solution m g represents the amount of mcc ben g paa 2 5 ionic competition experiments in order to simulate the adsorption in sewage treatment no3 po4 3 co3 2 pb2 ni2 and ca2 were selected as competing ions their effects on the removal of cd ii were verified by setting the concentrations of cd ii and other competing ions at 100 mg l and at 50 mg l respectively the dosage of mcc ben g paa was set at 1 g l the adsorption capacity was determined by shaking them for 24 h at 298 k 2 6 regenerative adsorption experiments the concentration of cd ii was 100 mg l the dosage of mcc ben g paa was 1 g l the cd ii removal capacity was measured by shaking them for 24 h at ph 6 and temperature of 298 k upon recovery mcc ben g paa was desorbed with 0 1 mol l hcl regenerated with 0 1 mol l naoh rinsed with deionized water and placed in an oven at 323 k for 4 h before being taken out and tested again for adsorption 3 results and discussion 3 1 mcc ben g paa characterization fig 1 shows the morphology of mcc ben g paa before and after cd ii adsorption the surface was rough and inhomogeneous though observation under low magnification forming an oriented streamlined framework structure suggesting that the addition of cellulose could generate a solid gel system fig 1a at high magnification it was more clearly observed that the hydrogel formed a framework structure with a network distribution fig 1b according to this study the sem eds mapping analysis of cd ii adsorption on mcc g paa ben revealed that the c and o groups were uniformly distributed in this adsorbent with a wide range of adsorption sites fig 1c after the adsorption the surface structure was essentially unchanged and cd ii was homogeneously adsorbed on the material further demonstrating that the 2 adsorption sites were homogeneous for cd ii fig 2 provides us with the ftir spectrum of mcc ben g paa before and after the adsorption of cd ii the characteristic peaks of mcc ben g paa at 3352 cm 1 2934 cm 1 and 1621 cm 1 could be explained as the oh ch and co stretching vibrations respectively 33 35 the peaks at 1550 cm 1 and 1449 cm 1 were the bending of co in the cooh and coor groups 36 in addition cn and co bending vibration peaked at 1276 cm 1and 1164 cm 1 accordingly 37 the characteristic peak at 1019 cm 1 may be ascribed to si oh stretching vibrations in the bentonite 38 the characteristic peak at 792 cm 1 was the sio tetrahedral and alo octahedral skeletal vibrational characteristic peak 39 upon the adsorption of cd ii the vibrational peak of oh at 3353 cm 1 became 3340 cm 1 and its characteristic peak was weakened by the stretching of the oh which can manifest the key role played by oh in adsorbing cd ii 40 the weak variations in the characteristic peaks of co cooh cn and ch showed that these functional groups were involved in the adsorption reaction of cd ii 41 the xps spectra of mcc ben g paa hydrogels before and after adsorption were shown in fig 3a mcc ben g paa mainly contains c n o and na there were new peaks of cd3d3 2 and cd3d5 2 after the adsorption of cd ii and at the same time the binding energy of c1s n1s and o1s ascended slightly which could demonstrate the effective adsorption of cd ii by mcc ben g paa fig 3b shows the c1s diagram of mcc ben g paa hydrogels before adsorption c1s had four major peaks specifically the peak at 284 6 ev as a c c c h peak the peak at 285 1 ev as a c o c c n peak the peak at 287 1 ev as a co peak and the peak at 288 7 ev as an o c o peak 42 43 in fig 3c of o1s diagram of mcc ben g paa before adsorption the peaks at 531 6 ev and 532 7 ev represent the co and co peaks respectively 44 the slightly increased binding energy of c1s o1s and cc c o c o c o co and co after the adsorption fig 3d indicated that the electron deficient cd metal cation may cripple the electron cloud density around the c and o atoms further suggesting that mcc ben g paa was effective in the adsorption of cd ii 45 among the peaks of cd3d appeared after the adsorption the peaks at 406 1 ev and 411 8 ev were cd3d3 2 and cd3d5 2 respectively fig 3f which also demonstrated the effective adsorption of cd ii 25 to further investigate the adsorption performance thermal stability measurements of mcc ben g paa were carried out by tg the weight loss before the adsorption of cd ii was divided into three stages fig 4a specifically the first stage at 0 k to 423 k with a weight loss of 2 mainly caused by evaporation and the detachment of water 17 the second stage at 423 k to 528 k mainly featured the decomposition of cellulose at high temperatures which was probably due to the breakage of cc bonds and the decomposition of groups such as cooh and oh on the cellulose chain with the weight loss of 29 the third stage at 528 k to 773 k with a weight loss of 34 could be caused by thermal decomposition of the polymer backbone in the graft copolymer 46 the weight loss following cd ii adsorption was also composed of three stages fig 4b the first stage at 0 k to 423 k was only 2 mainly caused by the evaporation of water molecules adsorbed on the surface the second stage from 423 k to 528 k climbed to 14 which could probably find its roots in the splitting of cellulose chains and the loss of unabsorbed functional groups from the reaction 45 the third stage from 528 k to 773 k reached 34 probably due to the thermal decomposition of the polymer backbone in the graft copolymer and the breaking of bonds bound to heavy metals 35 when the tg was compared before and after the adsorption it can be found that the weight loss of the adsorbent after adsorption of cd ii was less than that before adsorption probably due to the stronger hydrogen bonding of the adsorbent after the adsorption of cd ii making the polymer s main chain structure more stable 47 in contrast different rates of the thermal degradation indicated that the interchain cross linking reaction would result in good thermal stability of mcc ben g paa both before and after the adsorption 48 3 2 cd ii adsorption by mcc ben g paa 3 2 1 adsorbent dosage solution ph initial cd ii concentration and time the adsorbent dosage is a crucial parameter in the study of adsorption and its influence on adsorption capacity is mainly reflected in the sites where the adsorption occurs in this study the ph was 6 and the concentration of cd ii was 100 mg l the effects of adsorbents with varying dosages on the adsorption and removal rate of cd ii were investigated ranging from 0 6 to 1 6 g l for mcc ben g paa dosages fig 5a the results showed that the adsorption and removal of cd ii tended to increase when the adsorbent dosage was within the range of 0 6 1 g l this is because if we introduced lower doses of this adsorbent its adsorption effect and removal rate of cd ii could become more pronounced as we increased its dosage with the adsorption sites increased 49 when the adsorbent dosage was in the range of 1 1 6 g l the adsorption of cd ii showed a downward trend while the removal rate remained unchanged therefore in an attempt to give full play to the efficiency of the adsorbent the adsorption reaction seems to be optimal when the mcc ben g paa reaches 1 g l 29 the ph affects the form in which the metal ions are present in the solution and the surface properties of mcc ben g paa and it has been considered as an essential factor during adsorption 50 in the study the default setting was a adsorbent dosage of 1 g l cd ii concentration of 100 mg l and a ph of 3 8 in the ph range 3 6 the adsorption of cd ii by mcc ben g paa increased with increasing ph before peaking at ph 6 fig 5b this is because under strongly acidic conditions the hydrogel adsorbent surface could be covered with h with which cd2 would compete for adsorption sites resulting in lower adsorption capacity as the ph continued to increase the h concentration decreased and the capacity of ion exchange and the adsorption increased accordingly 51 in addition the ph value could also affect the surface charge density of the hydrogel adsorbent as shown in fig 5c the zero charge point of mcc ben g paa almost bottomed at 1 6 phzcp when ph phzcp the zeta potential of the adsorbent was negative the charge density at the adsorbent surface increased as the ph continued to rise the cation of cd ii in solution was adsorbed onto the negatively charged adsorbent surface it was driven by the electric adsorption force when the ph was lower there was less negative charge on the surface of the adsorbent therefore the solution with low ph were not conducive to cd ii adsorption 52 generally as the concentration of cd ii increases the adsorption can be affected by the potential energy generated by the concentration difference between the solution and the adsorbent 53 also the adsorption time is an essential element of the adsorption reaction the study set the adsorbent dosage to 1 g l ph 6 cd ii concentration to 50 200 mg l and adsorption time to 0 5 24 h our results showed that the adsorption reaction reached equilibrium within 10 h fig 6a the adsorption amount increased with increasing cd ii concentration while the cd ii removal rates tended to decrease with increasing cd ii concentration fig 6a and b with given dosage of adsorbent dosage the mcc ben g paa failed to adsorb more cd ii when the binding sites on the adsorbent were saturated as a result the adsorbent dosage was enhanced to improve the removal amount of cd ii in the treatment of the sewage with higher concentrations 54 3 2 2 adsorption kinetics and intraparticle diffusion models to investigate the rapidity of solute adsorption rates by mcc ben g paa the experiment was set at 298 k ph 6 and cd ii concentration was 50 mg l the amount of mcc ben g paa was 1 g l and the adsorption time was 0 5 24 h the data were fitted and analyzed through kinetic models 55 pseudo first order kinetic model equation 2 qt qe 1 exp k 1 t pseudo second order kinetic model equation 3 qt q e 2 k 2 t 1 qek 2 t where q t mg g is the volume adsorbed at moment t q e mg g is the equilibrium adsorption volume t min is the adsorption duration k 1 min 1 is the pseudo first order kinetic rate constant k 2 g mg min is the pseudo second order kinetic rate constant the results are presented in fig 7a and table 1 respectively fig 7a indicates that the adsorption reaction reached the adsorption equilibrium after approximately 10 h which complied with the pseudo second order kinetic model according to the model fitting parameters in table 1 it could be seen that r 2 2 0 990 for pseudo second order kinetics was higher than r 1 2 0 955 for pseudo first order kinetics and q e 50 34 mg g for pseudo second order kinetics was closer to the actual maximum adsorption amount q max 51 31 mg g 48 the pseudo second order kinetic model was shown to be a more sensible explanation for the process of cd ii adsorption by mcc ben g paa it also indicated that during the adsorption process the chemisorption and physical adsorption worked together 56 to further investigate the controlling factors in the adsorption process an intraparticle diffusion model was introduced to analyze the adsorption of cd ii by mcc ben g paa the model equation for intraparticle diffusion is as follows 4 q t k id t 0 5 c where q t mg g refers to the adsorption capacity at time t t h is the adsorption time k id mg g min0 5 is a constant for the internal particle diffusivity c is the model constant the fitting results are illustrated in fig 7b and table 2 which revealed that three steps were involved during the adsorption process the first stage was the surface diffusion stage 0 1h when the mcc ben g paa surface contained numerous adsorption sites and the mass transfer power and the adsorption rates increased due to the differences in the concentration between the solution and the adsorbent with the increasing cd ii concentration the mass transfer power accelerated and the adsorption rates increased which could prove that the k 1 value in table 2 could rise with the increasing cd ii concentration 53 the controlling factor in the second stage was membrane diffusion 1 6 h with the adsorption sites gradually occupied what paralleled the decrease in cd ii solubility were the abatement of mass transfer kinetics and the drop in adsorption rates thus demonstrating that the k 2 value in table 2 was less than the k 1 value 42 the third stage was the final equilibrium stage 6 24 h in which the adsorption sites were saturated and the rates of adsorption were essentially the same as those of desorption 55 the fitted lines for the first two stages did not cross the origin which may indicate that the diffusion process could be influenced by a number of factors 3 2 3 adsorption isotherms and thermodynamics the concentration of cd ii was 50 800 mg l the dosage of mcc ben g paa was 1 g l and ph 6 the temperature was 298 k 318 k and the adsorption time was 24 h the langmuir and freundlich model were used to study the sorption of cd ii by mcc ben g paa at different temperatures and ph 6 in order to calculate the number of molecular layers and the maximum adsorption capacity 57 langmuir model equation 5 q e k l q max c e 1 k l c e freundlich model equation 6 q e k f c e 1 n where q e mg g is the adsorption amount at equilibrium q max mg g is the maximum adsorption volumes c e mg l is the concentration of cd ii in solution at adsorption equilibrium k l l mg is the langmuir constant k f mg g mg l 1 n and n is the freundlich constant the results are shown in fig 8 and table 3 fig 8 indicated that the adsorption process was consistent with the freundlich model the fitting results showed that the r2 of the freundlich model was all greater than that of the langmuir model which proved that the freundlich model could be a better interpretation on the adsorption of cd ii by mcc ben g paa 44 thus the type of adsorption belonged to the multi molecular layer adsorption according to table 3 the parameter n 1 confirming that the adsorption reaction was readily performed 41 by comparing the adsorption capacity of cd ii with different hydrogel adsorbents reported in the literature table 4 mcc ben g paa prepared in this study was found to outperform other counterparts it could be contributed to the intercalated bentonite on the graft copolymerized polymer 57 the thermodynamics of adsorption is a more in depth study of the adsorption process the free energy of adsorption δg kj mol the heat of adsorption δh kj mol and the entropy of adsorption δs kj k mol of the adsorption process can be obtained through these equations 58 7 δg rt ln k a 8 δg δh tδs 9 ln k a δs r δh rt where r j mol k is the ideal gas number t k is the thermodynamic temperature and k α is the thermodynamic equilibrium constant as shown in table 5 the free energy δg was negative and decreased with increasing temperature meaning that the adsorption reaction could proceed more easily at higher temperatures 55 the heat of adsorption δh was positive which indicated that during the adsorption process heat could be absorbed the entropy of adsorption δs was positive which testified that the adsorption was an irreversible process driven by the entropy of adsorption and there were slim chances of desorption 51 3 3 ion competition and regenerative adsorption experiments in sewage treatment there might be various coexisting cations and anions with cd ii no3 po4 3 co3 2 pb2 ni2 and ca2 were selected as test competing ions for cd ii adsorption the removal of cd ii with the presence of no3 po4 3 and co3 2 respectively was up to 99 97 99 87 and 99 83 which were greater than that of ck fig 9a thus addition of such anions could facilitate the adsorption of cd ii with the addition of no3 no3 could form metal complexes with cd ii 59 addition of po4 3 resulted in the formation of cdhpo4 60 while co3 2 also leaded to cadmium precipitates those processes may account for the enhanced adsorption of cd ii 61 the removal rates of cd ii with the presence of pb2 ni2 and ca2 were 98 74 96 18 and 95 37 respectively which were lower than that of ck co existing of cations reduced the removal efficiencies probably caused by competition for adsorption sites the hydration radius and electronegativity of cations also influenced the adsorption process more electronegative cations showed stronger binding ability and were more likely to be captured by the adsorbent 62 63 compared to cd2 1755 kj mol ca2 1505 kj mol had a lower hydration energy and could be more easily trapped by the adsorbent that is why the presence of ca2 resulted in the lowest cd ii removal rate 64 recycling is of great importance in practical applications the present study was carried out on mcc g paa ben for 10 cycles of adsorption experiments in the adsorption desorption regeneration experiments desorption with 0 1 mol l hcl regeneration with 0 1 mol l naoh it can be reused for the next round adsorption in the first cyclic adsorption the cd ii removal was 97 31 in cycles 2 7 the cd ii removal rate decreased probably due to incomplete desorption of cd ii and destruction of c and o adsorption sites during the desorption process 53 the cd ii removal rate was stable at around 88 37 over 8 10 cycles fig 9b 10 cycles of adsorption only decreased the cd ii removal rate by 9 which demonstrated that the adsorbent had good regenerative adsorption performance therefore practical use of mcc ben g paa in sewage treatment is promising 3 4 adsorption mechanism from the adsorption kinetics adsorption diffusion and adsorption isotherm modeling results it can be seen that the adsorption of cd ii by mcc ben g paa was mainly a chemisorption based integrated physical chemical process which was a heterogeneous adsorption of multi molecular layers 48 sem eds mapping analysis of mcc g paa ben after adsorption of cd ii showed that the c and o groups were uniformly distributed in this adsorbent with a wide range of adsorption sites fig 1c after the adsorption reaction the surface structure remained essentially unchanged and cd ii was adsorbed uniformly onto the material further demonstrating that the 2 adsorption sites were homogeneous for cd ii zeta potential analysis also showed that mcc ben g paa was negatively charged at ph 1 6 mainly related to the formation of c and o o and coo adsorption of cd ii via electrostatic attraction 51 the results of ftir analysis before and after adsorption showed that the vibrational peak of oh was at 3353 cm 1 which changed to 3340 cm 1 after the adsorption of cd ii an obvious change could be seen during this process and this indicated that there could be hydrogen bonding between oh and cd ii and its hydroxyl and carboxyl groups acted adsorbed cd ii through hydrogen bonding 39 in addition the cn absorption peak changed indicating that cn was ionically complexed with cd ii 52 the xps results showed the appearance of cd3d after adsorption indicating an effective adsorption of cd ii by comparing the full spectra before and after adsorption it can be found that the na1s spectral peaks were significantly reduced which indicated that cation exchange occurred between the bentonite layers and promoted the adsorption of cd ii furthermore c1s and o1s showed a marginal growth in binding energies suggesting that the carbon oxygen functional groups may be the main active sites for the adsorption of cd ii by mcc ben g paa 44 it turned out that the adsorption of cd ii by mcc ben g paa was realized mainly through hydrogen bonding electrostatic attraction ion complexation and physical adsorption fig 10 4 conclusion with the purpose of efficiently removing cd ii from waste water a novel and efficient hydrogel adsorbent mcc ben g paa was synthesized with cellulose and bentonite as raw materials the performance characterization revealed that mcc ben g paa features a rough and inhomogeneous network framework structure with many carbon oxygen adsorption groups which favors the adsorption of cd ii adsorption tests show the maximum adsorption capacity of mcc ben g paa for cd ii could reach 242 53 mg g much higher than other counterparts the adsorption of cd ii by mcc ben g paa was heat absorbing and spontaneous during which chemical multilayer adsorption occurred the removal rate with multiple competing ions around could reached as high as 95 37 demonstrating the high selectivity of mcc ben g paa for cd ii the main adsorption mechanisms of cd ii on mcc ben g paa include electrostatic interaction ion complexation physical adsorption and hydrogen bonding in addition the mcc ben g paa could maintain a removal rate of 88 37 after 10 cycles of adsorption and desorption with reusable performance therefore mcc ben g paa showed high adsorption performance highly selective and reusable hydrogel adsorbent in the present study bentonite by intercalation to increase the spatial capacity of the hydrogel has provided a new path of hydrogel preparation and

kps k2s2o8 effects of different operating parameters such as treatment temperature us power ph of the solution and oxidant loading on the extent of degradation have been studied acoustic power of 100 w with a frequency of 22 khz and duty cycle of 70 7 s on 3 s off were elucidated as the best treatment conditions for only ultrasound induced degradation us amongst all the combined approaches us kps scheme was the most efficient and economical treatment scheme for the highest removal of ma 97 3 within 2 h of treatment the optimized us kps scheme at conditions of ph of 10 kps loading of 0 5 g l and temperature of 30 c was exploited for ma degradation at a pilot level using a longitudinal horn based sonoreactor at a capacity of 4 l which resulted in 94 of ma removal cavitational yield for longitudinal horn 1 23 10 3 mg j was almost 4 times higher than that seen in a simple us horn 0 33 10 3 mg j under similar conditions additionally it was shown that a combined strategy based on cavitation and oxidants is preferred compared to an individual approach involving ultrasound or oxidants overall the longitudinal horn reactor in combination with kps was shown to be the most energy efficient and economical treatment method giving 94 of degradation at an operating cost of 0 03 l graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords methylamine degradation ultrasound longitudinal horn intensification advanced oxidation processes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction methylamine ma a primary amine is typically found in effluent from the pharmaceutical insecticide paint surfactant and amine processing industries it is also found in human urine decaying seafood and fermented broths used in ethanol production 1 2 ma is highly toxic to aquatic life as well as the environment many investigations have proved the toxicity of several primary amines emphasizing the importance of remediation 3 4 therefore to maintain the water quality and protect the environment an effective and industrially practicable treatment method is required conventional remediation techniques for the primary amines include thermal degradation 5 biological treatment 6 activated carbon based adsorption 7 and membrane separation 8 long degradation times sludge production high energy consumption fouling and significant maintenance are some of the drawbacks of traditional processes that need to be addressed with the development of modern technologies 9 10 advanced oxidation processes aops are one of the alternative oxidation methods that can remove organic compounds from effluent and allow discharge of treated water that adheres to standard discharge norms 11 the attack of highly reactive radicals is the main degradation mechanism for the aops involving hydrogen peroxide h2o2 12 o3 oxidation 13 fenton oxidation h2o2 fe2 14 electrochemical oxidation 15 photolysis 16 photocatalysis 17 us 18 19 hydrodynamic cavitation 20 22 etc that can be applied for regulating critical water parameters such as cod toc or control the presence of organic compounds in the water bodies the development of hybrid oxidation processes based on such aops by combining one or two oxidation processes can result in minimal chemical consumption and process cost and play a crucial role in finalizing the most appropriate treatment method for commercial application the remediation of nitrogen or amine based pollutants using aops as an alternate option was indeed discussed in recent research 23 another study aimed at developing quantitative assessments for such pollutants which is essential for effectively regulating their standard permissible limits in the final treated water 24 some studies looked at the mechanism and pathway of organic compound degradation including the identification of reactive species in the oxidation process such as singlet oxygen 1o2 hydroxyl radicals ho and super oxygen radicals o2 which would be essential for the development and optimization of treatment conditions number of processing steps as well as assessing the longevity of process equipment for industrial applications 25 27 studies have also been published on the application of aops for the treatment of primary amine based synthetic or industrial effluents and the results from these studies have been quite beneficial karthikeyan et al 14 studied the use of the fenton oxidation for the removal of aniline present in an aqueous solution and reported almost 96 of aniline removal using heterogeneous fenton oxidation under optimum conditions as molar ratio of h2o2 fe2 equal to 1 2 solution ph of 3 5 and aniline concentration of 1000 mg l bhat and gogate 23 critically reviewed the degradation of several industrially important nitrogeneuous compounds including primary amine using advanced oxidation processes and reported that hybrid methods are generally beneficial as compared to the individual processes though the specific intensification is dependent on the type of amine and applied process fernandes et al 28 revealed that tio2 uv o3 and tio2 uv o3 h2o2 are efficient systems to degrade the several types of vocs in a relatively minimum treatment time and chemical loading with maximum efficacy as 92 of t vocs degradation and 46 of cod reduction some recent investigations also focused on the use of advanced techniques based on the use of fumaric acid based metal organic frameworks 29 hydroxyapatite layered lanthanum organic frameworks 30 and hydroxyapatite embedded cerium organic frameworks 31 for removal of fluoride ions as well as using nano mixed metal mn al fe oxide based adsorptive technique for removal of chromate and phosphate ions 32 considering that there is not much work based on cavitation for treatment of primary amines the current work has targeted the use of cavitation for treatemnt of methylamine containing wastewater cavitation is an oxidation method governed by the generation growth and collapse of gas vapour filled bubbles the implosion of these bubbles causes intense localized temperature 500 to 15 000 k and pressure 100 5000 atm inside the liquid medium for microseconds the continuous implosion of numerous bubbles generates extremely reactive hydroxyl radicals ho due to the decomposition of water molecules which can be effectively employed in water treatment to degrade complex compounds 19 cavitation is usually initiated by passing a liquid through a confinement zone hydrodynamic cavitation or by passing ultrasonic waves in the liquid acoustic cavitation in addition to its cost effectiveness and energy efficiency cavitation is a technology that can provide sustainable and pollution free and greener solutions for treating industrial wastewater 23 33 the enormous energy released during cavitation can be transferred locally to organic molecules causing them to raise their intrinsic energy and break down into small molecules using pyrolytic mechanism or reaction with hydroxyl radicals there is not much literature on the use of advanced oxidation processes to degrade primary amines except for some studies based on photocatalytic oxidation yielding complete degradation of ma and 94 degradation of dma after 15 h and 18 h respectively 34 and 75 degradation of ethanolamine using uv chlorine treatment 16 etc the current study provides important information about the potential use of cavitation to remove ma from aqueous solutions as it plans to develop a low cost and eco friendly degradation system based on cavitation that can be demonstrated on a large scale to the best of our understanding first attempt has been made for application of hybrid cavitation based treatment for removal of ma with detailed understanding into effect of operating parameters and different combinations followed by successful pilot scale demonstration which clearly highlights the novelty of the work asides the potential role in commercial applications the model primary amine based study can help design engineers in choosing an appropriate range of operating parameters and oxidation processes for the treatment of various amine

uhplc instrument equipped with refractive index ri detector and c18 column c18 column was operated with 95 5 aqueous ammonium acetate 5 mm methanol as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml min column temperature of 30 c and detector temperature of 30 c 35 37 the finalization of the analysis conditions including the mobile phase was based on the initial optimization study trying out different concentration ratios of aqueous ammonium acetate and methanol as well as the flow rates of mobile phase the extent of ma degradation was calculated using the eq 1 1 ma degradation initial concentration ma o final conccentration ma initial concentration ma o 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of temperature effect of temperature on ma degradation was studied using different temperatures such as 20 c 30 c 40 c and 45 c operated at constant alkaline conditions ph 10 for 2 h of treatment time fig 2 a shows the degradation pattern of ma vs time at different temperatures it was observed that a rise in temperature from 20 c to 45 c increased the degradation of ma and a subsequent increase in the temperature resulted in marginal change maximum ma degradation of 22 was obtained at 30 c as compared to ma degradation at 20 c 5 40 20 and 45 20 after 2 h of treatment due to the insufficient amount of heat energy required to break the bond between ch3 nh2 and the lower kinetic rates negligible ma degradation was obtained at 20 c within 2 h of treatment it was also noticed that no significant change was obtained after 30 c for ma degradation within 2 h of treatment attributed to the fact that cavitation effects are less prevalent at higher temperatures beyond the optimal value meaning that there is less energy available due to the cushioning effect during collapse resulting in a slower degradation rate of the ma hence the optimal temperature must be chosen to achieve the thermal effect and sonochemistry synergism and minimize the operational cost 38 the degradation mechanism of ma using ho radicals produced in the cavitation and generation of its degradation products such as methyl amino radical hydrogen cyanide radical and ammonia is shown in eqs 2 to 5 35 2 ch 3 nh 2 ho ch 3 n h h 2 o 3 ch 3 n h ho ch 2 n h h 2 o 4 ch 2 n h ho hcn h h 2 o 5 hcn h ho co nh 3 in another study the effect of temperature on the degradation of monoethanolamine was reported when the temperature was changed from 40 c to 55 c and it was found that the oxidation was enhanced by 30 for the desired increase in temperature 39 in another study zhang et al 40 elucidated that aniline degradation using the o3 zero valent zinc zn0 system was highest at a temperature of 24 c amongst the studied temperatures ranging from 15 c to 45 c temperatures above 24 c seemed to have a negative impact on o3 solubility and stability yielding lower degradation overall it can be said that it is necessary to apply an optimum temperature specific to the system and avoid the use of excessive heat energy for the degradation in order to reduce the cost of the operation 3 2 effect of ph effect of ph on the degradation of ma was studied at various ph values such as 3 6 8 and 10 the temperature of the experiments for the ph study was kept constant at 30 c it was observed from the obtained results as shown in fig 2 b that the degradation of ma increased with an increase in ph values from 3 to 10 maximum degradation of ma of 16 66 was obtained at a ph value of 10 amongst all other ph values of 3 7 86 6 8 38 and 8 11 08 within 120 min of treatment it was also seen that not much change was seen between the treatments times of 90 and 120 min of operation based on the results ph value of 10 was considered as optimum value and used for further experiments the favored trend of higher degradation under basic condition may be observed due to the reaction that occurs between ho and ch3nh2 which is favored at the increased ph value of the solution the unstable intermediate product of ch3nh formed in eq 2 combines with ho radicals and undergoes degradation as per a series of reactions as shown in eqs 3 to 4 strong base ammonia formed as per eq 5 is also responsible for maintaining the ph of the solution at the basic condition jiang et al 41 reported similar results for aniline degradation with higher degradation under alkaline conditions with us frequency of 610 khz us power of 25 w and a temperature of 15 c the interaction between ho radicals and the aniline is stronger in alkaline than in acidic conditions with a rate constant obtained at ph of 8 11 being approximately three times that obtained at ph 4 overall it can be said that alkaline ph is more suited for the ma degradation using ultrasonic irradiation alone 3 3 effect of us power the effect of us power on the ma degradation was also studied using different us power of 60 w 80 w 100 w and 120 w for 2 h of treatment at a solution ph of 10 and temperature of 30 c the degradation of ma was shown to rise as us power increased from 60 w to 100 w with no further increase in degradation occurring at us power of 120 w as shown in fig 2 c the maximum degradation of 18 75 was obtained at us power of 100 w as compared to the other us power values such as 60 w 10 54 80 w 15 72 and 120 w 11 53 after 90 min of treatment time there was no significant difference beyond the treatment time of 90 min us is known for generating more cavitation events up to the optimal us power limit beyond which the degradation remains stable or declines due to a reduction in cavitation collapse intensity caused by coalescence and degassing 42 liang et al 43 reported a similar trend for the degradation of aromatic amines using us kmno4 system at different power densities ranging from 0 36 to 3 24 w cm3 amongst all the power densities 1 80 w cm3 was found to be optimal for achieving maximum degradation of monocyclic anilines and other aromatic amines as 82 8 and 53 1 average respectively at kmno4 loading of 12 mm and ph of 5 us power applied over the optimal limit is also detrimental to operational costs and hence selecting optimum power is important directing the importance of current study for ma based on the obtained results in the study with individual us treatment power of 100 w ph of 10 and temperature of 30 c were selected as the optimum combining us and other oxidation methods could be an effective way to achieve synergetic benefits while minimizing the cost and energy consumption of the process and hence using established optimum conditions for individual us operation different combinations of us with oxidants were investigated 3 4 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 combination with us effect of h2o2 combined with us on ma degradation was studied at different h2o2 loadings of 1 g l 2 g l 3 g l and 4 g l at solution ph of 10 the temperature of 30 c power of 100 w and 2 h of treatment time it was observed that the degradation of ma increased gradually from 9 52 to 33 34 as h2o2 loading increased from 1 g l to 3 g l the maximum ma degradation of 33 34 was obtained for the us h2o2 combination at optimum h2o2 loading of 3 g l as compared to other combinations of us h2o2 at h2o2 loading of 1 g l 9 52 2 g l 14 28 and 4 g l 16 96 after 2 h of treatment time as shown in fig 3 c h2o2 loading of 4 g l was not effective in the us h2o2 scheme due to the scavenging effect of excess h2o2 during the treatment based on the results the h2o2 loading of 3 g l was considered as an optimal value in the us h2o2 scheme for the ma degradation experiment with only h2o2 was also performed to check the synergistic effect of us and h2o2 and it was observed that combined approach of us h2o2 was indeed efficient in giving higher degradation of ma though not synergistic as compared to the individual approach of us 22 1 and h2o2 19 16 at optimal h2o2 loading of 3 g l with studies performed at reaction temperature of 30 c and 2 h of treatment time during the treatment us helps to break the covalent oo single bond in h2o2 forming the reactive ho radical and subsequently transforming a complex pollutant into an easily biodegradable one eq 12 however excess h2o2 reacts with ho radicals giving ooh radicals eq 7 which have lower oxidative strength than the hydroxyl radical ho 23 this reaction as well as the recombination reaction eq 9 between the radicals slow down the degradation rate beyond the optimal h2o2 loading 44 47 6 h 2 o 2 2 ho 7 h 2 o 2 ho hoo h 2 o 8 h 2 o 2 hoo ho h 2 o o 2 9 2 ho h 2 o 2 10 2 hoo h 2 o 2 o 2 11 ho hoo h 2 o o 2 12 pollutant ho intermediates h 2 o co 2 rahdar et al 46 investigated the use of us h2o2 system for aniline degradation at various h2o2 loadings ranging from 0 01 to 0 07 mol l according to the study the maximum aniline removal of 95 91 was obtained with us h2o2 system under optimum h2o2 loading as 0 01 mol l and operating conditions as initial aniline concentration of 20 mg l ph of 3 and treatment time of 45 min overall based on literature comparison it is proposed that the optimum loading of h2o2 needs to be evaluated specific to the system to avoid additional cost and chemical use directing the importance of current work 3 5 fenton s reagent combination with us fenton oxidation is a highly exothermic oxidation process that is commonly employed to break down complex organic compounds present in wastewater in the fenton oxidation the fenton reagent primarily composed of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and ferrous ion fe2 is applied with h2o2 acting as an oxidizing agent and fe2 acting as a catalyst the detailed mechanism of the classic fenton oxidation can be represented by the following equations eqs 13 to 17 13 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 ho ho 14 fe 2 ho fe 3 ho 15 ho r h h 2 o r 16 r fe 3 r fe 2 17 fe 2 2 ho fe oh 2 in fenton oxidation h2o2 loading and fenton reagent ratio h2o2 fe2 control the amount of sludge generated due to ferrous ion and scavenging of hydroxyl radicals also deciding the degradation of efficiency increasing sludge leads to higher sludge separation costs while increasing h2o2 loading leads to additional chemical cost as well as reduced process efficiency hence both the parameters need to be considered while designing an optimal fenton based system and this requirement is also true for combined approach with us 3 5 1 effect of h2o2 loading sludge generation is also the main concern for employing fenton oxidation in wastewater treatment and the amount of sludge produced is dependent on the ph of the effluent during fenton oxidation as well as loading of oxidants applied an acidic condition favors lower sludge generation during the fenton process as compared to basic conditions and cavitation is also effective in an acidic medium 18 hence fenton based oxidation process was applied in acidic conditions to get higher degradation efficiency and lower sludge quantum effect of various h2o2 loadings in us fenton oxidation scheme was employed at different h2o2 loadings such as 0 5 g l 0 8 g l 1 g l and 1 2 g l while keeping a constant fenton ratio h2o2 fe2 of 4 1 under acidic conditions ph of 3 the temperature of 30 c and power of 100 w ma degradation of 79 28 83 58 65 04 and 43 54 were obtained at varied h2o2 loadings of 0 5 g l 0 8 g l 1 g l and 1 2 g l respectively after 60 min and no significant degradation was found on further treatment according to the obtained results as depicted in fig 3 a the ma degradation increased as the h2o2 loading increased from 0 5 g l to 1 g l however the degradation decreased as the h2o2 loading further increased to 1 2 g l h2o2 loading of 1 g l in us h2o2 scheme was considered as optimal for getting maximum ma degradation of 88 77 amongst all other h2o2 loadings applied in the work at acidic condition ph 3 and fenton ratio h2o2 fe2 of 4 1 h2o2 loading beyond 1 g l was not effective for further degradation due to hydroxyl radical scavenging the optimal load of h2o2 varies according to the targeted compound or type of real industrial effluent depicting the importance of the current study additionally excess h2o2 loading would inhibit the micro organisms present in the biological oxidation process if cavitation based oxidation is applied as the pretreatment clearly emphasizing the need for research into the effect of oxidant loading for each contaminant 48 similar existence of optimum loading although with different quantitative value is seen in the literature shokri 49 reported the use of the sono fenton process in the treatment of real industrial petrochemical wastewater with the cod value of 260 mg l and toc of 100 mg l according to the obtained results the maximum cod removal of 76 1 and toc reduction of 68 7 were obtained using the us fenton scheme at optimum fe2 loading of 24 mg l and h2o2 loading of 500 mg l 3 5 2 fenton reagent ratio h2o2 fe2 effect of oxidant ratio h2o2 fe2 in the us fenton oxidation scheme on ma degradation was studied using oxidant ratio h2o2 fe2 of 2 1 3 1 4 1 and 5 1 keeping constant h2o2 loading of 0 8 g l at ph of 3 temperature of 30 c and us power of 100 w from the obtained results shown in fig 3 b it was observed that the degradation of ma enhanced due to an increase in the h2o2 fe2 ratio from 2 1 to 5 1 the maximum ma degradation of 91 23 was obtained using us fenton at h2o2 fe2 ratio of 4 1 as compared to the ma degradation at h2o2 fe2 ratio of 2 1 70 96 3 1 88 57 and 5 1 89 64 at constant h2o2 loading of 0 8 g l within 1 h of treatment there was no significant change in degradation after the h2o2 fe2 of 4 1 due to the minimum amount of fe2 available in the system resulting in the lower catalytic activity of fe2 according to the literature 19 amount of sludge is higher if the fe2 loading is higher whereas if fe2 loading is lower the catalytic activity of the fe2 ion is lower resulting in lower degradation thus directing the requirement of optimum in the present work h2o2 fe2 ratio of 4 1 was found to be optimum giving maximum ma degradation of 91 23 using us fenton after 1 h of treatment the experiments with only us and only fenton at optimum conditions h2o2 fe2 4 1 h2o2 0 8 g l were also performed to check the synergistic effect of the combined approach from the obtained results shown in fig 3 b it was found that combined approach of us fenton 91 23 was more efficient as compared to individual approach of us 22 1 and fenton oxidation 81 27 a similar study was done by dükkancı et al 50 for the decolorization of amine containing azo dye orange ii ado using the us fenton uv system at different molar ratios fe2 h2o2 such as 1 10 1 30 1 50 and 1 60 according to obtained results the maximum decolorization of 80 8 was achieved using a combined approach of the us fenton uv system whereas individual approaches such as uv 6 5 us 28 9 and us uv 47 8 applied at optimal conditions of us frequency of 850 khz h2o2 of 5 mm molar fenton ratio of 1 50 reduced in lower decolonization after 120 min of treatment time comparison with literature elucidated that optimum oxidant ratio and loading are dependent on the specific system elucidating the importance of current work on ma degradation 3 6 ozone o3 combination with us combined approach of us o3 to degrade the ma in an aqueous medium was studied at the different o3 flow rates of 0 2 lph 0 33 lph 0 5 lph 1 lph 2 lph and 3 lph at alkaline conditions ph of 10 temperature of 30 c us power of 100 w and 2 h of treatment time according to obtained results shown in fig 3 d the degradation of ma decreased from 89 96 to 70 16 in treatment time of 1 h inset shows expanded region for degradation above 80 for clarity as the flow rate of o3 increased from 0 2 to 2 lph after the treatment time of 2 h removal extents of ma were 90 81 o3 0 2lph 89 39 o3 0 33lph 86 32 o3 0 5lph 88 31 o3 1lph 84 36 o3 2lph and 69 39 o3 3lph the combined o3 and ultrasound system was much more effective in the degradation of ma than only ultrasound or only o3 system which may be attributed to the direct reaction of ozone and ma at the higher temperatures available at cavitation bubble interfaces the obtained results clearly showed that a minimum o3 loading of 0 2lph in the us o3 system was sufficient and optimum for maximal ma removal which is particularly noteworthy in terms of operating cost excess o3 loading results in the production of large bubbles owing to the coalescence effect leading to a decrease in the interfacial area for the gas liquid mass transfer resulting in minimal ho radical generation and also direct reaction of ozone 51 52 generally the degassing effect of us would reduce the solubility of o3 gas in aqueous solutions which would affect the degradation of pollutants negatively however in the us o3 system us can also improve o3 decomposition and the mass transfer rate which is beneficial for the generation of reactive ho radicals which results in improved process efficiency 53 based on the counteracting effects the ozone loading is an important parameter and so is the utilization by pollutants making specific studies for ma important it can be said that increasing the ozone flow rate decreases the ma degradation because of the scavenging effect with ho radicals that forms the carbonate and also due to lower efficacy for cavitation 55 56 song et al 52 explored the use of the combined approach of us o3 in the degradation of aniline at different o3 flow rates such as 1 mg min 2 mg min 4 mg min 8 mg min and 12 mg min according to the obtained results almost 82 of removal efficiency was observed using us o3 scheme which was higher as compared to us 6 and o3 44 at optimum conditions i e o3 flow rate of 2 mg min aniline 0 100 mg l us energy density of 0 1 w ml ph of 7 and the temperature of 25 c within 30 min of treatment overall the us o3 system is capable of achieving desired results in terms of improved efficiency when used under optimum conditions specific to the system pointing towards the importance of the current work 3 7 kps combination with us effect of kps in combination us on ma degradation scheme was studied at alkaline ph 10 condition the temperature of 30 c us power of 100 w and 2 h of the treatment time different kps loadings used for the optimization study were 0 3 g l 0 5 g l 0 8 g l and 1 2 g l according to the obtained results depicted in fig 3 e it was noted that higher ma degradation of 97 3 was achieved using us kps at optimum kps loading of 0 5 g l as compared to ma degradation obtained at 0 3 g l 92 8 0 8 g l 90 3 and 1 g l 89 2 it was observed that the removal efficiency of ma increased from 92 8 to 97 3 with an increase in kps loading from 0 3 g l to 0 5 g l beyond which the removal efficiency of ma reduced to 88 94 at kps loading of 1 g l no significant enhancement in reduction was obtained beyond the optimum kps loading of 0 5 g l due to the scavenging of so4 radicals by excess s2o8 2 the presence of so4 in the system supplies extra oxidizing radicals but the formation of ho radicals is almost steady when ps is overloaded as a result after the optimum loading of ps ho and so4 radicals are scavenged due to the possible recombination and reaction with excess ps as illustrated in eqs 18 and 20 56 57 18 s o 4 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 19 s 2 o 8 2 ho ho s 2 o 8 20 s 2 o 8 2 s 2 o 4 s 2 o 4 2 s 2 o 8 thus excess ps loading can lead to a reduced pollutant degradation that adversely affects the efficiency of the process 58 in order to avoid inhibition effects the optimum loading of ps 0 5 g l was used in further work it is worthwhile to compare the trend with literature so as to highlight the importance of the work based on a different optimum oxidant loading specific to the effluent monteagudo et al 59 elucidated a similar trend when they used the us in combination with the persulfate to degrade diclofenac dcf in aqueous solution at operating conditions of ph 3 us duty cycle of 100 us power of 380 w temperature of 30 c us amplitude of 100 ps dosing ranging from 90 mg l to 150 mg l and an initial dcf concentration of 5 mg l due to an increase in ps loading to 120 mg l different optimum as compared to current work dcf removal effectiveness increased to 97 following which it decreased to 82 after 120 min of treatment it was also found that us ps scheme was found to be effective yielding higher dcf removal efficiency of 97 as compared to individual approaches of us 58 and ps 2 after 240 min similar to that seen in the current work 3 8 combined approach of multiple oxidation schemes 3 8 1 us fenton o3 a combined approach of us fenton o3 scheme was also explored to check the effectiveness of combined approaches involving multiple oxidants at optimized conditions the experiment was performed using us fenton o3 approach at optimized conditions as h2o2 fe2 ratio of 4 1 h2o2 loading of 0 8 g l o3 flow rate of 0 2 lph and 2 h of treatment time it was found that almost 95 5 of ma degradation was obtained using a combined approach of us fenton o3 which was higher as compared to the approach of only us 22 1 only fenton 81 28 only o3 89 66 us fenton 91 23 us o3 90 81 and fenton o3 94 78 at ph of 3 temperature of 30 c and 2 h of treatment according to the results shown in fig 4 a it is also seen that the marginal change in the ma removal is observed between us fenton o3 and fenton o3 which concluded that the us doesn t contribute to the binary system of fenton o3 to get the synergistic results hence it was elucidated that fenton o3 is an efficient process amongst various approaches involving us fenton and o3 in terms of ma removal efficiency under optimum conditions a study by gujar and gogate 19 investigated the remediation of amine containing real industrial dye effluent using us fenton o3 followed by a lime cao treatment it was found that us fenton o3 followed by cao treatment was effective for getting almost 95 of cod reduction within 30 min of treatment time under the conditions of h2o2 17 5 g l h2o2 fe2 3 cao 1 g l o3 flow rate 1 g h implying that the addition of o3 accelerated the treatment the comparison clearly illustrated that the benefits of combining different oxidants are dependent on the pollutant in question 3 8 2 us fenton kps the effect of us fenton oxidation and kps on the degradation of ma was investigated at optimum conditions of h2o2 fe2 4 1 h2o2 0 8 g l kps 0 5 g l ph of 3 the temperature of 30 c and us power of 100 w it was observed that maximum ma removal of 98 14 was obtained using the us fenton kps scheme which was higher as compared to only us 22 1 only fenton 80 1 only kps 92 74 fenton kps 89 94 us fenton 89 5 and us kps 94 72 within 1 h of treatment according to the obtained results shown in fig 4 b it can be seen that the us improved the fenton kps system in terms of achieving maximum ma reduction under similar conditions interestingly the us fenton kps scheme was effective for achieving maximum cod reduction within 1 h of treatment but the us kps scheme achieved nearly the same outcome after 2 h of treatment fenton oxidation enhances the us fenton kps process by halving the treatment time but it also adds an extra load in the form of sludge which can increases disposal expenses the introduction of multiple systems to the individual system for the degradation of any specific compound up to the desired level needs to be evaluated in terms of additional cost to the operation due to the chemical consumption and byproduct disposal as well as benefits in terms of lower treatment time before selecting any approach hence considering the economy of the process the us kps scheme cost 0 01 l was considered efficient with 2 h of treatment giving almost 97 3 of ma reduction agarkoti et al 60 studied the treatment of cetp effluent using us fenton ps scheme at various fe2 h2o2 s2o8 2 ratios of 1 40 5 83 1 40 11 67 1 40 17 5 and 1 40 23 33 while keeping constant other parameters such as us power of 150 w and us frequency of 22 khz it was reported that almost 78 8 of cod reduction was obtained using us fenton ps at an optimal fe2 h2o2 s2o8 2 ratio of 1 40 17 5 and under the same conditions cod reductions of 88 3 and 13 16 were obtained using us fenton oxidation and only us respectively overall it appears that using combined oxidation schemes is efficient in terms of cod reduction but an optimal combination of oxidation schemes must be determined considering the treatment cost and obtained efficacy 3 8 3 us kps o3 various approaches involving us kps and o3 were also applied for the treatment of ma under optimum conditions as kps loading of 0 5 g l o3 flow rate of 0 2lph ph of 10 temperature of 30 c and us power of 100 w under optimized conditions it was observed that the maximum ma removal of 94 1 was achieved using the us kps o3 system within 2 h of treatment time as shown in fig 4 c the experiments were also performed using different approaches as us kps o3 us kps us o3 kps o3 at optimum conditions and ma removal for each system was 22 1 90 92 89 66 97 3 90 81 and 92 69 respectively the cost of the combined schemes as us kps o3 us kps and us o3 were 0 19 l 0 01 l and 0 02 l respectively according to the findings the introduction of three distinct systems us kps and o3 into the combined system of us kps o3 has no significant effect on ma removal efficiency as compared to us kps or us o3 us kps was shown to be the most effective of all these systems in terms of ma removal efficiency and operational cost ghanbari et al 61 studied the use of tertiary system of us peroxymonosulfate pms o3 for the degradation of benzotriazole under optimal conditions viz neutral ph o3 6 8 mg l pms 1 5 mm us power of 200 w and bta 0 40 mg l under the optimum conditions it was observed that almost complete degradation was observed using the us pms o3 system within 60 min of treatment time also resulting in almost 85 of cod reduction 75 of toc reduction and 73 3 of organic nitrogen removal it was also reported that the same system of us pms o3 was also employed to the real samples of petrochemical effluent saline water and secondary effluent matrices which resulted in 72 3 54 and 94 6 of bta degradation respectively under similar conditions the work also elucidated the critical role of ultrasound in deciding the intensification comparison with literature allowed establishing the specificity of the benefits for combined process to the type of effluent overall it is critical to identify the best combination of individual systems that can give a sufficient breakdown of a specific complex compound at optimized cost which can assist the design of any commercial treatment system 3 8 4 us fenton kps o3 combination of us fenton oxidation kps and o3 was also applied to remove ma effectively at optimum conditions as h2o2 loading of 0 8 g l h2o2 fe2 ratio of 4 1 kps loading of 0 5 g l o3 flow rate of 0 2 lph ph of 3 the temperature of 30 c and us power of 100 w under the optimum conditions almost similar results were obtained using the us fenton kps o3 97 91 and fenton kps o3 96 49 within 2 h of treatment time as shown in fig 4 d hence it was established that us was ineffective in producing further benefits in terms of ma degradation in the hybrid system and that us also added additional energy cost for a similar final result elucidating fenton kps o3 as an efficient approach kodavatiganti et al 62 studied the degradation of acid violent 7 dye av7 using different approaches of us feso4 kps feso4 kps fenton and us fenton at optimum condition viz av7 20 mg l h2o2 50 mg l kps 20 mg l feso4 25 mg l ph of 4 temperature of 20 c and time of 60 min it was reported that only fenton oxidation was efficient for achieving maximum cod reduction of 80 9 similar to to us fenton 81 whereas kps feso4 60 2 and us kps feso4 69 9 resulted in lower efficacy hence the inclusion of multiple oxidation systems may not always be effective considering the removal efficiency operation cost and chemical consumption overall selecting the treatment approach based on the smallest number of individual schemes is critical to save chemical consumption and energy costs while achieving the target outcome 3 9 large scale study an optimized lab scale treatment scheme us kps was applied on the pilot level using a longitudinal horn based sonoreactor with the capacity of 4 l the operating condition for the large scale operation was maintained at kps loading of 0 5 g l us frequency of 25 khz us power of 700 w and the duty cycle of 100 according to the obtained results as shown in fig 5 it was observed that almost 94 of ma removal was achieved using longitudinal horn sonoreactor coupled with kps under optimum conditions within 2 h of treatment hence it is confirmed that the lab scale optimized conditions of us kps 97 3 were successfully applied on the pilot level using a longitudinal horn sonoreactor it was also observed that cavitational yield for longitudinal horn 1 23 10 3 mg j was almost 4 times higher than that for the us horn 0 33 10 3mg j under a similar operating conditions of kps 0 5 g l ph of 10 ma 0 1152 mg l and temperature of 30 c patil et al 63 also reported the comparison study between longitudinal horn lh sonoreactor with us frequency of 25 khz and us power 1 kw and conventional us horn with us frequency of 20 khz and us power 240 w for the degradation of imidacloprid idp in an aqueous medium it was illustrated that an optimized lab scale system was successfully applied on large scale using longitudinal horn sonoreactor resulting in idp degradation of 98 5 and 83 2 using us uv h2o2 approaches and lh sonorector uv h2o2 respectively it was also reported that the cavitational yield for longitudinal horn sonoreactor 5 08 10 6 mg j was almost three times higher than that for the us horn 1 86 10 6 mg j under optimum conditions viz h2o2 35 mg l idp 0 20 mg l uv power of 4 w and ph of 5 similar to that seen in the current work 3 10 comparison of all treatment schemes for the ma degradation a comparison of all the approaches applied for the degradation of ma using the simple us as well as longitudinal horn based sonoreactor has been performed based on ma degradation fig 6 cost of the process cavitational yield and the treatment time fig 6 with the data presented in table s 1 supplementary information the energy cost was calculated based on a standard power meter to evaluate the power of the instruments used in the treatment and the chemical cost was calculated based on the commercial price of the chemical used in the treatment us and hydrogen peroxide generally increase the energy cost and chemical costs respectively posing a problem when designing a degradation scheme at the commercial level the us on the other hand offers its own set of advantages in terms of reducing excessive chemical consumption and treatment time requirements fenton oxidation produces sludge as a byproduct which adds to the sludge handling problem when it comes to costing and handling the persulfate and o3 oxidation processes are much more viable all schemes have their own limitations and advantages prompting a detailed comparison of the effectiveness in terms of ma degradation cavitational yield and treatment cost as depicted in table s 1 the spectra analysis of the untreated and treated sample using the us kps 0 5 g l approach was also performed using hplc it was seen that no additional peak for any of the intermediates was found in treated sample as shown in fig s2 indicating that us kps scheme was effective for the complete ma removal and mineralization with no residual intermediates the untreated sample mainly comprised of primary amine methylamine compound containing methyl group attached to the single amine compound from the obtained results fig s 1 and s 2 and eq 12 it can be said that complex compound present in the untreated solution dissociated and completely mineralized under the influence of us kps scheme at optimum conditions from the obtained results it was concluded that the us kps system was more efficient in terms of giving maximum ma degradation 97 3 and lower cost of the process 0 11 l than all other processes it was also noted that us fenton kps and us fenton kps o3 systems were most effective in terms of giving a maximum cavitational yield of 0 34 10 3mg j each amongst all other individual or combined processes at lab scale however both these processes offer disadvantage of sludge generation due to fenton the longitudinal horn sonoreactor kps scheme was found to be effective in terms of process cost 0 03 l ma removal efficiency 94 and cavitational yield 1 23 10 3mg j only us approach was one of the most expensive 0 46 l and had the lowest cavitational yield 0 08 10 3mg j for the ma degradation amongst all other schemes the optimized lab scale design of the ma degradation scheme was demonstrated to be successfully scaled up on a pilot level using a longitudinal horn based sonoreactor 4 conclusions a cavitation based novel study also involving different chemical oxidants to remove methylamine ma from an aqueous solution was evaluated in terms of important aspects such as the removal efficiency of the process process optimization operating cost and cavitational yield based on a detailed study into effect of operating parameters and various combinations the optimum conditions were established as us power of 100 w us frequency of 20 khz us duty cycle of 70 the temperature of 30 c h2o2 loading of 0 8 g l h2o2 fe2 ratio of 4 1 and kps loading of 0 5 g l o3 loading of 0 2 lph and treatment time of 120 min the us fenton kps o3 and us kps systems were shown to have a maximum ma removal of 97 91 and 97 33 respectively within 2 h of treatment under optimal conditions us kps system was found to be the most economical scheme considering the cost of the treatment 0 11 l with higher cost being seen for the us fenton kps o3 scheme 0 18 l longitudinal horn with kps system kps 0 5 g l was successfully demonstrated at pilot scale resulting in almost 94 of ma removal after 120 min of treatment it was also found that the cavitational yield for the longitudinal horn 1 23 10 3 mg j was almost 4 times higher than us horn 1 23 10 3 mg j under similar operating conditions from the intermediate analysis of treated ma solution it was established that us kps scheme was effective in terms of complete transformation of complex compound without formation of any residual intermediates overall it can be concluded that sonochemistry in combination with kps can be the best alternative option to remediate the primary amine based pollutant and it is not a good idea to add too many oxidants to the treatment schemes declaration of competing interest the authors wish to confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this publication and there has

12691,methylamine ma degradation has been studied using different processes based on cavitation and oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide h2o2 fenton s reagent h2o2 fe2 ozone o3 and potassium persulfate kps k2s2o8 effects of different operating parameters such as treatment temperature us power ph of the solution and oxidant loading on the extent of degradation have been studied acoustic power of 100 w with a frequency of 22 khz and duty cycle of 70 7 s on 3 s off were elucidated as the best treatment conditions for only ultrasound induced degradation us amongst all the combined approaches us kps scheme was the most efficient and economical treatment scheme for the highest removal of ma 97 3 within 2 h of treatment the optimized us kps scheme at conditions of ph of 10 kps loading of 0 5 g l and temperature of 30 c was exploited for ma degradation at a pilot level using a longitudinal horn based sonoreactor at a capacity of 4 l which resulted in 94 of ma removal cavitational yield for longitudinal horn 1 23 10 3 mg j was almost 4 times higher than that seen in a simple us horn 0 33 10 3 mg j under similar conditions additionally it was shown that a combined strategy based on cavitation and oxidants is preferred compared to an individual approach involving ultrasound or oxidants overall the longitudinal horn reactor in combination with kps was shown to be the most energy efficient and economical treatment method giving 94 of degradation at an operating cost of 0 03 l graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords methylamine degradation ultrasound longitudinal horn intensification advanced oxidation processes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction methylamine ma a primary amine is typically found in effluent from the pharmaceutical insecticide paint surfactant and amine processing industries it is also found in human urine decaying seafood and fermented broths used in ethanol production 1 2 ma is highly toxic to aquatic life as well as the environment many investigations have proved the toxicity of several primary amines emphasizing the importance of remediation 3 4 therefore to maintain the water quality and protect the environment an effective and industrially practicable treatment method is required conventional remediation techniques for the primary amines include thermal degradation 5 biological treatment 6 activated carbon based adsorption 7 and membrane separation 8 long degradation times sludge production high energy consumption fouling and significant maintenance are some of the drawbacks of traditional processes that need to be addressed with the development of modern technologies 9 10 advanced oxidation processes aops are one of the alternative oxidation methods that can remove organic compounds from effluent and allow discharge of treated water that adheres to standard discharge norms 11 the attack of highly reactive radicals is the main degradation mechanism for the aops involving hydrogen peroxide h2o2 12 o3 oxidation 13 fenton oxidation h2o2 fe2 14 electrochemical oxidation 15 photolysis 16 photocatalysis 17 us 18 19 hydrodynamic cavitation 20 22 etc that can be applied for regulating critical water parameters such as cod toc or control the presence of organic compounds in the water bodies the development of hybrid oxidation processes based on such aops by combining one or two oxidation processes can result in minimal chemical consumption and process cost and play a crucial role in finalizing the most appropriate treatment method for commercial application the remediation of nitrogen or amine based pollutants using aops as an alternate option was indeed discussed in recent research 23 another study aimed at developing quantitative assessments for such pollutants which is essential for effectively regulating their standard permissible limits in the final treated water 24 some studies looked at the mechanism and pathway of organic compound degradation including the identification of reactive species in the oxidation process such as singlet oxygen 1o2 hydroxyl radicals ho and super oxygen radicals o2 which would be essential for the development and optimization of treatment conditions number of processing steps as well as assessing the longevity of process equipment for industrial applications 25 27 studies have also been published on the application of aops for the treatment of primary amine based synthetic or industrial effluents and the results from these studies have been quite beneficial karthikeyan et al 14 studied the use of the fenton oxidation for the removal of aniline present in an aqueous solution and reported almost 96 of aniline removal using heterogeneous fenton oxidation under optimum conditions as molar ratio of h2o2 fe2 equal to 1 2 solution ph of 3 5 and aniline concentration of 1000 mg l bhat and gogate 23 critically reviewed the degradation of several industrially important nitrogeneuous compounds including primary amine using advanced oxidation processes and reported that hybrid methods are generally beneficial as compared to the individual processes though the specific intensification is dependent on the type of amine and applied process fernandes et al 28 revealed that tio2 uv o3 and tio2 uv o3 h2o2 are efficient systems to degrade the several types of vocs in a relatively minimum treatment time and chemical loading with maximum efficacy as 92 of t vocs degradation and 46 of cod reduction some recent investigations also focused on the use of advanced techniques based on the use of fumaric acid based metal organic frameworks 29 hydroxyapatite layered lanthanum organic frameworks 30 and hydroxyapatite embedded cerium organic frameworks 31 for removal of fluoride ions as well as using nano mixed metal mn al fe oxide based adsorptive technique for removal of chromate and phosphate ions 32 considering that there is not much work based on cavitation for treatment of primary amines the current work has targeted the use of cavitation for treatemnt of methylamine containing wastewater cavitation is an oxidation method governed by the generation growth and collapse of gas vapour filled bubbles the implosion of these bubbles causes intense localized temperature 500 to 15 000 k and pressure 100 5000 atm inside the liquid medium for microseconds the continuous implosion of numerous bubbles generates extremely reactive hydroxyl radicals ho due to the decomposition of water molecules which can be effectively employed in water treatment to degrade complex compounds 19 cavitation is usually initiated by passing a liquid through a confinement zone hydrodynamic cavitation or by passing ultrasonic waves in the liquid acoustic cavitation in addition to its cost effectiveness and energy efficiency cavitation is a technology that can provide sustainable and pollution free and greener solutions for treating industrial wastewater 23 33 the enormous energy released during cavitation can be transferred locally to organic molecules causing them to raise their intrinsic energy and break down into small molecules using pyrolytic mechanism or reaction with hydroxyl radicals there is not much literature on the use of advanced oxidation processes to degrade primary amines except for some studies based on photocatalytic oxidation yielding complete degradation of ma and 94 degradation of dma after 15 h and 18 h respectively 34 and 75 degradation of ethanolamine using uv chlorine treatment 16 etc the current study provides important information about the potential use of cavitation to remove ma from aqueous solutions as it plans to develop a low cost and eco friendly degradation system based on cavitation that can be demonstrated on a large scale to the best of our understanding first attempt has been made for application of hybrid cavitation based treatment for removal of ma with detailed understanding into effect of operating parameters and different combinations followed by successful pilot scale demonstration which clearly highlights the novelty of the work asides the potential role in commercial applications the model primary amine based study can help design engineers in choosing an appropriate range of operating parameters and oxidation processes for the treatment of various amine containing wastewaters 2 materials and methodology 2 1 materials commercially available ma aqueous 40 w v was procured from loba chem pvt ltd hydrogen peroxide 30 w v ar h2so4 98 ar ferrous sulfate ar and potassium persulfate kps ar were procured from thomas baker chemicals mumbai methanol 99 99 hplc grade and ammonium acetate hplc grade were procured from thermo fisher pvt ltd mumbai and oxford chemical pvt ltd mumbai respectively mili q di water having a conductivity of 0 05 μs was obtained from the di plant at the institute of chemical technology mumbai hplc instrument used for the sample analysis was procured from thermo fisher pvt ltd mumbai 2 2 methodology a dual step ultrasonic horn was used for ma degradation and was procured from dakshin india ltd mumbai the degradation of ma was studied at different ultrasonic power ranging from 60 w to 120 w keeping all other ultrasonic parameters such as ultrasonic us frequency of 22 khz and duty cycle of 70 constant the titanium based tip of the us horn was connected to a pzt transducer having a tip diameter of 12 mm the three neck flat bottom cylindrical glass reactor was used for the ma degradation studies with a working volume of 150 ml the water bath was used to maintain the temperature of reaction mass at 30 c the experimental setup was modified as a closed system and the schematic representation is shown in fig 1 a the initial concentration of ma solution was taken as 1000 mg l the optimization study was conducted for the degradation of ma using various values of the experimental parameters such as ph of the solution 3 6 8 10 temperature 20 30 40 45 c and us power 60 80 100 120 w in the individual us approach whereas for the combination approaches use of different chemical oxidants such as h2o2 1 2 3 4 g l feso4 0 5 0 8 1 1 2 g l with varying oxidants ratio h2o2 fe2 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 at acidic condition o3 0 2 0 33 0 5 1 lph at alkaline condition and kps 0 3 0 5 0 8 1 g l at alkaline conditions was applied use of multiple oxidants with ultrasound in combination as us o3 fenton kps us o3 fenton us fenton kps and us o3 kps as well as individual approaches of only us only o3 only fenton oxidation and only kps were also performed at the optimal value of each parameter to check the synergistic effect of combinations on the ma degradation the optimized treatment scheme of the lab scale batch was also applied at a large scale using a longitudinal horn based ultrasonic reactor having a capacity of 4 l at a us frequency of 25 khz us power of 700 w and a duty cycle of 100 the temperature of the sonoreactor was kept constant at 30 c by circulating effluent sample through a peristaltic pump into a separate glass reactor that was jacketed with cooling water and equipped with a thermometer the schematic diagram of a longitudinal horn is depicted in fig 1 b and c for the analysis the samples were collected periodically at 30 min and then withdrawn samples were filtered and analyzed using a uhplc instrument equipped with refractive index ri detector and c18 column c18 column was operated with 95 5 aqueous ammonium acetate 5 mm methanol as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml min column temperature of 30 c and detector temperature of 30 c 35 37 the finalization of the analysis conditions including the mobile phase was based on the initial optimization study trying out different concentration ratios of aqueous ammonium acetate and methanol as well as the flow rates of mobile phase the extent of ma degradation was calculated using the eq 1 1 ma degradation initial concentration ma o final conccentration ma initial concentration ma o 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of temperature effect of temperature on ma degradation was studied using different temperatures such as 20 c 30 c 40 c and 45 c operated at constant alkaline conditions ph 10 for 2 h of treatment time fig 2 a shows the degradation pattern of ma vs time at different temperatures it was observed that a rise in temperature from 20 c to 45 c increased the degradation of ma and a subsequent increase in the temperature resulted in marginal change maximum ma degradation of 22 was obtained at 30 c as compared to ma degradation at 20 c 5 40 20 and 45 20 after 2 h of treatment due to the insufficient amount of heat energy required to break the bond between ch3 nh2 and the lower kinetic rates negligible ma degradation was obtained at 20 c within 2 h of treatment it was also noticed that no significant change was obtained after 30 c for ma degradation within 2 h of treatment attributed to the fact that cavitation effects are less prevalent at higher temperatures beyond the optimal value meaning that there is less energy available due to the cushioning effect during collapse resulting in a slower degradation rate of the ma hence the optimal temperature must be chosen to achieve the thermal effect and sonochemistry synergism and minimize the operational cost 38 the degradation mechanism of ma using ho radicals produced in the cavitation and generation of its degradation products such as methyl amino radical hydrogen cyanide radical and ammonia is shown in eqs 2 to 5 35 2 ch 3 nh 2 ho ch 3 n h h 2 o 3 ch 3 n h ho ch 2 n h h 2 o 4 ch 2 n h ho hcn h h 2 o 5 hcn h ho co nh 3 in another study the effect of temperature on the degradation of monoethanolamine was reported when the temperature was changed from 40 c to 55 c and it was found that the oxidation was enhanced by 30 for the desired increase in temperature 39 in another study zhang et al 40 elucidated that aniline degradation using the o3 zero valent zinc zn0 system was highest at a temperature of 24 c amongst the studied temperatures ranging from 15 c to 45 c temperatures above 24 c seemed to have a negative impact on o3 solubility and stability yielding lower degradation overall it can be said that it is necessary to apply an optimum temperature specific to the system and avoid the use of excessive heat energy for the degradation in order to reduce the cost of the operation 3 2 effect of ph effect of ph on the degradation of ma was studied at various ph values such as 3 6 8 and 10 the temperature of the experiments for the ph study was kept constant at 30 c it was observed from the obtained results as shown in fig 2 b that the degradation of ma increased with an increase in ph values from 3 to 10 maximum degradation of ma of 16 66 was obtained at a ph value of 10 amongst all other ph values of 3 7 86 6 8 38 and 8 11 08 within 120 min of treatment it was also seen that not much change was seen between the treatments times of 90 and 120 min of operation based on the results ph value of 10 was considered as optimum value and used for further experiments the favored trend of higher degradation under basic condition may be observed due to the reaction that occurs between ho and ch3nh2 which is favored at the increased ph value of the solution the unstable intermediate product of ch3nh formed in eq 2 combines with ho radicals and undergoes degradation as per a series of reactions as shown in eqs 3 to 4 strong base ammonia formed as per eq 5 is also responsible for maintaining the ph of the solution at the basic condition jiang et al 41 reported similar results for aniline degradation with higher degradation under alkaline conditions with us frequency of 610 khz us power of 25 w and a temperature of 15 c the interaction between ho radicals and the aniline is stronger in alkaline than in acidic conditions with a rate constant obtained at ph of 8 11 being approximately three times that obtained at ph 4 overall it can be said that alkaline ph is more suited for the ma degradation using ultrasonic irradiation alone 3 3 effect of us power the effect of us power on the ma degradation was also studied using different us power of 60 w 80 w 100 w and 120 w for 2 h of treatment at a solution ph of 10 and temperature of 30 c the degradation of ma was shown to rise as us power increased from 60 w to 100 w with no further increase in degradation occurring at us power of 120 w as shown in fig 2 c the maximum degradation of 18 75 was obtained at us power of 100 w as compared to the other us power values such as 60 w 10 54 80 w 15 72 and 120 w 11 53 after 90 min of treatment time there was no significant difference beyond the treatment time of 90 min us is known for generating more cavitation events up to the optimal us power limit beyond which the degradation remains stable or declines due to a reduction in cavitation collapse intensity caused by coalescence and degassing 42 liang et al 43 reported a similar trend for the degradation of aromatic amines using us kmno4 system at different power densities ranging from 0 36 to 3 24 w cm3 amongst all the power densities 1 80 w cm3 was found to be optimal for achieving maximum degradation of monocyclic anilines and other aromatic amines as 82 8 and 53 1 average respectively at kmno4 loading of 12 mm and ph of 5 us power applied over the optimal limit is also detrimental to operational costs and hence selecting optimum power is important directing the importance of current study for ma based on the obtained results in the study with individual us treatment power of 100 w ph of 10 and temperature of 30 c were selected as the optimum combining us and other oxidation methods could be an effective way to achieve synergetic benefits while minimizing the cost and energy consumption of the process and hence using established optimum conditions for individual us operation different combinations of us with oxidants were investigated 3 4 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 combination with us effect of h2o2 combined with us on ma degradation was studied at different h2o2 loadings of 1 g l 2 g l 3 g l and 4 g l at solution ph of 10 the temperature of 30 c power of 100 w and 2 h of treatment time it was observed that the degradation of ma increased gradually from 9 52 to 33 34 as h2o2 loading increased from 1 g l to 3 g l the maximum ma degradation of 33 34 was obtained for the us h2o2 combination at optimum h2o2 loading of 3 g l as compared to other combinations of us h2o2 at h2o2 loading of 1 g l 9 52 2 g l 14 28 and 4 g l 16 96 after 2 h of treatment time as shown in fig 3 c h2o2 loading of 4 g l was not effective in the us h2o2 scheme due to the scavenging effect of excess h2o2 during the treatment based on the results the h2o2 loading of 3 g l was considered as an optimal value in the us h2o2 scheme for the ma degradation experiment with only h2o2 was also performed to check the synergistic effect of us and h2o2 and it was observed that combined approach of us h2o2 was indeed efficient in giving higher degradation of ma though not synergistic as compared to the individual approach of us 22 1 and h2o2 19 16 at optimal h2o2 loading of 3 g l with studies performed at reaction temperature of 30 c and 2 h of treatment time during the treatment us helps to break the covalent oo single bond in h2o2 forming the reactive ho radical and subsequently transforming a complex pollutant into an easily biodegradable one eq 12 however excess h2o2 reacts with ho radicals giving ooh radicals eq 7 which have lower oxidative strength than the hydroxyl radical ho 23 this reaction as well as the recombination reaction eq 9 between the radicals slow down the degradation rate beyond the optimal h2o2 loading 44 47 6 h 2 o 2 2 ho 7 h 2 o 2 ho hoo h 2 o 8 h 2 o 2 hoo ho h 2 o o 2 9 2 ho h 2 o 2 10 2 hoo h 2 o 2 o 2 11 ho hoo h 2 o o 2 12 pollutant ho intermediates h 2 o co 2 rahdar et al 46 investigated the use of us h2o2 system for aniline degradation at various h2o2 loadings ranging from 0 01 to 0 07 mol l according to the study the maximum aniline removal of 95 91 was obtained with us h2o2 system under optimum h2o2 loading as 0 01 mol l and operating conditions as initial aniline concentration of 20 mg l ph of 3 and treatment time of 45 min overall based on literature comparison it is proposed that the optimum loading of h2o2 needs to be evaluated specific to the system to avoid additional cost and chemical use directing the importance of current work 3 5 fenton s reagent combination with us fenton oxidation is a highly exothermic oxidation process that is commonly employed to break down complex organic compounds present in wastewater in the fenton oxidation the fenton reagent primarily composed of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and ferrous ion fe2 is applied with h2o2 acting as an oxidizing agent and fe2 acting as a catalyst the detailed mechanism of the classic fenton oxidation can be represented by the following equations eqs 13 to 17 13 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 ho ho 14 fe 2 ho fe 3 ho 15 ho r h h 2 o r 16 r fe 3 r fe 2 17 fe 2 2 ho fe oh 2 in fenton oxidation h2o2 loading and fenton reagent ratio h2o2 fe2 control the amount of sludge generated due to ferrous ion and scavenging of hydroxyl radicals also deciding the degradation of efficiency increasing sludge leads to higher sludge separation costs while increasing h2o2 loading leads to additional chemical cost as well as reduced process efficiency hence both the parameters need to be considered while designing an optimal fenton based system and this requirement is also true for combined approach with us 3 5 1 effect of h2o2 loading sludge generation is also the main concern for employing fenton oxidation in wastewater treatment and the amount of sludge produced is dependent on the ph of the effluent during fenton oxidation as well as loading of oxidants applied an acidic condition favors lower sludge generation during the fenton process as compared to basic conditions and cavitation is also effective in an acidic medium 18 hence fenton based oxidation process was applied in acidic conditions to get higher degradation efficiency and lower sludge quantum effect of various h2o2 loadings in us fenton oxidation scheme was employed at different h2o2 loadings such as 0 5 g l 0 8 g l 1 g l and 1 2 g l while keeping a constant fenton ratio h2o2 fe2 of 4 1 under acidic conditions ph of 3 the temperature of 30 c and power of 100 w ma degradation of 79 28 83 58 65 04 and 43 54 were obtained at varied h2o2 loadings of 0 5 g l 0 8 g l 1 g l and 1 2 g l respectively after 60 min and no significant degradation was found on further treatment according to the obtained results as depicted in fig 3 a the ma degradation increased as the h2o2 loading increased from 0 5 g l to 1 g l however the degradation decreased as the h2o2 loading further increased to 1 2 g l h2o2 loading of 1 g l in us h2o2 scheme was considered as optimal for getting maximum ma degradation of 88 77 amongst all other h2o2 loadings applied in the work at acidic condition ph 3 and fenton ratio h2o2 fe2 of 4 1 h2o2 loading beyond 1 g l was not effective for further degradation due to hydroxyl radical scavenging the optimal load of h2o2 varies according to the targeted compound or type of real industrial effluent depicting the importance of the current study additionally excess h2o2 loading would inhibit the micro organisms present in the biological oxidation process if cavitation based oxidation is applied as the pretreatment clearly emphasizing the need for research into the effect of oxidant loading for each contaminant 48 similar existence of optimum loading although with different quantitative value is seen in the literature shokri 49 reported the use of the sono fenton process in the treatment of real industrial petrochemical wastewater with the cod value of 260 mg l and toc of 100 mg l according to the obtained results the maximum cod removal of 76 1 and toc reduction of 68 7 were obtained using the us fenton scheme at optimum fe2 loading of 24 mg l and h2o2 loading of 500 mg l 3 5 2 fenton reagent ratio h2o2 fe2 effect of oxidant ratio h2o2 fe2 in the us fenton oxidation scheme on ma degradation was studied using oxidant ratio h2o2 fe2 of 2 1 3 1 4 1 and 5 1 keeping constant h2o2 loading of 0 8 g l at ph of 3 temperature of 30 c and us power of 100 w from the obtained results shown in fig 3 b it was observed that the degradation of ma enhanced due to an increase in the h2o2 fe2 ratio from 2 1 to 5 1 the maximum ma degradation of 91 23 was obtained using us fenton at h2o2 fe2 ratio of 4 1 as compared to the ma degradation at h2o2 fe2 ratio of 2 1 70 96 3 1 88 57 and 5 1 89 64 at constant h2o2 loading of 0 8 g l within 1 h of treatment there was no significant change in degradation after the h2o2 fe2 of 4 1 due to the minimum amount of fe2 available in the system resulting in the lower catalytic activity of fe2 according to the literature 19 amount of sludge is higher if the fe2 loading is higher whereas if fe2 loading is lower the catalytic activity of the fe2 ion is lower resulting in lower degradation thus directing the requirement of optimum in the present work h2o2 fe2 ratio of 4 1 was found to be optimum giving maximum ma degradation of 91 23 using us fenton after 1 h of treatment the experiments with only us and only fenton at optimum conditions h2o2 fe2 4 1 h2o2 0 8 g l were also performed to check the synergistic effect of the combined approach from the obtained results shown in fig 3 b it was found that combined approach of us fenton 91 23 was more efficient as compared to individual approach of us 22 1 and fenton oxidation 81 27 a similar study was done by dükkancı et al 50 for the decolorization of amine containing azo dye orange ii ado using the us fenton uv system at different molar ratios fe2 h2o2 such as 1 10 1 30 1 50 and 1 60 according to obtained results the maximum decolorization of 80 8 was achieved using a combined approach of the us fenton uv system whereas individual approaches such as uv 6 5 us 28 9 and us uv 47 8 applied at optimal conditions of us frequency of 850 khz h2o2 of 5 mm molar fenton ratio of 1 50 reduced in lower decolonization after 120 min of treatment time comparison with literature elucidated that optimum oxidant ratio and loading are dependent on the specific system elucidating the importance of current work on ma degradation 3 6 ozone o3 combination with us combined approach of us o3 to degrade the ma in an aqueous medium was studied at the different o3 flow rates of 0 2 lph 0 33 lph 0 5 lph 1 lph 2 lph and 3 lph at alkaline conditions ph of 10 temperature of 30 c us power of 100 w and 2 h of treatment time according to obtained results shown in fig 3 d the degradation of ma decreased from 89 96 to 70 16 in treatment time of 1 h inset shows expanded region for degradation above 80 for clarity as the flow rate of o3 increased from 0 2 to 2 lph after the treatment time of 2 h removal extents of ma were 90 81 o3 0 2lph 89 39 o3 0 33lph 86 32 o3 0 5lph 88 31 o3 1lph 84 36 o3 2lph and 69 39 o3 3lph the combined o3 and ultrasound system was much more effective in the degradation of ma than only ultrasound or only o3 system which may be attributed to the direct reaction of ozone and ma at the higher temperatures available at cavitation bubble interfaces the obtained results clearly showed that a minimum o3 loading of 0 2lph in the us o3 system was sufficient and optimum for maximal ma removal which is particularly noteworthy in terms of operating cost excess o3 loading results in the production of large bubbles owing to the coalescence effect leading to a decrease in the interfacial area for the gas liquid mass transfer resulting in minimal ho radical generation and also direct reaction of ozone 51 52 generally the degassing effect of us would reduce the solubility of o3 gas in aqueous solutions which would affect the degradation of pollutants negatively however in the us o3 system us can also improve o3 decomposition and the mass transfer rate which is beneficial for the generation of reactive ho radicals which results in improved process efficiency 53 based on the counteracting effects the ozone loading is an important parameter and so is the utilization by pollutants making specific studies for ma important it can be said that increasing the ozone flow rate decreases the ma degradation because of the scavenging effect with ho radicals that forms the carbonate and also due to lower efficacy for cavitation 55 56 song et al 52 explored the use of the combined approach of us o3 in the degradation of aniline at different o3 flow rates such as 1 mg min 2 mg min 4 mg min 8 mg min and 12 mg min according to the obtained results almost 82 of removal efficiency was observed using us o3 scheme which was higher as compared to us 6 and o3 44 at optimum conditions i e o3 flow rate of 2 mg min aniline 0 100 mg l us energy density of 0 1 w ml ph of 7 and the temperature of 25 c within 30 min of treatment overall the us o3 system is capable of achieving desired results in terms of improved efficiency when used under optimum conditions specific to the system pointing towards the importance of the current work 3 7 kps combination with us effect of kps in combination us on ma degradation scheme was studied at alkaline ph 10 condition the temperature of 30 c us power of 100 w and 2 h of the treatment time different kps loadings used for the optimization study were 0 3 g l 0 5 g l 0 8 g l and 1 2 g l according to the obtained results depicted in fig 3 e it was noted that higher ma degradation of 97 3 was achieved using us kps at optimum kps loading of 0 5 g l as compared to ma degradation obtained at 0 3 g l 92 8 0 8 g l 90 3 and 1 g l 89 2 it was observed that the removal efficiency of ma increased from 92 8 to 97 3 with an increase in kps loading from 0 3 g l to 0 5 g l beyond which the removal efficiency of ma reduced to 88 94 at kps loading of 1 g l no significant enhancement in reduction was obtained beyond the optimum kps loading of 0 5 g l due to the scavenging of so4 radicals by excess s2o8 2 the presence of so4 in the system supplies extra oxidizing radicals but the formation of ho radicals is almost steady when ps is overloaded as a result after the optimum loading of ps ho and so4 radicals are scavenged due to the possible recombination and reaction with excess ps as illustrated in eqs 18 and 20 56 57 18 s o 4 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 19 s 2 o 8 2 ho ho s 2 o 8 20 s 2 o 8 2 s 2 o 4 s 2 o 4 2 s 2 o 8 thus excess ps loading can lead to a reduced pollutant degradation that adversely affects the efficiency of the process 58 in order to avoid inhibition effects the optimum loading of ps 0 5 g l was used in further work it is worthwhile to compare the trend with literature so as to highlight the importance of the work based on a different optimum oxidant loading specific to the effluent monteagudo et al 59 elucidated a similar trend when they used the us in combination with the persulfate to degrade diclofenac dcf in aqueous solution at operating conditions of ph 3 us duty cycle of 100 us power of 380 w temperature of 30 c us amplitude of 100 ps dosing ranging from 90 mg l to 150 mg l and an initial dcf concentration of 5 mg l due to an increase in ps loading to 120 mg l different optimum as compared to current work dcf removal effectiveness increased to 97 following which it decreased to 82 after 120 min of treatment it was also found that us ps scheme was found to be effective yielding higher dcf removal efficiency of 97 as compared to individual approaches of us 58 and ps 2 after 240 min similar to that seen in the current work 3 8 combined approach of multiple oxidation schemes 3 8 1 us fenton o3 a combined approach of us fenton o3 scheme was also explored to check the effectiveness of combined approaches involving multiple oxidants at optimized conditions the experiment was performed using us fenton o3 approach at optimized conditions as h2o2 fe2 ratio of 4 1 h2o2 loading of 0 8 g l o3 flow rate of 0 2 lph and 2 h of treatment time it was found that almost 95 5 of ma degradation was obtained using a combined approach of us fenton o3 which was higher as compared to the approach of only us 22 1 only fenton 81 28 only o3 89 66 us fenton 91 23 us o3 90 81 and fenton o3 94 78 at ph of 3 temperature of 30 c and 2 h of treatment according to the results shown in fig 4 a it is also seen that the marginal change in the ma removal is observed between us fenton o3 and fenton o3 which concluded that the us doesn t contribute to the binary system of fenton o3 to get the synergistic results hence it was elucidated that fenton o3 is an efficient process amongst various approaches involving us fenton and o3 in terms of ma removal efficiency under optimum conditions a study by gujar and gogate 19 investigated the remediation of amine containing real industrial dye effluent using us fenton o3 followed by a lime cao treatment it was found that us fenton o3 followed by cao treatment was effective for getting almost 95 of cod reduction within 30 min of treatment time under the conditions of h2o2 17 5 g l h2o2 fe2 3 cao 1 g l o3 flow rate 1 g h implying that the addition of o3 accelerated the treatment the comparison clearly illustrated that the benefits of combining different oxidants are dependent on the pollutant in question 3 8 2 us fenton kps the effect of us fenton oxidation and kps on the degradation of ma was investigated at optimum conditions of h2o2 fe2 4 1 h2o2 0 8 g l kps 0 5 g l ph of 3 the temperature of 30 c and us power of 100 w it was observed that maximum ma removal of 98 14 was obtained using the us fenton kps scheme which was higher as compared to only us 22 1 only fenton 80 1 only kps 92 74 fenton kps 89 94 us fenton 89 5 and us kps 94 72 within 1 h of treatment according to the obtained results shown in fig 4 b it can be seen that the us improved the fenton kps system in terms of achieving maximum ma reduction under similar conditions interestingly the us fenton kps scheme was effective for achieving maximum cod reduction within 1 h of treatment but the us kps scheme achieved nearly the same outcome after 2 h of treatment fenton oxidation enhances the us fenton kps process by halving the treatment time but it also adds an extra load in the form of sludge which can increases disposal expenses the introduction of multiple systems to the individual system for the degradation of any specific compound up to the desired level needs to be evaluated in terms of additional cost to the operation due to the chemical consumption and byproduct disposal as well as benefits in terms of lower treatment time before selecting any approach hence considering the economy of the process the us kps scheme cost 0 01 l was considered efficient with 2 h of treatment giving almost 97 3 of ma reduction agarkoti et al 60 studied the treatment of cetp effluent using us fenton ps scheme at various fe2 h2o2 s2o8 2 ratios of 1 40 5 83 1 40 11 67 1 40 17 5 and 1 40 23 33 while keeping constant other parameters such as us power of 150 w and us frequency of 22 khz it was reported that almost 78 8 of cod reduction was obtained using us fenton ps at an optimal fe2 h2o2 s2o8 2 ratio of 1 40 17 5 and under the same conditions cod reductions of 88 3 and 13 16 were obtained using us fenton oxidation and only us respectively overall it appears that using combined oxidation schemes is efficient in terms of cod reduction but an optimal combination of oxidation schemes must be determined considering the treatment cost and obtained efficacy 3 8 3 us kps o3 various approaches involving us kps and o3 were also applied for the treatment of ma under optimum conditions as kps loading of 0 5 g l o3 flow rate of 0 2lph ph of 10 temperature of 30 c and us power of 100 w under optimized conditions it was observed that the maximum ma removal of 94 1 was achieved using the us kps o3 system within 2 h of treatment time as shown in fig 4 c the experiments were also performed using different approaches as us kps o3 us kps us o3 kps o3 at optimum conditions and ma removal for each system was 22 1 90 92 89 66 97 3 90 81 and 92 69 respectively the cost of the combined schemes as us kps o3 us kps and us o3 were 0 19 l 0 01 l and 0 02 l respectively according to the findings the introduction of three distinct systems us kps and o3 into the combined system of us kps o3 has no significant effect on ma removal efficiency as compared to us kps or us o3 us kps was shown to be the most effective of all these systems in terms of ma removal efficiency and operational cost ghanbari et al 61 studied the use of tertiary system of us peroxymonosulfate pms o3 for the degradation of benzotriazole under optimal conditions viz neutral ph o3 6 8 mg l pms 1 5 mm us power of 200 w and bta 0 40 mg l under the optimum conditions it was observed that almost complete degradation was observed using the us pms o3 system within 60 min of treatment time also resulting in almost 85 of cod reduction 75 of toc reduction and 73 3 of organic nitrogen removal it was also reported that the same system of us pms o3 was also employed to the real samples of petrochemical effluent saline water and secondary effluent matrices which resulted in 72 3 54 and 94 6 of bta degradation respectively under similar conditions the work also elucidated the critical role of ultrasound in deciding the intensification comparison with literature allowed establishing the specificity of the benefits for combined process to the type of effluent overall it is critical to identify the best combination of individual systems that can give a sufficient breakdown of a specific complex compound at optimized cost which can assist the design of any commercial treatment system 3 8 4 us fenton kps o3 combination of us fenton oxidation kps and o3 was also applied to remove ma effectively at optimum conditions as h2o2 loading of 0 8 g l h2o2 fe2 ratio of 4 1 kps loading of 0 5 g l o3 flow rate of 0 2 lph ph of 3 the temperature of 30 c and us power of 100 w under the optimum conditions almost similar results were obtained using the us fenton kps o3 97 91 and fenton kps o3 96 49 within 2 h of treatment time as shown in fig 4 d hence it was established that us was ineffective in producing further benefits in terms of ma degradation in the hybrid system and that us also added additional energy cost for a similar final result elucidating fenton kps o3 as an efficient approach kodavatiganti et al 62 studied the degradation of acid violent 7 dye av7 using different approaches of us feso4 kps feso4 kps fenton and us fenton at optimum condition viz av7 20 mg l h2o2 50 mg l kps 20 mg l feso4 25 mg l ph of 4 temperature of 20 c and time of 60 min it was reported that only fenton oxidation was efficient for achieving maximum cod reduction of 80 9 similar to to us fenton 81 whereas kps feso4 60 2 and us kps feso4 69 9 resulted in lower efficacy hence the inclusion of multiple oxidation systems may not always be effective considering the removal efficiency operation cost and chemical consumption overall selecting the treatment approach based on the smallest number of individual schemes is critical to save chemical consumption and energy costs while achieving the target outcome 3 9 large scale study an optimized lab scale treatment scheme us kps was applied on the pilot level using a longitudinal horn based sonoreactor with the capacity of 4 l the operating condition for the large scale operation was maintained at kps loading of 0 5 g l us frequency of 25 khz us power of 700 w and the duty cycle of 100 according to the obtained results as shown in fig 5 it was observed that almost 94 of ma removal was achieved using longitudinal horn sonoreactor coupled with kps under optimum conditions within 2 h of treatment hence it is confirmed that the lab scale optimized conditions of us kps 97 3 were successfully applied on the pilot level using a longitudinal horn sonoreactor it was also observed that cavitational yield for longitudinal horn 1 23 10 3 mg j was almost 4 times higher than that for the us horn 0 33 10 3mg j under a similar operating conditions of kps 0 5 g l ph of 10 ma 0 1152 mg l and temperature of 30 c patil et al 63 also reported the comparison study between longitudinal horn lh sonoreactor with us frequency of 25 khz and us power 1 kw and conventional us horn with us frequency of 20 khz and us power 240 w for the degradation of imidacloprid idp in an aqueous medium it was illustrated that an optimized lab scale system was successfully applied on large scale using longitudinal horn sonoreactor resulting in idp degradation of 98 5 and 83 2 using us uv h2o2 approaches and lh sonorector uv h2o2 respectively it was also reported that the cavitational yield for longitudinal horn sonoreactor 5 08 10 6 mg j was almost three times higher than that for the us horn 1 86 10 6 mg j under optimum conditions viz h2o2 35 mg l idp 0 20 mg l uv power of 4 w and ph of 5 similar to that seen in the current work 3 10 comparison of all treatment schemes for the ma degradation a comparison of all the approaches applied for the degradation of ma using the simple us as well as longitudinal horn based sonoreactor has been performed based on ma degradation fig 6 cost of the process cavitational yield and the treatment time fig 6 with the data presented in table s 1 supplementary information the energy cost was calculated based on a standard power meter to evaluate the power of the instruments used in the treatment and the chemical cost was calculated based on the commercial price of the chemical used in the treatment us and hydrogen peroxide generally increase the energy cost and chemical costs respectively posing a problem when designing a degradation scheme at the commercial level the us on the other hand offers its own set of advantages in terms of reducing excessive chemical consumption and treatment time requirements fenton oxidation produces sludge as a byproduct which adds to the sludge handling problem when it comes to costing and handling the persulfate and o3 oxidation processes are much more viable all schemes have their own limitations and advantages prompting a detailed comparison of the effectiveness in terms of ma degradation cavitational yield and treatment cost as depicted in table s 1 the spectra analysis of the untreated and treated sample using the us kps 0 5 g l approach was also performed using hplc it was seen that no additional peak for any of the intermediates was found in treated sample as shown in fig s2 indicating that us kps scheme was effective for the complete ma removal and mineralization with no residual intermediates the untreated sample mainly comprised of primary amine methylamine compound containing methyl group attached to the single amine compound from the obtained results fig s 1 and s 2 and eq 12 it can be said that complex compound present in the untreated solution dissociated and completely mineralized under the influence of us kps scheme at optimum conditions from the obtained results it was concluded that the us kps system was more efficient in terms of giving maximum ma degradation 97 3 and lower cost of the process 0 11 l than all other processes it was also noted that us fenton kps and us fenton kps o3 systems were most effective in terms of giving a maximum cavitational yield of 0 34 10 3mg j each amongst all other individual or combined processes at lab scale however both these processes offer disadvantage of sludge generation due to fenton the longitudinal horn sonoreactor kps scheme was found to be effective in terms of process cost 0 03 l ma removal efficiency 94 and cavitational yield 1 23 10 3mg j only us approach was one of the most expensive 0 46 l and had the lowest cavitational yield 0 08 10 3mg j for the ma degradation amongst all other schemes the optimized lab scale design of the ma degradation scheme was demonstrated to be successfully scaled up on a pilot level using a longitudinal horn based sonoreactor 4 conclusions a cavitation based novel study also involving different chemical oxidants to remove methylamine ma from an aqueous solution was evaluated in terms of important aspects such as the removal efficiency of the process process optimization operating cost and cavitational yield based on a detailed study into effect of operating parameters and various combinations the optimum conditions were established as us power of 100 w us frequency of 20 khz us duty cycle of 70 the temperature of 30 c h2o2 loading of 0 8 g l h2o2 fe2 ratio of 4 1 and kps loading of 0 5 g l o3 loading of 0 2 lph and treatment time of 120 min the us fenton kps o3 and us kps systems were shown to have a maximum ma removal of 97 91 and 97 33 respectively within 2 h of treatment under optimal conditions us kps system was found to be the most economical scheme considering the cost of the treatment 0 11 l with higher cost being seen for the us fenton kps o3 scheme 0 18 l longitudinal horn with kps system kps 0 5 g l was successfully demonstrated at pilot scale resulting in almost 94 of ma removal after 120 min of treatment it was also found that the cavitational yield for the longitudinal horn 1 23 10 3 mg j was almost 4 times higher than us horn 1 23 10 3 mg j under similar operating conditions from the intermediate analysis of treated ma solution it was established that us kps scheme was effective in terms of complete transformation of complex compound without formation of any residual intermediates overall it can be concluded that sonochemistry in combination with kps can be the best alternative option to remediate the primary amine based pollutant and it is not a good idea to add too many oxidants to the treatment schemes declaration of competing interest the authors wish to confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this publication and there has

treated sewage wastewater achieved using 20 ml min cu2o pvdf tf hfm after 360 min light irradiation about 71 33 of regeneration efficiency was achieved after 3 consecutive cycles that this technique promises the good reusability with strong adhesion capability graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords bisphenol a cuxo pvdf thin film hollow fiber membrane magnetron sputtering photocatalysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater with refractory pollutants such as bisphenol a bpa one of the endocrine disrupting compound edc not only affects public health but also gives adverse effects to the ecosystem 1 the pollutant known as synthetic oestrogen been discharge into the water bodies 2 contributes to human chronic diseases 3 the endocrine disruptor which has unique structure has the capability to block the natural hormones 4 bpa is frequently traced in water wastewater sewage sludge and sediments where the higher amount of bpa causes risks of diabetes and heart disease to humans 5 small percentage of bpa can be detected in industrial and municipal sewage treatment plant outlet around 1 3 to 215 ng l in tap water around 3 5 to 59 8 ng l and 3 3 2 6 ng l in mineral bottled water at room temperature 6 in malaysia bpa is not listed in the national water quality standard nwqs and malaysia environmental quality sewage and industrial effluents regulations hence the issue of bpa toxicity is a global concern and sustainable approaches of its advanced treatments need to be highlighted for this reason wastewater managers have the responsibility to ensure that the effluent that is eventually released into the environment does not degrade the quality of the recipient water bodies 7 as attaining the sustainability in wastewater management is the top priority of sustainable development goals sdgs agenda so the realization of a more sustainable wastewater management requires a holistic and balanced approach in evaluating a specific management strategy promoting the use of safe affordable and approachable wastewater treatment techniques is a step towards wastewater treatment for sustainability wastewater treatment is the overall process that involves the improvement of the quality of wastewater between points of production and points of discharge several technologies have been developed for bpa removal including adsorption 4 ozonation 5 ion exchange 7 biosorption 8 and photocatalysis 9 adsorption is considered as a promising method due to simple operation low cost treatment as well as reasonable treatment efficiency 10 however the recovery and filtration of adsorbent is a key bottleneck other methods also encounter drawbacks such as the formation of harmful oxidation by products and high operational cost 11 among the present treatment technologies advanced oxidation processes aop especially photocatalytic degradation is considered as a seminal method to treat bpa contaminated wastewater photocatalysis is actually a chemical photoreaction between a catalyst with uv visible or near infrared light and the photoexcitation occurred depends on the energy band gaps and a wide range of inactivate waterborne microbes through simple photocatalytic redox mechanism 12 13 in photocatalysis basically a light penetration towards catalyst is required to produce electrons e in valence band vb after that e excite towards conduction band cb by producing holes h in vb the redox reaction between e and h produces hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide anion radicals o2 that break target pollutant into carbon dioxide co2 and water h2o 12 photocatalysis using membrane has been popular in water treatment due to the environment friendly approach in maintaining a sustainable ecosystem although tio2 is the promising material for photocatalytic application in previous literature however it only functions to ultraviolet light illumination where the light causes drawbacks such as bacterial growth after the process and high energy consumption 12 cu2o is an inexpensive non toxic and abundantly available compound it has a narrow band gap 1 2 2 5 ev suitable for photocatalytic degradation under visible light 14 15 as a promising photocatalyst cu2o nanocrystal removed 99 of congo red dye 16 while cuo nanowire successfully degraded methylene blue up to 79 47 after 4 h of reaction 17 although the powdered catalysts have benefits such as numerous active spaces for light illumination but there are some limitations of separation and recovery process after treatment therefore the immobilization of catalyst on a suitable support is needed to overcome the powder catalyst issues 18 the physical deposition of catalyst on substrate produced thin film can provide different photocatalytic properties sputtering technique can produce higher deposition rate simple operation safe method as well providing a large area deposition which is recommended for industrial applications 18 19 this technique also delivers a uniform deposition which is highly adhesive and free from contamination 21 in spite of its above mentioned benefits so far no one has reported the deposition of copper oxide catalyst on polymer substrate especially hollow polymeric membrane configuration for photocatalysis application to bridge the existing gap this study investigated the deposition of copper oxide thin film on pvdf hfm using radio frequency rf magnetron sputtering technique with varying oxygen flow rates oxygen flow rates play as an important key in producing different phases of copper oxide that influence the photocatalysis efficiency pvdf hfm was chosen due to its versatility including outstanding thermal and chemical stability 21 22 the technical feasibility of cuxo pvdf tf hfm for bpa photocatalytic degradation in synthetic and real treated sewage wastewater was evaluated photocatalysis analysis towards real treated sewage wastewater was carried out to evaluate the capability of cu2o pvdf tf hfm as good photocatalytic membrane to be used in real wastewater treatment flexible hollow fiber pvdf membrane based thin film substrate sputtered with copper oxide acts as a novel configuration for photocatalytic applications and filtration performance in providing a good membrane reusability with strong adhesion of photocatalyst for

18857 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 morphology and element mapping in sample the surface morphology of the sputtered cuxo was successfully attached onto the surface of pvdf hfm by bombardment of cuxo using process pressure inside the magnetron sputtering chamber by varying the oxygen flow rate fig s1 shows that produced thin films of sputtered cuxo with different thickness were detected and observed via fesem analysis the obtained images of deposited cuxo exhibited densely packed grains that uniformly distributed along the surface of pvdf hfm the thickness of cuxo sputtered on the polymer substrate was 194 189 184 174 and 164 nm for 10 15 20 25 and 30 ml min of the samples respectively by applying lower oxygen flow rate 10 ml min during sputtering micro cracks appeared on the surface of the sample that can be attributed to the dense and thicker deposition of cuxo although the other samples showed uniformity when o2 flow rate was increased up to 30 ml min the thickness of the sputtered material decreased when oxygen flow rate increased from 10 to 30 ml min by maintaining the target substrate distance at 14 cm by increasing the o2 flow rate the sputtered cu atoms reduced and lowered the film deposition rate 30 31 it was attributed to the higher oxygen flow rate with higher energy that reached the film surface which bombarded the cu atoms by allowing them to migrate on the surface of substrate this suggests the connection between cuxo particles and promotes the layer by layer growth 32 compared to neat pvdf no deposition of cuxo appeared and pores shown at outer surface view the uniform distribution of cuxo at the outer surface of the pvdf hfm was verified by edx analysis fig s2 the red dots referred to the presence of cu while blue dots were assigned to o the presence of high loading of cuxo as a photocatalyst on the outer surface membrane enhanced the photodegradation of target pollutants however there was also diffusion of the cuxo particles into the intermediate space of the pvdf hfm due to the single layer of porous pvdf hfm as substrate and it might easily enter through the pores as compared to dual layer pvdf hfm fig s3 compared to neat pvdf no red dots on the membrane surface and cross section shown while only little blue dots appeared due to the triethyl phosphate solvent for neat pvdf hfm fabrication the elemental composition of cuxo thin film on the pvdf hfm surface and cross section layer was shown in table 3 from the surface it indicates that the higher the oxygen flow rate the lower the cu element the same finding was also reported by jilani et al 33 who found that the cu element reduced with the rising oxygen flow rate carbon element was also analyzed to detect its atom on the pvdf hfm carbon was considered as a contaminant on the surface during the transfer of films from sputtering 34 as the pvdf hfm was a single layer the cuxo was easily diffused inside the porous pvdf hfm layer cu and o were also detected on the surface thickness of the coating layer the change in their contents is related to phase change 35 the higher the oxygen flow rate the greater the tendency for cuxo diffused inside the pores and attached inside the finger like projections it could be due to the pressure during the sputtering which pushed the cuxo into the porous pvdf hfm layer the oxygen content inside the pvdf hfm layer originated from the oxygen of the polyethylene glycol peg 400 and triethyl phosphate tep during the fabrication of pvdf hfm 3 1 2 x ray diffraction the structural analysis of the sputtered cuxo thin films on the membrane s surface was investigated using an xrd fig 3 depicts the xrd pattern of different phases of cuxo formation after being deposited on the pvdf hfm surface at varying oxygen flowrates according to the icdd 00 045 0937 crystallographic information the main diffraction of cu2o was observed at 110 plane which referred to 26 peak at all sample details 36 according to kumar et al 37 cu2o phase was detected at same peak in the xrd spectra while other cu2o peak which appeared at 36 indicated 111 diffraction plane in 10 15 and 20 ml min of the samples this reveals the formation of pure cubic crystalline phase of cu2o 38 the diffractions of single cuo were also observed at 40 4 for 25 ml min sample which implied as 111 diffraction plane while sample 30 ml min revealed cuo peaks at 36 5 40 75 56 6 and 68 15 which referred to 111 and 002 diffraction planes based on the icdd 01 071 4310 crystallographic information the same pattern was also shown by radjehi et al 31 where cuo phase emerged when the sample with 30 ml min of oxygen flow rate was applied according to jilani et al 33 cuo was also observed at 111 and 002 planes using direct current dc sputtering techniques this can be explained due to the fact that different cuo phase was successfully implemented on the surface of membrane by sputtering due to the effects of oxygen flow rate this suggested that higher o2 flow rate produced o 39 cu2o formation at lower o2 flow rate was due to insufficient o2 and less energy of o at a higher o2 flow rate the higher energy of o enhanced the reaction between cu and o of which of the cu was oxidized to cu 2 to produce pure cuo with the increasing o2 flow rate 40 the higher the oxygen flowrate the higher the intensity of the peaks which in turns increases the crystallinity of cuo thin film as a result the intense semi crystalline peak at 18 31 and 19 62 were also observed at the sputtered pvdf hfm which corresponded to the existence of pvdf 41 the scherrer eq 6 was used to calculate grain size 33 6 d kλ β cos θ where d is the crystalline size of diffraction planes and k is the constant while λ is the wavelength and β refers to a corresponding diffraction plane table 4 shows that the grain size of cu2o was calculated to be 2 11 nm in 10 ml min sample when the oxygen flow rate was increased to 15 ml min the grain size was reduced to 1 32 nm however when the oxygen flow rate was increased to 20 ml min the grain size of cu2o was again increased to 2 15 nm subsequently the grain size of sputtered cuo reduced when it started developing at 25 and 30 ml min of o2 flowrate table 3 the decreasing grain size could be due to the migration effects of constrain grain boundary which restricts the grains growth 42 the effect of oxygen flow rate in sputtering can further alter the dislocation density of sputtered cuo and cu2o number of defects in the material was calculated using eq 7 43 7 δ 1 d 2 where d is the grain size based on the scherrer equation the higher the oxygen flow rate in the sputtering the higher the dislocation density and vice versa table 3 as a result the variation of dislocation density influenced the lattice strain of the material the lattice strain of sputtered cuxo can be calculated using eq 8 8 ε βcos θ 4 where β represents a full width half maximum of diffraction peaks while θ is a diffraction angle the lattice strain of 10 ml min of the sample was 0 020 nm and increased to 0 027 nm when 15 ml min of oxygen flow rate was employed however the lattice strain dropped to 0 019 nm at 20 ml min sample after further increment of the oxygen flow rate to 25 and 30 ml min the lattice strain rose again the lattice strain of the sputtered cuo showed the same trend for dislocation density this data suggests that the higher the oxygen flow rate the lower the grain size of the sputtered cuo which improved the grain boundaries leading to the increment in strain and dislocation density furthermore this can also be explained due to the higher interstitial oxygen defects introduced into cuo film with the increasing oxygen flow rate by rising the oxygen flow rate during the sputtering the growth of the grains impeded and reduced the crystallinity of film formation resulting in a large number of grain boundaries 44 the same trend was also reported by dolai et al 45 who found that the grain size became smaller as a higher oxygen flow rate was applied using d c sputtering technique different phase of the cuxo was further analyzed by the ftir analysis 3 1 3 attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to measure vibrational bond frequency in a molecule ftir analysis of neat pvdf hfm and cuxo pvdf tf hfm at various oxygen flow rates scanned in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 at ambient temperature was conducted as given fig 4 when the pvdf hfm was sputtered with copper oxide by varying oxygen flow rate different phase of the cuxo was formed fig 4 reveals that the cu2o bond appeared at 610 and 680 cm 1 in agreement with dulma et al 46 and renuga et al 47 by increasing the oxygen flow rate to 25 and 30 ml min the band at 478 35 cm 1 466 77 cm 1 and 435 91 cm 1 revealed cuo bond 48 and the intensity of their peaks also increased as compared to neat pvdf hfm moreover the peak at 534 cm 1 found in 30 ml min sample was also identified as cuo fig 3 also displays the intense band at 1178 51 cm 1 that corresponded to cf2 bond from the pvdf while the band at 975 98 cm 1 and 759 95 cm 1 were assigned to alpha phase pvdf crystal according to kamaludin et al 24 and shi et al 47 the phase of cu2o in 20 ml min sample was further confirmed by xps analysis 3 1 4 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy the a xps survey spectra and b xps spectra of cu 2p of 20 ml min sample cu2o pvdf tf hfm was shown in fig 5 three peaks at 281 ev 528 ev and 931 ev attributable to c 1s o 1s and cu 2p were observed in the xps survey scan spectrum of 20 ml min sample cu2o pvdf tf hfm fig 5 a the existence of c 1s attributable to the pvdf hfm while o 1s and cu 2p correspond to the existence of cu2o the similar report of c 1s from pvdf can be seen from akashi and kuroda 49 fig 5 b show the cu 2p xps spectrum two peaks at 930 55 ev and 950 95 ev corresponding to the cu 2p3 2 and cu 2p1 2 peaks of cu respectively confirm the existence of cu2o in the sample moreover the existence of cu in the sample can be further confirmed by the two extra peaks at 940 55 ev and 959 05 ev which similar with previous literature 50 51 3 1 5 surface roughness the surface topography of the neat pvdf hfm and cuxo pvdf tf hfm at different oxygen flow rate were scanned at an area of 10 10 μm using afm the changes in oxygen flow rate affected the surface morphology and the roughness of the sputtered cuxo fig 6 the sputtering of cuxo onto the surface of pvdf hfm increased the roughness of the membrane at 10 ml min of oxygen flow rate it was observed that the surface roughness was 8 26 nm higher than the neat pvdf hfm 6 15 nm the average surface roughness ra was found to be 8 05 7 92 5 95 and 5 17 nm for each film deposited at 15 20 25 and 30 ml min of samples respectively the surface roughness increased after cu2o deposition at 10 ml min of oxygen however the roughness reduced once the oxygen flow rate increased jilani et al 33 found that the surface roughness of cuo film decreased on applying higher oxygen pressure this implied that a smaller grain size was produced by sputtered cuo as oxygen flow rate increased which reduced the surface roughness of the sputtered material this was also reported by dustgeer et al 52 who found the surface roughness depends on the particle size of the deposited material 3 1 6 optical band gap the direct optical bandgap of the sputtered thin films was determined by the tauc s model fig 7 the intercept of the straight line to hv axis at zero indicated the optical band gap eg the cu2o thin film deposited at 10 ml min of o2 flow rate had a band gap of 2 41 ev the thin film deposited at 15 20 and 25 ml min of o2 flow rate had a band gap of 2 34 ev 2 29 ev and 2 24 ev respectively while the band gap at 30 ml min exhibited at 2 15 ev the higher the o2 flow rate the lower the band gap this can be explained that the band gap of cuo exhibited at 25 and 30 ml min was lower than cu2o in 10 15 and 20 ml min of the samples the band gap of cu2o film was 2 3 2 5 ev while for cuo it ranged from 1 9 to 2 3 ev 20 52 therefore samples with lower band gap were suitable for visible light irradiation of the photocatalysis 3 2 water flux performance water flux study was conducted during photodegradation to observe the filtration performance of the cuxo pvdf tf hfm the water flux performance showed an improvement when higher o2 flow rate was applied during the sputtering fig 8 samples with 10 15 20 and 25 ml min achieved 16 39 20 18 26 53 and 33 99 l m2 h while sample of 30 ml min achieved the highest water flux at 37 96 l m2 h after 6 h comparable to the contact angle and porosity of the sputtered membrane table 5 shows that samples with 10 and 15 ml min exhibited a higher contact angle at 100 85 and 109 1 respectively as compared to the neat pvdf hfm it could be due to the agglomerated sputtered thin film developed as a thicker layer covered on the membrane s surface leading to hydrophobicity when increasing the o2 flow rate to 20 ml min the contact angle reduced to 67 88 this could be due to the fact that the uniform sputtered cuo thin film was successfully deposited and had a strong bonding with the pvdf hfm resulting the hydrophilic nature of membrane a lower contact angle produced good wettability hence increasing the water flux as the o2 flow rate was increased to 25 and 30 ml min the contact angle increased dramatically up to 98 82 and 104 05 due to the thinner film deposition although 25 and 30 ml min exhibited a greater contact angle the water flux showed the porosity achieved by the samples table 5 the porosity of the sputtered membrane showed that the porosity increased when higher oxygen flow rates were applied this resulted in the thickness of the sputtered cuo onto the membrane s surface the lower the thickness of cuo deposition the higher the porosity of the sputtered membrane thereby enhancing the water flux performance a higher porosity of the sputtered membrane at 30 ml min of o2 flow rate could be due to the porous cuo distribution on the surface of the pvdf hfm increasing the water flux performance pedram et al 53 reported that a flat sheet polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe sputtered pes membrane at 20 mtorr of argon pressure 50 w power of rf magnetron sputtering and 10 min of deposition achieved a lower water flux at 3 kg m2 h 3 3 photocatalytic activity of bpa in synthetic wastewater the photocatalytic degradation of bpa was carried out to evaluate the photocatalytic performance of cuxo pvdf tf hfm by using 10 15 20 25 and 30 ml min fig 9 after potting cuxo pvdf tf hfm inside pvc pipe and in photocatalytic reactor 10 mg l of bpa solution was introduced into the photoreactor the experiment started without any light irradiation for 1 h to achieve adsorption desorption equilibrium subsequently it was irradiated using visible light for 6 h about 10 ml suspension was collected periodically every 30 min and analyzed using uv vis spectrophotometer at 280 nm of wavelength fig 9 a revealed a plot for the first order kinetic model for bpa photodegradation a low removal of bpa was shown during adsorption desorption process when no visible light irradiated at the first hour while sample of 20 and 25 ml min shows no bpa reduction during the adsorption desorption process after adsorption in the dark for 60 min the reactor was exposed to visible light and the photocatalytic decomposition of bpa by cuxo pvdf tf hfm increased with the increasing reaction time fig 9 b demonstrates the apparent rate constant that the photocatalytic activity was enhanced by the hybridization of cuxo with pvdf hfm at 10 15 20 25 and 30 ml min of o2 flow rates this was attributed to the oxygen vacancy and the greater grain size that led to a higher surface to the volume ratio of the sputtered cu2o with lower thickness the lower the thickness of thin film the higher the oxygen vacancy in the cu2o pvdf tf hfm 30 to enhance the photocatalytic activity the average of kinetic rate of 25 and 30 ml min of the samples was reduced to 0 00028 min 1 and 0 000312 min 1 respectively this was due to the low adhesion of cuo attached on the pvdf hfm substrate due to which the photocatalyst leached out into the bpa solution fig 9 c indicates that after 6 h of uv irradiation bpa removal increased as a higher o2 flow rate 20 ml min was applied the cu2o pvdf tf hfm sputtered at 10 and 15 ml min of o2 flow rate degraded 30 and 31 of bpa respectively while thin film sputtered at 20 ml min sample degraded 60 of bpa at an initial bpa concentration of 10 mg l and at neutral to ph scale the efficient photocatalytic activity of the cu2o pvdf tf hfm under visible light irradiation was due to the presence of cu2o which enhanced the absorption capability that possessed a lower band gap that was suitable in visible light region the band gap energy of 20 ml min of sample was 2 29 ev which is lower than 2 34 ev and 2 41 ev for 15 and 10 ml min of samples respectively moreover 20 ml min sample shows outstanding result with 60 removal of bpa by using shorter 20 strands of 10 cm of cuxo pvdf tf hfm compared to 20 strands of 23 cm of cu2o pvdf dual layer hollow fiber membrane that achieved 75 photodegradation of bpa stated by mohamed noor et al 54 however a low bpa removal with only 9 and 11 was attained by sample deposited with 25 and 30 ml min of o2 flow rate respectively cu2o shifted its phase to cuo at higher o2 flow rate and formed cuo pvdf tf hfm during the photocatalysis color of cuo thin film was faded and it was detached from the fiber membrane and leached out into bpa solution this finding was in agreement with akbari et al 55 who found that cuo possessed a low adhesion towards substrate and that it was easy for cuo to be separated from the fiber membrane substrate and leached into the bpa solution reducing the photodegradation efficiency the cuxo detached from the fiber membrane was detected by leaching test leaching test was confirmed by the presence of cu in bpa solution using icp oes agilent 710 after 6 h of photodegradation it was found that 20 ml min of sample had no leaching of cu inside the bpa solution while 3 33 and 22 22 μg l of cu were found inside the solution after irradiation by 25 and 30 ml min of the samples rejection by filtration occurred simultaneously and the results show that the bpa reduced more than photodegradation process only the photodegradation with rejection achieve the highest 65 removal of 10 mg l bpa using cu2o pvdf tf hfm at 10 min deposition time sample after 360 min illumination with visible light small difference on the results shown by the photodegradation and photodegradation with rejection it shows that the degradation is the main key of bpa removal the photodegradation process helps to break down the bpa molecules with radicals while the rejection process by pvdf hfm helps again in the rejection of the degraded bpa table 6 shows the summary of the photocatalytic performance of photodegradation and rejection of bpa by cuxo pvdf tf hfm at different o2 flowrate an excellent degradation of bpa by the cu2o pvdf tf hfm sputtered at 20 ml min was due to the agglomeration free and a larger grain size of the cu2o sputtered on the pvdf hfm which increased the exposed surface area for light penetration and enhanced the production of e and h for photodegradation process the enhanced photocatalytic efficacy of 20 ml min of sample could be explained due to the catalytic oxidation of bpa by the cu2o with respect to the photodegradation mechanism bpa photodegradation by cu2o cuo under visible light irradiation activated the adsorbed bpa molecules to become excited molecules when the light penetrates the active site of cu2o cuo the electrons e in valence band vb excited to the conduction band cb resulting holes h in vb the e and h were involved in the redox reaction 12 while the reduction of oxygen and oxidation of water produce oh and o2 the radicals entrapped inside the organic pollutant decomposed bpa into harmless co2 and h2o fig 10 depicts that the bpa molecules were degraded by oh attack and oxidative ring opening reaction at cc bond produced aliphatic compounds followed by a mineralization into co2 and h2o this degradation pathway has also been reported by zhu et al 56 the bpa removal increased with the increasing functionality of cu2o hybridization with pvdf due to additional binding sites for adsorbing the bpa in addition the mechanism of bpa degradation can also be seen from previous literature 57 where bpa molecules adsorbed on photocatalyst go bioi bi2wo6 surface and oxidized due to photogenerated holes h the bpa molecules oxidized by oh and o2 as well degraded into non harmful by products consist of co2 and h2o 3 3 1 regeneration of cu2o pvdf tf hfm the reusability test of cu2o pvdf tf hfm was conducted for the photocatalytic study of the bpa three cycles were carried out using 20 ml min of the cu2o pvdf tf hfm between each cycle of the experiments the films were taken out by washing with distilled water fig 11 depicts the bpa degradation and rejection performance of the thin films over consecutive cycles after 3 cycles the degradation reached 42 8 lower than 60 for the first cycle of regeneration where it is about 71 33 of regeneration efficiency was achieved after 3 consecutive cycles less photodegradation activity was due to the adsorbed intermediate by products that blocked the active sites on the surface of cu2o pvdf tf hfm srinivasan et al 30 found that the photocatalytic activity was reduced after 5 cycles of irradiation with cu2o thin film while ansari et al 58 indicated a small decrease in the photocatalytic activity by the cuo gn pani thin film after 3 cycles although the degradation efficiency is reduced but the reusability of spent cu2o pvdf tf hfm was still promising the sputtered cu2o pvdf tf hfm still exhibited reasonable reusability in the bpa photodegradation after 3 consecutive cycles 3 3 2 photocatalytic efficiency at lower concentration of bpa due to the highest degradation of bpa shown by 20 ml min sample of cu2o pvdf tf hfm in synthetic wastewater therefore it is chosen to be used for photocatalysis at different bpa concentration after chemical analysis of photocatalytic activity of bpa at higher bpa concentration completed photocatalytic activity of bpa was further analyzed at lower concentration of bpa consist of 5 and 2 mg l lower bpa concentrations were chosen because lower bpa levels have been detected in malaysian rivers 59 photocatalytic degradation of 2 mg l bpa results in 70 bpa removal in synthetic wastewater as can be seen in fig 12 final rejection of the bpa sample shows that bpa reduced more than photodegradation process only and photodegradation with rejection achieve the highest 74 removal of 2 mg l bpa it indicates that the lower the bpa concentration the higher the photocatalytic performance according to the previous literature by garg et al 60 increasing the bpa concentration from 10 mg l to 50 mg l tend to reduces the photodegradation of bpa from 98 to 40 more bpa molecules were adsorbed on the catalyst s surface as the initial concentration of bpa increased occupying the active sites and thus lowering the production of hydroxyl radicals 57 58 3 4 photocatalytic efficiency in real treated sewage wastewater compared to synthetic wastewater photocatalytic degradation of bpa was further analyzed in treated sewage wastewater to evaluate the efficiency of cu2o pvdf tf hfm in real situation it exhibits excellent performance under same condition the initial concentration of bpa in treated sewage wastewater was detected in very low concentration around 0 54 μg l it reveals that the presence of edc especially bpa in treated sewage wastewater is very small after the conventional treatment before discharging it into the river bodies it can be proven by the literature reported by wee et al 63 100 detection of bpa was observed in all river water and tap water samples around malaysia small concentration of 8 24 ng l and 0 06 66 40 ng l of bpa was detected in river water and tap water respectively from this study it is found that bpa concentration in treated wastewater is higher compared to river water stated by wee et al 63 the sustainability and treatment efficiency indicate as the key matters of concern when higher edc levels detected in treated water than raw water it may be attributed to the parent compounds formation from metabolites desorption of edc during the operation lower adsorption rates of saturated absorbents dissolution of edc aggregates insufficient wastewater treatment for edc and leaching of plasticizers as well contamination occurred in the treatment pipeline 53 55 after treated with photocatalytic membrane the concentration of bpa reduced to 0 06 μg l up to 88 89 degradation of bpa while achieved after 360 min of visible light irradiation as depicted in fig 13 photodegradation and rejection result of the final sample after 360 min irradiation shows excellent result which achieves 91 0 of bpa removal the efficient performance of photocatalytic activity shown could be due to the lower amount of bpa presented inside the treated sewage wastewater compared to synthetic wastewater thus easier for bpa to be degraded in small concentration the degradation of bpa using light shows the main role in higher removal of bpa 3 5 comparison of membrane performance between this study and previous work table 7 summarizes a comparison between cuxo pvdf tf hfm and other sputtered photocatalyst compared to the previous work of kacprzynska golacka et al 67 which corresponds to the flat sheet tio2 ago polyamide membrane prepared by magnetron sputtering technique with 10 ml min o2 flow rate eliminated only 20 and 8 of methylene blue using uv light and visible light irradiation respectively after 8 h meanwhile the 20 ml min of cuxo pvdf tf hfm from this work can remove 60 and 88 89 of complex bpa demonstrating that the cuxo pvdf tf hfm has higher removal efficiency similarly the sputtering of tio2 cuo on glass substrate using 35 ml min o2 flow rate successfully eliminated 5 mg l of 94 1 rhodamine b dye after 2 h irradiation with 150 w visible light 68 although the percentage degradation of dye exhibits high efficiency however filtration cannot be done simultaneously during the photocatalytic study due to glass substrates in addition poor photocatalytic degradation of 10 of 10 mg l bpa was detected with 150 w visible light irradiation using sputtered cu tio2 film on soda lime glass substrate without any o2 flow rate application during the sputtering process 69 the poor removal of bpa was due to the lower porosity of sputtered cu tio2 hence difficult for bpa molecules to access the catalytic sites moreover the film showed more oxygen vacancies that enhance charge carrier recombination that reduce the photocatalytic process besides other study also reported on sputtering of ni zno on fluorine doped tin oxide glass without any o2 flow rate implementation during the procedure from the study 70 higher removal of 95 55 of 10 mg l of ciprofloxacin detected after 90 min irradiation with visible light the outstanding photodegradation efficiency was due to the oxygen created from electrocatalytic oxidation that can accept the electron for photocatalytic process and large electro active surface area provide large number of active sites to generate oxidants for degradation of ciprofloxacin although the removal of edc was high however the filtration process cannot be done by sputtered photocatalyst compared to this study that can simultaneously run for photocatalysis and filtration on the same time another photocatalytic study reveals 80 3 decolorization of reactive black 5 dye by photocatalytic kaolin tio2 nanorod hollow fiber ceramic membrane the higher efficiency shown by photocatalytic ceramic membrane for dye degradation however may not suitable for edc removal since larger band gap of tio2 incompatible for visible light bpa photocatalysis reaction and brittleness of ceramic material give drawback during the photocatalytic process 71 based on these findings it can be stated that the cu2o pvdf tf hfm shows promising result compared to other photocatalyst since the cu2o pvdf tf hfm can undergo 2 processes namely photocatalysis and filtration simultaneously for better water treatment applications the outstanding 20 ml min cu2o pvdf tf hfm in this study has successfully photodegrade and rejects 74 and 91 of bpa from synthetic wastewater and real treated sewage wastewater respectively moreover the pvdf hollow fiber membrane configuration gives flexible and easy operation with good reusability which can be used repetitively for the next cycle of photocatalysis process expectantly cu2o pvdf tf hfm may be a good photocatalytic membrane for degradation of small percentage of bpa detected and might be also beneficial to be applied in wastewater treatment plant in malaysia for edc removal in addition this research may be preferential to tackle the malaysian national water resources policy and national key results area that aims to provide clear directions and strategies for water resources management with collaborative governance to ensure water security and continued sustainability and ensuring public access to clean and treated water 63 4 conclusion fabrication of cuxo polyvinylidene fluoride thin film cuxo pvdf tf hollow fiber membrane was successfully achieved by radio frequency rf magnetron sputtering technique a different phase of cuxo was produced where cu2o formed when 10 15 and 20 ml min oxygen flow rate was applied during sputtering procedure while cuo formed when 25 and 30 ml min oxygen flow rate was implemented cu2o shows more active in the bisphenol a photocatalysis degradation which can be seen from the 20 ml min sample oxygen flow rate of 20 ml min is the best sputtering conditions due to the uniform cu2o deposition on pvdf hfm surfaces and producing the highest photocatalytic performance up to 74 degradation and rejection of 2 mg l bpa in synthetic wastewater while 91 in treated sewage wastewater in neutral ph condition after 360 min irradiation with visible light about 71 33 of regeneration efficiency was achieved after 3 consecutive cycles which confirms that this technique promises the good reusability with strong adhesion of cu2o photocatalyst this can be concluded that the cu2o pvdf tf hfm is capable in 2 in 1 function efficient in photocatalytic activity bpa filtration and achieve excellent water flux as well moreover it might be an effective and potentially reusable membrane for bpa photodegradation to be applied in real sewage wastewater treatment plant in malaysia for edc removal declaration of competing interest the authors

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater with refractory pollutants such as bisphenol a bpa one of the endocrine disrupting compound edc not only affects public health but also gives adverse effects to the ecosystem 1 the pollutant known as synthetic oestrogen been discharge into the water bodies 2 contributes to human chronic diseases 3 the endocrine disruptor which has unique structure has the capability to block the natural hormones 4 bpa is frequently traced in water wastewater sewage sludge and sediments where the higher amount of bpa causes risks of diabetes and heart disease to humans 5 small percentage of bpa can be detected in industrial and municipal sewage treatment plant outlet around 1 3 to 215 ng l in tap water around 3 5 to 59 8 ng l and 3 3 2 6 ng l in mineral bottled water at room temperature 6 in malaysia bpa is not listed in the national water quality standard nwqs and malaysia environmental quality sewage and industrial effluents regulations hence the issue of bpa toxicity is a global concern and sustainable approaches of its advanced treatments need to be highlighted for this reason wastewater managers have the responsibility to ensure that the effluent that is eventually released into the environment does not degrade the quality of the recipient water bodies 7 as attaining the sustainability in wastewater management is the top priority of sustainable development goals sdgs agenda so the realization of a more sustainable wastewater management requires a holistic and balanced approach in evaluating a specific management strategy promoting the use of safe affordable and approachable wastewater treatment techniques is a step towards wastewater treatment for sustainability wastewater treatment is the overall process that involves the improvement of the quality of wastewater between points of production and points of discharge several technologies have been developed for bpa removal including adsorption 4 ozonation 5 ion exchange 7 biosorption 8 and photocatalysis 9 adsorption is considered as a promising method due to simple operation low cost treatment as well as reasonable treatment efficiency 10 however the recovery and filtration of adsorbent is a key bottleneck other methods also encounter drawbacks such as the formation of harmful oxidation by products and high operational cost 11 among the present treatment technologies advanced oxidation processes aop especially photocatalytic degradation is considered as a seminal method to treat bpa contaminated wastewater photocatalysis is actually a chemical photoreaction between a catalyst with uv visible or near infrared light and the photoexcitation occurred depends on the energy band gaps and a wide range of inactivate waterborne microbes through simple photocatalytic redox mechanism 12 13 in photocatalysis basically a light penetration towards catalyst is required to produce electrons e in valence band vb after that e excite towards conduction band cb by producing holes h in vb the redox reaction between e and h produces hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide anion radicals o2 that break target pollutant into carbon dioxide co2 and water h2o 12 photocatalysis using membrane has been popular in water treatment due to the environment friendly approach in maintaining a sustainable ecosystem although tio2 is the promising material for photocatalytic application in previous literature however it only functions to ultraviolet light illumination where the light causes drawbacks such as bacterial growth after the process and high energy consumption 12 cu2o is an inexpensive non toxic and abundantly available compound it has a narrow band gap 1 2 2 5 ev suitable for photocatalytic degradation under visible light 14 15 as a promising photocatalyst cu2o nanocrystal removed 99 of congo red dye 16 while cuo nanowire successfully degraded methylene blue up to 79 47 after 4 h of reaction 17 although the powdered catalysts have benefits such as numerous active spaces for light illumination but there are some limitations of separation and recovery process after treatment therefore the immobilization of catalyst on a suitable support is needed to overcome the powder catalyst issues 18 the physical deposition of catalyst on substrate produced thin film can provide different photocatalytic properties sputtering technique can produce higher deposition rate simple operation safe method as well providing a large area deposition which is recommended for industrial applications 18 19 this technique also delivers a uniform deposition which is highly adhesive and free from contamination 21 in spite of its above mentioned benefits so far no one has reported the deposition of copper oxide catalyst on polymer substrate especially hollow polymeric membrane configuration for photocatalysis application to bridge the existing gap this study investigated the deposition of copper oxide thin film on pvdf hfm using radio frequency rf magnetron sputtering technique with varying oxygen flow rates oxygen flow rates play as an important key in producing different phases of copper oxide that influence the photocatalysis efficiency pvdf hfm was chosen due to its versatility including outstanding thermal and chemical stability 21 22 the technical feasibility of cuxo pvdf tf hfm for bpa photocatalytic degradation in synthetic and real treated sewage wastewater was evaluated photocatalysis analysis towards real treated sewage wastewater was carried out to evaluate the capability of cu2o pvdf tf hfm as good photocatalytic membrane to be used in real wastewater treatment flexible hollow fiber pvdf membrane based thin film substrate

photocatalytic degradation of synthetic bpa and water flux performance the submerged membrane photoreactor setup fig 2 was employed for photodegradation of bpa using cuxo pvdf tf hfm a bundle of 20 strands of cuxo pvdf tf hfm with 10 cm of length were potted into pvc tube using epoxy resin e 30cl loctite corporation usa synthetic 2 5 and 10 mg l of bpa solution was transferred into a photoreactor air pump was used for providing aeration the treatment was started without light irradiation for 1 h to obtain adsorption desorption equilibrium after achieving an equilibrium the

than 4 c for preservation purposes so that analysis could be carried out all sample bottles were labelled with the station number date and time of sampling 2 7 chemical analysis of treated sewage wastewater about 9 l of unknown concentration of treated sewage wastewater was transferred into an acrylic reactor and the photocatalytic setup was same as mentioned in section 2 5 with 20 ml min sample of cu2o pvdf tf hfm air pump was used for providing aeration the treatment was started without light irradiation for 1 h to obtain adsorption desorption equilibrium after achieving an

18857 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 morphology and element mapping in sample the surface morphology of the sputtered cuxo was successfully attached onto the surface of pvdf hfm by bombardment of cuxo using process pressure inside the magnetron sputtering chamber by varying the oxygen flow rate fig s1 shows that produced thin films of sputtered cuxo with different thickness were detected and observed via fesem analysis the obtained images of deposited cuxo exhibited densely packed grains that uniformly distributed along the surface of pvdf hfm the thickness of cuxo sputtered on the polymer substrate was 194 189 184 174 and 164 nm for 10 15 20 25 and 30 ml min of the samples respectively by applying lower oxygen flow rate 10 ml min during sputtering micro cracks appeared on the surface of the sample that can be attributed to the dense and thicker deposition of cuxo although the other samples showed uniformity when o2 flow rate was increased up to 30 ml min the thickness of the sputtered material decreased when oxygen flow rate increased from 10 to 30 ml min by maintaining the target substrate distance at 14 cm by increasing the o2 flow rate the sputtered cu atoms reduced and lowered the film deposition rate 30 31 it was attributed to the higher oxygen flow rate with higher energy that reached the film surface which bombarded the cu atoms by allowing them to migrate on the surface of substrate this suggests the connection between cuxo particles and promotes the layer by layer growth 32 compared to neat pvdf no deposition of cuxo appeared and pores shown at outer surface view the uniform distribution of cuxo at the outer surface of the pvdf hfm was verified by edx analysis fig s2 the red dots referred to the presence of cu while blue dots were assigned to o the presence of high loading of cuxo as a photocatalyst on the outer surface membrane enhanced the photodegradation of target pollutants however there was also diffusion of the cuxo particles into the intermediate space of the pvdf hfm due to the single layer of porous pvdf hfm as substrate and it might easily enter through the pores as compared to dual layer pvdf hfm fig s3 compared to neat pvdf no red dots on the membrane surface and cross section shown while only little blue dots appeared due to the triethyl phosphate solvent for neat pvdf hfm fabrication the elemental composition of cuxo thin film on the pvdf hfm surface and cross section layer was shown in table 3 from the surface it indicates that the higher the oxygen flow rate the lower the cu element the same finding was also reported by jilani et al 33 who found that the cu element reduced with the rising oxygen flow rate carbon element was also analyzed to detect its atom on the pvdf hfm carbon was considered as a contaminant on the surface during the transfer of films from sputtering 34 as the pvdf hfm was a single layer the cuxo was easily diffused inside the porous pvdf hfm layer cu and o were also detected on the surface thickness of the coating layer the change in their contents is related to phase change 35 the higher the oxygen flow rate the greater the tendency for cuxo diffused inside the pores and attached inside the finger like projections it could be due to the pressure during the sputtering which pushed the cuxo into the porous pvdf hfm layer the oxygen content inside the pvdf hfm layer originated from the oxygen of the polyethylene glycol peg 400 and triethyl phosphate tep during the fabrication of pvdf hfm 3 1 2 x ray diffraction the structural analysis of the sputtered cuxo thin films on the membrane s surface was investigated using an xrd fig 3 depicts the xrd pattern of different phases of cuxo formation after being deposited on the pvdf hfm surface at varying oxygen flowrates according to the icdd 00 045 0937 crystallographic information the main diffraction of cu2o was observed at 110 plane which referred to 26 peak at all sample details 36 according to kumar et al 37 cu2o phase was detected at same peak in the xrd spectra while other cu2o peak which appeared at 36 indicated 111 diffraction plane in 10 15 and 20 ml min of the samples this reveals the formation of pure cubic crystalline phase of cu2o 38 the diffractions of single cuo were also observed at 40 4 for 25 ml min sample which implied as 111 diffraction plane while sample 30 ml min revealed cuo peaks at 36 5 40 75 56 6 and 68 15 which referred to 111 and 002 diffraction planes based on the icdd 01 071 4310 crystallographic information the same pattern was also shown by radjehi et al 31 where cuo phase emerged when the sample with 30 ml min of oxygen flow rate was applied according to jilani et al 33 cuo was also observed at 111 and 002 planes using direct current dc sputtering techniques this can be explained due to the fact that different cuo phase was successfully implemented on the surface of membrane by sputtering due to the effects of oxygen flow rate this suggested that higher o2 flow rate produced o 39 cu2o formation at lower o2 flow rate was due to insufficient o2 and less energy of o at a higher o2 flow rate the higher energy of o enhanced the reaction between cu and o of which of the cu was oxidized to cu 2 to produce pure cuo with the increasing o2 flow rate 40 the higher the oxygen flowrate the higher the intensity of the peaks which in turns increases the crystallinity of cuo thin film as a result the intense semi crystalline peak at 18 31 and 19 62 were also observed at the sputtered pvdf hfm which corresponded to the existence of pvdf 41 the scherrer eq 6 was used to calculate grain size 33 6 d kλ β cos θ where d is the crystalline size of diffraction planes and k is the constant while λ is the wavelength and β refers to a corresponding diffraction plane table 4 shows that the grain size of cu2o was calculated to be 2 11 nm in 10 ml min sample when the oxygen flow rate was increased to 15 ml min the grain size was reduced to 1 32 nm however when the oxygen flow rate was increased to 20 ml min the grain size of cu2o was again increased to 2 15 nm subsequently the grain size of sputtered cuo reduced when it started developing at 25 and 30 ml min of o2 flowrate table 3 the decreasing grain size could be due to the migration effects of constrain grain boundary which restricts the grains growth 42 the effect of oxygen flow rate in sputtering can further alter the dislocation density of sputtered cuo and cu2o number of defects in the material was calculated using eq 7 43 7 δ 1 d 2 where d is the grain size based on the scherrer equation the higher the oxygen flow rate in the sputtering the higher the dislocation density and vice versa table 3 as a result the variation of dislocation density influenced the lattice strain of the material the lattice strain of sputtered cuxo can be calculated using eq 8 8 ε βcos θ 4 where β represents a full width half maximum of diffraction peaks while θ is a diffraction angle the lattice strain of 10 ml min of the sample was 0 020 nm and increased to 0 027 nm when 15 ml min of oxygen flow rate was employed however the lattice strain dropped to 0 019 nm at 20 ml min sample after further increment of the oxygen flow rate to 25 and 30 ml min the lattice strain rose again the lattice strain of the sputtered cuo showed the same trend for dislocation density this data suggests that the higher the oxygen flow rate the lower the grain size of the sputtered cuo which improved the grain boundaries leading to the increment in strain and dislocation density furthermore this can also be explained due to the higher interstitial oxygen defects introduced into cuo film with the increasing oxygen flow rate by rising the oxygen flow rate during the sputtering the growth of the grains impeded and reduced the crystallinity of film formation resulting in a large number of grain boundaries 44 the same trend was also reported by dolai et al 45 who found that the grain size became smaller as a higher oxygen flow rate was applied using d c sputtering technique different phase of the cuxo was further analyzed by the ftir analysis 3 1 3 attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to measure vibrational bond frequency in a molecule ftir analysis of neat pvdf hfm and cuxo pvdf tf hfm at various oxygen flow rates scanned in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 at ambient temperature was conducted as given fig 4 when the pvdf hfm was sputtered with copper oxide by varying oxygen flow rate different phase of the cuxo was formed fig 4 reveals that the cu2o bond appeared at 610 and 680 cm 1 in agreement with dulma et al 46 and renuga et al 47 by increasing the oxygen flow rate to 25 and 30 ml min the band at 478 35 cm 1 466 77 cm 1 and 435 91 cm 1 revealed cuo bond 48 and the intensity of their peaks also increased as compared to neat pvdf hfm moreover the peak at 534 cm 1 found in 30 ml min sample was also identified as cuo fig 3 also displays the intense band at 1178 51 cm 1 that corresponded to cf2 bond from the pvdf while the band at 975 98 cm 1 and 759 95 cm 1 were assigned to alpha phase pvdf crystal according to kamaludin et al 24 and shi et al 47 the phase of cu2o in 20 ml min sample was further confirmed by xps analysis 3 1 4 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy the a xps survey spectra and b xps spectra of cu 2p of 20 ml min sample cu2o pvdf tf hfm was shown in fig 5 three peaks at 281 ev 528 ev and 931 ev attributable to c 1s o 1s and cu 2p were observed in the xps survey scan spectrum of 20 ml min sample cu2o pvdf tf hfm fig 5 a the existence of c 1s attributable to the pvdf hfm while o 1s and cu 2p correspond to the existence of cu2o the similar report of c 1s from pvdf can be seen from akashi and kuroda 49 fig 5 b show the cu 2p xps spectrum two peaks at 930 55 ev and 950 95 ev corresponding to the cu 2p3 2 and cu 2p1 2 peaks of cu respectively confirm the existence of cu2o in the sample moreover the existence of cu in the sample can be further confirmed by the two extra peaks at 940 55 ev and 959 05 ev which similar with previous literature 50 51 3 1 5 surface roughness the surface topography of the neat pvdf hfm and cuxo pvdf tf hfm at different oxygen flow rate were scanned at an area of 10 10 μm using afm the changes in oxygen flow rate affected the surface morphology and the roughness of the sputtered cuxo fig 6 the sputtering of cuxo onto the surface of pvdf hfm increased the roughness of the membrane at 10 ml min of oxygen flow rate it was observed that the surface roughness was 8 26 nm higher than the neat pvdf hfm 6 15 nm the average surface roughness ra was found to be 8 05 7 92 5 95 and 5 17 nm for each film deposited at 15 20 25 and 30 ml min of samples respectively the surface roughness increased after cu2o deposition at 10 ml min of oxygen however the roughness reduced once the oxygen flow rate increased jilani et al 33 found that the surface roughness of cuo film decreased on applying higher oxygen pressure this implied that a smaller grain size was produced by sputtered cuo as oxygen flow rate increased which reduced the surface roughness of the sputtered material this was also reported by dustgeer et al 52 who found the surface roughness depends on the particle size of the deposited material 3 1 6 optical band gap the direct optical bandgap of the sputtered thin films was determined by the tauc s model fig 7 the intercept of the straight line to hv axis at zero indicated the optical band gap eg the cu2o thin film deposited at 10 ml min of o2 flow rate had a band gap of 2 41 ev the thin film deposited at 15 20 and 25 ml min of o2 flow rate had a band gap of 2 34 ev 2 29 ev and 2 24 ev respectively while the band gap at 30 ml min exhibited at 2 15 ev the higher the o2 flow rate the lower the band gap this can be explained that the band gap of cuo exhibited at 25 and 30 ml min was lower than cu2o in 10 15 and 20 ml min of the samples the band gap of cu2o film was 2 3 2 5 ev while for cuo it ranged from 1 9 to 2 3 ev 20 52 therefore samples with lower band gap were suitable for visible light irradiation of the photocatalysis 3 2 water flux performance water flux study was conducted during photodegradation to observe the filtration performance of the cuxo pvdf tf hfm the water flux performance showed an improvement when higher o2 flow rate was applied during the sputtering fig 8 samples with 10 15 20 and 25 ml min achieved 16 39 20 18 26 53 and 33 99 l m2 h while sample of 30 ml min achieved the highest water flux at 37 96 l m2 h after 6 h comparable to the contact angle and porosity of the sputtered membrane table 5 shows that samples with 10 and 15 ml min exhibited a higher contact angle at 100 85 and 109 1 respectively as compared to the neat pvdf hfm it could be due to the agglomerated sputtered thin film developed as a thicker layer covered on the membrane s surface leading to hydrophobicity when increasing the o2 flow rate to 20 ml min the contact angle reduced to 67 88 this could be due to the fact that the uniform sputtered cuo thin film was successfully deposited and had a strong bonding with the pvdf hfm resulting the hydrophilic nature of membrane a lower contact angle produced good wettability hence increasing the water flux as the o2 flow rate was increased to 25 and 30 ml min the contact angle increased dramatically up to 98 82 and 104 05 due to the thinner film deposition although 25 and 30 ml min exhibited a greater contact angle the water flux showed the porosity achieved by the samples table 5 the porosity of the sputtered membrane showed that the porosity increased when higher oxygen flow rates were applied this resulted in the thickness of the sputtered cuo onto the membrane s surface the lower the thickness of cuo deposition the higher the porosity of the sputtered membrane thereby enhancing the water flux performance a higher porosity of the sputtered membrane at 30 ml min of o2 flow rate could be due to the porous cuo distribution on the surface of the pvdf hfm increasing the water flux performance pedram et al 53 reported that a flat sheet polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe sputtered pes membrane at 20 mtorr of argon pressure 50 w power of rf magnetron sputtering and 10 min of deposition achieved a lower water flux at 3 kg m2 h 3 3 photocatalytic activity of bpa in synthetic wastewater the photocatalytic degradation of bpa was carried out to evaluate the photocatalytic performance of cuxo pvdf tf hfm by using 10 15 20 25 and 30 ml min fig 9 after potting cuxo pvdf tf hfm inside pvc pipe and in photocatalytic reactor 10 mg l of bpa solution was introduced into the photoreactor the experiment started without any light irradiation for 1 h to achieve adsorption desorption equilibrium subsequently it was irradiated using visible light for 6 h about 10 ml suspension was collected periodically every 30 min and analyzed using uv vis spectrophotometer at 280 nm of wavelength fig 9 a revealed a plot for the first order kinetic model for bpa photodegradation a low removal of bpa was shown during adsorption desorption process when no visible light irradiated at the first hour while sample of 20 and 25 ml min shows no bpa reduction during the adsorption desorption process after adsorption in the dark for 60 min the reactor was exposed to visible light and the photocatalytic decomposition of bpa by cuxo pvdf tf hfm increased with the increasing reaction time fig 9 b demonstrates the apparent rate constant that the photocatalytic activity was enhanced by the hybridization of cuxo with pvdf hfm at 10 15 20 25 and 30 ml min of o2 flow rates this was attributed to the oxygen vacancy and the greater grain size that led to a higher surface to the volume ratio of the sputtered cu2o with lower thickness the lower the thickness of thin film the higher the oxygen vacancy in the cu2o pvdf tf hfm 30 to enhance the photocatalytic activity the average of kinetic rate of 25 and 30 ml min of the samples was reduced to 0 00028 min 1 and 0 000312 min 1 respectively this was due to the low adhesion of cuo attached on the pvdf hfm substrate due to which the photocatalyst leached out into the bpa solution fig 9 c indicates that after 6 h of uv irradiation bpa removal increased as a higher o2 flow rate 20 ml min was applied the cu2o pvdf tf hfm sputtered at 10 and 15 ml min of o2 flow rate degraded 30 and 31 of bpa respectively while thin film sputtered at 20 ml min sample degraded 60 of bpa at an initial bpa concentration of 10 mg l and at neutral to ph scale the efficient photocatalytic activity of the cu2o pvdf tf hfm under visible light irradiation was due to the presence of cu2o which enhanced the absorption capability that possessed a lower band gap that was suitable in visible light region the band gap energy of 20 ml min of sample was 2 29 ev which is lower than 2 34 ev and 2 41 ev for 15 and 10 ml min of samples respectively moreover 20 ml min sample shows outstanding result with 60 removal of bpa by using shorter 20 strands of 10 cm of cuxo pvdf tf hfm compared to 20 strands of 23 cm of cu2o pvdf dual layer hollow fiber membrane that achieved 75 photodegradation of bpa stated by mohamed noor et al 54 however a low bpa removal with only 9 and 11 was attained by sample deposited with 25 and 30 ml min of o2 flow rate respectively cu2o shifted its phase to cuo at higher o2 flow rate and formed cuo pvdf tf hfm during the photocatalysis color of cuo thin film was faded and it was detached from the fiber membrane and leached out into bpa solution this finding was in agreement with akbari et al 55 who found that cuo possessed a low adhesion towards substrate and that it was easy for cuo to be separated from the fiber membrane substrate and leached into the bpa solution reducing the photodegradation efficiency the cuxo detached from the fiber membrane was detected by leaching test leaching test was confirmed by the presence of cu in bpa solution using icp oes agilent 710 after 6 h of photodegradation it was found that 20 ml min of sample had no leaching of cu inside the bpa solution while 3 33 and 22 22 μg l of cu were found inside the solution after irradiation by 25 and 30 ml min of the samples rejection by filtration occurred simultaneously and the results show that the bpa reduced more than photodegradation process only the photodegradation with rejection achieve the highest 65 removal of 10 mg l bpa using cu2o pvdf tf hfm at 10 min deposition time sample after 360 min illumination with visible light small difference on the results shown by the photodegradation and photodegradation with rejection it shows that the degradation is the main key of bpa removal the photodegradation process helps to break down the bpa molecules with radicals while the rejection process by pvdf hfm helps again in the rejection of the degraded bpa table 6 shows the summary of the photocatalytic performance of photodegradation and rejection of bpa by cuxo pvdf tf hfm at different o2 flowrate an excellent degradation of bpa by the cu2o pvdf tf hfm sputtered at 20 ml min was due to the agglomeration free and a larger grain size of the cu2o sputtered on the pvdf hfm which increased the exposed surface area for light penetration and enhanced the production of e and h for photodegradation process the enhanced photocatalytic efficacy of 20 ml min of sample could be explained due to the catalytic oxidation of bpa by the cu2o with respect to the photodegradation mechanism bpa photodegradation by cu2o cuo under visible light irradiation activated the adsorbed bpa molecules to become excited molecules when the light penetrates the active site of cu2o cuo the electrons e in valence band vb excited to the conduction band cb resulting holes h in vb the e and h were involved in the redox reaction 12 while the reduction of oxygen and oxidation of water produce oh and o2 the radicals entrapped inside the organic pollutant decomposed bpa into harmless co2 and h2o fig 10 depicts that the bpa molecules were degraded by oh attack and oxidative ring opening reaction at cc bond produced aliphatic compounds followed by a mineralization into co2 and h2o this degradation pathway has also been reported by zhu et al 56 the bpa removal increased with the increasing functionality of cu2o hybridization with pvdf due to additional binding sites for adsorbing the bpa in addition the mechanism of bpa degradation can also be seen from previous literature 57 where bpa molecules adsorbed on photocatalyst go bioi bi2wo6 surface and oxidized due to photogenerated holes h the bpa molecules oxidized by oh and o2 as well degraded into non harmful by products consist of co2 and h2o 3 3 1 regeneration of cu2o pvdf tf hfm the reusability test of cu2o pvdf tf hfm was conducted for the photocatalytic study of the bpa three cycles were carried out using 20 ml min of the cu2o pvdf tf hfm between each cycle of the experiments the films were taken out by washing with distilled water fig 11 depicts the bpa degradation and rejection performance of the thin films over consecutive cycles after 3 cycles the degradation reached 42 8 lower than 60 for the first cycle of regeneration where it is about 71 33 of regeneration efficiency was achieved after 3 consecutive cycles less photodegradation activity was due to the adsorbed intermediate by products that blocked the active sites on the surface of cu2o pvdf tf hfm srinivasan et al 30 found that the photocatalytic activity was reduced after 5 cycles of irradiation with cu2o thin film while ansari et al 58 indicated a small decrease in the photocatalytic activity by the cuo gn pani thin film after 3 cycles although the degradation efficiency is reduced but the reusability of spent cu2o pvdf tf hfm was still promising the sputtered cu2o pvdf tf hfm still exhibited reasonable reusability in the bpa photodegradation after 3 consecutive cycles 3 3 2 photocatalytic efficiency at lower concentration of bpa due to the highest degradation of bpa shown by 20 ml min sample of cu2o pvdf tf hfm in synthetic wastewater therefore it is chosen to be used for photocatalysis at different bpa concentration after chemical analysis of photocatalytic activity of bpa at higher bpa concentration completed photocatalytic activity of bpa was further analyzed at lower concentration of bpa consist of 5 and 2 mg l lower bpa concentrations were chosen because lower bpa levels have been detected in malaysian rivers 59 photocatalytic degradation of 2 mg l bpa results in 70 bpa removal in synthetic wastewater as can be seen in fig 12 final rejection of the bpa sample shows that bpa reduced more than photodegradation process only and photodegradation with rejection achieve the highest 74 removal of 2 mg l bpa it indicates that the lower the bpa concentration the higher the photocatalytic performance according to the previous literature by garg et al 60 increasing the bpa concentration from 10 mg l to 50 mg l tend to reduces the photodegradation of bpa from 98 to 40 more bpa molecules were adsorbed on the catalyst s surface as the initial concentration of bpa increased occupying the active sites and thus lowering the production of hydroxyl radicals 57 58 3 4 photocatalytic efficiency in real treated sewage wastewater compared to synthetic wastewater photocatalytic degradation of bpa was further analyzed in treated sewage wastewater to evaluate the efficiency of cu2o pvdf tf hfm in real situation it exhibits excellent performance under same condition the initial concentration of bpa in treated sewage wastewater was detected in very low concentration around 0 54 μg l it reveals that the presence of edc especially bpa in treated sewage wastewater is very small after the conventional treatment before discharging it into the river bodies it can be proven by the literature reported by wee et al 63 100 detection of bpa was observed in all river water and tap water samples around malaysia small concentration of 8 24 ng l and 0 06 66 40 ng l of bpa was detected in river water and tap water respectively from this study it is found that bpa concentration in treated wastewater is higher compared to river water stated by wee et al 63 the sustainability and treatment efficiency indicate as the key matters of concern when higher edc levels detected in treated water than raw water it may be attributed to the parent compounds formation from metabolites desorption of edc during the operation lower adsorption rates of saturated absorbents dissolution of edc aggregates insufficient wastewater treatment for edc and leaching of plasticizers as well contamination occurred in the treatment pipeline 53 55 after treated with photocatalytic membrane the concentration of bpa reduced to 0 06 μg l up to 88 89 degradation of bpa while achieved after 360 min of visible light irradiation as depicted in fig 13 photodegradation and rejection result of the final sample after 360 min irradiation shows excellent result which achieves 91 0 of bpa removal the efficient performance of photocatalytic activity shown could be due to the lower amount of bpa presented inside the treated sewage wastewater compared to synthetic wastewater thus easier for bpa to be degraded in small concentration the degradation of bpa using light shows the main role in higher removal of bpa 3 5 comparison of membrane performance between this study and previous work table 7 summarizes a comparison between cuxo pvdf tf hfm and other sputtered photocatalyst compared to the previous work of kacprzynska golacka et al 67 which corresponds to the flat sheet tio2 ago polyamide membrane prepared by magnetron sputtering technique with 10 ml min o2 flow rate eliminated only 20 and 8 of methylene blue using uv light and visible light irradiation respectively after 8 h meanwhile the 20 ml min of cuxo pvdf tf hfm from this work can remove 60 and 88 89 of complex bpa demonstrating that the cuxo pvdf tf hfm has higher removal efficiency similarly the sputtering of tio2 cuo on glass substrate using 35 ml min o2 flow rate successfully eliminated 5 mg l of 94 1 rhodamine b dye after 2 h irradiation with 150 w visible light 68 although the percentage degradation of dye exhibits high efficiency however filtration cannot be done simultaneously during the photocatalytic study due to glass substrates in addition poor photocatalytic degradation of 10 of 10 mg l bpa was detected with 150 w visible light irradiation using sputtered cu tio2 film on soda lime glass substrate without any o2 flow rate application during the sputtering process 69 the poor removal of bpa was due to the lower porosity of sputtered cu tio2 hence difficult for bpa molecules to access the catalytic sites moreover the film showed more oxygen vacancies that enhance charge carrier recombination that reduce the photocatalytic process besides other study also reported on sputtering of ni zno on fluorine doped tin oxide glass without any o2 flow rate implementation during the procedure from the study 70 higher removal of 95 55 of 10 mg l of ciprofloxacin detected after 90 min irradiation with visible light the outstanding photodegradation efficiency was due to the oxygen created from electrocatalytic oxidation that can accept the electron for photocatalytic process and large electro active surface area provide large number of active sites to generate oxidants for degradation of ciprofloxacin although the removal of edc was high however the filtration process cannot be done by sputtered photocatalyst compared to this study that can simultaneously run for photocatalysis and filtration on the same time another photocatalytic study reveals 80 3 decolorization of reactive black 5 dye by photocatalytic kaolin tio2 nanorod hollow fiber ceramic membrane the higher efficiency shown by photocatalytic ceramic membrane for dye degradation however may not suitable for edc removal since larger band gap of tio2 incompatible for visible light bpa photocatalysis reaction and brittleness of ceramic material give drawback during the photocatalytic process 71 based on these findings it can be stated that the cu2o pvdf tf hfm shows promising result compared to other photocatalyst since the cu2o pvdf tf hfm can undergo 2 processes namely photocatalysis and filtration simultaneously for better water treatment applications the outstanding 20 ml min cu2o pvdf tf hfm in this study has successfully photodegrade and rejects 74 and 91 of bpa from synthetic wastewater and real treated sewage wastewater respectively moreover the pvdf hollow fiber membrane configuration gives flexible and easy operation with good reusability which can be used repetitively for the next cycle of photocatalysis process expectantly cu2o pvdf tf hfm may be a good photocatalytic membrane for degradation of small percentage of bpa detected and might be also beneficial to be applied in wastewater treatment plant in malaysia for edc removal in addition this research may be preferential to tackle the malaysian national water resources policy and national key results area that aims to provide clear directions and strategies for water resources management with collaborative governance to ensure water security and continued sustainability and ensuring public access to clean and treated water 63 4 conclusion fabrication of cuxo polyvinylidene fluoride thin film cuxo pvdf tf hollow fiber membrane was successfully achieved by radio frequency rf magnetron sputtering technique a different phase of cuxo was produced where cu2o formed when 10 15 and 20 ml min oxygen flow rate was applied during sputtering procedure while cuo formed when 25 and 30 ml min oxygen flow rate was implemented cu2o shows more active in the bisphenol a photocatalysis degradation which can be seen from the 20 ml min sample oxygen flow rate of 20 ml min is the best sputtering conditions due to the uniform cu2o deposition on pvdf hfm surfaces and producing the highest photocatalytic performance up to 74 degradation and rejection of 2 mg l bpa in synthetic wastewater while 91 in treated sewage wastewater in neutral ph condition after 360 min irradiation with visible light about 71 33 of regeneration efficiency was achieved after 3 consecutive cycles which confirms that this technique promises the good reusability with strong adhesion of cu2o photocatalyst this can be concluded that the cu2o pvdf tf hfm is capable in 2 in 1 function efficient in photocatalytic activity bpa filtration and achieve excellent water flux as well moreover it might be an effective and potentially reusable membrane for bpa photodegradation to be applied in real sewage wastewater treatment plant in malaysia for edc removal declaration of competing interest the authors

12693,the removal efficiencies of tetracycline antibiotics tcs by the ovs lfo ps driven photo fenton system were studied the effects of molecular structure on the removal efficiencies of tetracycline hydrochloride tc oxytetracycline hydrochloride otc chlortetracycline hydrochloride ctc doxycycline hydrochloride dox minocycline hydrochloride mh and metacycline hydrochloride mtc were investigated by theoretical calculations and statistical analysis it can be found that the removal efficiencies of all tcs were 87 00 96 51 90 25 87 90 90 43 92 48 and 90 30 respectively the results showed that three parameters related to molecular orbitals the energy gap δe 30 24 the highest occupied molecular orbital energy ehomo 27 70 and the vertical ionization potential vip 26 54 had relatively large contributions 84 48 in total to the removal efficiencies the reason for the high effect of δe on the removal efficiencies was subsequently explored and further verified by the removal processes of other four pollutants the degradation pattern of tcs was further studied by obtaining the fukui index f0 and f values of tcs through dft calculations according to the detection and analysis results of intermediates dft calculations can be applied to predict the degradation of pollutants with the different structure the study can provide clues to predict the potential and pathways for the oxidative degradation of pollutants with different molecular structures in wastewater treatment graphical abstract the removal efficiency of tetracycline antibiotics tcs by the lfo ps ovs driven photo fenton system and the effect of pollutants molecular structure on the removal efficiency were investigated the effects of molecular structure on the removal efficiency of tc otc ctc dox mh and mtc were investigated using theoretical calculations and statistical analysis the reason for the high effect of δe on the removal efficiency was subsequently investigated and further verified by the removal processes of lev mox di and ib the degradation pattern of tcs was further investigated by obtaining the fukui index f0 and f values of tcs through dft calculations and based on the detection of intermediates by lc ms and dft calculations the conclusion that dft calculations can be applied to predict the degradation process of contaminants with the same basic parent structure was verified unlabelled image keywords photo fenton lafeo3 dft calculation molecular structure tetracycline antibiotics data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction tetracycline antibiotics tcs mainly including tetracycline tc oxytetracycline otc and doxycycline dox are one of the most widely used antibiotics in livestock aquaculture and pharmaceutical industries 1 4 the enrichment of tc in the environment is likely to make a direct damaging effect on humans and microorganisms thus disrupt the ecological balance at the same time it intensifies the environmental pressure and inhibits the growth of microorganisms when it migrates to water 5 9 therefore it is urgent to eliminate tcs from the water environment there are several methods for elimination of antibiotics such as coagulations flocculation adsorption etc 10 13 among them advanced oxidation processes aops can rapidly produce different reactive species oh so4 o2 h 1o2 etc which have a higher standard oxygen reduction potential e0 compared to conventional oxidants of other chemical methods aops are non selective for the degradation of pollution facilitating the rapid and complete removal of complex organic pollutants from wastewater it is well known that the photo fenton method is widely used in aops 14 it allows the introduction of uv or visible light into the fenton process and promotes the generation of active species thus making the process more effective 15 16 therefore photo fenton has been widely used in the degradation of tetracycline 17 21 evidence has revealed that lafeo3 lfo as a typical perovskite is a commonly used photo fenton catalyst and has many advantages 22 the lfo is generally in the form of powder or dry gel with a small specific surface area 23 24 moreover as a catalyst lfo has obvious shortcomings such as easy agglomeration and low ovs content 25 27 researches show that one of the effective and convenient ways to solve the shortcomings of agglomeration is to load lfo on polystyrene ps with a large specific surface area ps can allow more active sites to deposit on its surface and expose them to the reaction system vaiano et al 28 investigated distributing cu zno particles on ps by the solvent casting method their findings showed that this method can increase the effective oxygen of the catalyst the increased oxygen can also be used as the oxygen source for the formation of oxygen vacancies ovs and active species 29 30 ovs can facilitate the activation of h2o2 and promote the migration of h 31 32 in addition ovs can not only enable the conversion of o2 adsorbed on ps to o2 through a single electron transfer pathway 33 but also can promote the cycle of fe3 fe2 34 which accelerates the synergy between photocatalysis and fenton so a suitable content of ovs can enhance the performance of the catalyst 35 in the heating and ultrasonic process of the sol more ovs can be generated in the lafeo3 gel and accordingly solve the problem of low ovs content 36 37 some reactive species tend to attack pollutants with specific structures or functional groups 38 40 for example the h o2 and so4 prefer to directly attack electron donating groups such as amino nh2 hydroxyl oh and unsaturated bonds 41 44 in the previous study the phenomenon that removal efficiency of tetracycline antibiotics tcs by photo fenton was much better than that of ceftriaxone sodium cro and sulfamethoxazole smx was found out 20 it is speculated that the phenomenon may be related to the basic matrix structure of the pollutants problematically limited information is available on how the molecular structures and functional groups of pollutants affect the removal efficiency and degradation rate constants k meanwhile zhi et al 45 studied the effect of several molecular parameters on degradation efficiency which well reflected the effect of specific functional groups on degradation efficiency and also obtained certain rules however the specific contribution of those parameters to the degradation efficiency could not be derived and few parameters could not reflect a commonality of whether pollutants with the same parent structure are susceptible to degradation the properties of the parent structure should also be explored in depth as such the degradation characteristics of tcs and the degradation patterns between tcs and other organic pollutants were further investigated the statistical analysis was applied to derive the corresponding contributions of several commonly used parameters to the pollutants degradation efficiency these parameters were related to the molecular structure energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital ehomo energy gap δe elumo ehomo vertical ionization potential vip vertical electron affinity energy vea and electrophilic index e 19 it was verified whether the similar parts of tcs are responsible for their easy degradation by the photo fenton system the matrix structure and the reactivity of the matrix structure based on density functional theory dft and fukui index f0 and f values calculation the degradation pathway of tc was proposed as well the application of ovs enriched lafeo3 depositing on ps for the photo fenton degradation of tcs the prediction of the degradation pattern of tcs and the effect of molecular structure on the removal efficiency over this technology have not been reported in this study the performance of ovs lfo ps as the visible light fenton catalyst to degrade tcs was explored the effect of molecular structure on degradation performance was also investigated by regression analysis and dft calculations the degradation mechanism was analyzed in detail according to the results of esr tests and the accuracy of obtaining the organic pollutants degradation pathways by the means of predicted reaction sites was verified by detection results of liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms the toxicity of tc and its intermediates was derived by the means of quantitative structure activity relationship qsar the purpose of this study is to reveal the degradation mechanisms and rules of tcs by ovs lfo ps which will provide a completely new strategy for predict the degradation performance of pollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials la no3 3 6h2o 99 99 fecl3 6h2o 99 00 c6h8o7 h2o ca 99 50 na2c2o4 99 96 c6h4o2 pbq 99 00 c ch3 3oh

the ovs lfo ps preparation process by the methods of ultrasound assisted sol gel and hydrothermal is shown in fig s2 2 3 instruments and characterization tu 1901 type uv vis spectrophotometer beijing

degradation experiments were performed using an xpa 7 photocatalytic reactor equipped with a xenon lamp with a 420 nm cut off filter all experiments were repeated twice and the experimental data were averaged the detailed process of degradation experiments is put in text s3 2 5 theoretical calculations and statistical analysis the geometry of the tcs was optimized under density functional theory dft by gaussian 09 w software all of the pollutant molecules are optimized and calculated at the b3lyp 6 31 g level of theory the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo highest occupied molecular orbital homo natural populated analysis npa charge distributions vertical ionization potential vertical electron affinity and electrophilic index of tcs were got by multiwfn ver 3 8 and gaussian ver

vertical ionization potential vertical electron affinity and electrophilic index obtained by dft calculations the contour surface maps of homo lumo and fukui index f0 and f were visualized and optimized over visual molecular dynamics vmd software the toxicity of pollutants and degradation intermediates was evaluated using qsar based consistency over software of toxicity estimation software tool t e s t 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations the description relating to structure and morphology was presented in detail in our previous studies 20 form table s2 ovs lfo ps is more favorable for the deposition and exposure of active sites because its specific surface area and average pore size are much larger than those of pure lfo consequently the increase of its specific surface area greatly increases the possibility of oxygen vacancies and oxygen content adsorbed on the surface 46 47 notably a lot of surface hydroxyl groups on the surface of the catalyst were found which facilitates the trapping of photogenerated electrons and holes thus they contribute to photocatalytic activity 48 49 the results of uv vis drs are shown in text s4 and fig s3 the bandgap energy of lfo and ovs lfo ps are 2 86 ev and 2 37 ev respectively the binding energy analysis for each fine spectrum has been described in previous studies 20 it is important to highlight here that the percentage of ovs o2 o of the whole oxygen species in lfo and lfo ps was substantially increased after sonication from 10 06 and 35 92 without sonication to 85 29 and 75 89 after the sonication respectively according to the quantitative data of xps the weight percentages of lfo 0 29 and ps 99 71 in the lfo ps ovs were obtained the e vb binding energy of valence band of lfo and ovs lfo ps is 2 06 ev and 2 20 ev respectively the e cb binding energy of conduction band of lfo and ovs lfo ps is 0 31 ev and 0 66 ev respectively 20 3 2 insights into the structure varied degradation efficiency 3 2 1 comparison of tcs removal efficiency by ovs lfo ps driven photo fenton to explore the degradation performance of tetracycline antibiotics tcs by ovs lfo ps driven photo fenton process we carried out the experiments under the same conditions ch2o2 3 mmol l 1 dosage 0 60 g l 1 ctcs 0 03 mmol l 1 ph 4 45 the results are showed in fig 1 for fig 1 a b the removal efficiencies and degradation rate constant k of the lfo ps ovs photo fenton system for tc otc ctc dox mh and mtc were 96 51 and 0 0175 min 1 90 25 and 0 0146 min 1 87 90 and 0 0130 min 1 90 43 and 0 0138 min 1 92 48 and 0 0174 min 1 90 30 and 0 0157 min 1 respectively the removal efficiency of all tcs was 87 00 indicating that the tcs containing tetraphenyl skeleton are degraded easily by the photo fenton system 50 among them the removal efficiency of otc and ctc was relatively low 90 25 and 87 90 the reasons may be that the molecular structure of ctc contains an electron withdrawing group cl compared to other tcs 45 for otc no obvious inhibitory factor was found in its structure this may require further exploration through other methods and tools such as theoretical calculation and statistics it can be supposed that tetraphenyl may be degraded more easily by the lfo ps ovs driven photo fenton system 3 2 2 statistical methods combined with theoretical calculations as mentioned above some of the structural characteristics of the contaminants may not valid to distinguish the removal efficiency of molecules with similar structures theoretical calculations are therefore a convincible tool for achieving the goal of an in depth understanding of the effect of the structure of organic pollutants on removal efficiency the differences in the degradation reactions of these pollutants with distinct molecular structures were also analyzed first based on structural properties we performed dft calculations by gaussian 09 w and multiwfn software to obtain each parameter of each compound including the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital ehomo energy gap δe elumo ehomo vertical ionization potential vip vertical electron affinity vea and electrophilic index e 51 54 the ehomo denotes the electrophilic reactivity δe denotes the stability of the compound and vip is involved to the reactivity for compounds in general electron donating groups can reduce the vip of pollutants while the electron withdrawing group can increase the vip of pollutants the magnitude of the vea reflects the difficulty of obtaining electrons for atoms 55 56 the more negative the electron affinity is the stronger the ability of the atom to acquire electrons is the e stands for electrophilicity and a higher value indicates a more electrophilic molecule subsequently a relative contribution analysis over spss software was conducted with the above parameters as input parameters the consequences of the statistical analysis after linear regression are illustrated in fig 2 the structural parameters of tcs and other pollutant molecules are in table s3 as showed in fig 2 a δe ehomo and vip had the relatively large contributions to k among these independent variables e and vea had a smaller effect 15 52 in total on the dependent variable k this showed that the degree of influence of the orbit related parameters on k 84 48 in total was much higher than that of other parameters next the combined effect of three parameters related to molecular orbitals δe ehomo and vip on k was further analyzed in fig 2 b the red region represented higher k lower δe and vip and higher ehomo while purple region represented the lower k it was clear that the physicochemical properties of the parent and substituents can influence the reaction of organic compounds by affecting ehomo δe and vip in general pollutants with higher ehomo lower δe and lower vip were more likely to be attacked by active species h o2 oh etc 45 the specific contribution of these parameters to the degradation efficiency was obtained through the combination of statistical analysis and theoretical calculations which seems to be more convincing the removal efficiency and k 96 51 and 0 0175 min 1 of tetracycline were higher than other tcs in this study this was because the degradation of pollutant not only related to its structure but also its orbit related parameters the higher degradation efficiency of tc was due to its more pronounced parametric advantage δe 0 1361 hartree ehomo 0 2117 hartree vip 0 2685 hartree the δe and electron density homo and lumo are important stability indicators in degradation the two parameters can be used in describing the impact of different molecular structures for tcs degradation performance over ovs lfo ps driven photo fenton process 19 in fig 2 a the contribution of δe and ehomo to k was 30 24 and 27 70 respectively table 1 illustrated the homo and lumo distributions of tcs based on the fed frontier electron density the h oh and o2 in the photo fenton system prefer to strike the sites with the higher charge densities 57 there are some distinctions in the distribution of homo and lumo for tcs overall there is a uniform electron distribution in the aromatic part of the molecule homo while the lumo of tcs is mainly distributed on the ordinary six membered ring on the right similarities in these electron distributions lead to some regularity in the reactivity of the molecules and their product distributions then the relationship of ehomo and elumo with k was explored as shown in fig 3 elumo is inversely proportional to k while ehomo is proportional to k interestingly for all tcs the linear correlation between ehomo and k is better r2 0 834 than elumo r2 0 603 it may suggest that the pollutants with high ehomo are easy to be eliminated by ros 45 it was found that δe has a good linear relationship with k r2 0 827 therefore the effect of δe on the removal efficiency of tcs was further investigated furthermore in the frontier molecular orbital fmo theory the smaller the δe values is the greater the reactivity of the molecules is δe largely affects the effectiveness of the photo fenton reaction 58 60 table 1 and fig 3 illustrated that ctc had the largest δe 0 1588 the smallest was tc the degradation rate of tc was the fastest k 0 0175 min 1 and the degradation rate of ctc was the slowest k 0 0130 min 1 these results further elaborated that the reactivity and stability of tcs are related to their δe and the degradation efficiency of tcs was inversely proportional to δe the differences in δe between tcs mainly originate from the different substituents on the tetraphenyl group which caused the changes in the distribution of homo and lumo of tcs molecules at the same time substituents can cause significant alterations in the relevant parameters of molecular orbitals this leads to differences in the degradation efficiency of tcs with similar structures 3 2 3 applicability of molecular orbital related parameters to verify the conclusions obtained above concerning the influence of parameters of molecular orbitals on the removal efficiency the photo fenton is applied to the removal of other types of organic pollutants levofloxacin hydrochloride lev moxifloxacin hydrochloride mox ibuprofen ib and diclofenac di among them the e of lev and mox is close to that of tcs while the e of di and ib is larger than that of tcs the results of the verification experiments are illustrated in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 a b the removal efficiency and k of lev and mox degradation over ovs lfo ps driven photo fenton were 89 97 and 0 136 min 1 88 85 and 0 0134 min 1 respectively those of di and ib were 70 38 and 0 0096 min 1 65 98 and 0 0080 min 1 respectively the e of lev and mox 0 1537 and 0 1566 were close to that of ctc 0 1588 while k 0 0146 min 1 and 0 0144 min 1 were also close to that of ctc k 0 0130 min 1 in addition we found a better linear relationship between δe and k r2 0 932 fig 5 the above result was further verified that the lower the δe value is the higher the values of corresponding removal efficiency and k are this could be used to predict the removal efficiency of pollutants with different e in the photo fenton system 3 3 degradation mechanism in order to determine the active species in the advanced oxidation process photo fenton the esr tests were conducted 61 the esr tests at 0 min black and 10 min of light were performed the study also used esr to demonstrate the presence of ovs the results of esr tests were shown in fig 6 for fig 6 a c the characteristic peaks of h oh and o2 had a great increase in the intensity after turning on the light 10 min these results indicated that those active species h oh and o2 are produced in the degradation system 20 from fig 6 d higher ovs intensity was detected after ultrasound assisted treatment of lfo proving that the ovs content of the catalyst was significantly elevated after ultrasound treatment the mechanism of tcs degradation was obtained over ovs lfo ps driven photo fenton according to the results of esr tests as shown in fig 7 the whole degradation process includes the generation and separation of electron hole pairs the circulation of e the generation of various active species and the degradation of target pollutants tcs and other pollutants by active species to evaluate the applicability of visible light fenton degradation of tc studied in this paper it was compared with other published methods table 2 the ovs lfo ps driven photo fenton has the advantage of high tc and toc removal efficiency 3 4 regularity of tcs degradation to further explore the pattern of degradation of tcs by the photo fenton and the change of molecular structures of tcs during the degradation process the dft calculations were carried out the sites with high f0 and f values are more reactive because they are vulnerable to free radicals and electrophiles respectively 38 68 70 thereby the fukui index f0 and f values for the npa natural population analysis charge distribution on the basis of tcs molecules were calculated and illustrated in fig 9 a b and table s4 9 all isovalues 0 0015 a u meanwhile the optimized structures of tcs with the corresponding reaction sites to further infer the degradation pattern of tcs were labelled and showed in fig 8 and fig s4 9 from fig 8 and fig s4 9 the useful information that their reactive sites have a good regularity by labelling the structures of the tcs molecules was obtained firstly there are more sites were attached on both the benzene ring part and the backbone of the tetraphenyl group and secondly more sites also appear on the functional groups connected to the backbone chain of the tetraphenyl group such as the stronger electron donating functional groups like oh this marks that the tetraphenyl and the functional groups linked to tetraphenyl especially the oxygen containing functional groups were more vulnerable to be attacked in addition the purpose of the combination of dft calculations and lc ms detection is to get the degradation pathways of representative tcs tc fig s10 shows the total ion flow diagram obtained by lc ms in positive ion mode and the structures of intermediates are presented in table s10 therefore three possible degradation pathways of tc are proposed based on intermediate identification and attack site prediction as showed in fig 9 c pathway 1 in the early stages of the reaction the atoms with larger f0 values 1c 7c and 8c of tc 0 0333 0 0366 and 0 0320 respectively and larger f values 0 0350 0 0398 and 0 0454 respectively could be attacked by h and electrophilic species this led to the remove of the amino hydroxyl and methyl groups and the formation of f1 m z 410 21 by the breakage of the benzene ring and second ring the first ring from the left is the benzene ring 71 thereafter the atoms with larger f0 values 2c 3c 5c and 6c of tc 0 0223 0 0141 0 0098 and 0 0178 respectively and larger f values 0 0245 0 0141 0 0115 and 0 0226 respectively were preferred to be attacked by o2 oh and h leading to the removal of whole benzene ring to form f2 m z 318 18 subsequently hydroxyl removal and chain scission reactions occurred which generated f3 m z 274 32 pathway 2 ros attacked 14c 16c and 19o atoms of tc because they had larger f0 values 0 0440 0 0469 and 0 1049 respectively at the same time 19o with larger f values 0 1587 of tc this led to the formation of g1 m z 361 19 by the breakage of the third and fourth ring subsequently the atoms 12c and 15c with larger f0 values 0 0096 and 0 0187 were attacked leading to the rupture of the third ring to form g2 m z 204 08 and g3 m z 60 06 pathway 3 early in the degradation ros tended to attack on the atoms 20o 25n and 27n with larger f0 values 0 0469 0 0221 and 0 0509 respectively and the atoms 20o and 25n with larger f values 0 0428 and 0 0651 respectively and the bond cn with low energy 72 resulting in the loss of n methyl nh2 hydroxyl and co of the second ring the tc molecule therefore the tc conversed to h1 m z 360 16 73 subsequently ros attacked 18c 23o 24c 30c and 31o atoms due to their larger f0 values 0 0140 0 0132 0 0221 0 0114 and 0 0232 respectively and larger f values 0 0163 0 0159 0 0245 0 0167 and 0 0192 respectively this led to the formation of h2 m z 290 15 subsequently the tetraphenyl group was destroyed to form h3 m z 230 17 the intermediates were finally mineralized to small molecular co2 and h2o through fig 9 the tc intermediates obtained by the predicted active sites are in good agreement with the detection results of lc ms in other words based on the intermediates detected by lc ms and dft calculations it can be concluded that dft calculations can be applied to predict the degradation process of contaminants with the same basic parent structure therefore the degradation process of tcs and other organic pollutants predicted by dft calculations has some significance for reference fig 10 a b shows that the lc50 value defined as very toxic below 1 mg l 1 0 mg l 1 10 mg l 1 defined as toxic and 10 mg l 1 defined as harmful for tc corresponding to fathead minnow was 0 0664 mg l 1 which was defined as very toxic compounds 74 and the lc50 value for daphnia magna defined as toxic for 0 10 mg l 1 and harmful for 10 mg l 1 was 1 49 mg l 1 which was defined as toxic compounds the results showed that only f1 f2 g1 h1 and h3 remained highly toxic and all other intermediates showed higher ld50 values than tc for fathead minnow while all intermediates showed higher lc50 values than tc for daphnia magna meanwhile only f1 g1 and h1 remained toxic the ld50 values of the final products were higher indicating the generation of less toxic intermediates fig 10 c d shows that tc is developmental toxicant and mutagenicity positive however after photo fenton treatment two developmentally non toxic and six mutagenic negative tc intermediates were produced overall the development toxicity and mutagenicity of tc were obviously reduced after the treatment theoretically the conversion and destruction of carboxyl hydroxyl and tetraphenyl groups weakened the antibacterial activity of tc in previous study it was found that a nonlinear relationship between antibiotic removal efficiency and residual antimicrobial activity suggesting that the early formed intermediates retain a measurable degree of antimicrobial activity 75 based on the above toxicity prediction results although some of the intermediates are still toxic the final products exhibit weak antibacterial properties and are less harmful to the environment 76 4 conclusion in this study lafeo3 ps enriched with ovs was successfully synthesized the characterization results illustrated that the sonication process brings more ovs to the lfo theoretical calculations and statistical analysis showed that δe ehomo and vip were important factors that affected the removal efficiency of tcs in general the higher removal efficiency of tcs was observed for low δe high ehomo and low vip crucially other pollutants were successfully used to verify the conclusion that the lower the δe was the higher the removal efficiencies were therefore the probability of degradation for pollutants can be predicted by various parameters about molecular structures the regularity of the reaction sites was analyzed using dft calculations based on the predicted reaction sites obtained from dft calculations three possible tc degradation pathways were proposed including hydroxylation n dealkylation dehydration reaction and ring opening reaction this has been validated by degradation intermediates identified by lc ms also dft calculations can be used to predict the degradation process of pollutants with the same basic parent structure after degradation treatment the overall toxicity of tc was obviously reduced this study could provide some insights into the ovs lfo ps driven photo fenton degradation of organic pollutants with different molecular structures and provide a basis for improving their practical application in wastewater treatment credit authorship contribution statement xiaodong ge conceptualization

12693,the removal efficiencies of tetracycline antibiotics tcs by the ovs lfo ps driven photo fenton system were studied the effects of molecular structure on the removal efficiencies of tetracycline hydrochloride tc oxytetracycline hydrochloride otc chlortetracycline hydrochloride ctc doxycycline hydrochloride dox minocycline hydrochloride mh and metacycline hydrochloride mtc were investigated by theoretical calculations and statistical analysis it can be found that the removal efficiencies of all tcs were 87 00 96 51 90 25 87 90 90 43 92 48 and 90 30 respectively the results showed that three parameters related to molecular orbitals the energy gap δe 30 24 the highest occupied molecular orbital energy ehomo 27 70 and the vertical ionization potential vip 26 54 had relatively large contributions 84 48 in total to the removal efficiencies the reason for the high effect of δe on the removal efficiencies was subsequently explored and further verified by the removal processes of other four pollutants the degradation pattern of tcs was further studied by obtaining the fukui index f0 and f values of tcs through dft calculations according to the detection and analysis results of intermediates dft calculations can be applied to predict the degradation of pollutants with the different structure the study can provide clues to predict the potential and pathways for the oxidative degradation of pollutants with different molecular structures in wastewater treatment graphical abstract the removal efficiency of tetracycline antibiotics tcs by the lfo ps ovs driven photo fenton system and the effect of pollutants molecular structure on the removal efficiency were investigated the effects of molecular structure on the removal efficiency of tc otc ctc dox mh and mtc were investigated using theoretical calculations and statistical analysis the reason for the high effect of δe on the removal efficiency was subsequently investigated and further verified by the removal processes of lev mox di and ib the degradation pattern of tcs was further investigated by obtaining the fukui index f0 and f values of tcs through dft calculations and based on the detection of intermediates by lc ms and dft calculations the conclusion that dft calculations can be applied to predict the degradation process of contaminants with the same basic parent structure was verified unlabelled image keywords photo fenton lafeo3 dft calculation molecular structure tetracycline antibiotics data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction tetracycline antibiotics tcs mainly including tetracycline tc oxytetracycline otc and doxycycline dox are one of the most widely used antibiotics in livestock aquaculture and pharmaceutical industries 1 4 the enrichment of tc in the environment is likely to make a direct damaging effect on humans and microorganisms thus disrupt the ecological balance at the same time it intensifies the environmental pressure and inhibits the growth of microorganisms when it migrates to water 5 9 therefore it is urgent to eliminate tcs from the water environment there are several methods for elimination of antibiotics such as coagulations flocculation adsorption etc 10 13 among them advanced oxidation processes aops can rapidly produce different reactive species oh so4 o2 h 1o2 etc which have a higher standard oxygen reduction potential e0 compared to conventional oxidants of other chemical methods aops are non selective for the degradation of pollution facilitating the rapid and complete removal of complex organic pollutants from wastewater it is well known that the photo fenton method is widely used in aops 14 it allows the introduction of uv or visible light into the fenton process and promotes the generation of active species thus making the process more effective 15 16 therefore photo fenton has been widely used in the degradation of tetracycline 17 21 evidence has revealed that lafeo3 lfo as a typical perovskite is a commonly used photo fenton catalyst and has many advantages 22 the lfo is generally in the form of powder or dry gel with a small specific surface area 23 24 moreover as a catalyst lfo has obvious shortcomings such as easy agglomeration and low ovs content 25 27 researches show that one of the effective and convenient ways to solve the shortcomings of agglomeration is to load lfo on polystyrene ps with a large specific surface area ps can allow more active sites to deposit on its surface and expose them to the reaction system vaiano et al 28 investigated distributing cu zno particles on ps by the solvent casting method their findings showed that this method can increase the effective oxygen of the catalyst the increased oxygen can also be used as the oxygen source for the formation of oxygen vacancies ovs and active species 29 30 ovs can facilitate the activation of h2o2 and promote the migration of h 31 32 in addition ovs can not only enable the conversion of o2 adsorbed on ps to o2 through a single electron transfer pathway 33 but also can promote the cycle of fe3 fe2 34 which accelerates the synergy between photocatalysis and fenton so a suitable content of ovs can enhance the performance of the catalyst 35 in the heating and ultrasonic process of the sol more ovs can be generated in the lafeo3 gel and accordingly solve the problem of low ovs content 36 37 some reactive species tend to attack pollutants with specific structures or functional groups 38 40 for example the h o2 and so4 prefer to directly attack electron donating groups such as amino nh2 hydroxyl oh and unsaturated bonds 41 44 in the previous study the phenomenon that removal efficiency of tetracycline antibiotics tcs by photo fenton was much better than that of ceftriaxone sodium cro and sulfamethoxazole smx was found out 20 it is speculated that the phenomenon may be related to the basic matrix structure of the pollutants problematically limited information is available on how the molecular structures and functional groups of pollutants affect the removal efficiency and degradation rate constants k meanwhile zhi et al 45 studied the effect of several molecular parameters on degradation efficiency which well reflected the effect of specific functional groups on degradation efficiency and also obtained certain rules however the specific contribution of those parameters to the degradation efficiency could not be derived and few parameters could not reflect a commonality of whether pollutants with the same parent structure are susceptible to degradation the properties of the parent structure should also be explored in depth as such the degradation characteristics of tcs and the degradation patterns between tcs and other organic pollutants were further investigated the statistical analysis was applied to derive the corresponding contributions of several commonly used parameters to the pollutants degradation efficiency these parameters were related to the molecular structure energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital ehomo energy gap δe elumo ehomo vertical ionization potential vip vertical electron affinity energy vea and electrophilic index e 19 it was verified whether the similar parts of tcs are responsible for their easy degradation by the photo fenton system the matrix structure and the reactivity of the matrix structure based on density functional theory dft and fukui index f0 and f values calculation the degradation pathway of tc was proposed as well the application of ovs enriched lafeo3 depositing on ps for the photo fenton degradation of tcs the prediction of the degradation pattern of tcs and the effect of molecular structure on the removal efficiency over this technology have not been reported in this study the performance of ovs lfo ps as the visible light fenton catalyst to degrade tcs was explored the effect of molecular structure on degradation performance was also investigated by regression analysis and dft calculations the degradation mechanism was analyzed in detail according to the results of esr tests and the accuracy of obtaining the organic pollutants degradation pathways by the means of predicted reaction sites was verified by detection results of liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms the toxicity of tc and its intermediates was derived by the means of quantitative structure activity relationship qsar the purpose of this study is to reveal the degradation mechanisms and rules of tcs by ovs lfo ps which will provide a completely new strategy for predict the degradation performance of pollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials la no3 3 6h2o 99 99 fecl3 6h2o 99 00 c6h8o7 h2o ca 99 50 na2c2o4 99 96 c6h4o2 pbq 99 00 c ch3 3oh

the ovs lfo ps preparation process by the methods of ultrasound assisted sol gel and hydrothermal is shown in fig s2 2 3 instruments and characterization tu 1901 type uv vis spectrophotometer beijing

degradation experiments were performed using an xpa 7 photocatalytic reactor equipped with a xenon lamp with a 420 nm cut off filter all experiments were repeated twice and the experimental data were averaged the detailed process of degradation experiments is put in text s3 2 5 theoretical calculations and statistical analysis the geometry of the tcs was optimized under density functional theory dft by gaussian 09 w software all of the pollutant molecules are optimized and calculated at the b3lyp 6 31 g level of theory the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo highest occupied molecular orbital homo natural populated analysis npa charge distributions vertical ionization potential vertical electron affinity and electrophilic index of tcs were got by multiwfn ver 3 8 and gaussian ver

vertical ionization potential vertical electron affinity and electrophilic index obtained by dft calculations the contour surface maps of homo lumo and fukui index f0 and f were visualized and optimized over visual molecular dynamics vmd software the toxicity of pollutants and degradation intermediates was evaluated using qsar based consistency over software of toxicity estimation software tool t e s t 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations the description relating to structure and morphology was presented in detail in our previous studies 20 form table s2 ovs lfo ps is more favorable for the deposition and exposure of active sites because its specific surface area and average pore size are much larger than those of pure lfo consequently the increase of its specific surface area greatly increases the possibility of oxygen vacancies and oxygen content adsorbed on the surface 46 47 notably a lot of surface hydroxyl groups on the surface of the catalyst were found which facilitates the trapping of photogenerated electrons and holes thus they contribute to photocatalytic activity 48 49 the results of uv vis drs are shown in text s4 and fig s3 the bandgap energy of lfo and ovs lfo ps are 2 86 ev and 2 37 ev respectively the binding energy analysis for each fine spectrum has been described in previous studies 20 it is important to highlight here that the percentage of ovs o2 o of the whole oxygen species in lfo and lfo ps was substantially increased after sonication from 10 06 and 35 92 without sonication to 85 29 and 75 89 after the sonication respectively according to the quantitative data of xps the weight percentages of lfo 0 29 and ps 99 71 in the lfo ps ovs were obtained the e vb binding energy of valence band of lfo and ovs lfo ps is 2 06 ev and 2 20 ev respectively the e cb binding energy of conduction band of lfo and ovs lfo ps is 0 31 ev and 0 66 ev respectively 20 3 2 insights into the structure varied degradation efficiency 3 2 1 comparison of tcs removal efficiency by ovs lfo ps driven photo fenton to explore the degradation performance of tetracycline antibiotics tcs by ovs lfo ps driven photo fenton process we carried out the experiments under the same conditions ch2o2 3 mmol l 1 dosage 0 60 g l 1 ctcs 0 03 mmol l 1 ph 4 45 the results are showed in fig 1 for fig 1 a b the removal efficiencies and degradation rate constant k of the lfo ps ovs photo fenton system for tc otc ctc dox mh and mtc were 96 51 and 0 0175 min 1 90 25 and 0 0146 min 1 87 90 and 0 0130 min 1 90 43 and 0 0138 min 1 92 48 and 0 0174 min 1 90 30 and 0 0157 min 1 respectively the removal efficiency of all tcs was 87 00 indicating that the tcs containing tetraphenyl skeleton are degraded easily by the photo fenton system 50 among them the removal efficiency of otc and ctc was relatively low 90 25 and 87 90 the reasons may be that the molecular structure of ctc contains an electron withdrawing group cl compared to other tcs 45 for otc no obvious inhibitory factor was found in its structure this may require further exploration through other methods and tools such as theoretical calculation and statistics it can be supposed that tetraphenyl may be degraded more easily by the lfo ps ovs driven photo fenton system 3 2 2 statistical methods combined with theoretical calculations as mentioned above some of the structural characteristics of the contaminants may not valid to distinguish the removal efficiency of molecules with similar structures theoretical calculations are therefore a convincible tool for achieving the goal of an in depth understanding of the effect of the structure of organic pollutants on removal efficiency the differences in the degradation reactions of these pollutants with distinct molecular structures were also analyzed first based on structural properties we performed dft calculations by gaussian 09 w and multiwfn software to obtain each parameter of each compound including the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital ehomo energy gap δe elumo ehomo vertical ionization potential vip vertical electron affinity vea and electrophilic index e 51 54 the ehomo denotes the electrophilic reactivity δe denotes the stability of the compound and vip is involved to the reactivity for compounds in general electron donating groups can reduce the vip of pollutants while the electron withdrawing group can increase the vip of pollutants the magnitude of the vea reflects the difficulty of obtaining electrons for atoms 55 56 the more negative the electron affinity is the stronger the ability of the atom to acquire electrons is the e stands for electrophilicity and a higher value indicates a more electrophilic molecule subsequently a relative contribution analysis over spss software was conducted with the above parameters as input parameters the consequences of the statistical analysis after linear regression are illustrated in fig 2 the structural parameters of tcs and other pollutant molecules are in table s3 as showed in fig 2 a δe ehomo and vip had the relatively large contributions to k among these independent variables e and vea had a smaller effect 15 52 in total on the dependent variable k this showed that the degree of influence of the orbit related parameters on k 84 48 in total was much higher than that of other parameters next the combined effect of three parameters related to molecular orbitals δe ehomo and vip on k was further analyzed in fig 2 b the red region represented higher k lower δe and vip and higher ehomo while purple region represented the lower k it was clear that the physicochemical properties of the parent and substituents can influence the reaction of organic compounds by affecting ehomo δe and vip in general pollutants with higher ehomo lower δe and lower vip were more likely to be attacked by active species h o2 oh etc 45 the specific contribution of these parameters to the degradation efficiency was obtained through the combination of statistical analysis and theoretical calculations which seems to be more convincing the removal efficiency and k 96 51 and 0 0175 min 1 of tetracycline were higher than other tcs in this study this was because the degradation of pollutant not only related to its structure but also its orbit related parameters the higher degradation efficiency of tc was due to its more pronounced parametric advantage δe 0 1361 hartree ehomo 0 2117 hartree vip 0 2685 hartree the δe and electron density homo and lumo are important stability indicators in degradation the two parameters can be used in describing the impact of different molecular structures for tcs degradation performance over ovs lfo ps driven photo fenton process 19 in fig 2 a the contribution of δe and ehomo to k was 30 24 and 27 70 respectively table 1 illustrated the homo and lumo distributions of tcs based on the fed frontier electron density the h oh and o2 in the photo fenton system prefer to strike the sites with the higher charge densities 57 there are some distinctions in the distribution of homo and lumo for tcs overall there is a uniform electron distribution in the aromatic part of the molecule homo while the lumo of tcs is mainly distributed on the ordinary six membered ring on the right similarities in these electron distributions lead to some regularity in the reactivity of the molecules and their product distributions then the relationship of ehomo and elumo with k was explored as shown in fig 3 elumo is inversely proportional to k while ehomo is proportional to k interestingly for all tcs the linear correlation between ehomo and k is better r2 0 834 than elumo r2 0 603 it may suggest that the pollutants with high ehomo are easy to be eliminated by ros 45 it was found that δe has a good linear relationship with k r2 0 827 therefore the effect of δe on the removal efficiency of tcs was further investigated furthermore in the frontier molecular orbital fmo theory the smaller the δe values is the greater the reactivity of the molecules is δe largely affects the effectiveness of the photo fenton reaction 58 60 table 1 and fig 3 illustrated that ctc had the largest δe 0 1588 the smallest was tc the degradation rate of tc was the fastest k 0 0175 min 1 and the degradation rate of ctc was the slowest k 0 0130 min 1 these results further elaborated that the reactivity and stability of tcs are related to their δe and the degradation efficiency of tcs was inversely proportional to δe the differences in δe between tcs mainly originate from the different substituents on the tetraphenyl group which caused the changes in the distribution of homo and lumo of tcs molecules at the same time substituents can cause significant alterations in the relevant parameters of molecular orbitals this leads to differences in the degradation efficiency of tcs with similar structures 3 2 3 applicability of molecular orbital related parameters to verify the conclusions obtained above concerning the influence of parameters of molecular orbitals on the removal efficiency the photo fenton is applied to the removal of other types of organic pollutants levofloxacin hydrochloride lev moxifloxacin hydrochloride mox ibuprofen ib and diclofenac di among them the e of lev and mox is close to that of tcs while the e of di and ib is larger than that of tcs the results of the verification experiments are illustrated in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 a b the removal efficiency and k of lev and mox degradation over ovs lfo ps driven photo fenton were 89 97 and 0 136 min 1 88 85 and 0 0134 min 1 respectively those of di and ib were 70 38 and 0 0096 min 1 65 98 and 0 0080 min 1 respectively the e of lev and mox 0 1537 and 0 1566 were close to that of ctc 0 1588 while k 0 0146 min 1 and 0 0144 min 1 were also close to that of ctc k 0 0130 min 1 in addition we found a better linear relationship between δe and k r2 0 932 fig 5 the above result was further verified that the lower the δe value is the higher the values of corresponding removal efficiency and k are this could be used to predict the removal efficiency of pollutants with different e in the photo fenton system 3 3 degradation mechanism in order to determine the active species in the advanced oxidation process photo fenton the esr tests were conducted 61 the esr tests at 0 min black and 10 min of light were performed the study also used esr to demonstrate the presence of ovs the results of esr tests were shown in fig 6 for fig 6 a c the characteristic peaks of h oh and o2 had a great increase in the intensity after turning on the light 10 min these results indicated that those active species h oh and o2 are produced in the degradation system 20 from fig 6 d higher ovs intensity was detected after ultrasound assisted treatment of lfo proving that the ovs content of the catalyst was significantly elevated after ultrasound treatment the mechanism of tcs degradation was obtained over ovs lfo ps driven photo fenton according to the results of esr tests as shown in fig 7 the whole degradation process includes the generation and separation of electron hole pairs the circulation of e the generation of various active species and the degradation of target pollutants tcs and other pollutants by active species to evaluate the applicability of visible light fenton degradation of tc studied in this paper it was compared with other published methods table 2 the ovs lfo ps driven photo fenton has the advantage of high tc and toc removal efficiency 3 4 regularity of tcs degradation to further explore the pattern of degradation of tcs by the photo fenton and the change of molecular structures of tcs during the degradation process the dft calculations were carried out the sites with high f0 and f values are more reactive because they are vulnerable to free radicals and electrophiles respectively 38 68 70 thereby the fukui index f0 and f values for the npa natural population analysis charge distribution on the basis of tcs molecules were calculated and illustrated in fig 9 a b and table s4 9 all isovalues 0 0015 a u meanwhile the optimized structures of tcs with the corresponding reaction sites to further infer the degradation pattern of tcs were labelled and showed in fig 8 and fig s4 9 from fig 8 and fig s4 9 the useful information that their reactive sites have a good regularity by labelling the structures of the tcs molecules was obtained firstly there are more sites were attached on both the benzene ring part and the backbone of the tetraphenyl group and secondly more sites also appear on the functional groups connected to the backbone chain of the tetraphenyl group such as the stronger electron donating functional groups like oh this marks that the tetraphenyl and the functional groups linked to tetraphenyl especially the oxygen containing functional groups were more vulnerable to be attacked in addition the purpose of the combination of dft calculations and lc ms detection is to get the degradation pathways of representative tcs tc fig s10 shows the total ion flow diagram obtained by lc ms in positive ion mode and the structures of intermediates are presented in table s10 therefore three possible degradation pathways of tc are proposed based on intermediate identification and attack site prediction as showed in fig 9 c pathway 1 in the early stages of the reaction the atoms with larger f0 values 1c 7c and 8c of tc 0 0333 0 0366 and 0 0320 respectively and larger f values 0 0350 0 0398 and 0 0454 respectively could be attacked by h and electrophilic species this led to the remove of the amino hydroxyl and methyl groups and the formation of f1 m z 410 21 by the breakage of the benzene ring and second ring the first ring from the left is the benzene ring 71 thereafter the atoms with larger f0 values 2c 3c 5c and 6c of tc 0 0223 0 0141 0 0098 and 0 0178 respectively and larger f values 0 0245 0 0141 0 0115 and 0 0226 respectively were preferred to be attacked by o2 oh and h leading to the removal of whole benzene ring to form f2 m z 318 18 subsequently hydroxyl removal and chain scission reactions occurred which generated f3 m z 274 32 pathway 2 ros attacked 14c 16c and 19o atoms of tc because they had larger f0 values 0 0440 0 0469 and 0 1049 respectively at the same time 19o with larger f values 0 1587 of tc this led to the formation of g1 m z 361 19 by the breakage of the third and fourth ring subsequently the atoms 12c and 15c with larger f0 values 0 0096 and 0 0187 were attacked leading to the rupture of the third ring to form g2 m z 204 08 and g3 m z 60 06 pathway 3 early in the degradation ros tended to attack on the atoms 20o 25n and 27n with larger f0 values 0 0469 0 0221 and 0 0509 respectively and the atoms 20o and 25n with larger f values 0 0428 and 0 0651 respectively and the bond cn with low energy 72 resulting in the loss of n methyl nh2 hydroxyl and co of the second ring the tc molecule therefore the tc conversed to h1 m z 360 16 73 subsequently ros attacked 18c 23o 24c 30c and 31o atoms due to their larger f0 values 0 0140 0 0132 0 0221 0 0114 and 0 0232 respectively and larger f values 0 0163 0 0159 0 0245 0 0167 and 0 0192 respectively this led to the formation of h2 m z 290 15 subsequently the tetraphenyl group was destroyed to form h3 m z 230 17 the intermediates were finally mineralized to small molecular co2 and h2o through fig 9 the tc intermediates obtained by the predicted active sites are in good agreement with the detection results of lc ms in other words based on the intermediates detected by lc ms and dft calculations it can be concluded that dft calculations can be applied to predict the degradation process of contaminants with the same basic parent structure therefore the degradation process of tcs and other organic pollutants predicted by dft calculations has some significance for reference fig 10 a b shows that the lc50 value defined as very toxic below 1 mg l 1 0 mg l 1 10 mg l 1 defined as toxic and 10 mg l 1 defined as harmful for tc corresponding to fathead minnow was 0 0664 mg l 1 which was defined as very toxic compounds 74 and the lc50 value for daphnia magna defined as toxic for 0 10 mg l 1 and harmful for 10 mg l 1 was 1 49 mg l 1 which was defined as toxic compounds the results showed that only f1 f2 g1 h1 and h3 remained highly toxic and all other intermediates showed higher ld50 values than tc for fathead minnow while all intermediates showed higher lc50 values than tc for daphnia magna meanwhile only f1 g1 and h1 remained toxic the ld50 values of the final products were higher indicating the generation of less toxic intermediates fig 10 c d shows that tc is developmental toxicant and mutagenicity positive however after photo fenton treatment two developmentally non toxic and six mutagenic negative tc intermediates were produced overall the development toxicity and mutagenicity of tc were obviously reduced after the treatment theoretically the conversion and destruction of carboxyl hydroxyl and tetraphenyl groups weakened the antibacterial activity of tc in previous study it was found that a nonlinear relationship between antibiotic removal efficiency and residual antimicrobial activity suggesting that the early formed intermediates retain a measurable degree of antimicrobial activity 75 based on the above toxicity prediction results although some of the intermediates are still toxic the final products exhibit weak antibacterial properties and are less harmful to the environment 76 4 conclusion in this study lafeo3 ps enriched with ovs was successfully synthesized the characterization results illustrated that the sonication process brings more ovs to the lfo theoretical calculations and statistical analysis showed that δe ehomo and vip were important factors that affected the removal efficiency of tcs in general the higher removal efficiency of tcs was observed for low δe high ehomo and low vip crucially other pollutants were successfully used to verify the conclusion that the lower the δe was the higher the removal efficiencies were therefore the probability of degradation for pollutants can be predicted by various parameters about molecular structures the regularity of the reaction sites was analyzed using dft calculations based on the predicted reaction sites obtained from dft calculations three possible tc degradation pathways were proposed including hydroxylation n dealkylation dehydration reaction and ring opening reaction this has been validated by degradation intermediates identified by lc ms also dft calculations can be used to predict the degradation process of pollutants with the same basic parent structure after degradation treatment the overall toxicity of tc was obviously reduced this study could provide some insights into the ovs lfo ps driven photo fenton degradation of organic pollutants with different molecular structures and provide a basis for improving their practical application in wastewater treatment credit authorship contribution statement xiaodong ge conceptualization

12694,the microbial communities of activated sludge could be affected by antibiotics pollution however it is unclear that how the historical antibiotic stress feedback to the later responses of microbes and antibiotic resistance genes args to combined antibiotics stress by leaving their imprint on activated sludge legacy effect in order to conceptualize the role of antibiotic legacy effects sulfamethoxazole smx or trimethoprim tmp was selected as historical stress to investigate responses of activated sludge to combined smx and tmp stress 0 005 30 mg l ammonia removal was affected by legacy of activated sludge delivered which increased with the increase of historical antibiotic concentrations but it was less affected by the legacy of antibiotic type stress changes of aromatic protein like substances and soluble microbial by products in soluble microbial product smp and tightly bound extracellular polymeric substances tb eps were more obvious under combined smx and tmp stress which could reflect the dynamic response of microorganisms to antibiotics stress legacy effects affected response of structure and composition of microbial community to later antibiotic stress args could produce positive feedback on the increase of relative abundance of hosts under antibiotics stress to occupy the niche of bacteria with high relative abundance especially genera taibaiella hydrogenophaga et al with low proportion but carrying multiple args mdtd mdtg acrd overall legacy of activated sludge delivered is able to change its responses to antibiotics stress and the occurrence of args can drive enrichment of their potential hosts graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords legacy effects combined stress antibiotics microbial communities antibiotic resistance genes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps are important for protecting the water environment and human health 1 2 especially microbial communities of activated sludge play crucial roles in the wwtps contributing to almost all ecosystem processes 3 the conventional activated sludge method removes ammonia nitrogen under aerobic conditions with a mixed microbial community 4 5 and degrades complex organic matter 6 7 however the activated sludge microbial community is threatened by antibiotics due to their global overuse which are pooled by wastewater and eventually flow into wwtps 8 9 different types of antibiotics have been detected in the wwtps 10 12 such as sulfamethoxazole smx trimethoprim tmp tetracyclines tet and methicillins antibiotics could affect specific performance e g nitrification denitrification and extracellular polymeric substances eps in activated sludge systems 13 14 and inevitably increase the development and spread of antibiotic resistance genes args 15 16 most studies have explored the stress effects on activated sludge in terms of the entire stressing process of antibiotics the activated sludge was stressed by smx 5 mg l and the ammonia nitrogen removal rate was maintained at 95 97 while which was gradually inhibited by tmp tetracycline tet and ciprofloxacin cip in the subsequent period 17 after the stress of tet 5 mg l alone the ammonia nitrogen removal rate by the combined stress of tet 5 mg l and smx 1 mg l was inhibited but the initial level was quickly restored 18 and the study subsequent effect of tet alone on the performance of activated sludge was not discussed under continuous stress with different concentrations of antibiotics nitrification gradually collapsed and enrichment of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob was inhibited 19 with increasing concentrations of antibiotics smx tmp ampicillin amp etc eventually enriched complete ammonia oxidizers comammox 20 the above research also shows that the stress of the whole process of antibiotics has an impact on functional bacteria of ammonia nitrogen removal at the same time as an important part of microorganisms eps plays a key role in microbial aggregation adsorption and mass transfer and eps was produced as the concentration of antibiotic stress increased which may also lead to the immobilization and adsorption of args 8 args cannot be effectively removed by traditional biological processes and most args are accompanied by potential bacterial hosts and eventually accumulate in activated sludge 21 the hosts of args have important contributions to the migration and transformation of args 16 thus it is important to understand the development of args and their hosts under the selective pressure of antibiotics although the interaction of antibiotic stress between microbial communities and args has been studied extensively 16 22 the previous studies mainly focused on the co occurrence mode between microorganisms and args 9 23 without clarifying the feedback of args on microbial community development the process construction of a microbial community or its response following a disturbance may depend on historical processes including external disturbances 24 the constraints of changes in the composition of contemporary conditions caused by past biotic or abiotic conditions 25 28 so that when the effects of past environmental conditions or shock events persist historical conditions are sufficient to influence the construction of the activated sludge system in the present which is referred to as a legacy effect and microbial communities have been found to provide a legacy to change external environmental perturbations in different environments e g human gut microbiota and soil microbes 25 29 the legacy effect of plant debris on soil has lasting effects on soil microbial communities particularly respiration 30 the study has shown that the formation of ecological memory in soils from repeated droughts increases the ability of ecosystems to recover from future droughts 31 the legacy delivered can control microbial composition and function 30 32 as it is more often associated with specific functions with certain legacy effects and may influence community development pathways however the impacts of historical antibiotic stress in the past to the responses of activated sludge to the later stress are less investigated and the antibiotic legacy effects are unclear thus it is necessary to further investigate the ecological consequences of the legacy of activated sludge formation on microbial composition as well as the response to antibiotic stress and even the contribution of args to microbial development in order to explore whether activated sludge can develop legacy and how to change the response to combined antibiotics in nitrification system smx and tmp are widely used as bacteriostatic antibiotics 33 which can coordinately target and dual blocking of bacterial folate metabolism 34 leading to their simultaneously detected in wwtps with different concentrations 11 35 36 so smx and tmp were selected as historical stress conditions and the responses of activated sludge to combined stress of smx and tmp were investigated in details this study investigated the impact of legacy of activated sludge delivery on 1 ammonia removal performance 2 eps secretion 3 microbial communities and 4 feedback from args on microbial development under antibiotics stress we hypothesize that activated sludge can deliver legacy under the stress of different types and concentrations of antibiotics and historical contaminant mediated changes in activated sludge ammonia removal and bacterial communities may persist after changes in stress conditions and args are associated with the increase in relative abundance among microorganisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 activated sludge collection the aerobic activated sludge used to explore the legacy of activated sludge delivered in response to combined smx and tmp stress was taken from the aeration tank of a full scale municipal wwtp with anoxic oxic activated sludge process in beijing china 39 89 n 116 25 e after collection the activated sludge was washed three times with distilled water to remove the contaminants to work stress experiments 2 2 stress and post stress phase of activated sludge smx and tmp were selected as typical antibiotic contaminants with concentration gradients of the environmental concentration e 0 005 mg l low concentration l 5 mg l medium concentration m 15 mg l and high concentration h 30 mg l the environmental concentration of smx and tmp in the influent of wwtps was 0 005 0 01 mg l 37 and the half maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 of smx on microorganisms was 32 mg l 8 30 mg l was selected lower than ic50 so as not to cause irreversible effects on activated sludge thus the gradient concentrations presented environmental to high levels in stress phase different concentrations 0 005 30 mg l smx or tmp was used as the historical antibiotics stress in activated sludge system in post stress phase to evaluate the status of the legacy delivered by activated sludge activated sludge of reactors were regarded as legacy of activated sludge based on the stress phase described above the operating conditions and concentration of antibiotics were consistent with the stress phase but the antibiotic stress conditions were the smx and tmp combined smx tmp 1 1 in order to distinguish between the two different activated sludge stress experiments the historical smx and tmp stress were defined as sat mode and tas mode table 1 the experiment of different concentrations of antibiotics stress was examined in conical flasks 500 ml a total of eighteen microcosm experiments two parallel were started up with activated sludge thus there were different microcosms including sat e sat l sat m sath tas e tas l tas m and tash 2 3 operation of

previous study 22 2 4 eps extraction and analysis the eps can be divided into soluble microbial product smp loosely bound lb eps and tightly bound tb eps 38 activated sludge samples from different reactors were collected at the end of post stress phase for eps analysis after a series of steps such as centrifugation ultrasonic treatment and thermal extraction three kinds of eps were extracted 39 the eps composition was further analyzed by three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy f 7000 hitachi japan to further analyze the composition of eps which was divided into five regions according to the prescribed excitation ex emission em boundaries 230 330 340 nm region i aromatic protein like substances a 225 350 360 nm region ii aromatic protein like

quality filtered according to the standard protocols described previously 40 uchime was used to filter chimeras to obtain valid fasta sequences 41 operational taxonomic units otus were clustered using a cutoff of 97 similarity with uparse version 7 1 42 the rdp classifier was used to classify and identify each 16s rrna gene sequence through silva 16s rrna database http www arb silva de picrust phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved state 43 was used to investigated args in different samples args was obtained by screening summarized kyoto encyclopedia of

resistance protein mlsb macrolide lincosamide streptogramin b aminoglycoside tetracycline vancomycin and other antibiotics 2 6 statistical analysis the fixed effects of interactions under antibiotic legacy ammonia oxidation performance total nitrogen tn removal and microbial community were analyzed using a linear mixed model lme with restricted maximum likelihood reml by spss 25 ibm usa which included 95 confidence interval ci and p value the feedback effect was considered significant if the 95 ci did not cross zero if the 95 ci range is in the positive region it indicates the development of activated sludge under antibiotic stress with positive feedback for that particular response and negative region indicates negative feedback principal component analysis pca was used to analyze the bacterial community characteristics of the samples using a wilcox rank sum test followed by a benjamini hochberg fdr correction for multiple testing to identify bacteria with significant differences between the two modes taxonomic branching maps were plotted using the r package meta encoder 44 spearman s rank correlation coefficient srcc was used to calculate correlations between bacteria and args in samples of the stress phase to find the potential hosts of args using python version 3 7 0 and the significant positive correlation was defined p 0 01 srcc 0 6 the correlation matrix between them was constructed and combined with gephi version 0 92 to map the co occurrence network of microorganisms and args the random forest model 45 was further used to quantify the proportional weigh of the influence of relative abundance of genera and their degrees with args on the development of bacteria in sat mode and tas mode 3 results 3 1 legacy effects of activated sludge on nitrification performance and tn removal in the stress phase nh4 n degradation time differed significantly at different antibiotic stress concentrations in the sat and tas modes fig 1a the nh4 n degradation time of sat e and tas e remained the same as blank 1 4 1 7 h while the ammonia oxidation performance gradually decreased with increasing antibiotic concentration and the nh4 n degradation time reached 4 3 h and 5 3 h under smx tmp stress of 30 mg l moreover it is noteworthy that the total nitrogen removal efficiency tnre increased with increasing smx tmp concentration fig 1b with a maximum increase of 10 8 compared to blank in addition nh4 n degradation time and tnre were essentially the same under the same concentration stress in both sat and tas modes at the end of the two phases of antibiotic stress the ammonia oxidation performance was significantly inhibited in both sat and tas modes and the average degradation time of nh4 n exceeded the blank and even reached 18 h by 30 mg l stress fig 1a the inhibition of ammonia oxidation performance was similar for both antibiotics at the same concentration during the stress phase the legacy effects caused by different types of antibiotic stress did not significantly affect the ammonia oxidation time fig 1c however except for 0 005 mg l the stress of historical low concentration was enough to present a significant effect on ammonia oxidation performance p 0 05 fig 1d more importantly the historical stress of medium and high concentration significantly inhibited the response of ammonia oxidation performance to the combined stress of smx and tmp p 0 001 fig 1e and the ammonia nitrogen degradation time reached 6 0 1 h and 18 4 2 h however in contrast to the ammonia oxidation performance tnre showed an increasing trend under sat and tas modes fig 1b both modes of 0 005 mg l and 5 mg l suppressed tnre compared to the 25 of blank in the activated sludge system it was basically consistent with tnre in the stress phase under the stress of 15 mg l tnre of tas m increased by 24 1 compared with the stress stage and tnre increased with the further increase of antibiotic concentration especially which tnre was significantly increased under stress of 30 mg l reaching 71 98 74 51 the response of tnre to combined stress of smx and tmp was significantly affected by the legacy of activated sludge transmission under different types of antibiotic stress p 0 05 fig 1f even the legacy of historical smx tmp stress had a significant positive contribution to tnre with tmp stress being more significant the legacy delivered by activated sludge was not significantly affected by historical stresses of 0 005 mg l and 5 mg lsmx tmp on tnre fig 1g while the legacy formed under stress of 15 mg l and 30 mg l produced significant effects p 0 01 fig 1h the above results indicated that the legacy of activated sludge delivered due to different historical antibiotic stress of the type and concentration can drive different response of the ammonia oxidation performance and tnre to the combined antibiotics 3 2 the effect of antibiotics on eps was not related to legacy of activated sludge transmission microorganisms in activated sludge are usually flocculated and bound by eps and these substances are considered to be a protective barrier for bacteria the effects of legacy transmitted by activated sludge under different historical stresses of antibiotics on eps were compared fig 2 under different legacy effects of historical antibiotic stress tb eps has the highest fluorescence intensity followed by smp and lb eps the aromatic protein like substances a and b and soluble microbial by products showed high concentrations in smp and tb eps while they were less in lb eps the result indicated that antibiotic stress mainly promoted the production of tb eps and smp and it was mainly in aromatic protein like substances a and b and soluble microbial by products for smp the fluorescence intensity of aromatic protein like substances b and soluble microbial by products increased with increasing concentrations of smx and tmp complex in sat mode while the remaining regions were largely unchanged on the contrary soluble microbial by products and aromatic protein like substances b decreased with increasing antibiotic concentrations in tas mode and the fluorescence intensity of smp was higher in sat mode than in tas mode except for group e lb eps did not show significant fluorescence intensity under antibiotic stress and neither smx nor tmp developed significant differences the effects of legacy delivered by activated sludge from different historical antibiotic stresses were largely consistent in tb eps the fluorescence intensities in both sat h and tas h were the highest values under stress of the corresponding historical antibiotic species and aromatic protein like substances a and b and soluble microbial by products in e l and h groups did not decrease with increasing antibiotic concentrations the above results showed that the eps formed on the surface of activated sludge increased with the increase of the combined concentration of smx and tmp especially tb eps but the legacy of activated sludge transfer did not significantly change the response of eps to the combined stress of smx and tmp 3 3 effect of legacy delivered by activated sludge on microorganisms pc1 explained 40 9 of the shifts in activated sludge microbial structure and pc2 explained 18 7 fig 3a as the historical stress antibiotic concentration increased from 0 005 mg l to 30 mg l the distance between the samples with smx and tmp as historical stress conditions increased gradually respectively especially under the historical stress of 30 mg l the legacy of activated sludge delivery caused the most obvious difference even under the same combined pressure of smx and tmp the results showed that legacy effects changed the microbial community structure in response to combined antibiotic stress and increased with increasing historical stress concentrations of different antibiotic types sat tas and blank were shown to differ from each other on all scales fig 3b the stress of antibiotics caused a clear development of microbial community succession in activated sludge system among all samples proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi had the highest relative abundance 0 78 66 35 under stress fig s1 the saccharibacteria sphingomonas and shewanellaceae were all significantly enriched in blank bacillales thauera and pseudomonas were enriched in all samples under stress of antibiotics flavobacterium and bacteroides were significantly enriched in the sat mode while veillonella acinetobacter and paracoccus were enriched in tas mode further a linear mixed model showed that the legacy delivery of activated sludge caused a significant positive feedback enrichment of known microbial communities p 0 05 especially historical tmp stress fig 3c the above results indicated that response of community structure and composition in activated sludge to combined stress of smx and tmp could be changed by the legacy of activated sludge delivery even difference in response increased with increasing concentration of historical antibiotic stress 3 4 feedback of args driving development of microbial community under legacy effects the gene counts of each args detected ranged from 101 to 105 in different samples fig s2 the composition of args in the different samples was similar in stress phase in the sat mode the total gene number of args increased with increasing smx stress concentration which increased from 8 0 105 smx e to 9 3 105 smx h however in the tas mode the total gene number of args reached 9 2 105 in smx e which was higher than the other samples the results indicated that different types of antibiotics had dissimilar effects on the occurrence of args the subtypes of multidrug resistance args mdtd mdtg mdte etc accounted majority of the args detected and the gene counts of them range from 102 to 104 the gene count of acra and adea genes reached 1 5 105 and 1 6 105 which were the highest among all the args the acrr bcr cfxa emra emre marc and mdta genes were also enriched in smx m smx h tmp e and tmp m samples the results indicated that the occurrence of args under antibiotic stress was related to the exposure concentrations the co occurrence relationship between args and microorganisms were explored using network analysis fig 4a according to the hypothesis proposed by previous authors 16 if args and microbial communities showed significantly similar abundance trends among samples microorganisms could be presumed to hosts in this study 23 genera were possible hosts for 35 args under smx stress among which genera such as pseudomonas brevundimonas and taibaiella were hosts for eight args e g acrr emre mexe and mdta multidrug resistant args e g mdtd mdtg mdte et al were co occurring with hydrogenophaga and rhodovulum at the meantime after combined stress of smx and tmp the original numerical dominance of genera changed significantly fig 4b ferruginibacter aeromonas and bellilinea et al genera that were numerically dominant but less connected to args in the past and the percentage of their numbers decreased to 0 233 0 020 and 0 012 decreased 51 42 61 99 and 58 79 but some bacteria with low original relative abundance increased the percentage of pseudomonas and brevundimonas increased to 0 094 and 0 176 increased by 522 1 and 444 1 compared with stress phase respectively while comamonas hyphomicrobium and defluviimonas were only hosts of 1 2 args and their percentages decreased to 0 009 0 008 and 0 008 decreased by 83 07 56 07 and 92 98 similarly genera such as taibaiella and hydrogenophaga which were hosts of multiple args under stress of tmp such as arcd qepa catb and mdtd whose percentage reached to 0 087 and 0 110 increased by 4250 and 2650 under combined stress of smx and tmp respectively the results showed that the relative abundance of these bacteria increased due to the drug resistance conferred by args which made these species to occupy niches of primitive dominant genera in the stress environment with antibiotics further the legacy effects of degrees with args and relative abundance on the development of bacteria were analyzed by random forest model fig 4c it could be seen that the degrees between genera with args on increase of relative abundance was more important than relative abundance under antibiotic stress the weight factor of degrees under smx 0 621 and tmp 0 52 stress were higher than relative abundances 0 379 0 48 and the contribution of args was more obvious in the legacy of smx historical stress the above results suggest that the presence of args can promote the progressive dominance of microorganisms over time the bacteria with low relative abundance carried args which promoted the increase of relative abundance and occupied the position of dominant bacteria 4 discussion in this study how the legacy of activated sludge delivery in different histories of antibiotics stress affects the response of activated sludge to combined stress of smx and tmp was explored including activated sludge performance eps secretion microbial community and args feedback to the community overall the study showed that the response of activated sludge to antibiotic stress depends on the legacy transmitted by previous activated sludge communities indicating that legacy delivered by activated sludge can occur within a relatively short time scale different from the hypothesis of the study the legacy delivered by the activated sludge had little lasting effect on nitrification under differential antibiotics types similarly the result was supported by other studies that long and short term stresses of different types of antibiotic species do not differ significantly on ammonia oxidation in activated sludge 15 46 while legacy effects caused by different historical concentrations of stress significantly affected the response of nitrification to combined antibiotics this may be due to the inhibition of ammonia oxidation performance by antibiotics in the past stress 47 the study has shown that the legacy produced by activated sludge can enhance the inhibition of combined antibiotics on nitrification and increase with the increase of historical stress concentration even leading to serious performance degradation the previous study also showed that after tet stress the nitrification performance further decreased under combined smx and tet stress 18 this may be due to the antibiotic inhibiting the expression of the ammonia nitrogen oxygenase gene which can oxidize nh4 n to nh2oh 48 compared with the stress phase the inhibition of ammonia oxidation performance was increased under different concentrations in the post stress phase this indicated that the ammonia oxidation performance was further significantly inhibited under the combined stress of smx and tmp and was affected by the legacy of antibiotics stress in stress phase it is possible that smx and tmp have synergistic targeting and inhibition of bacterial folate synthesis reserve resulting in a broad spectrum inhibitory effect on the community leading to the absence of a clear preferential effect of ecologically functionally distinct taxa in the stress phase however due to the specificity of bacterial mic50 a significant ecological niche preemption advantage was generated at different antibiotic concentrations creating an ecological niche inhibitory modification which in turn inhibited the increase of ammonia oxidizing bacteria and altered the ammonia oxidation performance of the activated sludge community which is consistent with previous studies that nitrification was significantly inhibited by antibiotics smx amp with increasing concentrations 46 49 both ammonia oxidizing and aerobic denitrification bacteria use ammonia nitrogen as a competing substrate and based on the principle of competitive exclusion when the utilization of resources by species is highly overlapping these inhibitory preferential effects are assumed to be strong which may contribute to the rise in aerobic denitrification performance under high concentration conditions the post effects phase of activated sludge stress by triclosan lasted for 19 d before nitrification was fully reinstated 50 the similar phenomenon was found under stress of cu and azithromycin 9 the two modes of antibiotic stress and different concentration conditions produced significant effects on the performance of tn removal mainly at high concentrations the change trend of different concentrations of smx tmp on tn removal was basically consistent with that under stress phase it may be due to the priority effects that prompt the formation of specific functions in the activated sludge during the smx tmp stress phase 26 stable ecological niches were created for these species while erasing the ecological niches of antibiotic sensitive species historical community plants can exert legacy effects on soil properties and control future plant development through association with microorganisms 51 while 15 mg l of tmp caused higher tn removal 59 than smx for the legacy of activated sludge delivery the previous study also showed that smx had less effect on tn removal and different types of antibiotics smx tmp tet cip had different effects on tn removal 17 thus the concept of legacy effects of activated sludge under antibiotic stress can be extended to the occurrence of activated sludge functions for example the study had also accomplished a one step process implementation for the conversion of nh4 n to no3 n using increasing concentrations of various antibiotics amp kanamycin lincomycin and methomycin 20 the initial prediction that different concentrations of antibiotics would directly affect eps production from activated sludge was consistent with our hypothesis but the transmission of legacy did not cause significant differences a previous study had also reported that external stress can produce more eps 52 the production of thicker eps can adsorb more antibiotics and prevent them from entering the cell thus reducing antibiotic toxicity which seems to indicate that eps secreted by activated sludge increases with only with the current antibiotic concentration 49 and with the increase of antibiotic smx and oxytetracycline stress time 53 which is consistent with the present study in particular the changes of aromatic protein like substances and soluble microbial by products in smp and tb eps were more obvious under combined smx and tmp stress paracoccus pseudoxanthomonas and thauera had been identified as genera that can secrete eps tb eps 7 50 corresponding to the fact that these genera were stressed by sat and tas modes and their relative abundance increased leading to the secrete more eps smp tb eps with the increase of antibiotic concentrations the composition of microbial communities was significantly affected by historical antibiotic stress which may be due to the bactericidal mechanisms of different conditioned antibiotics thus specifically shaping microbial communities as confirmed in previous studies 20 46 53 smx inhibited bacterial growth by disrupting the synthesis of folic acid 54 while tmp disrupts the breakdown of folic acid at the same time activated sludge had the ability to mineralize smx 7 55 even in the presence of other organic carbon sources 56 the historical stress of antibiotics has prompted a different dependence of microorganisms in the genetics of activated sludge delivery which explains the increase in the relative abundance of heterotrophic microorganisms under tas mode such as thauera pseudomonas chryseobacterium etc thauera and pseudomonas are widely reported genera with aerobic denitrification functions 16 which explains the significant effect of activated sludge heritage transfer on tn removal while nitrosomonas also decreased with increasing concentration and the feedback delivered by tmp stressed activated sludge was more severe similarly relative abundance of nitrospira decreased with increasing antibiotic concentrations even decreased to 0 1 under 30 mg l stress respectively much lower than the relative abundance of 0 005 mg l 15 mg l 0 39 1 31 a previous study has shown that the relative abundance of nitrospira increased from 0 02 to 2 07 with increasing tigecycline stress concentrations up to 25 mg l 23 the above results suggest that functionally important genera are affected by legacy effects 31 and legacy being passed affects some individual species more than at the community and ecosystem levels 57 which may lead to more pronounced legacy effects of aob aerobic dnb the correlation analysis also showed that the increase of different antibiotics caused changes in microbial composition at the genus level 46 similarly one study selected ten different antibiotics in the form of increasing concentrations and eventually found that only four antibiotics selectively enriched the developmentally distant comammox and identified four new branches 20 it is clear that understanding of the legacy effects of activated sludge mechanism is needed under contamination with antibiotics which is important to obtain the activated sludge microbial functional community in a targeted manner consistent with the hypothesis of the study args promoted the hosts to occupy the niche of dominant bacteria under antibiotics stress environments especially the bacteria with a low proportion but carrying args flavobacterium carried oqxb oqxa and mexf increased in post stress phase multidrug args were carried by leadbetterella whose relative abundance increased especially under high antibiotic stress in stressful environments with antibiotics as bacteria are endowed with resistance by args drive these species to predominate in ecological niches the abundance of the species does not matter under strong stress levels because species with args present always dominated in activated sludge system regardless of historical abundance and the effects are amplified over time through population growth and interactions the previous study also showed that tetx was carried by flavobacterium under tigecycline stress 0 25 mg l whose relative abundance increased from 0 66 increased to 16 55 as did leadbetterella and flexibacter 23 the qepa and marc were carried by thauera whose relative abundance increased by 108 27 and 134 26 under the post stress phase comparing stress phase as args hosts in activated sludge are usually bound by eps as a protective barrier 21 the generated of eps may contribute to the establishment of args hosts the hosts thaura leadbetterella flavobacterium and flexibacter etc might be the potential microbial secretors of eps associated args the results may also lead to the increasing trend of relative abundance of hosts higher than that of dominant genera similarly a previous study has shown that thauera under tmp stress carried at least three args and relative abundance was all higher than the control 16 it is possible that antibiotic stress promotes the association of args with host bacteria and that these effects in turn alter the strength of the legacy effects taking the lead in the ecological position to changing the developmental pathway of the genera lineage leading to convergent developmental adaptation to similar environments 58 5 conclusion here the study investigated the response of activated sludge delivery legacy to combined antibiotics and the feedback of args legacy of activated sludge delivery changed nitrification and microbial community response to combined antibiotics which were more significantly with increasing concentrations legacy delivered by activated sludge can drive tn removal through aerobic denitrification under high historical concentration stress the changes of aromatic protein like substances and soluble microbial by products in smp and tb eps were more obvious under combined smx and tmp stress eps was not affected by the legacy transmitted by activated sludge but affected by the contemporary stress of antibiotics the presence of args can promote the progressive dominance of hosts over time to occupy

microbes and antibiotic resistance genes args to combined antibiotics stress by leaving their imprint on activated sludge legacy effect in order to conceptualize the role of antibiotic legacy effects sulfamethoxazole smx or trimethoprim tmp was selected as historical stress to investigate responses of activated sludge to combined smx and tmp stress 0 005 30 mg l ammonia removal was affected by legacy of activated sludge delivered which increased with the increase of historical antibiotic concentrations but it was less affected by the legacy of antibiotic type stress changes of aromatic protein like substances and soluble microbial by products in soluble microbial product smp and tightly bound extracellular polymeric substances tb eps were more obvious under combined smx and tmp stress which could reflect the dynamic response of microorganisms to antibiotics stress legacy effects affected response of structure and composition of microbial community to later antibiotic stress

hydrogenophaga et al with low proportion but carrying multiple args mdtd mdtg acrd overall legacy of activated sludge delivered is able to change its responses to antibiotics stress and the occurrence of args can drive enrichment of their potential hosts graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords legacy effects combined stress antibiotics microbial communities antibiotic resistance genes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps are important for protecting the water environment and human health 1 2 especially microbial communities of activated sludge play crucial roles in the wwtps contributing to almost all ecosystem processes 3 the conventional activated sludge method removes ammonia nitrogen under aerobic conditions with a mixed microbial community 4 5 and degrades complex organic matter 6 7 however the activated sludge microbial community is threatened by antibiotics due to their global overuse which are pooled by wastewater and eventually flow into wwtps 8 9 different types of antibiotics have been detected in the wwtps 10 12 such as sulfamethoxazole smx trimethoprim tmp tetracyclines tet and methicillins antibiotics could affect specific performance e g nitrification denitrification and extracellular polymeric substances eps in activated sludge systems 13 14 and inevitably increase the development and spread of antibiotic resistance genes args 15 16 most studies have explored the stress effects on activated sludge in terms of the entire stressing process of antibiotics the activated sludge was stressed by smx 5 mg l and the ammonia nitrogen removal rate was maintained at 95 97 while which was gradually inhibited by tmp tetracycline tet and ciprofloxacin cip in the subsequent period 17 after the stress of tet 5 mg l alone the ammonia nitrogen removal rate by the combined stress of tet 5 mg l and smx 1 mg l was inhibited but the initial level was quickly restored 18 and the study subsequent effect of tet alone on the performance of activated sludge was not discussed under continuous stress with different concentrations of antibiotics nitrification gradually collapsed and enrichment of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob was inhibited 19 with increasing concentrations of antibiotics smx tmp ampicillin amp etc eventually enriched complete ammonia oxidizers comammox 20 the above research also shows that the stress of the whole process of antibiotics has an impact on functional bacteria of ammonia nitrogen removal at the same time as an important part of microorganisms eps plays a key role in microbial aggregation adsorption and mass transfer and eps was produced as the concentration of antibiotic stress increased which may also lead to the immobilization and adsorption of args 8 args cannot be effectively removed by traditional biological processes and most args are accompanied by potential bacterial hosts and eventually accumulate in activated sludge 21 the hosts of args have important contributions to the migration and transformation of args 16 thus it is important to understand the development of args and their hosts under the selective pressure of antibiotics although the interaction of antibiotic stress between microbial communities and args has been studied extensively 16 22 the previous studies mainly focused on the co occurrence mode between microorganisms and args 9 23 without clarifying the feedback of args on microbial community development the process construction of a microbial community or its response following a disturbance may depend on historical processes including external disturbances 24 the constraints of changes in the composition of contemporary conditions caused by past biotic or abiotic conditions 25 28 so that when the effects of past environmental conditions or shock events persist historical conditions are sufficient to influence the construction of the activated sludge system in the present which is referred to as a legacy effect and microbial communities have been found to provide a legacy to change external environmental perturbations in different environments e g human gut microbiota and soil microbes 25 29 the legacy effect of plant debris on soil has lasting effects on soil microbial communities particularly respiration 30 the study has shown that the formation of ecological memory in soils from repeated droughts increases the ability of ecosystems to recover from future droughts 31 the legacy delivered can control microbial composition and function 30 32 as it is more often associated with specific functions with certain legacy effects and may influence community development pathways however the impacts of historical antibiotic stress in the past to the responses of activated sludge to the later stress are less investigated and the antibiotic legacy effects are unclear thus it is necessary to further investigate the ecological consequences of the legacy of activated sludge formation on microbial composition as well as the response to antibiotic stress and even the contribution of args to microbial development in order to explore whether activated sludge can develop legacy and how to change the response to combined antibiotics in nitrification system smx and tmp are widely used as bacteriostatic antibiotics 33 which can coordinately target and dual blocking of bacterial folate metabolism 34 leading to their simultaneously detected in wwtps with different concentrations 11 35 36 so smx and tmp were selected as historical stress conditions and the responses of activated sludge to combined stress of smx and tmp were investigated in details this study investigated the impact of legacy of activated sludge delivery on 1 ammonia removal performance 2 eps secretion 3 microbial communities and 4 feedback from args on microbial development under antibiotics stress we hypothesize that activated sludge can deliver legacy under the stress of different types and concentrations of antibiotics and historical contaminant mediated changes in activated sludge ammonia removal and bacterial communities may persist after changes in stress conditions and args are associated with the increase in relative abundance among microorganisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 activated sludge collection the aerobic activated sludge used to explore the legacy of activated sludge delivered in response to combined smx and tmp stress was taken from the aeration tank of a full scale municipal wwtp with anoxic oxic activated sludge process in beijing china 39 89 n 116 25 e after collection the activated sludge was washed three times with distilled water to remove the contaminants to work stress experiments 2 2 stress and post stress phase of activated sludge smx and tmp were selected as typical antibiotic contaminants with concentration gradients of the environmental concentration e 0 005 mg l low concentration l 5 mg l medium concentration m 15 mg l and high concentration h 30 mg l the environmental concentration of smx and tmp in the influent of wwtps was 0 005 0 01 mg l 37 and the half maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 of smx on microorganisms was 32 mg l 8 30 mg l was selected lower than ic50 so as not to cause irreversible effects on activated sludge thus the gradient concentrations presented environmental to high levels in stress phase different concentrations 0 005 30 mg l smx or tmp was used as the historical antibiotics stress in activated sludge system in post stress phase to evaluate the status of the legacy delivered by activated sludge activated sludge of reactors were regarded as legacy of activated sludge based on the stress phase described above the operating conditions and concentration of antibiotics were consistent with the stress phase but the antibiotic stress conditions were the smx and tmp combined smx tmp 1 1 in order to distinguish between the two different activated sludge stress experiments the historical smx and tmp stress were defined as sat mode and tas mode table 1 the experiment of different concentrations of antibiotics stress was examined in conical flasks 500 ml a total of eighteen microcosm experiments two parallel were started up with activated sludge thus there were different microcosms including sat e sat l sat m sath tas e tas l tas m and tash 2 3 operation of

legacy ammonia oxidation performance total nitrogen tn removal and microbial community were analyzed using a linear mixed model lme with restricted maximum likelihood reml by spss 25 ibm usa which included 95 confidence interval ci and p value the feedback effect was considered significant if the 95 ci did not cross zero if the 95 ci range is in the positive region it indicates the development of activated sludge under antibiotic stress with positive feedback for that particular response and negative region indicates negative feedback principal component analysis pca was used to analyze the bacterial community characteristics of the samples using a wilcox rank sum test followed by a benjamini hochberg fdr correction for multiple testing to identify bacteria with significant differences

the influence of relative abundance of genera and their degrees with args on the development of bacteria in sat mode and tas mode 3 results 3 1 legacy effects of activated sludge on nitrification performance and tn removal in the stress phase nh4 n degradation time differed significantly at different antibiotic stress concentrations in the sat and tas modes fig 1a the nh4 n degradation time of sat e and tas e remained the same as blank 1 4 1 7 h while the ammonia oxidation performance gradually decreased with increasing antibiotic concentration and the nh4 n degradation time reached 4 3 h and 5 3 h under smx tmp stress of 30 mg l moreover it is noteworthy that the total nitrogen removal efficiency tnre increased with increasing smx tmp concentration fig 1b with a maximum increase of 10 8 compared to blank in addition nh4 n degradation time and tnre were essentially the same under the same concentration stress in both sat and tas modes at the end of the two phases of antibiotic stress the ammonia oxidation performance was significantly inhibited in both sat and tas modes and the average degradation time of nh4 n exceeded the blank and even reached 18 h by 30 mg l stress fig 1a the inhibition of ammonia oxidation performance was similar for both antibiotics at the same concentration during the stress phase the legacy effects caused by different types of antibiotic stress did not significantly affect the ammonia oxidation time fig 1c however except for 0 005 mg l the stress of historical low concentration was enough to present a significant effect on ammonia oxidation performance p 0 05 fig 1d more importantly the historical stress of medium and high concentration significantly inhibited the response of ammonia oxidation performance to the combined stress of smx and tmp p 0 001 fig 1e and the ammonia nitrogen degradation time reached 6 0 1 h and 18 4 2 h however in contrast to the ammonia oxidation performance tnre showed an increasing trend under sat and tas modes fig 1b both modes of 0 005 mg l and 5 mg l suppressed tnre compared to the 25 of blank in the activated sludge system it was basically consistent with tnre in the stress phase under the stress of 15 mg l tnre of tas m increased by 24 1 compared with the stress stage and tnre increased with the further increase of antibiotic concentration especially which tnre was significantly increased under stress of 30 mg l reaching 71 98 74 51 the response of tnre to combined stress of smx and tmp was significantly affected by the legacy of activated sludge transmission under different types of antibiotic stress p 0 05 fig 1f even the legacy of historical smx tmp stress had a significant positive contribution to tnre with tmp stress being more significant the legacy delivered by activated sludge was not significantly affected by historical stresses of 0 005 mg l and 5 mg lsmx tmp on tnre fig 1g while the legacy formed under stress of 15 mg l and 30 mg l produced significant effects p 0 01 fig 1h the above results indicated that the legacy of activated sludge delivered due to different historical antibiotic stress of the type and concentration can drive different response of the ammonia oxidation performance and tnre to the combined antibiotics 3 2 the effect of antibiotics on eps was not related to legacy of activated sludge transmission microorganisms in activated sludge are usually flocculated and bound by eps and these substances are considered to be a protective barrier for bacteria the effects of legacy transmitted by activated sludge under different historical stresses of antibiotics on eps were compared fig 2 under different legacy effects of historical antibiotic stress tb eps has the highest fluorescence intensity followed by smp and lb eps the aromatic protein like substances a and b and soluble microbial by products showed high concentrations in smp and tb eps while they were less in lb eps the result indicated that antibiotic stress mainly promoted the production of tb eps and smp and it was mainly in aromatic protein like substances a and b and soluble microbial by products for smp the fluorescence intensity of aromatic protein like substances b and soluble microbial by products increased with increasing concentrations of smx and tmp complex in sat mode while the remaining regions were largely unchanged on the contrary soluble microbial by products and aromatic protein like substances b decreased with increasing antibiotic concentrations in tas mode and the fluorescence intensity of smp was higher in sat mode than in tas mode except for group e lb eps did not show significant fluorescence intensity under antibiotic stress and neither smx nor tmp developed significant differences the effects of legacy delivered by activated sludge from different historical antibiotic stresses were largely consistent in tb eps the fluorescence intensities in both sat h and tas h were the highest values under stress of the corresponding historical antibiotic species and aromatic protein like substances a and b and soluble microbial by products in e l and h groups did not decrease with increasing antibiotic concentrations the above results showed that the eps formed on the surface of activated sludge increased with the increase of the combined concentration of smx and tmp especially tb eps but the legacy of activated sludge transfer did not significantly change the response of eps to the combined stress of smx and tmp 3 3 effect of legacy delivered by activated sludge on microorganisms pc1 explained 40 9 of the shifts in activated sludge microbial structure and pc2 explained 18 7 fig 3a as the historical stress antibiotic concentration increased from 0 005 mg l to 30 mg l the distance between the samples with smx and tmp as historical stress conditions increased gradually respectively especially under the historical stress of 30 mg l the legacy of activated sludge delivery caused the most obvious difference even under the same combined pressure of smx and tmp the results showed that legacy effects changed the microbial community structure in response to combined antibiotic stress and increased with increasing historical stress concentrations of different antibiotic types sat tas and blank were shown to differ from each other on all scales fig 3b the stress of antibiotics caused a clear development of microbial community succession in activated sludge system among all samples proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi had the highest relative abundance 0 78 66 35 under stress fig s1 the saccharibacteria sphingomonas and shewanellaceae were all significantly enriched in blank bacillales thauera and pseudomonas were enriched in all samples under stress of antibiotics flavobacterium and bacteroides were significantly enriched in the sat mode while veillonella acinetobacter and paracoccus were enriched in tas mode further a linear mixed model showed that the legacy delivery of activated sludge caused a significant positive feedback enrichment of known microbial communities p 0 05 especially historical tmp stress fig 3c the above results indicated that response of community structure and composition in activated sludge to combined stress of smx and tmp could be changed by the legacy of activated sludge delivery even difference in response increased with increasing concentration of historical antibiotic stress 3 4 feedback of args driving development of microbial community under legacy effects the gene counts of each args detected ranged from 101 to 105 in different samples fig s2 the composition of args in the different samples was similar in stress phase in the sat mode the total gene number of args increased with increasing smx stress concentration which increased from 8 0 105 smx e to 9 3 105 smx h however in the tas mode the total gene number of args reached 9 2 105 in smx e which was higher than the other samples the results indicated that different types of antibiotics had dissimilar effects on the occurrence of args the subtypes of multidrug resistance args mdtd mdtg mdte etc accounted majority of the args detected and the gene counts of them range from 102 to 104 the gene count of acra and adea genes reached 1 5 105 and 1 6 105 which were the highest among all the args the acrr bcr cfxa emra emre marc and mdta genes were also enriched in smx m smx h tmp e and tmp m samples the results indicated that the occurrence of args under antibiotic stress was related to the exposure concentrations the co occurrence relationship between args and microorganisms were explored using network analysis fig 4a according to the hypothesis proposed by previous authors 16 if args and microbial communities showed significantly similar abundance trends among samples microorganisms could be presumed to hosts in this study 23 genera were possible hosts for 35 args under smx stress among which genera such as pseudomonas brevundimonas and taibaiella were hosts for eight args e g acrr emre mexe and mdta multidrug resistant args e g mdtd mdtg mdte et al were co occurring with hydrogenophaga and rhodovulum at the meantime after combined stress of smx and tmp the original numerical dominance of genera changed significantly fig 4b ferruginibacter aeromonas and bellilinea et al genera that were numerically dominant but less connected to args in the past and the percentage of their numbers decreased to 0 233 0 020 and 0 012 decreased 51 42 61 99 and 58 79 but some bacteria with low original relative abundance increased the percentage of pseudomonas and brevundimonas increased to 0 094 and 0 176 increased by 522 1 and 444 1 compared with stress phase respectively while comamonas hyphomicrobium and defluviimonas were only hosts of 1 2 args and their percentages decreased to 0 009 0 008 and 0 008 decreased by 83 07 56 07 and 92 98 similarly genera such as taibaiella and hydrogenophaga which were hosts of multiple args under stress of tmp such as arcd qepa catb and mdtd whose percentage reached to 0 087 and 0 110 increased by 4250 and 2650 under combined stress of smx and tmp respectively the results showed that the relative abundance of these bacteria increased due to the drug resistance conferred by args which made these species to occupy niches of primitive dominant genera in the stress environment with antibiotics further the legacy effects of degrees with args and relative abundance on the development of bacteria were analyzed by random forest model fig 4c it could be seen that the degrees between genera with args on increase of relative abundance was more important than relative abundance under antibiotic stress the weight factor of degrees under smx 0 621 and tmp 0 52 stress were higher than relative abundances 0 379 0 48 and the contribution of args was more obvious in the legacy of smx historical stress the above results suggest that the presence of args can promote the progressive dominance of microorganisms over time the bacteria with low relative abundance carried args which promoted the increase of relative abundance and occupied the position of dominant bacteria 4 discussion in this study how the legacy of activated sludge delivery in different histories of antibiotics stress affects the response of activated sludge to combined stress of smx and tmp was explored including activated sludge performance eps secretion microbial community and args feedback to the community overall the study showed that the response of activated sludge to antibiotic stress depends on the legacy transmitted by previous activated sludge communities indicating that legacy delivered by activated sludge can occur within a relatively short time scale different from the hypothesis of the study the legacy delivered by the activated sludge had little lasting effect on nitrification under differential antibiotics types similarly the result was supported by other studies that long and short term stresses of different types of antibiotic species do not differ significantly on ammonia oxidation in activated sludge 15 46 while legacy effects caused by different historical concentrations of stress significantly affected the response of nitrification to combined antibiotics this may be due to the inhibition of ammonia oxidation performance by antibiotics in the past stress 47 the study has shown that the legacy produced by activated sludge can enhance the inhibition of combined antibiotics on nitrification and increase with the increase of historical stress concentration even leading to serious performance degradation the previous study also showed that after tet stress the nitrification performance further decreased under combined smx and tet stress 18 this may be due to the antibiotic inhibiting the expression of the ammonia nitrogen oxygenase gene which can oxidize nh4 n to nh2oh 48 compared with the stress phase the inhibition of ammonia oxidation performance was increased under different concentrations in the post stress phase this indicated that the ammonia oxidation performance was further significantly inhibited under the combined stress of smx and tmp and was affected by the legacy of antibiotics stress in stress phase it is possible that smx and tmp have synergistic targeting and inhibition of bacterial folate synthesis reserve resulting in a broad spectrum inhibitory effect on the community leading to the absence of a clear preferential effect of ecologically functionally distinct taxa in the stress phase however due to the specificity of bacterial mic50 a significant ecological niche preemption advantage was generated at different antibiotic concentrations creating an ecological niche inhibitory modification which in turn inhibited the increase of ammonia oxidizing bacteria and altered the ammonia oxidation performance of the activated sludge community which is consistent with previous studies that nitrification was significantly inhibited by antibiotics smx amp with increasing concentrations 46 49 both ammonia oxidizing and aerobic denitrification bacteria use ammonia nitrogen as a competing substrate and based on the principle of competitive exclusion when the utilization of resources by species is highly overlapping these inhibitory preferential effects are assumed to be strong which may contribute to the rise in aerobic denitrification performance under high concentration conditions the post effects phase of activated sludge stress by triclosan lasted for 19 d before nitrification was fully reinstated 50 the similar phenomenon was found under stress of cu and azithromycin 9 the two modes of antibiotic stress and different concentration conditions produced significant effects on the performance of tn removal mainly at high concentrations the change trend of different concentrations of smx tmp on tn removal was basically consistent with that under stress phase it may be due to the priority effects that prompt the formation of specific functions in the activated sludge during the smx tmp stress phase 26 stable ecological niches were created for these species while erasing the ecological niches of antibiotic sensitive species historical community plants can exert legacy effects on soil properties and control future plant development through association with microorganisms 51 while 15 mg l of tmp caused higher tn removal 59 than smx for the legacy of activated sludge delivery the previous study also showed that smx had less effect on tn removal and different types of antibiotics smx tmp tet cip had different effects on tn removal 17 thus the concept of legacy effects of activated sludge under antibiotic stress can be extended to the occurrence of activated sludge functions for example the study had also accomplished a one step process implementation for the conversion of nh4 n to no3 n using increasing concentrations of various antibiotics amp kanamycin lincomycin and methomycin 20 the initial prediction that different concentrations of antibiotics would directly affect eps production from activated sludge was consistent with our hypothesis but the transmission of legacy did not cause significant differences a previous study had also reported that external stress can produce more eps 52 the production of thicker eps can adsorb more antibiotics and prevent them from entering the cell thus reducing antibiotic toxicity which seems to indicate that eps secreted by activated sludge increases with only with the current antibiotic concentration 49 and with the increase of antibiotic smx and oxytetracycline stress time 53 which is consistent with the present study in particular the changes of aromatic protein like substances and soluble microbial by products in smp and tb eps were more obvious under combined smx and tmp stress paracoccus pseudoxanthomonas and thauera had been identified as genera that can secrete eps tb eps 7 50 corresponding to the fact that these genera were stressed by sat and tas modes and their relative abundance increased leading to the secrete more eps smp tb eps with the increase of antibiotic concentrations the composition of microbial communities was significantly affected by historical antibiotic stress which may be due to the bactericidal mechanisms of different conditioned antibiotics thus specifically shaping microbial communities as confirmed in previous studies 20 46 53 smx inhibited bacterial growth by disrupting the synthesis of folic acid 54 while tmp disrupts the breakdown of folic acid at the same time activated sludge had the ability to mineralize smx 7 55 even in the presence of other organic carbon sources 56 the historical stress of antibiotics has prompted a different dependence of microorganisms in the genetics of activated sludge delivery which explains the increase in the relative abundance of heterotrophic microorganisms under tas mode such as thauera pseudomonas chryseobacterium etc thauera and pseudomonas are widely reported genera with aerobic denitrification functions 16 which explains the significant effect of activated sludge heritage transfer on tn removal while nitrosomonas also decreased with increasing concentration and the feedback delivered by tmp stressed activated sludge was more severe similarly relative abundance of nitrospira decreased with increasing antibiotic concentrations even decreased to 0 1 under 30 mg l stress respectively much lower than the relative abundance of 0 005 mg l 15 mg l 0 39 1 31 a previous study has shown that the relative abundance of nitrospira increased from 0 02 to 2 07 with increasing tigecycline stress concentrations up to 25 mg l 23 the above results suggest that functionally important genera are affected by legacy effects 31 and legacy being passed affects some individual species more than at the community and ecosystem levels 57 which may lead to more pronounced legacy effects of aob aerobic dnb the correlation analysis also showed that the increase of different antibiotics caused changes in microbial composition at the genus level 46 similarly one study selected ten different antibiotics in the form of increasing concentrations and eventually found that only four antibiotics selectively enriched the developmentally distant comammox and identified four new branches 20 it is clear that understanding of the legacy effects of activated sludge mechanism is needed under contamination with antibiotics which is important to obtain the activated sludge microbial functional community in a targeted manner consistent with the hypothesis of the study args promoted the hosts to occupy the niche of dominant bacteria under antibiotics stress environments especially the bacteria with a low proportion but carrying args flavobacterium carried oqxb oqxa and mexf increased in post stress phase multidrug args were carried by leadbetterella whose relative abundance increased especially under high antibiotic stress in stressful environments with antibiotics as bacteria are endowed with resistance by args drive these species to predominate in ecological niches the abundance of the species does not matter under strong stress levels because species with args present always dominated in activated sludge system regardless of historical abundance and the effects are amplified over time through population growth and interactions the previous study also showed that tetx was carried by flavobacterium under tigecycline stress 0 25 mg l whose relative abundance increased from 0 66 increased to 16 55 as did leadbetterella and flexibacter 23 the qepa and marc were carried by thauera whose relative abundance increased by 108 27 and 134 26 under the post stress phase comparing stress phase as args hosts in activated sludge are usually bound by eps as a protective barrier 21 the generated of eps may contribute to the establishment of args hosts the hosts thaura leadbetterella flavobacterium and flexibacter etc might be the potential microbial secretors of eps associated args the results may also lead to the increasing trend of relative abundance of hosts higher than that of dominant genera similarly a previous study has shown that thauera under tmp stress carried at least three args and relative abundance was all higher than the control 16 it is possible that antibiotic stress promotes the association of args with host bacteria and that these effects in turn alter the strength of the legacy effects taking the lead in the ecological position to changing the developmental pathway of the genera lineage leading to convergent developmental adaptation to similar environments 58 5 conclusion here the study investigated the response of activated sludge delivery legacy to combined antibiotics and the feedback of args legacy of activated sludge delivery changed nitrification and microbial community response to combined antibiotics which were more significantly with increasing concentrations legacy delivered by activated sludge can drive tn removal through aerobic denitrification under high historical concentration stress the changes of aromatic protein like substances and soluble microbial by products in smp and tb eps were more obvious under combined smx and tmp stress eps was not affected by the legacy transmitted by activated sludge but affected by the contemporary stress of antibiotics the presence of args can promote the progressive dominance of hosts over time to occupy the niche of dominant species declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to
