7205,we develop a semi analytical model to calculate the entry pressure in rough capillaries based on an energy balance principle and wetting theory on rough surfaces during the drainage process we assume fluids form arc menisci at corners of capillary cross sections depending on the apparent angle and that there is a wetting phase film adsorbed on the rough surface depending on the wetting condition a logistic model is proposed to explain the contact angle dependence on the structure of rough surfaces then the capillary entry pressure is calculated by extended ms p mayer stowe and princen method we verify the model using the pseudopotential lattice boltzmann model and obtain good agreement between the analytical and simulated pressures taking capillaries with triangular sections with pillar pillar type rough surfaces as example we discuss how rough structures and contact angles influence capillary behaviors the results reveal that both the wetting phase saturation and entry pressure of rough capillaries are larger than those in smooth capillaries under the same conditions moreover the entry pressure is not sensitive to the roughness factor under strong wetting conditions and is much more sensitive to the pillar asperity height than the other structure parameters keywords rough surface capillary entry pressure ms p method lattice boltzmann method 1 introduction the phenomena of flow through porous media are ubiquitous in nature and artificial materials some examples include the oil flow underground microcirculation of blood in animals and gas migration in packed bed the pore scale ranges from nanometers to micrometers in porous media such as tight sandstone and shale which requires researchers to pay more attention to pore scale flow to further reveal flow mechanisms the shape of the pore space in porous media is irregular and the connectivity is complex also the flow often involves multiple fluids one popular tool used to model multi phase flow at pore scale is pore network modeling where the porous medium is described as a network of pores connected by capillaries using an idealized geometry blunt et al 2002 that in the simplest case are considered either completely full or completely empty depending on the capillary pressure however there will always be some fluid remaining in the corners both after drainage a non wetting fluid displaces a wetting fluid and imbibition a wetting fluid displaces a non wetting fluid processes so pores or throats in such networks are usually assumed to have angular cross sectional shapes such as triangle square and star to hold the fluid phase in a mathematically tractable way we focus on a quasi static primary drainage process controlled by capillary pressure in the following discussion i e the flow rate is very low and the capillary number is small hanspal et al 2013 no matter whether in experiments or simulations capillary behavior is the basis for getting the capillary pressure curve and the relative permeability curve zhang and yu 2016 ye et al 2017 an important property of capillary behavior is the value of the capillary entry pressure or threshold pressure i e the minimum pressure difference required for the non wetting fluid to penetrate a capillary filled with a wetting fluid the most popular theoretical model to calculate the capillary entry pressure is the so called ms p method which was originally proposed by mayer and stowe 1965 and further developed by princen 1969a b 1970 based on the ms p method oren et al 1998 derived the threshold pressures of triangular tubes under different flow conditions oren and bakke 1998 and lago et al 2001 derived the threshold pressure in a capillary with a polygonal cross section lago and araujo 2001 however most of the works ignore pore surface roughness in pore scale modeling though it influences the contact angle and contact angle hysteresis significantly hecht et al 2013 mortazavi et al 2013 as well as affecting energy consumption due to interface contact between fluids and solids during flow the surface roughness plays an important role in many flow processes for example with nanoparticles injection into porous media particles would be adsorbed onto the surface driven by dlvo forces forming a rough surface rao 2010 chowdhury et al 2011 consequently both the contact angle and microstructure of the surface would change during the flow process the influence of surface roughness on the apparent contact angle of the droplet is generally understood as lying between two theoretically extreme situations i e the cassie baxter c b state and wenzel state cassie 1948 wenzel 1949 whyman and bormashenko 2008 in the c b state the droplet remains suspended above the asperities in the surface in the wenzel state the droplet fills the grooves between the roughness elements admittedly these two classical models are not always accurate since they fail to capture the effect of many interactions occurring during wetting such as the heterogeneity lundgren et al 2007 hierarchical structure badge et al 2013 and geometry of bumps or cavities on the surface afferrante and carbone 2014 in addition the wetting state could change under certain conditions for example there would be a transition from cassie to wenzel state when the drop is acted on by an external force or the structure of the rough surface is modified guo et al 2014 thus some more accurate state equations have been developed but mainly are extensions of these two models bormashenko 2015 in this study we also derive a new equation for the wenzel wetting state and verify the model by lattice boltzmann lb simulation results rather than from physical mechanisms we propose the new equation from the perspective of mathematical modeling using a logistic model extrand 2007 studied retention forces of a liquid slug in a rough capillary tube with symmetric or asymmetric features and the imbalance of capillary forces that leads to directionally biased wetting was examined a model was described by butt 2008 to calculate capillary forces between solid surfaces analytically using the kelvin equation in which roughness is considered with an asperity distribution function there were also many other numerical methods reported to study capillary behavior in rough capillaries liu et al 2007 rostami and streator 2017 however these methods are generally complex and do not offer straightforward linkages between capillary behavior and flow as to the theory on capillary entry pressure considering rough surfaces though tsakiroglou and payatakes add pore wall roughness features to a network model using concepts from fractal geometry tsakiroglou and payatakes 1993 they did not give an analytical model to enable calculation of the capillary entry pressure exactly based on the microstructure of pore shapes in this work we present a semi analytical expression for the capillary entry pressure for the case of rough capillaries with polygonal cross sections using the ms p method and verify the model using lb simulation capillary entry pressures in smooth capillaries are compared with those in rough capillaries a study of the dependence of the capillary behavior on the shape factor contact angle groove width and asperity width and height is done for triangle shapes the study is not only useful for revealing flow mechanisms at micro and nano scales but also attractive for a variety of industry applications such as oil development wastewater treatment and mems based fluidic devices 2 theory background in this section we will introduce ms p method and its application to calculate capillary entry pressure in capillaries with polygonal cross section 2 1 ms p method capillary forces prevent non wetting fluid from spontaneously entering wetting fluid filled throats when the non wetting fluid invades the wetting fluid in a non circular capillary non wetting fluid can only enter an available throat if the capillary pressure exceeds the threshold capillary pressure at which point the wetting phase will be displaced from the central region leaving some residual in the corners the invading meniscus is referred to as the main terminal meniscus mtm while the menisci formed in the cross sectional plane are referred to as arc menisci ams mason and morrow 1991 in the absence of gravity the ms p method for calculating the capillary entry pressures relies on equating the curvature of the ams to that of the mtm there is a critical contact angle for the occurrence of ams in the corner that is to say only when the contact angle is smaller than the critical contact angle of the corner can the mtm and ams appears simultaneously fig 1 shows a three dimensional example where non wetting fluid invades wetting fluid in a square capillary in which there is a co occurrence of ams and mtm in strong wetting conditions while there is no am in poor wetting condition the capillary pressure p c is calculated as follows 1 p c p n p w where the subscripts w and n refer to the wetting and non wetting phases respectively if the ams are displaced a small distance dx the work of the displacement must be balanced by the change in surface free energy 2 p c a eff dx l nw γ nw l ns γ ns l ns γ ws dx where the subscript s indicates the solid a eff is the effective area occupied by the non wetting phase l ns is the length of the solid wall in contact with the non wetting phase l nw is the perimeter of the ams and γ is the interfacial tension when the contact angle is θ young s equation yields the following 3 γ ns γ ws γ nw cos θ and the energy balance equation can be simplified as follows 4 p c γ nw l nw l ns cos θ a eff l eff a eff if the radius of the threshold drainage curvature is r d threshold radius the young laplace equation yields the following 5 p c γ nw r d the capillary entry pressure and the threshold drainage radius are then obtained by solving eqs 4 and 5 the wetting phase saturation is calculated based on the geometrical characteristics of the cross section 2 2 capillary entry pressures in smooth polygonal capillaries lago and araujo 2001 studied the capillary entry pressure in capillaries with polygonal cross section when the wettability of capillaries is uniform during primary drainage the threshold pressure is equal to the capillary pressure a cross section of an arbitrary polygon is shown in fig 2 where the contact angle is θ the corner angle is denoted by εi and the drainage radius is r d with some geometric calculations we can get 6 l ns p 2 r d 1 n cos θ cot ε i 2 sin θ δ i 7 l nw 2 r d i 1 n π 2 ε i 2 θ δ i 8 a nw r d 2 f t where 9 δ i 0 ε i π 2 θ 1 ε i π 2 θ 10 f t n θ i 1 n cos θ cos θ cot ε i 2 sin θ π 2 ε i 2 θ δ i then the ms p method gives 11 f t r d 2 p cos θ r d a 0 where f t is an intermediate variable a is the area of the polygon p is the perimeter γ refers to the interfacial tension between wetting phase and non wetting phase and δi is a dimensionless coefficient the wetting phase saturation can be calculated further as 12 s w r d 2 f t a 3 model description 3 1 model assumption the rough surface used in the model is homogeneous and the pillar of the surface is square as shown in fig 3 in which a b d and h are the groove width groove length asperity pillar width and pillar height respectively there are a few ways to measure the surface roughness parameters of real porous media such as the experiment methods of scanning electron microscopy sem quéré 2008 field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem monfared et al 2015 3d laser scanning hoła et al 2015 and atomic force microscopy afm al anssari et al 2016 for some regular arranged porous media fem or fe sem images can provide enough information to estimate the roughness parameters while for irregular arranged porous media 3d laser scanning μm mm or afm nm μm images can help depends on the pore scale to construct an equivalent rough surface similar with fig 3 we need measure the average groove width groove length asperity pillar width and pillar height of porous media surface obtaining the surface morphology surface by experiment methods stated above the roughness parameters in different cross sections then could be calculated averagely the geometrical parameters that characterize the roughness are as follows chandra and yang 2011 13 r f d a d b 4 dh d a d b 14 f lx d d a f ly d d b where r f is the roughness factor which is the ratio of actual surface area to its horizontal projection f lx and f ly represent the ratio of the sum of asperity length to the side length along the groove in the x and y directions respectively the underlying assumptions are that the drainage is along the y axis direction and that the non wetting phase would suspend above or fill in the grooves according to the wetting condition in fact the non wetting phase usually stays in a transition state wherein the non wetting phase only partly penetrates the grooves and there is a wetting fluid film on the base of grooves when the non wetting phase begins to occupy the polygonal cross section the cross section can be divided into two regions the central region inside the shape and the border region including grooves and asperities taking the triangle as shown in fig 4 as an example one region is the triangle inside the blue line the other region is the area between the blue line and red line in the central region the corners still hold the wetting phase but depend on the apparent contact angle rather than young s contact angle on the rough surface denote the film height of wetting phase in a groove as hw then the wetting phase border region holds the can be described by hw the outlines of the two regions the blue and red lines in fig 4 are two similar polygons no matter the polygon is concave or convex denote the perimeter area and corner angle of the polygonal cross section outer polygon as p 0 a 0 and εi and the perimeter and area of the central region inner polygon as p and a respectively the similarity ratio of the inner polygon to the outer polygon k satisfies 15 k p p 0 p 0 2 h cot ε i 2 p 0 in addition the model does not consider contact angle hysteresis however readers can use the receding contact angle instead of the static contact angle if necessary and we will also give some supplementary information on contact angle hysteresis based on lattice boltzmann simulation results 3 2 capillary entry pressures in the rough capillary as shown in fig 5 in the rough capillary the non wetting phase mainly exists in the central region the rest of the non wetting phase fills the grooves of the border region except the corners the triangle is just an example and the model can be applied to all polygons we first calculate the effective area occupied by the non wetting phase a eff i e a nw and the effective length l eff i e l nw l ns cos θ based on fig 6 because they are needed to obtain the entry pressure according to ms p method in eq 4 according to similarity principle the inner polygon area and perimeter are 16 p kp 0 a k 2 a 0 the cross sections in a rough capillary are not always like the structure shown in fig 5 b and there are also some smooth cross sections in one certain direction that means that along the long axis of a pore perpendicular to these cross sections roughness of the pore walls will be present over some fraction of the total pore length and absent everywhere else as shown in fig 6 in fig 6 l ns can be divided to two parts one part is the length of asperity tops and the other part is the immersed height of non wetting fluid in grooves so 17 l ns 1 p 2 r d 1 n cos θ cot ε i 2 sin θ δ i f h w f ly p 2 r d s 1 f h w f ly where f h w 1 h w 0 f lx d d a else s 1 1 n cos θ cot ε i 2 sin θ δ and p 2 r d s 1 is dashed line length in fig 6 b as rough cross sections and smooth cross sections arrange alternately along the y axis direction and the non wetting phase only contacts the solid in rough ones the length is multiplied by f ly here to capture this feature and the other part of l ns is 18 l ns 2 2 h h w p 2 r d s 1 d a f ly then the total l ns is the sum of these two parts 19 l ns l ns 1 l ns 2 v p 2 r d s 1 v f ly f h w 2 h h w d a similarly l nw includes the length of ams and the wetting phase film 20 l nw 1 2 r d i 1 n π 2 ε i 2 θ δ i 21 l nw 2 p 2 r d s 1 f ly 1 f lx p 2 r d s 1 1 f ly f lx 22 l nw l nw 1 l nw 2 2 r d s 2 u p 2 r d s 1 where s 2 i 1 n π 2 ε i 2 θ δ and u 1 f lx f ly the length of dashed line is approximately equal to the red line of border region in fig 6 b in calculating the film length of the smooth capillary cross section next we calculate the non wetting phase area in the inner and border regions respectively 23 a nw 1 a r d 2 cos θ s 1 s 2 24 a nw 2 l nw 2 h h w u p 2 r d s 1 h h w 25 a nw a nw 1 a nw 2 a r d 2 cos θ s 1 s 2 w p 2 r d s 1 where w u h h w from eq 4 the ms p method finally gives 26 2 r d s 2 u p 2 r d s 1 v p 2 r d s 1 cos θ a r d 2 cos θ s 1 s 2 w p 2 r d s 1 1 r d and we can simplify it to the form of eq 11 27 2 u 2 v cos θ cos θ s 1 s 2 r d 2 u v cos θ p 2 ws 1 r d wp a 0 when the surface is smooth r f 1 f lx 1 f ly 1 h w h then θ θ u 0 w 0 and v 1 it follows that eq 27 reduces to 28 2 u 2 v cos θ cos θ s 1 s 2 cos θ s 1 s 2 f t 29 u v cos θ p 2 ws 1 p cos θ wp a a comparing eq 27 with eq 11 in such case we find they are equivalent which means that for smooth capillaries eq 11 can be recovered from eq 27 by solving eq 27 we can obtain the threshold drainage radius and calculate the capillary entry pressure by eq 5 moreover the saturation can be calculated by 30 s w 1 a nw a 0 1 f ly f ly a 0 f lx p 0 h 4 model verification to solve eq 27 we first have to identify two parameters i e the apparent contact angle and the wetting phase film height in this section we obtain these two parameters by the lattice boltzmann method lbm simulation moreover the capillary entry pressure in rough capillaries are analyzed using lbm simulation and then we compare the semi analytical model against numerical simulation results 4 1 shan chen multicomponent lattice boltzmann model the lattice boltzmann method is a pseudo molecular method that tracks the evolution of the particle distribution function of an assembly of molecules for single phase flow it follows the lbgk evolution equation derived from the boltzmann equation bhatnagar et al 1954 31 f i x e i δ t t δ t f i x t 1 τ f i x t f i eq x t where f i eq x t is the density distribution function x is the spatial position e i is the discrete velocity along the ith lattice direction τ is the relaxation time and f i eq x t is the corresponding equilibrium distribution function the equilibrium distribution functions depend on the particular velocity model and can be calculated as 32 f i eq x t ω i ρ 1 e i u c s 2 e i u 2 2 c s 4 u 2 2 c s 2 where w i s are weights and c s is the sound speed ρ and u are the macroscopic density and the macroscopic velocity vector respectively which can be calculated from 33 ρ i f i u 1 ρ i f i e i the shan chen multiphase lattice boltzmann model or the pseudopotential multiphase model was originally proposed by shan and chen shan and chen 1993 shan and chen 1994 and its intermolecular interactions are represented by a density dependent pseudopotential it includes two kinds of models namely single component multiphase scmp model and multicomponent multiphase model mcmp sukop and thorne 2006 as the mcmp model is used in later verifications here we only introduce the mcmp model for the sake of conciseness in the mcmp lattice boltzmann model each fluid component follows a similar lbgk evolution equation eq 31 as in single phase flow the equilibrium velocity of the σ th component is modified to carry the effect of the interactive and adhesive forces 34 u eq u τ σ f int σ f ads σ ρ σ where f int σ is the fluid fluid interactive force between different components f ads σ is the fluid solid interactive force and u is a composite macroscopic velocity defined as u σ i f i σ e i τ σ i ρ i σ τ σ in order to simulate separation between different components in multicomponent fluids non local interactions between fluid particles are incorporated via the following fluid fluid interactive force f int σ x t ρ σ x t g int σ σ i ω i ρ σ x e i δ t t e i where σ and σ represent different components and g int σ σ is a parameter that controls the interaction force between the different components the adhesive or solid surface force on the σ th component can be computed as follows martys and chen 1996 35 f ads σ x t g ads σ ρ σ x t i ω i s x e i δ t t e i where the s x e i δ t t is an indicator function that is equal to 1 or 0 for a solid or fluid domain node g ads σ is a parameter that controls the strength of the interfacial tension between the solid and σ th component 4 2 wetting theory on rough surfaces logistic model the well known wenzel model and cassie baxter model have been reported to only be applicable to certain conditions morrow 1975 milne and amirfazli 2012 carmeliet et al 2017 for example the drop size must be sufficiently large compared with the surface roughness scale for the wenzel equation and the cassie baxter equation is only correct for the case of flat topped pillar geometry without any penetration of the liquid based on previous understanding of physical mechanisms on rough surface wetting theory we propose a new equation for wenzel state from the perspective of mathematical modeling as the young s contact angle is always smaller than 90 when non wetting phase invades the wetting phase in the described semi analytical model we only need to model the wetting behavior of hydrophilic rough surfaces on which the droplet always stay in wenzel state bico et al 2002 logistic population growth is a famous model to predict population in the logistic model the carrying capacity restricts the population from growing infinitely and population regulation is a density dependent process meaning that population growth rates are regulated by the density of a population verhulst 1845 denote the maximum value of young s contact angle θ that makes the apparent contact angle decrease to 0 as θ c on a rough surface i e when young s contact angle is smaller than this critical value the apparent contact angle is always 0 when θ θ c assuming θ increases with roughness factor rf on a rough surface and the growth rates are related to θ and the carrying capacity θ max 90 then the logistic model is 36 θ 90 1 90 θ θ θ c e m r f 1 θ θ c where m is the growth rate θ c is the critical contact angle and they both depend on the design of the rough surface we design three rough surfaces according to fig 3 namely h 1 a b d 2 h 2 a b d 2 and h 4 a b d 2 the roughness factors are 1 5 2 and 3 respectively the shan chen multicomponent lattice boltzmann model is initialized to mimic wetting behaviors on both smooth and rough surfaces the d3q19 velocity model is used and the major density for wetting phase or non wetting phase is 8 0 g int σ σ 0 225 and different wetting conditions are achieved by adjusting g ads σ the simulation domain size is 120 120 80 and the initial droplet size is 30 bounce back boundaries are applied to the solid walls and the other boundaries are periodic three simulation results when r f 3 are shown in figs 7 and 8 summarizes data concerning all the results for the three rough surfaces we also do curve fitting between young s contact angles and the apparent contact angle based on eq 36 the curves match well with simulation results further the growth rate and critical contact angle on this type of rough surface are given by 37 m 0 55 ln r f 0 016 r f 1 θ c 30 5 ln r f 4 3 fluid distribution in rough capillaries under quasi static in this section we observe the steady fluid distribution in rough capillaries using the shan chen lb model a half rough and half smooth tube with a solid bottom is designed as shown in fig 9 in simulation the smooth half is initialized with wetting phase and the rough half with non wetting phase the redistribution of fluid is then calculated by lbm similar to a capillary rise process fig 10 compares two different fluid configurations from simulations in fig 10 a the ams appear in corners while this would never happen for the smooth capillary when θ 45 see eq 9 this is because the rough surface decreases the contact angle so that ams can form with an apparent contact angle smaller than 45 it is also notable that there are wetting phase films around the wall surfaces which is consistent with the assumption in section 3 in fig 10 b we give an example of the fluid distribution in a pore of isosceles right triangular cross section where the upper angle is 90 the roughness factor is smaller and the apparent contact angle is not small enough to form am in the right angle but it is wetting enough to form ams in the 45 base angles meanwhile there almost no wetting phase films on the walls for the poor wetting condition we can also measure the wetting phase film height by calculate the density in grooves of the tube slice as the density profile in the tube is continuous in the lbm simulation results the film height can be estimated by the quotient of the wetting phase density in one groove divided by the major density of the wetting phase around 8 0 in the equilibrium state fig 11 gives an example of wetting phase density profile of tube slices when h 4 similar with the results in fig 10 there are almost no wetting film in grooves when θ 62 37 while the films exist when θ 45 we also fit a curve between young s contact angle and film height based on lbm simulation which demonstrates that it is a sigmoid like curve as shown in fig 12 the wetting film height as a function of young s contact angle satisfies 38 h w 1 1 1 e 0 12 θ 45 h note that in a vapor fluid system in capillaries there are also film adsorption on surfaces either in smooth surface or rough surface but mainly determined by disjoining pressure we cannot consider this feature in this model and tuller et al 1999 gave more details on the adsorption and capillary condensation in porous media 4 4 capillary entry pressure in rough capillaries as oblique lines in the regular lattice grid system leads to zigzag boundaries during lb simulation we use square capillary rather than triangular capillary to verify the semi analytical model in this section a whole smooth or whole rough capillary tube with domain size of 64 64 120 note that the inscribed circle radius of cross section is 31 because the edge is solid is designed as shown in fig 13 the capillary is full of wetting phase at the simulation beginning with density of 8 0 and we meanwhile add non wetting wetting phase reservoirs on the top bottom consisting of additional three layers by droplet test the interface tension γ nw was calculated by laplace s law and the value is 0 9458 when the major density is 8 0 for each phase pressure boundary conditions equivalent to densities are applied to the first layer of the non wetting phase reservoir and the last layer of the wetting phase reservoir to simulate the primary drainage process we started from zero capillary pressure which was achieved by fixing non wetting phase and wetting phase densities in the first layer and last layer of the reservoir respectively pan et al 2004 zhang et al 2016 the density on the bottom was fixed at 7 95 and the density on the top was increased from 7 95 to 8 40 the driving pressure increased gradually and non wetting phase began to enter the tube and displace the wetting phase in the initially wetting phase saturated capillary finally we obtain a series of p c γ nw s w curves for the smooth and rough capillaries under different wetting conditions and with different roughness factors then we can compare the simulated and analytical entry pressure and here we take the rough one when r f 3 h 4 a b d 2 as an example when θ 32 52 h w 0 725 h and apparent angle θ 0 the analytical entry pressure p c γ nw calculated from extended ms p model from section 3 for a rough capillary is 0 0695 and that for a smooth capillary calculated from general ms p method is 0 0536 primary drainage curves obtained by lbm simulations under the same conditions are shown in fig 14 in which we can make a tangent line at the inflection point not the point where the second derivative is equal to 0 but the point where the curve become much steeper of the capillary pressure curve the intersection point between the tangent line and y axis is the capillary entry pressure the value is 0 0720 and 0 0560 for the rough capillary and the smooth one respectively the relative error is smaller than 5 and we obtain good agreement of the simulated and analytical entry pressure fig 15 summarizes another five pairs of simulation results against the semi analytical model though the relative error is larger than 5 in some cases there is good agreement overall we also give three displacement processes driven by the entry pressure in a rough capillary under different wetting conditions corresponding to the cases in fig 7 to show the differences it can be seen from fig 16 that the non wetting phase enters the middle channel for low flow resistance then the non wetting phase tries to penetrate into the grooves on the rough surface however due to the wetting film adsorbed on the walls the non wetting phase can only penetrate partly under strong wetting conditions fig 16 a while in the case when the wetting condition is not strong enough the non wetting phase can fill most grooves on the surface and the displacement process like a two step layered flow fill the middle first and then the surface fig 16 b moreover when the wettability becomes poorer the non wetting phase even can penetrate the grooves at the first step fig 16 c 4 5 contact angle hysteresis in rough capillaries the contact angle hysteresis is influenced by many mixing factors such as the droplet size flow velocity as well as the surface roughness and it s hard to illustrate it separately in this section we will only discuss the contact angle hysteresis in few rough capillaries under small pressure difference there are usually three ways in literatures to study the contact angle hysteresis usually measured by the difference between the advancing contact angle and receding contact angle 1 slowly increasing the volume of a drop or sucking the liquid and observing contact lines gao and mccarthy 2006 during the increase of drop volume the contact line first remains stuck before it suddenly jumps above a critical volume the maximum observed angle is the so called advancing contact angle θ a if we afterwards decrease the volume of the drop and determine the contact angle just before the wetting line is receding we measure the so called receding contact angle θ r 2 droplet moving driven by the body force or external force the contact angle is different at the front and at the rear of the drop contact line always stays stationary and the droplet only deforms if the instantaneous receding contact angle and advancing contact angle don t arrive certain critical values ba et al 2016 studied the contact angle hysteresis on topologically structured surfaces using lbm and analyzed the critical capillary number for droplet slipping 3 liquid column motion due to capillary force such as measuring the contact angles by wilhelmy plate method the measure of receding contact angle or advancing contact angle depends on the relative movement direction of the plate in our study we focus on the contact hysteresis in a capillary so we construct a similar model according to joanny and de gennes 1984 i e a wetting phase column is initialized in the middle of a capillary while the other space is filled with non wetting phase pressure boundary conditions are applied to inlet and outlet and the pressure difference is relatively small than the capillary entry pressure eliminate the effects of large flow velocity so that the non wetting phase will invade the wetting phase from both capillary ends forming the advance receding contact angle and advancing contact angle as shown in fig 17 a in the following simulation we only consider the similar capillaries in section 4 4 the domain size of the capillary is 64 64 128 the inlet and outlet are non wetting reservoir consisting of 20 layers the 21th layers 108th layers along the z axis is the capillary before simulation the 40th 90th layers are filled with wetting phase and the first layer density of inlet and outlet are fixed at 8 03 and 8 0 respectively as shown in fig 17 b contact angle hysteresis under different wetting conditions θ 78 9 62 3 and 32 5 in different rough capillaries rf 1 1 5 2 and 3 are simulated by lbm the results are shown in fig 18 firstly it can be seen that the roughness decreasing the advancing and receding contact angle simultaneously then by measuring receding contact angle in rough capillaries we find that the receding contact angle is close to the corresponding apparent contact angle in strong wetting conditions while the receding contact angle in poor wetting conditions seems tend to larger than the corresponding apparent angle which maybe is due to the limited simulation time step in addition the difference between the advancing contact angle and receding contact angle contact hysteresis stays relative stable and do not show a clear changing pattern in brief in our simulations we can say that the roughness can decreasing the receding contact angle further but it does not mean the roughness is bound to promote the contact hysteresis moreover if the contact angle hysteresis is ignored in the new proposed model the accuracy may be influenced in poor wetting conditions 5 results and discussion define the dimensionless capillary entry pressure as p cnorm p cr p cs where p cs is the capillary entry pressure in a smooth capillary and p cr is the capillary entry pressure in a rough capillary of the same size refer to capillaries in fig 5 introduce five dimensionless variables to describe how the roughness influences the capillary entry pressure in different wetting conditions α a d β b d ω d p 0 λ h r in g a 0 p 0 2 where r in is the inscribed radius of the polygon and g is the shape factor we take triangles as examples to analyze the influencing factors in this section the triangles can be constructed using method patzek s 2001 for convenience the inscribed radius of the triangle is set to one also readers can refer to wei s 2015 method if n sided polygon construction is needed wei et al 2015 the apparent angles and film height are calculated by eqs 36 38 5 1 analysis of influencing factors groove length and groove width let h 0 1 b 0 05 or a 0 05 d 0 05 g 0 024 then construct various shapes with different groove length or groove width leading to various values of α or β after this calculate capillary behaviors using the proposed model in section 3 α and β can indicate the impact of groove length and groove width on the capillary behavior respectively fig 19 gives the information concerning how p cnorm changes with groove length and contact angle overall p cnorm is larger than one which means that the rough capillary entry pressure is always larger than the smooth one under the same conditions moreover p cnorm shows a dramatic rise with the increase of contact angle however it remains stable at different values of α when the contact angle is smaller than 40 this is because the reciprocal of cos θ is greater when the contact angle is bigger meanwhile the rough surface would make the contact angle smaller and the range of the drop is much bigger under poor wetting conditions than that in good wetting conditions that is to say cos θ cos θ plays a key role in this rising trend and the rough surface can t decrease the apparent angle significantly p cnorm also decreases a little with the increase of α for the gradually declining roughness factor however it is clear from the subgraph of fig 19 that there is a dramatic decline in r f with the increase of α which means that α has little influence on p cnorm even under poor wetting conditions though there is a subtle difference due to the drainage direction i e the influence of f ly our results indicate that the influence of groove width on the capillary behavior is similar to that of groove length for they exert the similar impact on r f according to the subgraph in fig 19 5 2 analysis of influencing factors asperity width similarly let a 0 05 b 0 05 h 0 1 g 0 024 then construct various shapes with different asperity width leading to various values of ω thus ω illustrates the influence of asperity width fig 20 summarizes the simulation results in terms of how p cnorm changes with ω under different wetting conditions p cnorm grows noticeably with the rise of contact angle at small ω while it declines with ω when the contact angle is large enough it increases gradually at its initial stage and then peaks at a certain point with the increase of ω after the peak point it decreases gradually this is because the roughness factor fluctuates with ω in a similar pattern as shown in the subgraph of fig 20 in addition the degree of decrease is larger than the influence of α in section 4 1 p cnorm is still not sensitive to the roughness factor under strong wetting conditions 5 3 analysis of influencing factors asperity height construct various shapes with different asperity height making sure that a 0 05 b 0 05 d 0 05 and g 0 024 fig 21 compares the statistics regarding the capillary behaviors in rough capillaries when the asperity height and contact angle vary then λ can illustrate the influence of asperity height in general p cnorm increases with λ and contact angle however there is a slight drop for p cnorm with the increase of λ under poor wetting conditions this can happen when the roughness factor is large enough and decreases the apparent angle significantly under poor wetting conditions moreover it seems that λ exerts more impacts on this upward trend than α and ω for it decreases the effective radius of capillary directly 5 4 analysis of influencing factors shape factor shape factor has an important influence on the wetting phase saturation construct different shapes making sure that a 0 05 b 0 05 d 0 05 and h 0 1 fig 22 provides statistics concerning the performance of the wetting saturation of these shapes in rough and smooth capillaries as shown in fig 22 the wetting saturation in rough capillaries is larger than in smooth capillaries two combined factors contribute to this on the one hand the rough surface narrows the pore space and the grooves are filled with wetting phase film on the other hand the rough surface would make the apparent contact angle smaller which means more wetting phase could exist in the corners in addition the wetting saturation in rough capillaries shows a similar trend with that in smooth capillaries i e the wetting saturation decreases with the shape factor and the contact angle this is because the bigger the shape factor is the more regular the shape is and as a result there would be less corner space to hold wetting phase also the increasing contact angle would narrow the space of wetting phase in the corners which is stated clearly by wei et al 2015 there is a slight difference in that the wetting phase in rough capillaries would decrease more quickly after a certain point with the increase of the contact angle to conclude both the wetting phase saturation and entry pressure of rough capillaries are always larger than those of smooth ones under the same conditions and fig 14 show good evidence of this point furthermore the capillary entry pressure is not sensitive to the roughness factor under strong wetting conditions as to the magnitude of their relative effects on rough capillary entry pressure under middle or poor wetting conditions the contact angle ranks first then the asperity height followed by the asperity width and groove length width is last 6 conclusions to sum up we propose a semi analytical model based on the ms p and wetting theories of rough surfaces to calculate the capillary entry pressure in rough capillaries with polygonal cross sections we provide a new logistic wetting equation to calculate the apparent contact angle in the wenzel state and to verify the model with lattice boltzmann method simulations using this model we discuss capillary behavior under different conditions first both the wetting phase saturation and entry pressure of rough capillaries are larger than those of smooth ones under the same conditions the effective radius of the capillary would decrease and the contact angle would be smaller in the rough capillary meanwhile the rough surface would also change the phase distribution for example there would be a wetting phase film adsorbed on surface moreover the contact angle and asperity height have a more significant influence on capillary entry pressure than any other factors followed by asperity width and groove length width in general the capillary entry pressure changes only slightly with the roughness factor under strong wetting conditions acknowledgments the authors greatly appreciate the ﬁnancial support of the national natural science foundation

7205,we develop a semi analytical model to calculate the entry pressure in rough capillaries based on an energy balance principle and wetting theory on rough surfaces during the drainage process we assume fluids form arc menisci at corners of capillary cross sections depending on the apparent angle and that there is a wetting phase film adsorbed on the rough surface depending on the wetting condition a logistic model is proposed to explain the contact angle dependence on the structure of rough surfaces then the capillary entry pressure is calculated by extended ms p mayer stowe and princen method we verify the model using the pseudopotential lattice boltzmann model and obtain good agreement between the analytical and simulated pressures taking capillaries with triangular sections with pillar pillar type rough surfaces as example we discuss how rough structures and contact angles influence capillary behaviors the results reveal that both the wetting phase saturation and entry pressure of rough capillaries are larger than those in smooth capillaries under the same conditions moreover the entry pressure is not sensitive to the roughness factor under strong wetting conditions and is much more sensitive to the pillar asperity height than the other structure parameters keywords rough surface capillary entry pressure ms p method lattice boltzmann method 1 introduction the phenomena of flow through porous media are ubiquitous in nature and artificial materials some examples include the oil flow underground microcirculation of blood in animals and gas migration in packed bed the pore scale ranges from nanometers to micrometers in porous media such as tight sandstone and shale which requires researchers to pay more attention to pore scale flow to further reveal flow mechanisms the shape of the pore space in porous media is irregular and the connectivity is complex also the flow often involves multiple fluids one popular tool used to model multi phase flow at pore scale is pore network modeling where the porous medium is described as a network of pores connected by capillaries using an idealized geometry blunt et al 2002 that in the simplest case are considered either completely full or completely empty depending on the capillary pressure however there will always be some fluid remaining in the corners both after drainage a non wetting fluid displaces a wetting fluid and imbibition a wetting fluid displaces a non wetting fluid processes so pores or throats in such networks are usually assumed to have angular cross sectional shapes such as triangle square and star to hold the fluid phase in a mathematically tractable way we focus on a quasi static primary drainage process controlled by capillary pressure in the following discussion i e the flow rate is very low and the capillary number is small hanspal et al 2013 no matter whether in experiments or simulations capillary behavior is the basis for getting the capillary pressure curve and the relative permeability curve zhang and yu 2016 ye et al 2017 an important property of capillary behavior is the value of the capillary entry pressure or threshold pressure i e the minimum pressure difference required for the non wetting fluid to penetrate a capillary filled with a wetting fluid the most popular theoretical model to calculate the capillary entry pressure is the so called ms p method which was originally proposed by mayer and stowe 1965 and further developed by princen 1969a b 1970 based on the ms p method oren et al 1998 derived the threshold pressures of triangular tubes under different flow conditions oren and bakke 1998 and lago et al 2001 derived the threshold pressure in a capillary with a polygonal cross section lago and araujo 2001 however most of the works ignore pore surface roughness in pore scale modeling though it influences the contact angle and contact angle hysteresis significantly hecht et al 2013 mortazavi et al 2013 as well as affecting energy consumption due to interface contact between fluids and solids during flow the surface roughness plays an important role in many flow processes for example with nanoparticles injection into porous media particles would be adsorbed onto the surface driven by dlvo forces forming a rough surface rao 2010 chowdhury et al 2011 consequently both the contact angle and microstructure of the surface would change during the flow process the influence of surface roughness on the apparent contact angle of the droplet is generally understood as lying between two theoretically extreme situations i e the cassie baxter c b state and wenzel state cassie 1948 wenzel 1949 whyman and bormashenko 2008 in the c b state the droplet remains suspended above the asperities in the surface in the wenzel state the droplet fills the grooves between the roughness elements admittedly these two classical models are not always accurate since they fail to capture the effect of many interactions occurring during wetting such as the heterogeneity lundgren et al 2007 hierarchical structure badge et al 2013 and geometry of bumps or cavities on the surface afferrante and carbone 2014 in addition the wetting state could change under certain conditions for example there would be a transition from cassie to wenzel state when the drop is acted on by an external force or the structure of the rough surface is modified guo et al 2014 thus some more accurate state equations have been developed but mainly are extensions of these two models bormashenko 2015 in this study we also derive a new equation for the wenzel wetting state and verify the model by lattice boltzmann lb simulation results rather than from physical mechanisms we propose the new equation from the perspective of mathematical modeling using a logistic model extrand 2007 studied retention forces of a liquid slug in a rough capillary tube with symmetric or asymmetric features and the imbalance of capillary forces that leads to directionally biased wetting was examined a model was described by butt 2008 to calculate capillary forces between solid surfaces analytically using the kelvin equation in which roughness is considered with an asperity distribution function there were also many other numerical methods reported to study capillary behavior in rough capillaries liu et al 2007 rostami and streator 2017 however these methods are generally complex and do not offer straightforward linkages between capillary behavior and flow as to the theory on capillary entry pressure considering rough surfaces though tsakiroglou and payatakes add pore wall roughness features to a network model using concepts from fractal geometry tsakiroglou and payatakes 1993 they did not give an analytical model to enable calculation of the capillary entry pressure exactly based on the microstructure of pore shapes in this work we present a semi analytical expression for the capillary entry pressure for the case of rough capillaries with polygonal cross sections using the ms p method and verify the model using lb simulation capillary entry pressures in smooth capillaries are compared with those in rough capillaries a study of the dependence of the capillary behavior on the shape factor contact angle groove width and asperity width and height is done for triangle shapes the study is not only useful for revealing flow mechanisms at micro and nano scales but also attractive for a variety of industry applications such as oil development wastewater treatment and mems based fluidic devices 2 theory background in this section we will introduce ms p method and its application to calculate capillary entry pressure in capillaries with polygonal cross section 2 1 ms p method capillary forces prevent non wetting fluid from spontaneously entering wetting fluid filled throats when the non wetting fluid invades the wetting fluid in a non circular capillary non wetting fluid can only enter an available throat if the capillary pressure exceeds the threshold capillary pressure at which point the wetting phase will be displaced from the central region leaving some residual in the corners the invading meniscus is referred to as the main terminal meniscus mtm while the menisci formed in the cross sectional plane are referred to as arc menisci ams mason and morrow 1991 in the absence of gravity the ms p method for calculating the capillary entry pressures relies on equating the curvature of the ams to that of the mtm there is a critical contact angle for the occurrence of ams in the corner that is to say only when the contact angle is smaller than the critical contact angle of the corner can the mtm and ams appears simultaneously fig 1 shows a three dimensional example where non wetting fluid invades wetting fluid in a square capillary in which there is a co occurrence of ams and mtm in strong wetting conditions while there is no am in poor wetting condition the capillary pressure p c is calculated as follows 1 p c p n p w where the subscripts w and n refer to the wetting and non wetting phases respectively if the ams are displaced a small distance dx the work of the displacement must be balanced by the change in surface free energy 2 p c a eff dx l nw γ nw l ns γ ns l ns γ ws dx where the subscript s indicates the solid a eff is the effective area occupied by the non wetting phase l ns is the length of the solid wall in contact with the non wetting phase l nw is the perimeter of the ams and γ is the interfacial tension when the contact angle is θ young s equation yields the following 3 γ ns γ ws γ nw cos θ and the energy balance equation can be simplified as follows 4 p c γ nw l nw l ns cos θ a eff l eff a eff if the radius of the threshold drainage curvature is r d threshold radius the young laplace equation yields the following 5 p c γ nw r d the capillary entry pressure and the threshold drainage radius are then obtained by solving eqs 4 and 5 the wetting phase saturation is calculated based on the geometrical characteristics of the cross section 2 2 capillary entry pressures in smooth polygonal capillaries lago and araujo 2001 studied the capillary entry pressure in capillaries with polygonal cross section when the wettability of capillaries is uniform during primary drainage the threshold pressure is equal to the capillary pressure a cross section of an arbitrary polygon is shown in fig 2 where the contact angle is θ the corner angle is denoted by εi and the drainage radius is r d with some geometric calculations we can get 6 l ns p 2 r d 1 n cos θ cot ε i 2 sin θ δ i 7 l nw 2 r d i 1 n π 2 ε i 2 θ δ i 8 a nw r d 2 f t where 9 δ i 0 ε i π 2 θ 1 ε i π 2 θ 10 f t n θ i 1 n cos θ cos θ cot ε i 2 sin θ π 2 ε i 2 θ δ i then the ms p method gives 11 f t r d 2 p cos θ r d a 0 where f t is an intermediate variable a is the area of the polygon p is the perimeter γ refers to the interfacial tension between wetting phase and non wetting phase and δi is a dimensionless coefficient the wetting phase saturation can be calculated further as 12 s w r d 2 f t a 3 model description 3 1 model assumption the rough surface used in the model is homogeneous and the pillar of the surface is square as shown in fig 3 in which a b d and h are the groove width groove length asperity pillar width and pillar height respectively there are a few ways to measure the surface roughness parameters of real porous media such as the experiment methods of scanning electron microscopy sem quéré 2008 field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem monfared et al 2015 3d laser scanning hoła et al 2015 and atomic force microscopy afm al anssari et al 2016 for some regular arranged porous media fem or fe sem images can provide enough information to estimate the roughness parameters while for irregular arranged porous media 3d laser scanning μm mm or afm nm μm images can help depends on the pore scale to construct an equivalent rough surface similar with fig 3 we need measure the average groove width groove length asperity pillar width and pillar height of porous media surface obtaining the surface morphology surface by experiment methods stated above the roughness parameters in different cross sections then could be calculated averagely the geometrical parameters that characterize the roughness are as follows chandra and yang 2011 13 r f d a d b 4 dh d a d b 14 f lx d d a f ly d d b where r f is the roughness factor which is the ratio of actual surface area to its horizontal projection f lx and f ly represent the ratio of the sum of asperity length to the side length along the groove in the x and y directions respectively the underlying assumptions are that the drainage is along the y axis direction and that the non wetting phase would suspend above or fill in the grooves according to the wetting condition in fact the non wetting phase usually stays in a transition state wherein the non wetting phase only partly penetrates the grooves and there is a wetting fluid film on the base of grooves when the non wetting phase begins to occupy the polygonal cross section the cross section can be divided into two regions the central region inside the shape and the border region including grooves and asperities taking the triangle as shown in fig 4 as an example one region is the triangle inside the blue line the other region is the area between the blue line and red line in the central region the corners still hold the wetting phase but depend on the apparent contact angle rather than young s contact angle on the rough surface denote the film height of wetting phase in a groove as hw then the wetting phase border region holds the can be described by hw the outlines of the two regions the blue and red lines in fig 4 are two similar polygons no matter the polygon is concave or convex denote the perimeter area and corner angle of the polygonal cross section outer polygon as p 0 a 0 and εi and the perimeter and area of the central region inner polygon as p and a respectively the similarity ratio of the inner polygon to the outer polygon k satisfies 15 k p p 0 p 0 2 h cot ε i 2 p 0 in addition the model does not consider contact angle hysteresis however readers can use the receding contact angle instead of the static contact angle if necessary and we will also give some supplementary information on contact angle hysteresis based on lattice boltzmann simulation results 3 2 capillary entry pressures in the rough capillary as shown in fig 5 in the rough capillary the non wetting phase mainly exists in the central region the rest of the non wetting phase fills the grooves of the border region except the corners the triangle is just an example and the model can be applied to all polygons we first calculate the effective area occupied by the non wetting phase a eff i e a nw and the effective length l eff i e l nw l ns cos θ based on fig 6 because they are needed to obtain the entry pressure according to ms p method in eq 4 according to similarity principle the inner polygon area and perimeter are 16 p kp 0 a k 2 a 0 the cross sections in a rough capillary are not always like the structure shown in fig 5 b and there are also some smooth cross sections in one certain direction that means that along the long axis of a pore perpendicular to these cross sections roughness of the pore walls will be present over some fraction of the total pore length and absent everywhere else as shown in fig 6 in fig 6 l ns can be divided to two parts one part is the length of asperity tops and the other part is the immersed height of non wetting fluid in grooves so 17 l ns 1 p 2 r d 1 n cos θ cot ε i 2 sin θ δ i f h w f ly p 2 r d s 1 f h w f ly where f h w 1 h w 0 f lx d d a else s 1 1 n cos θ cot ε i 2 sin θ δ and p 2 r d s 1 is dashed line length in fig 6 b as rough cross sections and smooth cross sections arrange alternately along the y axis direction and the non wetting phase only contacts the solid in rough ones the length is multiplied by f ly here to capture this feature and the other part of l ns is 18 l ns 2 2 h h w p 2 r d s 1 d a f ly then the total l ns is the sum of these two parts 19 l ns l ns 1 l ns 2 v p 2 r d s 1 v f ly f h w 2 h h w d a similarly l nw includes the length of ams and the wetting phase film 20 l nw 1 2 r d i 1 n π 2 ε i 2 θ δ i 21 l nw 2 p 2 r d s 1 f ly 1 f lx p 2 r d s 1 1 f ly f lx 22 l nw l nw 1 l nw 2 2 r d s 2 u p 2 r d s 1 where s 2 i 1 n π 2 ε i 2 θ δ and u 1 f lx f ly the length of dashed line is approximately equal to the red line of border region in fig 6 b in calculating the film length of the smooth capillary cross section next we calculate the non wetting phase area in the inner and border regions respectively 23 a nw 1 a r d 2 cos θ s 1 s 2 24 a nw 2 l nw 2 h h w u p 2 r d s 1 h h w 25 a nw a nw 1 a nw 2 a r d 2 cos θ s 1 s 2 w p 2 r d s 1 where w u h h w from eq 4 the ms p method finally gives 26 2 r d s 2 u p 2 r d s 1 v p 2 r d s 1 cos θ a r d 2 cos θ s 1 s 2 w p 2 r d s 1 1 r d and we can simplify it to the form of eq 11 27 2 u 2 v cos θ cos θ s 1 s 2 r d 2 u v cos θ p 2 ws 1 r d wp a 0 when the surface is smooth r f 1 f lx 1 f ly 1 h w h then θ θ u 0 w 0 and v 1 it follows that eq 27 reduces to 28 2 u 2 v cos θ cos θ s 1 s 2 cos θ s 1 s 2 f t 29 u v cos θ p 2 ws 1 p cos θ wp a a comparing eq 27 with eq 11 in such case we find they are equivalent which means that for smooth capillaries eq 11 can be recovered from eq 27 by solving eq 27 we can obtain the threshold drainage radius and calculate the capillary entry pressure by eq 5 moreover the saturation can be calculated by 30 s w 1 a nw a 0 1 f ly f ly a 0 f lx p 0 h 4 model verification to solve eq 27 we first have to identify two parameters i e the apparent contact angle and the wetting phase film height in this section we obtain these two parameters by the lattice boltzmann method lbm simulation moreover the capillary entry pressure in rough capillaries are analyzed using lbm simulation and then we compare the semi analytical model against numerical simulation results 4 1 shan chen multicomponent lattice boltzmann model the lattice boltzmann method is a pseudo molecular method that tracks the evolution of the particle distribution function of an assembly of molecules for single phase flow it follows the lbgk evolution equation derived from the boltzmann equation bhatnagar et al 1954 31 f i x e i δ t t δ t f i x t 1 τ f i x t f i eq x t where f i eq x t is the density distribution function x is the spatial position e i is the discrete velocity along the ith lattice direction τ is the relaxation time and f i eq x t is the corresponding equilibrium distribution function the equilibrium distribution functions depend on the particular velocity model and can be calculated as 32 f i eq x t ω i ρ 1 e i u c s 2 e i u 2 2 c s 4 u 2 2 c s 2 where w i s are weights and c s is the sound speed ρ and u are the macroscopic density and the macroscopic velocity vector respectively which can be calculated from 33 ρ i f i u 1 ρ i f i e i the shan chen multiphase lattice boltzmann model or the pseudopotential multiphase model was originally proposed by shan and chen shan and chen 1993 shan and chen 1994 and its intermolecular interactions are represented by a density dependent pseudopotential it includes two kinds of models namely single component multiphase scmp model and multicomponent multiphase model mcmp sukop and thorne 2006 as the mcmp model is used in later verifications here we only introduce the mcmp model for the sake of conciseness in the mcmp lattice boltzmann model each fluid component follows a similar lbgk evolution equation eq 31 as in single phase flow the equilibrium velocity of the σ th component is modified to carry the effect of the interactive and adhesive forces 34 u eq u τ σ f int σ f ads σ ρ σ where f int σ is the fluid fluid interactive force between different components f ads σ is the fluid solid interactive force and u is a composite macroscopic velocity defined as u σ i f i σ e i τ σ i ρ i σ τ σ in order to simulate separation between different components in multicomponent fluids non local interactions between fluid particles are incorporated via the following fluid fluid interactive force f int σ x t ρ σ x t g int σ σ i ω i ρ σ x e i δ t t e i where σ and σ represent different components and g int σ σ is a parameter that controls the interaction force between the different components the adhesive or solid surface force on the σ th component can be computed as follows martys and chen 1996 35 f ads σ x t g ads σ ρ σ x t i ω i s x e i δ t t e i where the s x e i δ t t is an indicator function that is equal to 1 or 0 for a solid or fluid domain node g ads σ is a parameter that controls the strength of the interfacial tension between the solid and σ th component 4 2 wetting theory on rough surfaces logistic model the well known wenzel model and cassie baxter model have been reported to only be applicable to certain conditions morrow 1975 milne and amirfazli 2012 carmeliet et al 2017 for example the drop size must be sufficiently large compared with the surface roughness scale for the wenzel equation and the cassie baxter equation is only correct for the case of flat topped pillar geometry without any penetration of the liquid based on previous understanding of physical mechanisms on rough surface wetting theory we propose a new equation for wenzel state from the perspective of mathematical modeling as the young s contact angle is always smaller than 90 when non wetting phase invades the wetting phase in the described semi analytical model we only need to model the wetting behavior of hydrophilic rough surfaces on which the droplet always stay in wenzel state bico et al 2002 logistic population growth is a famous model to predict population in the logistic model the carrying capacity restricts the population from growing infinitely and population regulation is a density dependent process meaning that population growth rates are regulated by the density of a population verhulst 1845 denote the maximum value of young s contact angle θ that makes the apparent contact angle decrease to 0 as θ c on a rough surface i e when young s contact angle is smaller than this critical value the apparent contact angle is always 0 when θ θ c assuming θ increases with roughness factor rf on a rough surface and the growth rates are related to θ and the carrying capacity θ max 90 then the logistic model is 36 θ 90 1 90 θ θ θ c e m r f 1 θ θ c where m is the growth rate θ c is the critical contact angle and they both depend on the design of the rough surface we design three rough surfaces according to fig 3 namely h 1 a b d 2 h 2 a b d 2 and h 4 a b d 2 the roughness factors are 1 5 2 and 3 respectively the shan chen multicomponent lattice boltzmann model is initialized to mimic wetting behaviors on both smooth and rough surfaces the d3q19 velocity model is used and the major density for wetting phase or non wetting phase is 8 0 g int σ σ 0 225 and different wetting conditions are achieved by adjusting g ads σ the simulation domain size is 120 120 80 and the initial droplet size is 30 bounce back boundaries are applied to the solid walls and the other boundaries are periodic three simulation results when r f 3 are shown in figs 7 and 8 summarizes data concerning all the results for the three rough surfaces we also do curve fitting between young s contact angles and the apparent contact angle based on eq 36 the curves match well with simulation results further the growth rate and critical contact angle on this type of rough surface are given by 37 m 0 55 ln r f 0 016 r f 1 θ c 30 5 ln r f 4 3 fluid distribution in rough capillaries under quasi static in this section we observe the steady fluid distribution in rough capillaries using the shan chen lb model a half rough and half smooth tube with a solid bottom is designed as shown in fig 9 in simulation the smooth half is initialized with wetting phase and the rough half with non wetting phase the redistribution of fluid is then calculated by lbm similar to a capillary rise process fig 10 compares two different fluid configurations from simulations in fig 10 a the ams appear in corners while this would never happen for the smooth capillary when θ 45 see eq 9 this is because the rough surface decreases the contact angle so that ams can form with an apparent contact angle smaller than 45 it is also notable that there are wetting phase films around the wall surfaces which is consistent with the assumption in section 3 in fig 10 b we give an example of the fluid distribution in a pore of isosceles right triangular cross section where the upper angle is 90 the roughness factor is smaller and the apparent contact angle is not small enough to form am in the right angle but it is wetting enough to form ams in the 45 base angles meanwhile there almost no wetting phase films on the walls for the poor wetting condition we can also measure the wetting phase film height by calculate the density in grooves of the tube slice as the density profile in the tube is continuous in the lbm simulation results the film height can be estimated by the quotient of the wetting phase density in one groove divided by the major density of the wetting phase around 8 0 in the equilibrium state fig 11 gives an example of wetting phase density profile of tube slices when h 4 similar with the results in fig 10 there are almost no wetting film in grooves when θ 62 37 while the films exist when θ 45 we also fit a curve between young s contact angle and film height based on lbm simulation which demonstrates that it is a sigmoid like curve as shown in fig 12 the wetting film height as a function of young s contact angle satisfies 38 h w 1 1 1 e 0 12 θ 45 h note that in a vapor fluid system in capillaries there are also film adsorption on surfaces either in smooth surface or rough surface but mainly determined by disjoining pressure we cannot consider this feature in this model and tuller et al 1999 gave more details on the adsorption and capillary condensation in porous media 4 4 capillary entry pressure in rough capillaries as oblique lines in the regular lattice grid system leads to zigzag boundaries during lb simulation we use square capillary rather than triangular capillary to verify the semi analytical model in this section a whole smooth or whole rough capillary tube with domain size of 64 64 120 note that the inscribed circle radius of cross section is 31 because the edge is solid is designed as shown in fig 13 the capillary is full of wetting phase at the simulation beginning with density of 8 0 and we meanwhile add non wetting wetting phase reservoirs on the top bottom consisting of additional three layers by droplet test the interface tension γ nw was calculated by laplace s law and the value is 0 9458 when the major density is 8 0 for each phase pressure boundary conditions equivalent to densities are applied to the first layer of the non wetting phase reservoir and the last layer of the wetting phase reservoir to simulate the primary drainage process we started from zero capillary pressure which was achieved by fixing non wetting phase and wetting phase densities in the first layer and last layer of the reservoir respectively pan et al 2004 zhang et al 2016 the density on the bottom was fixed at 7 95 and the density on the top was increased from 7 95 to 8 40 the driving pressure increased gradually and non wetting phase began to enter the tube and displace the wetting phase in the initially wetting phase saturated capillary finally we obtain a series of p c γ nw s w curves for the smooth and rough capillaries under different wetting conditions and with different roughness factors then we can compare the simulated and analytical entry pressure and here we take the rough one when r f 3 h 4 a b d 2 as an example when θ 32 52 h w 0 725 h and apparent angle θ 0 the analytical entry pressure p c γ nw calculated from extended ms p model from section 3 for a rough capillary is 0 0695 and that for a smooth capillary calculated from general ms p method is 0 0536 primary drainage curves obtained by lbm simulations under the same conditions are shown in fig 14 in which we can make a tangent line at the inflection point not the point where the second derivative is equal to 0 but the point where the curve become much steeper of the capillary pressure curve the intersection point between the tangent line and y axis is the capillary entry pressure the value is 0 0720 and 0 0560 for the rough capillary and the smooth one respectively the relative error is smaller than 5 and we obtain good agreement of the simulated and analytical entry pressure fig 15 summarizes another five pairs of simulation results against the semi analytical model though the relative error is larger than 5 in some cases there is good agreement overall we also give three displacement processes driven by the entry pressure in a rough capillary under different wetting conditions corresponding to the cases in fig 7 to show the differences it can be seen from fig 16 that the non wetting phase enters the middle channel for low flow resistance then the non wetting phase tries to penetrate into the grooves on the rough surface however due to the wetting film adsorbed on the walls the non wetting phase can only penetrate partly under strong wetting conditions fig 16 a while in the case when the wetting condition is not strong enough the non wetting phase can fill most grooves on the surface and the displacement process like a two step layered flow fill the middle first and then the surface fig 16 b moreover when the wettability becomes poorer the non wetting phase even can penetrate the grooves at the first step fig 16 c 4 5 contact angle hysteresis in rough capillaries the contact angle hysteresis is influenced by many mixing factors such as the droplet size flow velocity as well as the surface roughness and it s hard to illustrate it separately in this section we will only discuss the contact angle hysteresis in few rough capillaries under small pressure difference there are usually three ways in literatures to study the contact angle hysteresis usually measured by the difference between the advancing contact angle and receding contact angle 1 slowly increasing the volume of a drop or sucking the liquid and observing contact lines gao and mccarthy 2006 during the increase of drop volume the contact line first remains stuck before it suddenly jumps above a critical volume the maximum observed angle is the so called advancing contact angle θ a if we afterwards decrease the volume of the drop and determine the contact angle just before the wetting line is receding we measure the so called receding contact angle θ r 2 droplet moving driven by the body force or external force the contact angle is different at the front and at the rear of the drop contact line always stays stationary and the droplet only deforms if the instantaneous receding contact angle and advancing contact angle don t arrive certain critical values ba et al 2016 studied the contact angle hysteresis on topologically structured surfaces using lbm and analyzed the critical capillary number for droplet slipping 3 liquid column motion due to capillary force such as measuring the contact angles by wilhelmy plate method the measure of receding contact angle or advancing contact angle depends on the relative movement direction of the plate in our study we focus on the contact hysteresis in a capillary so we construct a similar model according to joanny and de gennes 1984 i e a wetting phase column is initialized in the middle of a capillary while the other space is filled with non wetting phase pressure boundary conditions are applied to inlet and outlet and the pressure difference is relatively small than the capillary entry pressure eliminate the effects of large flow velocity so that the non wetting phase will invade the wetting phase from both capillary ends forming the advance receding contact angle and advancing contact angle as shown in fig 17 a in the following simulation we only consider the similar capillaries in section 4 4 the domain size of the capillary is 64 64 128 the inlet and outlet are non wetting reservoir consisting of 20 layers the 21th layers 108th layers along the z axis is the capillary before simulation the 40th 90th layers are filled with wetting phase and the first layer density of inlet and outlet are fixed at 8 03 and 8 0 respectively as shown in fig 17 b contact angle hysteresis under different wetting conditions θ 78 9 62 3 and 32 5 in different rough capillaries rf 1 1 5 2 and 3 are simulated by lbm the results are shown in fig 18 firstly it can be seen that the roughness decreasing the advancing and receding contact angle simultaneously then by measuring receding contact angle in rough capillaries we find that the receding contact angle is close to the corresponding apparent contact angle in strong wetting conditions while the receding contact angle in poor wetting conditions seems tend to larger than the corresponding apparent angle which maybe is due to the limited simulation time step in addition the difference between the advancing contact angle and receding contact angle contact hysteresis stays relative stable and do not show a clear changing pattern in brief in our simulations we can say that the roughness can decreasing the receding contact angle further but it does not mean the roughness is bound to promote the contact hysteresis moreover if the contact angle hysteresis is ignored in the new proposed model the accuracy may be influenced in poor wetting conditions 5 results and discussion define the dimensionless capillary entry pressure as p cnorm p cr p cs where p cs is the capillary entry pressure in a smooth capillary and p cr is the capillary entry pressure in a rough capillary of the same size refer to capillaries in fig 5 introduce five dimensionless variables to describe how the roughness influences the capillary entry pressure in different wetting conditions α a d β b d ω d p 0 λ h r in g a 0 p 0 2 where r in is the inscribed radius of the polygon and g is the shape factor we take triangles as examples to analyze the influencing factors in this section the triangles can be constructed using method patzek s 2001 for convenience the inscribed radius of the triangle is set to one also readers can refer to wei s 2015 method if n sided polygon construction is needed wei et al 2015 the apparent angles and film height are calculated by eqs 36 38 5 1 analysis of influencing factors groove length and groove width let h 0 1 b 0 05 or a 0 05 d 0 05 g 0 024 then construct various shapes with different groove length or groove width leading to various values of α or β after this calculate capillary behaviors using the proposed model in section 3 α and β can indicate the impact of groove length and groove width on the capillary behavior respectively fig 19 gives the information concerning how p cnorm changes with groove length and contact angle overall p cnorm is larger than one which means that the rough capillary entry pressure is always larger than the smooth one under the same conditions moreover p cnorm shows a dramatic rise with the increase of contact angle however it remains stable at different values of α when the contact angle is smaller than 40 this is because the reciprocal of cos θ is greater when the contact angle is bigger meanwhile the rough surface would make the contact angle smaller and the range of the drop is much bigger under poor wetting conditions than that in good wetting conditions that is to say cos θ cos θ plays a key role in this rising trend and the rough surface can t decrease the apparent angle significantly p cnorm also decreases a little with the increase of α for the gradually declining roughness factor however it is clear from the subgraph of fig 19 that there is a dramatic decline in r f with the increase of α which means that α has little influence on p cnorm even under poor wetting conditions though there is a subtle difference due to the drainage direction i e the influence of f ly our results indicate that the influence of groove width on the capillary behavior is similar to that of groove length for they exert the similar impact on r f according to the subgraph in fig 19 5 2 analysis of influencing factors asperity width similarly let a 0 05 b 0 05 h 0 1 g 0 024 then construct various shapes with different asperity width leading to various values of ω thus ω illustrates the influence of asperity width fig 20 summarizes the simulation results in terms of how p cnorm changes with ω under different wetting conditions p cnorm grows noticeably with the rise of contact angle at small ω while it declines with ω when the contact angle is large enough it increases gradually at its initial stage and then peaks at a certain point with the increase of ω after the peak point it decreases gradually this is because the roughness factor fluctuates with ω in a similar pattern as shown in the subgraph of fig 20 in addition the degree of decrease is larger than the influence of α in section 4 1 p cnorm is still not sensitive to the roughness factor under strong wetting conditions 5 3 analysis of influencing factors asperity height construct various shapes with different asperity height making sure that a 0 05 b 0 05 d 0 05 and g 0 024 fig 21 compares the statistics regarding the capillary behaviors in rough capillaries when the asperity height and contact angle vary then λ can illustrate the influence of asperity height in general p cnorm increases with λ and contact angle however there is a slight drop for p cnorm with the increase of λ under poor wetting conditions this can happen when the roughness factor is large enough and decreases the apparent angle significantly under poor wetting conditions moreover it seems that λ exerts more impacts on this upward trend than α and ω for it decreases the effective radius of capillary directly 5 4 analysis of influencing factors shape factor shape factor has an important influence on the wetting phase saturation construct different shapes making sure that a 0 05 b 0 05 d 0 05 and h 0 1 fig 22 provides statistics concerning the performance of the wetting saturation of these shapes in rough and smooth capillaries as shown in fig 22 the wetting saturation in rough capillaries is larger than in smooth capillaries two combined factors contribute to this on the one hand the rough surface narrows the pore space and the grooves are filled with wetting phase film on the other hand the rough surface would make the apparent contact angle smaller which means more wetting phase could exist in the corners in addition the wetting saturation in rough capillaries shows a similar trend with that in smooth capillaries i e the wetting saturation decreases with the shape factor and the contact angle this is because the bigger the shape factor is the more regular the shape is and as a result there would be less corner space to hold wetting phase also the increasing contact angle would narrow the space of wetting phase in the corners which is stated clearly by wei et al 2015 there is a slight difference in that the wetting phase in rough capillaries would decrease more quickly after a certain point with the increase of the contact angle to conclude both the wetting phase saturation and entry pressure of rough capillaries are always larger than those of smooth ones under the same conditions and fig 14 show good evidence of this point furthermore the capillary entry pressure is not sensitive to the roughness factor under strong wetting conditions as to the magnitude of their relative effects on rough capillary entry pressure under middle or poor wetting conditions the contact angle ranks first then the asperity height followed by the asperity width and groove length width is last 6 conclusions to sum up we propose a semi analytical model based on the ms p and wetting theories of rough surfaces to calculate the capillary entry pressure in rough capillaries with polygonal cross sections we provide a new logistic wetting equation to calculate the apparent contact angle in the wenzel state and to verify the model with lattice boltzmann method simulations using this model we discuss capillary behavior under different conditions first both the wetting phase saturation and entry pressure of rough capillaries are larger than those of smooth ones under the same conditions the effective radius of the capillary would decrease and the contact angle would be smaller in the rough capillary meanwhile the rough surface would also change the phase distribution for example there would be a wetting phase film adsorbed on surface moreover the contact angle and asperity height have a more significant influence on capillary entry pressure than any other factors followed by asperity width and groove length width in general the capillary entry pressure changes only slightly with the roughness factor under strong wetting conditions acknowledgments the authors greatly appreciate the ﬁnancial support of the national natural science foundation

are analytically described the stochastic mass balance equation is solved analytically and based on this explicit expressions relating system performance to system characteristics are derived the performances of a wide variety of rwh systems located in five representative climatic regions of the united states are examined using the newly derived analytical equations close agreements between analytical and continuous simulation results are shown for all the compared cases in addition an analytical equation is obtained expressing the required storage size as a function of the desired water supply reliability average water use rate as well as rainfall and catchment characteristics the equations developed herein constitute a convenient and effective tool for sizing rwh systems and evaluating their performances keywords rainwater harvesting stochastic model water supply reliability stormwater capture efficiency 1 introduction a rainwater harvesting rwh system is generally designed to capture convey and store in storage units e g rain barrels or cisterns the rainwater falling upon a catchment surface e g rooftops or other impervious areas for domestic or municipal uses pdep 2006 it provides a promising alternative to reduce potable water demand or minimize water scarcity by harvesting the nonuniformly distributed rainfall both in urban and rural areas fewkes and wam 2000 matos et al 2013 sturm et al 2009 meanwhile the collection and use of rainwater can effectively reduce the volume of runoff especially in rapidly expanding urban areas guo and baetz 2007 kim et al 2012 sample et al 2012 hence this low impact development practice has been increasingly studied and implemented worldwide during the last two decades campisano and modica 2012 fewkes and wam 2000 jones and hunt 2010 kim and yoo 2009 palla et al 2012 sturm et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 zhang et al 2009 in analyzing the performance of a rwh system its water supply reliability or water saving efficiency and stormwater capture efficiency or runoff reduction rate are the two most commonly used indices for evaluation santos and taveira pinto 2013 various methods have been developed to evaluate them for the purpose of optimizing the system design and or operation kim et al 2012 among these methods continuous simulation based on mass balance principles has been used most frequently campisano et al 2017a fewkes 2000 hajani and rahman 2014 lopes et al 2017 mitchell et al 2008 mun and han 2012 empirical and semi empirical equations expressing directly the relationship between the storage volume water supply reliability water demand and climate conditions have also been developed based on regression analysis of simulation results campisano and modica 2012 fewkes 2000 hajani and rahman 2014 lee et al 2000 su et al 2009 youn et al 2012 to ensure the accuracy of the fitted empirical relationships a large number of simulations covering a sufficiently large design parameter space are inevitably required alternatively incorporating probabilistic rainfall models an appealing analytical probabilistic approach has been developed to investigate the long term average hydrologic performance of rwh systems becciu et al 2016 guo and baetz 2007 kim et al 2012 by analyzing an event based water balance equation using the derived probability distribution theory analytical solutions for quantifying the key performance indicators were derived for regions where the rainfall event characteristics follow exponential probability distributions however in deriving those analytical solutions simplifying assumptions about the initial condition of the water level in the storage unit at the beginning of a rainfall event have to be made although appropriate simplifications would adequately represent a vast majority of design cases the accuracy that can be provided by this method for some unusual or relatively unique cases is limited therefore further improvement of the analytical probabilistic approach is required in a recent study a stochastic approach was used by pelak and porporato 2016 for the optimal design of rwh systems in their study the input rainfall series is represented as a marked poisson process analytical equations that can be used to determine the optimal storage size of a rwh system were derived considering the total cost of operation and the random nature of the volume and timing of rainfall events as an extension and improvement of the previously developed analytical probabilistic and stochastic approaches a collection of analytical equations are derived and verified in this paper for evaluating the performance of rwh systems first of all a differential mass balance equation is used to describe the instantaneous water balance which governs the operation of a rwh system secondly the input rainfall series is represented as a marked poisson process and the inflow into the rwh system is expressed analytically considering the contributing catchment characteristics thirdly two common water use patterns are considered and approximate methods are proposed for modelling these two patterns finally an equilibrium solution in probabilistic terms is derived by solving the stochastic mass balance equation based on that solution explicit expressions for stormwater capture efficiency water supply reliability and the required storage size are all derived analytically the accuracy of the analytical solutions are examined by comparing with results from continuous simulations using the analytical solutions the influences of rainfall characteristics storage volume anticipated water demand and the contributing catchment characteristics on the hydrologic performance of rwh systems are all demonstrated 2 the dynamic water balance of a rainwater storage unit 2 1 instantaneous water balance equation in a rwh system rainwater captured by the catchment area is conveyed to a storage device after receiving some forms of pretreatment e g filtration or first flush diversion mun and han 2012 and when the storage capacity of the system is fully utilized overflow occurs and is discharged to the drainage system the stored water is often utilized for domestic and or municipal purposes as depicted in fig 1 the hydrological processes involved have often been described as those associated with a simple storage reservoir fewkes and butler 2000 guo and baetz 2007 hanson et al 2009 kim and yoo 2009 vaes and berlamont 2001 for describing the dynamic water balance of a water storage unit the mass balance equation can be expressed in differential form as 1 w 0 ds t dt i s t t l s t where w 0 is the maximum storage capacity of a rwh system expressed as depth of water over the storage unit s bottom area mm t is the time h s t represents the fraction of the maximum storage capacity that is occupied by water at time t 0 s t 1 i s t t represents the net rate of water filling into the storage unit at time t when s t fraction of the storage unit is filled with water mm h i s t t equals zero except when rainfall occurs at the instant when rainfall occurs i s t t would be such that available water will all be stored as long as the storage unit is not full l s t is the water depletion rate from the storage unit excluding overflow which may occur at time t mm h overflow is accounted for because i s t t is the net rate of inflow the rwh system is assumed to supply water for use as long as there is water in the system that is why depletion rate depends on the availability of water in the storage tank s t and is denoted as l s t eq 1 provides the basis for quantifying the dynamics of a rwh system it demonstrates that the water availability in the storage unit at a specific time t i e s t depends on the balance of water inflow the amount of water which can be captured and stored and demand the volume of water that will be used depleted coupled with the input of a time series of local rainfall data water demand conditions of contributing area and the size of a rwh system eq 1 can be used to model the system s hydrologic operations through either numerical calculations or analytical derivations in this paper an analytical approach is introduced the required terms described above will all be analytically represented 2 2 net inflow represented as a marked poisson process a long term continuous rainfall record can be viewed as being comprised of a series of rainfall pulses occurring at various instants of times to facilitate its application in theoretical analyses a rainfall data series is usually discretized into statistically independent individual rainfall events by selecting a minimum inter event time miet the miet is defined as the minimum number of dry hours between two rainfall events two consecutive rainfall episodes are considered as belonging to the same rainfall event if the dry time between them is less than the adopted miet otherwise they are considered as belonging to two different events each rainfall event can be characterized by its volume duration and inter event time the exponential probability density functions pdfs were found to fit the histograms of rainfall event volume v duration u and inter event time b satisfactorily especially in many regions of north america adams and papa 2000 guo and baetz 2007 restrepo posada and eagleson 1982 wanielista and yousef 1993 the pdfs of rainfall event characteristics are 2 f v ζ exp ζ v v 0 3 f u λ exp λ u u 0 4 f b ψ exp ψ b b 0 where ζ λ and ψ are distribution parameters a rigorous data processing technique for obtaining these parameters is provided by hassini and guo 2016 to represent different climate conditions long term hourly rainfall series from five stations varying from humid to arid climates are used in this study and their rainfall statistics obtained from previous studies are tabulated in table 1 where v u and b are the sample mean rainfall event volume mm sample mean rainfall event duration h and sample mean inter event time h respectively the rainfall event durations are usually much shorter than the inter event times as such an individual rainfall event may be considered as fallen at an instant of time and a point rainfall series can be idealized as a point process comprised of instantaneous rainfall jumps separated by random arrival times the random rainfall depths of individual events are statistically independent and the time series of rainfall events is therefore a marked poisson process with a mean rainfall event arrival rate μ approximately equalling to u b 1 eagleson 1978 guo 2016 the mark or ancillary variable of this marked poisson process is the rainfall event volume v use of the above described approach for statistically representing historical rainfall series does not consider the possible effects of climate change similar to other approaches currently used in engineering practice historical observations are used to predict future climate conditions assuming that the rainfall time series is a stationary process however climate change has already had observable effects and will likely increase in the future models for predicting future rainfall patterns and amounts have been developed e g easterling et at 2000 wadoux et at 2017 if future climate conditions need to be considered in the design of rwhs the rainfall event separation and frequency analysis procedures as outlined above can also be used to analyse the future rainfall series for locations of interest predicted by climate models in fact exponential distribution models for rainfall event characteristics were found to fit climate model predicted rainfall series as well guo and senior 2006 the stochastic approach developed in this paper can therefore also be used in the design of rwhs taking into consideration the impact of climate change the volume of runoff generated from a catchment that can be collected by the storage unit as the result of a rainfall event with volume v can be expressed as 5 v in 0 v v ff φ st v v ff v v ff where v in is the generated runoff or the available volume of inflow into the storage unit expressed as depth mm of water over the storage unit s bottom area φ st is the contributing ratio and can be calculated as φ st r a ϕ where r a is the ratio between the contributing catchment area and the bottom area of the storage unit r a is referred to as the area ratio hereafter and ϕ is the runoff coefficient of the catchment mainly reflecting the effect of wind infiltration and surface depressions in converting rainfall to runoff ϕ has a value from 0 to unity e g the suggested roof runoff coefficients vary in the range of 0 75 0 95 jennings et al 2015 v ff is the first flush diversion height typically ranging from 0 5 mm to 1 5 mm trca and cvca 2010 eq 5 properly represents the fact that the first v ff millimetres of rainfall of every rainfall event will not be collected by the storage unit since the first flush diversion is considered the runoff process is censored from the rainfall process with events having v v ff removed this runoff process forms a new marked poisson process the new marked poisson process has a less frequent arrival rate of μ μ v ff f v dv μ exp ζ v ff laio et al 2001 rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 the volume of rainfall events remaining in the new marked poisson process has the same distribution as v v ff conditioned on v v ff which is the same as described by eq 2 the mark of the new marked poisson process is the generated runoff volume v in with events having v in 0 removed i e rainfall events with v v ff removed the cumulative distribution function of v in is denoted as f v in and can be derived considering that v in is simply the product of φ st and v v ff conditioned on v v ff i e f v in p φ st v v ff v in v v ff 0 v in φ st v ff ζ exp ζ v dv v ff ζ exp ζ v dv 1 exp ζ v ff exp ζ φ st v in therefore the pdf of the generated runoff or available inflow v in denoted as f v in can be derived as 6 f v in df v in dv in ζ φ st exp ζ φ st v in ζ exp ζ v in where ζ ζ φ st is the exponential distribution parameter of the available inflow normalizing v in by dividing it by w 0 the pdf of the normalized available inflow denoted as r and r v in w 0 can be expressed as 7 f r γ exp γ r r 0 where r is dimensionless and γ ζ w 0 is the normalized dimensionless distribution parameter the rainwater amount that is lost prior to entering the storage unit due to first flush diversion depression storage and other losses e g infiltration losses if the catchment has pervious areas and evaporation have been excluded from the r values considered in eq 7 the actual net normalized inflow into the storage unit as a result of a runoff event generating a normalized available inflow r is denoted as y i e y i s t w 0 the value of y depends on not only r but also s the fraction of the maximum storage capacity that is already filled with water when the runoff event occurs the conditional pdf of y given an antecedent saturation level s is therefore required for further analysis this conditional pdf is denoted as f y s considering the pdf of r as given in eq 7 and the possible relations between y r and s it can be shown that 8 f y s γ exp γ y 0 y 1 s exp γ 1 s δ y 1 s y 1 s where δ is the dirac delta function eq 8 shows that y can only take on values from 0 to 1 s eq 8 also states that additional water cannot be stored by the system as soon as its maximum storage capacity is reached therefore there is an atom of probability at y 1 s under a rainfall event with normalized available inflow r 1 s y r this explains why for this region of y values i e 0 y 1 s the pdf of y is the same as the pdf of r the probability mass at y 1 s represents the probability that a storm will fill up the storage unit to its maximum capacity given that the storage unit has s fraction of it already occupied by water at the beginning of the storm the time series of net inflows into the storage unit can therefore be represented as a new marked poisson process with arrival rate μ and individual marks y obeying the pdf of f y s 2 3 water use rate rwh systems usually supply water to meet the demand for toilet flushing landscape irrigation pavement washing or even as complementary water sources for drinking purpose inside or outside buildings jennings et al 2012 matos et al 2013 palla et al 2011 sturm et al 2009 such water use may have significant daily and seasonal variations and may also change depending on whether it is during a rainfall event or dry period this study focuses on the overall sizing of rwh systems required at the planning or preliminary design stage not on a system s detailed operation therefore the rate of anticipated water demand is treated as a constant equalling its long term average campisano et al 2013 fewkes and wam 2000 hajani and rahman 2014 su et al 2009 the water use is therefore assumed to proceed at the average water demand rate except when the system is completely dry hence the normalized water use rate can be expressed as 9 l s t 0 s 0 η 0 s 1 where η ϖ w 0 is the long term average normalized water demand rate with ϖ being the average water demand rate expressed as depth of water in the storage unit per unit time 2 4 steady state solution of the stochastic water balance equation with the net inflow i s t t in eq 1 described as a marked poisson process with arrival rate μ and individual marks having a pdf as shown in eq 8 eq 1 can therefore be considered as a stochastic differential equation with its solution s t also being a stochastic process which is meaningful only in probabilistic terms since s t is driven by a marked poisson process it would be a markov process with jumps and drifts gardiner 2004 the state pdf of s at time t is denoted as p s t which can be obtained by solving the chapman kolmogorov forward equation for the markov process governed by eq 1 gardiner 2004 the chapman kolmogorov forward equation of a markov process relates the state probability distribution p s t in this case at different times based on eq 1 and adapting from the solutions provided by cox and isham 1986 rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 and rodríguez iturbe and porporato 2004 the chapman kolmogorov forward equations describing the temporal evolution of p s t were found to be 10 t p s t η s p s t μ p s t μ 0 s p z t f s z z dz μ p 0 t f s 0 11 d dt p 0 t μ p 0 t η p 0 t where f s z z is the conditional probability distribution expressed in eq 8 z is the dummy variable of integration p 0 t is the value of the pdf p s t when s approaches zero at time t i e p 0 t lim s 0 p s t and p 0 t is the probability that s is zero or the storage unit is empty at time t eq 11 appears as a part of the chapman kolmogorov forward equations because of the probability mass p 0 t at s 0 by taking the limit as t an equilibrium or steady state solution of the above chapman kolmogorov forward equations exists under this steady state although s still changes randomly with time the pdf of s does not change with time any more and the time series of s afterwards can be described as a strictly stationary process mathematically steady state can only be reached with t but practically since the storage volume of a rwh system is relatively small compared to monthly or seasonal total rainfall a nearly steady state condition would be reached after a few months of operation for planning and design purposes only the system s steady state condition is of interest the steady state solution for p s t is denoted as p s and the steady state solution for p 0 t is denoted as p 0 these steady state solutions can be obtained by setting the left hand sides of eqs 10 and 11 to zero and replacing p s t with p s and p 0 t with p 0 i e 12 η s p s μ p s μ 0 s p z f s z z dz μ p 0 f s 0 0 13 μ p 0 η p 0 0 denoting α μ γ η the steady state solution for cases where α 1 is see appendix for detailed derivations 14a p 0 α 1 α exp γ α 1 1 14b p s μ η p 0 exp μ η γ s γ α α 1 α exp γ α 1 1 exp μ η γ s for 0 s 1 similarly the solution for the special case where α 1 is 15a p 0 1 1 γ 15b p s γ 1 γ for 0 s 1 in the above expressions η is the normalized water demand rate μ γ represents the normalized mean inflow rate i e the inflow rate averaged through both dry and wet periods therefore α μ γ η i e μ γ η is the ratio between the normalized mean inflow rate and water demand rate the ratio α can also be viewed as the ratio between annual runoff collected by a rwh system and the annual total water demand it is considered as an important parameter in previous studies fewkes 2000 the solutions above show that when the average inflow rate is equal to the average water demand rate i e when α 1 the steady state fluctuation of s is only related to γ otherwise it depends on not only γ but also on η and μ it is noted here that the same steady state solution of the probability distribution of s is presented in pelak and porporato 2016 2 5 water use patterns and effective storage capacity when rainwater collected by a rwh system is designed only for outdoor uses e g garden irrigation pavement washing water use may primarily take place during dry periods for large buildings or communities use of water supplied by rwh systems may take place no matter if it rains or not therefore depending on the design purposes and time of the year two typical water use patterns exist pattern 1 water is only used during dry periods and pattern 2 water is used during both rainfall events and dry periods guo and baetz 2007 matos et al 2013 palla et al 2011 ward et al 2010 because of these different water use patterns there may be some inaccuracies resulting from the use of eq 9 to represent the water demand rate for rwh systems with pattern 1 water use physically water use occurs only during dry periods and starts when the dry period starts however in the established stochastic model the random inflows are treated as instantaneous pulses with an arrival rate of u b 1 the starting point of water use is thus moved forward to the start of the rainfall event and an additional period i e the duration of the rainfall event is added prior to the actual starting time of water use rainfall event duration is statistically much shorter than inter event dry period e g the average values of rainfall event durations are only 1 10 1 20 of those of the dry periods as shown in table 1 therefore it is reasonable to assume that only a slight overestimation of the overall water use would result from the use of eq 9 for pattern 1 cases if necessary this overestimation may be eliminated by proportionally adjusting the value of η used in the stochastic model for cases with pattern 2 water use stored water is used the same way during both dry and wet times and storage capacity in addition to what is physically provided by the tank is created as a result of water use simultaneously occurring during a rainfall event however in the stochastic model rainfall events are assumed to occur instantaneously so the additional storage capacity generated while water is used is not considered to take into account this additional storage capacity due to the water use occurred during rainfall events it is assumed that the maximum effective storage capacity of a rwh system prior to a rainfall event is approximately equal to the maximum physical storage volume of the system v st plus the average volume of water used during a rainfall event for pattern 1 water use no adjustment on the storage capacity is needed the maximum effective storage capacity can therefore be expressed as 16 w 0 v st a st pattern 1 water use v st a st ϖ u pattern 2 water use where v st is the storage volume measured in the unit of lites l or m3 and a st is the bottom area of the storage unit measured in the unit consistent with v st ϖ u is the average volume of water used during a rainfall event the acceptability of this simplification will be confirmed later 2 6 long term water balance and performance statistics performance indicators of a rwh system can be analytically expressed based on the preceding stochastic solutions first of all the performance of a rwh system in reducing potable water consumption is often examined by quantifying its volumetric reliability defined as the ratio between the total volume of rainwater supplied by the system and the total demand another time based reliability is defined as the fraction of time when the water demand is met by the rwh system guo and baetz 2007 mun and han 2012 palla et al 2011 santos and taveira pinto 2013 since water use rate is considered to be a constant whenever there is water in the storage tank the long term average volumetric reliability and the time based reliability are the same denoted as r e and also referred to as water saving efficiency using the stochastic model results presented earlier r e can be calculated as 17 r e l d 0 1 η p s ds η 1 p 0 where l 0 1 η p s ds is the normalized mean water use rate i e the actual average rate of water supplied by the system for use averaged through both wet and dry periods d η is the normalized water demand rate it is obvious that 1 p 0 which is the average fraction of time when there is water in storage can indeed represent this water supply reliability moreover p 0 which is the average fraction of time when there is no water in storage has also been defined as the water deficit rate in the performance analysis of rwh systems su et al 2009 youn et al 2012 additionally an unnecessarily large storage tank would be a misuse of investment and space yet it may still not meet the reliability requirement when the catchment size is too small amongst the performance indicators water supply reliability is found to be the most appropriate criterion to size a rwh system ensuring that the system may achieve a high water saving performance at a relatively low cost hajani and rahman 2014 santos and taveira pinto 2013 zhang et al 2009 substituting γ ζ w 0 φ st η ϖ w 0 into eq 14a or eq 15a for calculating p 0 and then substituting that p 0 expression

comparing with swmm continuous simulation results in establishing the stochastic model rainfall events are assumed to occur instantaneously the arrival of the rainfall events are treated as a poisson process the volume for any rainfall event is randomly drawn from an exponential distribution and the maximum effective storage capacity of rwh systems is assumed to be equal to what is described by eq 16 the lid module of the u s environmental protection agency s storm water management model swmm version 5 1 rossman 2015 does not employ similar assumptions and was found to provide accurate long term average performance evaluations of rwh systems campisano et al 2017b therefore to verify the accuracy of the derived stochastic results and test the validity of the simplifying assumptions continuous simulations using the swmm model were conducted with results compared to those from stochastic analysis in a swmm model two subcatchments are established subcatchment a represents the contributing area with depression storage equaling the value of first flush while subcatchment b represents the rwh system to model rwh systems under pattern 2 water use subcatchment b is modeled using swmm s lid module in which water in the rwh system can be used during both dry and rainfall periods since swmm s lid module does not provide a water use option for systems where water use only occurs during dry periods to model cases under pattern 1 water use subcatchment b is modeled in swmm as a regular 100 impervious subcatchment with its surface depression storage equaling v st a st and evaporation set to occur only in dry periods with a constant rate equaling to ϖ using continuous rainfall data the swmm model performs time step by time step simulations of the operation of the rwh system and can output the inflow into subcatchment b denoted as v inb and runoff i e discharge from subcatchment b denoted as v outb thus the stormwater capture efficiency can be calculated as 1 v outb v inb local rainfall statistics conditions of contributing area storage tank size and water demand rate are the main factors influencing the performance of rwh systems campisano et al 2013 fewkes and wam 2000 guo and baetz 2007 imteaz et al 2011 kim and yoo 2009 mun and han 2012 rwh systems in locations with different climates i e atlanta concord detroit flagstaff and billings as shown in table 1 with varying contributing area conditions φ st changing from 5 to 500 storage tank sizes v st changing from 200 l to 500 l and water demand rates hereafter l st is used to denote the volumetric water demand rate i e l st ϖ a st l st varies from 100 l day to 1000 l day are modeled in the swmm simulations hourly rainfall records were used as the rainfall inputs and a 5 min computational time step was used to ensure accuracy campisano and modica 2014 demonstrated that this kind of computational resolution is accurate enough for long term average performance evaluation stormwater capture efficiencies of various rwh systems under pattern 1 and pattern 2 water uses calculated using the analytical stochastic solutions eq 19 with w 0 expressed in eq 16 are compared with swmm simulation results the comparisons for 206 different cases under pattern 1 water use and 158 different cases under pattern 2 water use are shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively treating swmm results as observed data the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nsme the root mean square error rmse and the correlation coefficient between stochastic results and observed values were also calculated and the results are also presented in figs 2 and 3 it can be seen from the two figures that the analytical and simulation results are well within agreement taking the continuous simulation results as a benchmark the summary statistics indicate that the derived analytical solutions can provide an accurate and reliable method for estimating stormwater capture efficiencies to save space only some cases in atlanta are illustrated in figs 4 and 5 the two figures show that the stormwater capture efficiency of a rwh system would generally rise with the increase of the storage tank size and the water use rate and rapidly drop with the increase of the contributing ratio additionally in fig 4 the derived stochastic solution is also compared with the analytical probabilistic solution that adopted the same water use pattern pattern 1 and derived by guo and baetz 2007 as previously discussed a simplifying assumption about the initial water content of the storage tank had to be made in that event based probabilistic approach in the guo and baetz s 2007 solution it was assumed that the storage unit would be full at the beginning of a dry period preceding a rainfall event which is the end of the last rainfall event only small storage units e g rain barrels were considered and probabilistic results were obtained by analyzing the operation of the system during the dry and subsequent rainfall period preceded by the last rainfall event in comparison with the continuous simulation results results based on the guo and baetz s 2007 solution performed well when the storage volume is relatively small but would underestimate the stormwater capture efficiency when the storage tank size gets larger and the water use rate also reaches a certain high value or when the contributing ratio is relatively small this is because the contributing ratio determines the amount of inflow into the storage tank and when the contributing ratio is small the inflow volume is small and there is less a possibility for a rwh system with a larger storage capacity to be filled when a rainfall event ends with a large water use rate the runoff into the storage tank can be used quickly during a rainfall event that is why for these cases the assumption that the storage space is filled when the last storm ends becomes more unrealistic the average storage capacity available at the beginning of a random rainfall event would be larger than what is calculated in the analytical probabilistic approach therefore the stormwater capture efficiency for these cases will be slightly underestimated by the previous analytical probabilistic solutions the proposed stochastic method effectively gets rid of the simplifying assumptions about the initial condition of the water level in the storage unit at the start of a random rainfall event and therefore overcomes the resulting limitations it can provide a more general and reliable analytical tool for evaluating the long term average performance of rwh systems with wider application ranges 4 example analysis results in addition to stormwater capture efficiency many other valuable indicators can also be conveniently obtained using the derived formulas these results are also of great interest in the performance evaluation and design of rwh systems but continuous simulation models do not directly output these results the commonly used pattern 2 water use was applied as an example in the following analysis the cumulative frequency distribution of normalized water level in the storage tank and its long term average value can be calculated using eq 20 or eq 21 and 22 or eq 23 respectively taking atlanta as an example fig 6 a c and e show that the fluctuation of the water level in the storage tank is greater with larger contributing ratio larger storage tank size and smaller water demand rate for a given rwh system increases of contributing ratio can provide more available water to fill the storage and a larger storage tank size is able to store more rainwater for later uses therefore as shown in fig 6 b and d the normalized long term average water level s rises with larger contributing ratio and larger storage tank size contrarily higher rates of water use will certainly reduce the average water level in the storage as revealed in fig 6 f note that the rate of change of s with these factors are significantly different this should be taken into account in the optimum design of storage tanks the performance of a rwh system is often discussed in terms of either its water supply reliability r e or its water deficit rate p 0 the derived stochastic solutions indicate that these two indices mainly depend on the rainfall event characteristics and the water use patterns they are complementary to each other example results of the long term water deficit rate p 0 of rwh systems are included in fig 6 and the water supply reliability of rwh systems in atlanta and billings are presented in fig 7 fig 6 shows that increasing the contributing ratio and or the storage size can reduce the water deficit rate of rwh systems whereas increases in water use rate can significantly aggravate water deficit it can be seen from fig 7 that the water supply reliabilities of rwh systems in a humid region atlanta are generally higher than those that can be obtained in an arid region billings fig 7 highlights further that gradual increases of storage tank size and contributing ratio usually help raise water supply reliability but the relationship between r e and these controlling factors are significantly nonlinear which should be adequately considered in the sizing of rwh systems 5 concluding remarks runoff reduction and water supply are the two most important benefits of rainwater harvesting rwh systems based on a stochastic water balance equation analytical solutions which can be used for the detailed analysis of the hydrological performance of rwh systems were derived two typical water use patterns were considered and the analytical solutions for both of them were compared with the corresponding continuous simulation results the analytical solutions are fairly accurate for a wide range of cases with different contributing ratios storage sizes and water use rates located in five representative climate regions in the united states overall it was demonstrated that this stochastic approach is feasible and reliable in modeling the long term water balance of rwh systems it is worth emphasizing that the presented solutions are valid for rwh systems located in regions where the rainfall series may be approximated as marked poisson processes a similar stochastic approach was used recently by pelak and porporato 2016 for the optimal design of rwh systems the mathematical models describing the input rainfall series and the dynamic water balance of rwh systems used in this study are similar to those used by pelak and porporato 2016 however different water use patterns were considered and additional analytical solutions useful for the planning and design of rwh systems were derived in this study in addition the analytical solutions presented in this paper were also verified for their accuracies by comparing with continuous simulation results whereas the analytical solutions provided by pelak and porporato 2016 were not verified for their accuracies the analytical solutions presented in this paper relate the stormwater capture efficiency and water supply reliability of rwh systems directly and explicitly to the rainfall conditions sizes of contributing areas water collection conveyance efficiencies storage tank sizes and average water use rates significant nonlinear dependencies of the system performance on these factors have been observed design optimization is therefore necessary to balance the cost and performance the proposed analytical solutions are accurate concise and can be conveniently implemented in computer spreadsheets they may provide a robust and easy to use tool for the performance evaluation and optimum design of rwh systems acknowledgements this work has been supported by

contains the dirac delta function into eq 12 would eventually lead to the same equation as substituting the other portion of eq 8 into eq 12 therefore only the portion of eq 8 that does not contain

analytical and continuous simulation results are shown for all the compared cases in addition an analytical equation is obtained expressing the required storage size as a function of the desired water supply reliability average water use rate as well as rainfall and catchment characteristics the equations developed herein constitute a convenient and effective tool for sizing rwh systems and evaluating their performances keywords rainwater harvesting stochastic model water supply reliability stormwater capture efficiency 1 introduction a rainwater harvesting rwh system is generally designed to capture convey and store in storage units e g rain barrels or cisterns the rainwater falling upon a catchment surface e g rooftops or other impervious areas for domestic or municipal uses pdep 2006 it provides a promising alternative to reduce potable water demand or minimize water scarcity by harvesting the nonuniformly distributed rainfall both in urban and rural areas fewkes and wam 2000 matos et al 2013 sturm et al 2009 meanwhile the collection and use of rainwater can effectively reduce the volume of runoff especially in rapidly expanding urban areas guo and baetz 2007 kim et al 2012 sample et al 2012 hence this low impact development practice has been increasingly studied and implemented worldwide during the last two decades campisano and modica 2012 fewkes and wam 2000 jones and hunt 2010 kim and yoo 2009 palla et al 2012 sturm et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 zhang et al 2009 in analyzing the performance of a rwh system its water supply reliability or water saving efficiency and stormwater capture efficiency or runoff reduction rate are the two most commonly used indices for evaluation santos and taveira pinto 2013 various methods have been developed to evaluate them for the purpose of optimizing the system design and or operation kim et al 2012 among these methods continuous simulation based on mass balance principles has been used most frequently campisano et al 2017a fewkes 2000 hajani and rahman 2014 lopes et al 2017 mitchell et al 2008 mun and han 2012 empirical and semi empirical equations expressing directly the relationship between the storage volume water supply reliability water demand and climate conditions have also been developed based on regression analysis of simulation results campisano and modica 2012 fewkes 2000 hajani and rahman 2014 lee et al 2000 su et al 2009 youn et al 2012 to ensure the accuracy of the fitted empirical relationships a large number of simulations covering a sufficiently large design parameter space are inevitably required alternatively incorporating probabilistic rainfall models an appealing analytical probabilistic approach has been developed to investigate the long term average hydrologic performance of rwh systems becciu et al 2016 guo and baetz 2007 kim et al 2012 by analyzing an event based water balance equation using the derived probability distribution theory analytical solutions for quantifying the key performance indicators were derived for regions where the rainfall event characteristics follow exponential probability distributions however in deriving those analytical solutions simplifying assumptions about the initial condition of the water level in the storage unit at the beginning of a rainfall event have to be made although appropriate simplifications would adequately represent a vast majority of design cases the accuracy that can be provided by this method for some unusual or relatively unique cases is limited therefore further improvement of the analytical probabilistic approach is required in a recent study a stochastic approach was used by pelak and porporato 2016 for the optimal design of rwh systems in their study the input rainfall series is represented as a marked poisson process analytical equations that can be used to determine the optimal storage size of a rwh system were derived considering the total cost of operation and the random nature of the volume and timing of rainfall events as an extension and improvement of the previously developed analytical probabilistic and stochastic approaches a collection of analytical equations are derived and verified in this paper for evaluating the performance of rwh systems first of all a differential mass balance equation is used to describe the instantaneous water balance which governs the operation of a rwh system secondly the input rainfall series is represented as a marked poisson process and the inflow into the rwh system is expressed analytically considering the contributing catchment characteristics thirdly two common water use patterns are considered and approximate methods are proposed for modelling these two patterns finally an equilibrium solution in probabilistic terms is derived by solving the stochastic mass balance equation based on that solution explicit expressions for stormwater capture efficiency water supply reliability and the required storage size are all derived analytically the accuracy of the analytical solutions are examined by comparing with results from continuous simulations using the analytical solutions the influences of rainfall characteristics storage volume anticipated water demand and the contributing catchment characteristics on the hydrologic performance of rwh systems are all demonstrated 2 the dynamic water balance of a rainwater storage unit 2 1 instantaneous water balance equation in a rwh system rainwater captured by the catchment area is conveyed to a storage device after receiving some forms of pretreatment e g filtration or first flush diversion mun and han 2012 and when the storage capacity of the system is fully utilized overflow occurs and is discharged to the drainage system the stored water is often utilized for domestic and or municipal purposes as depicted in fig 1 the hydrological processes involved have often been described as those associated with a simple storage reservoir fewkes and butler 2000 guo and baetz 2007 hanson et al 2009 kim and yoo 2009 vaes and berlamont 2001 for describing the dynamic water balance of a water storage unit the mass balance equation can be expressed in differential form as 1 w 0 ds t dt i s t t l s t where w 0 is the maximum storage capacity of a rwh system expressed as depth of water over the storage unit s bottom area mm t is the time h s t represents the fraction of the maximum storage capacity that is occupied by water at time t 0 s t 1 i s t t represents the net rate of water filling into the storage unit at time t when s t fraction of the storage unit is filled with water mm h i s t t equals zero except when rainfall occurs at the instant when rainfall occurs i s t t would be such that available water will all be stored as long as the storage unit is not full l s t is the water depletion rate from the storage unit excluding overflow which may occur at time t mm h overflow is accounted for because i s t t is the net rate of inflow the rwh system is assumed to supply water for use as long as there is water in the system that is why depletion rate depends on the availability of water in the storage tank s t and is denoted as l s t eq 1 provides the basis for quantifying the dynamics of a rwh system it demonstrates that the water availability in the storage unit at a specific time t i e s t depends on the balance of water inflow the amount of water which can be captured and stored and demand the volume of water that will be used depleted coupled with the input of a time series of local rainfall data water demand conditions of contributing area and the size of a rwh system eq 1 can be used to model the system s hydrologic operations through either numerical calculations or analytical derivations in this paper an analytical approach is introduced the required terms described above will all be analytically represented 2 2 net inflow represented as a marked poisson process a long term continuous rainfall record can be viewed as being comprised of a series of rainfall pulses occurring at various instants of times to facilitate its application in theoretical analyses a rainfall data series is usually discretized into statistically independent individual rainfall events by selecting a minimum inter event time miet the miet is defined as the minimum number of dry hours between two rainfall events two consecutive rainfall episodes are considered as belonging to the same rainfall event if the dry time between them is less than the adopted miet otherwise they are considered as belonging to two different events each rainfall event can be characterized by its volume duration and inter event time the exponential probability density functions pdfs were found to fit the histograms of rainfall event volume v duration u and inter event time b satisfactorily especially in many regions of north america adams and papa 2000 guo and baetz 2007 restrepo posada and eagleson 1982 wanielista and yousef 1993 the pdfs of rainfall event characteristics are 2 f v ζ exp ζ v v 0 3 f u λ exp λ u u 0 4 f b ψ exp ψ b b 0 where ζ λ and ψ are distribution parameters a rigorous data processing technique for obtaining these parameters is provided by hassini and guo 2016 to represent different climate conditions long term hourly rainfall series from five stations varying from humid to arid climates are used in this study and their rainfall statistics obtained from previous studies are tabulated in table 1 where v u and b are the sample mean rainfall event volume mm sample mean rainfall event duration h and sample mean inter event time h respectively the rainfall event durations are usually much shorter than the inter event times as such an individual rainfall event may be considered as fallen at an instant of time and a point rainfall series can be idealized as a point process comprised of instantaneous rainfall jumps separated by random arrival times the random rainfall depths of individual events are statistically independent and the time series of rainfall events is therefore a marked poisson process with a mean rainfall event arrival rate μ approximately equalling to u b 1 eagleson 1978 guo 2016 the mark or ancillary variable of this marked poisson process is the rainfall event volume v use of the above described approach for statistically representing historical rainfall series does not consider the possible effects of climate change similar to other approaches currently used in engineering practice historical observations are used to predict future climate conditions assuming that the rainfall time series is a stationary process however climate change has already had observable effects and will likely increase in the future models for predicting future rainfall patterns and amounts have been developed e g easterling et at 2000 wadoux et at 2017 if future climate conditions need to be considered in the design of rwhs the rainfall event separation and frequency analysis procedures as outlined above can also be used to analyse the future rainfall series for locations of interest predicted by climate models in fact exponential distribution models for rainfall event characteristics were found to fit climate model predicted rainfall series as well guo and senior 2006 the stochastic approach developed in this paper can therefore also be used in the design of rwhs taking into consideration the impact of climate change the volume of runoff generated from a catchment that can be collected by the storage unit as the result of a rainfall event with volume v can be expressed as 5 v in 0 v v ff φ st v v ff v v ff where v in is the generated runoff or the available volume of inflow into the storage unit expressed as depth mm of water over the storage unit s bottom area φ st is the contributing ratio and can be calculated as φ st r a ϕ where r a is the ratio between the contributing catchment area and the bottom area of the storage unit r a is referred to as the area ratio hereafter and ϕ is the runoff coefficient of the catchment mainly reflecting the effect of wind infiltration and surface depressions in converting rainfall to runoff ϕ has a value from 0 to unity e g the suggested roof runoff coefficients vary in the range of 0 75 0 95 jennings et al 2015 v ff is the first flush diversion height typically ranging from 0 5 mm to 1 5 mm trca and cvca 2010 eq 5 properly represents the fact that the first v ff millimetres of rainfall of every rainfall event will not be collected by the storage unit since the first flush diversion is considered the runoff process is censored from the rainfall process with events having v v ff removed this runoff process forms a new marked poisson process the new marked poisson process has a less frequent arrival rate of μ μ v ff f v dv μ exp ζ v ff laio et al 2001 rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 the volume of rainfall events remaining in the new marked poisson process has the same distribution as v v ff conditioned on v v ff which is the same as described by eq 2 the mark of the new marked poisson process is the generated runoff volume v in with events having v in 0 removed i e rainfall events with v v ff removed the cumulative distribution function of v in is denoted as f v in and can be derived considering that v in is simply the product of φ st and v v ff conditioned on v v ff i e f v in p φ st v v ff v in v v ff 0 v in φ st v ff ζ exp ζ v dv v ff ζ exp ζ v dv 1 exp ζ v ff exp ζ φ st v in therefore the pdf of the generated runoff or available inflow v in denoted as f v in can be derived as 6 f v in df v in dv in ζ φ st exp ζ φ st v in ζ exp ζ v in where ζ ζ φ st is the exponential distribution parameter of the available inflow normalizing v in by dividing it by w 0 the pdf of the normalized available inflow denoted as r and r v in w 0 can be expressed as 7 f r γ exp γ r r 0 where r is dimensionless and γ ζ w 0 is the normalized dimensionless distribution parameter the rainwater amount that is lost prior to entering the storage unit due to first flush diversion depression storage and other losses e g infiltration losses if the catchment has pervious areas and evaporation have been excluded from the r values considered in eq 7 the actual net normalized inflow into the storage unit as a result of a runoff event generating a normalized available inflow r is denoted as y i e y i s t w 0 the value of y depends on not only r but also s the fraction of the maximum storage capacity that is already filled with water when the runoff event occurs the conditional pdf of y given an antecedent saturation level s is therefore required for further analysis this conditional pdf is denoted as f y s considering the pdf of r as given in eq 7 and the possible relations between y r and s it can be shown that 8 f y s γ exp γ y 0 y 1 s exp γ 1 s δ y 1 s y 1 s where δ is the dirac delta function eq 8 shows that y can only take on values from 0 to 1 s eq 8 also states that additional water cannot be stored by the system as soon as its maximum storage capacity is reached therefore there is an atom of probability at y 1 s under a rainfall event with normalized available inflow r 1 s y r this explains why for this region of y values i e 0 y 1 s the pdf of y is the same as the pdf of r the probability mass at y 1 s represents the probability that a storm will fill up the storage unit to its maximum capacity given that the storage unit has s fraction of it already occupied by water at the beginning of the storm the time series of net inflows into the storage unit can therefore be represented as a new marked poisson process with arrival rate μ and individual marks y obeying the pdf of f y s 2 3 water use rate rwh systems usually supply water to meet the demand for toilet flushing landscape irrigation pavement washing or even as complementary water sources for drinking purpose inside or outside buildings jennings et al 2012 matos et al 2013 palla et al 2011 sturm et al 2009 such water use may have significant daily and seasonal variations and may also change depending on whether it is during a rainfall event or dry period this study focuses on the overall sizing of rwh systems required at the planning or preliminary design stage not on a system s detailed operation therefore the rate of anticipated water demand is treated as a constant equalling its long term average campisano et al 2013 fewkes and wam 2000 hajani and rahman 2014 su et al 2009 the water use is therefore assumed to proceed at the average water demand rate except when the system is completely dry hence the normalized water use rate can be expressed as 9 l s t 0 s 0 η 0 s 1 where η ϖ w 0 is the long term average normalized water demand rate with ϖ being the average water demand rate expressed as depth of water in the storage unit per unit time 2 4 steady state solution of the stochastic water balance equation with the net inflow i s t t in eq 1 described as a marked poisson process with arrival rate μ and individual marks having a pdf as shown in eq 8 eq 1 can therefore be considered as a stochastic differential equation with its solution s t also being a stochastic process which is meaningful only in probabilistic terms since s t is driven by a marked poisson process it would be a markov process with jumps and drifts gardiner 2004 the state pdf of s at time t is denoted as p s t which can be obtained by solving the chapman kolmogorov forward equation for the markov process governed by eq 1 gardiner 2004 the chapman kolmogorov forward equation of a markov process relates the state probability distribution p s t in this case at different times based on eq 1 and adapting from the solutions provided by cox and isham 1986 rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 and rodríguez iturbe and porporato 2004 the chapman kolmogorov forward equations describing the temporal evolution of p s t were found to be 10 t p s t η s p s t μ p s t μ 0 s p z t f s z z dz μ p 0 t f s 0 11 d dt p 0 t μ p 0 t η p 0 t where f s z z is the conditional probability distribution expressed in eq 8 z is the dummy variable of integration p 0 t is the value of the pdf p s t when s approaches zero at time t i e p 0 t lim s 0 p s t and p 0 t is the probability that s is zero or the storage unit is empty at time t eq 11 appears as a part of the chapman kolmogorov forward equations because of the probability mass p 0 t at s 0 by taking the limit as t an equilibrium or steady state solution of the above chapman kolmogorov forward equations exists under this steady state although s still changes randomly with time the pdf of s does not change with time any more and the time series of s afterwards can be described as a strictly stationary process mathematically steady state can only be reached with t but practically since the storage volume of a rwh system is relatively small compared to monthly or seasonal total rainfall a nearly steady state condition would be reached after a few months of operation for planning and design purposes only the system s steady state condition is of interest the steady state solution for p s t is denoted as p s and the steady state solution for p 0 t is denoted as p 0 these steady state solutions can be obtained by setting the left hand sides of eqs 10 and 11 to zero and replacing p s t with p s and p 0 t with p 0 i e 12 η s p s μ p s μ 0 s p z f s z z dz μ p 0 f s 0 0 13 μ p 0 η p 0 0 denoting α μ γ η the steady state solution for cases where α 1 is see appendix for detailed derivations

above expressions η is the normalized water demand rate μ γ represents the normalized mean inflow rate i e the inflow rate averaged through both dry and wet periods therefore α μ γ η i e μ γ η is the ratio between the normalized mean inflow rate and water demand rate the ratio α can also be viewed as the ratio between annual runoff collected by a rwh system and the annual total water demand it is considered as an important parameter in previous studies fewkes 2000 the solutions above show that when the average inflow rate is equal to the average water demand rate i e when α 1 the steady state fluctuation of s is only related to γ otherwise it depends on not only γ but also on η and μ it is noted here that the same steady state solution of the probability distribution of s is presented in

use may primarily take place during dry periods for large buildings or communities use of water supplied by rwh systems may take place no matter if it rains or not therefore depending on the design purposes and time of the year two typical water use patterns exist pattern 1 water is only used during dry periods and pattern 2 water is used during both rainfall events and dry periods guo and baetz 2007 matos et al 2013 palla et al 2011 ward et al 2010 because of these different water use patterns there may be some inaccuracies resulting from the use of eq 9 to represent the water demand rate for rwh systems with pattern 1 water use physically water use occurs only during dry periods and starts when the dry period starts however in the established stochastic model the random inflows are treated as instantaneous pulses with an arrival rate of u b 1 the starting point of water use is thus moved forward to the start of the rainfall event and an additional period i e the duration of the rainfall event is added prior to the actual starting time of water use rainfall event duration is statistically much shorter than inter event dry period e g the average values of rainfall event durations are only 1 10 1 20 of those of the dry periods as shown in table 1 therefore it is reasonable to assume that only a slight overestimation of the overall water use would result from the use of eq 9 for pattern 1 cases if necessary this overestimation may be eliminated by proportionally adjusting the value of η used in the stochastic model for cases with pattern 2 water use stored water is used the same way during both dry and wet times and storage capacity in addition to what is physically provided by the tank is created as a result of water use simultaneously occurring during a rainfall event however in the stochastic model rainfall events are assumed to occur instantaneously so the additional storage capacity generated while water is used is not considered to take into account this additional storage capacity due to the water use occurred during rainfall events it is assumed that the maximum effective storage capacity of a rwh system prior to a rainfall event is approximately equal to the maximum physical storage volume of the system v st plus the average volume of water used during a rainfall event for pattern 1 water use no adjustment on the storage capacity is needed the maximum effective storage capacity can therefore be expressed as 16 w 0 v st a st pattern 1 water use v st a st ϖ u pattern 2 water use where v st is the storage volume measured in the unit of lites l or m3 and a st is the bottom area of the storage unit measured in the unit consistent with v st ϖ u is the average volume of water used during a rainfall event the acceptability of this simplification will be confirmed later 2 6 long term water balance and performance statistics performance indicators of a rwh system can be analytically expressed based on the preceding stochastic solutions first of all the performance of a rwh system in reducing potable water consumption is often examined by quantifying its volumetric reliability defined as the ratio between the total volume of rainwater supplied by the system and the total demand another time based reliability is defined as the fraction of time when the water demand is met by the rwh system guo and baetz 2007 mun and han 2012 palla et al 2011 santos and taveira pinto 2013 since water use rate is considered to be a constant whenever there is water in the storage tank the long term average volumetric reliability and the time based reliability are the same denoted as r e and also referred to as water saving efficiency using the stochastic model results presented earlier r e can be calculated as 17 r e l d 0 1 η p s ds η 1 p 0 where l 0 1 η p s ds is the normalized mean water use rate i e the actual average rate of water supplied by the system for use averaged through both wet and dry periods d η is the normalized water demand rate it is obvious that 1 p 0 which is the average fraction of time when there is water in storage can indeed represent this water supply reliability moreover p 0 which is the average fraction of time when there is no water in storage has also been defined as the water deficit rate in the performance analysis of rwh systems su et al 2009 youn et al 2012 additionally an unnecessarily large storage tank would be a misuse of investment and space yet it may still not meet the reliability requirement when the catchment size is too small amongst the performance indicators water supply reliability is found to be the most appropriate criterion to size a rwh system ensuring that the system may achieve a high water saving performance at a relatively low cost hajani and rahman 2014 santos and taveira pinto 2013 zhang et al 2009 substituting γ ζ w 0 φ st η ϖ w 0 into eq 14a or eq 15a for calculating p 0 and then substituting that p 0 expression into eq 17 solving for w 0 from the resulting expression of r e the following was obtained 18 w 0 ϖ μ ln 1 ζ φ st ϖ μ r e 1 r e 1 ζ φ st ϖ μ α 1 φ st ζ r e 1 r e α 1 eq 18 may provide an easy to use tool for sizing storage tanks with specified reliability requirements given an optimized desired r e e g the storage tank sized with a reliability of 80 was found to achieve the highest ratio between water savings and installation cost santos and taveira pinto 2013 and based on eq 18 the required storage volume for cases under pattern 1 water use can be calculated as v st w 0 a st and the required storage volume for cases under pattern 2 water use can be calculated as v st w 0 ϖ u a st also the runoff reduction benefit can be quantified by the long term average stormwater capture efficiency or runoff reduction ratio denoted as c e which can be derived as follows 19 c e l r 0 1 η p s ds μ γ γ η μ 1 p 0 r e α where r μ γ is the normalized mean inflow rate eq 19 shows that c e and r e are linearly related which is consistent with their respective definitions in addition considering the discontinuous nature of the loss function l s t at s 0 the cumulative distribution function cdf of s denoted as c u s for cases where α 1 can be determined as follows 20 c u s p 0 s 0 s p s ds α exp γ α 1 s 1 α exp γ α 1 1 c u s for cases where α 1 can be derived as follows 21 c u s p 0 s 0 s 1 p s

1 can be derived as follows 23 s s 0 s 1 sp s ds γ 1 γ eq 22 or eq 23 provide a convenient estimate of the long term average water level in the storage tank 3 validation of the stochastic solutions by comparing with swmm continuous simulation results in establishing the stochastic model rainfall events are assumed to occur instantaneously the arrival of the rainfall events are treated as a poisson process the volume for any rainfall event is randomly drawn from an exponential distribution and the maximum effective storage capacity of rwh systems is assumed to be equal to what is described by eq 16 the lid module of the u s environmental protection agency s storm water management model swmm version 5 1 rossman 2015 does not employ similar assumptions and was found to provide accurate long term average performance evaluations of rwh systems campisano et al 2017b therefore to verify the accuracy of the derived stochastic results and test the validity of the simplifying assumptions continuous simulations using the swmm model were conducted with results compared to those from stochastic analysis in a swmm model two subcatchments are established subcatchment a represents the contributing area with depression storage equaling the value of first flush while subcatchment b represents the rwh system to model rwh systems under pattern 2 water use subcatchment b is modeled using swmm s lid module in which water in the rwh system can be used during both dry and rainfall periods since swmm s lid module does not provide a water use option for systems where water use only occurs during dry periods to model cases under pattern 1 water use subcatchment b is modeled in swmm as a regular 100 impervious subcatchment with its surface depression storage equaling v st a st and evaporation set to occur only in dry periods with a constant rate equaling to ϖ using continuous rainfall data the swmm model performs time step by time step simulations of the operation of the rwh system and can output the inflow into subcatchment b denoted as v inb and runoff i e discharge from subcatchment b denoted as v outb thus the stormwater capture efficiency can be calculated as 1 v outb v inb local rainfall statistics conditions of contributing area storage tank size and water demand rate are the main factors influencing the performance of rwh systems campisano et al 2013 fewkes and wam 2000 guo and baetz 2007 imteaz et al 2011 kim and yoo 2009 mun and han 2012 rwh systems in locations with different climates i e atlanta concord detroit flagstaff and billings as shown in table 1 with varying contributing area conditions φ st changing from 5 to 500 storage tank sizes v st changing from 200 l to 500 l and water demand rates hereafter l st is used to denote the volumetric water demand rate i e l st ϖ a st l st varies from 100 l day to 1000 l day are modeled in the swmm simulations hourly rainfall records were used as the rainfall inputs and a 5 min computational time step was used to ensure accuracy campisano and modica 2014 demonstrated that this kind of computational resolution is accurate enough for long term average performance evaluation stormwater capture efficiencies of various rwh systems under pattern 1 and pattern 2 water uses calculated using the analytical stochastic solutions eq 19 with w 0 expressed in eq 16 are compared with swmm simulation results the comparisons for 206 different cases under pattern 1 water use and 158 different cases under pattern 2 water use are shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively treating swmm results as observed data the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nsme the root mean square error rmse and the correlation coefficient between stochastic results and observed values were also calculated and the results are also presented in figs 2 and 3 it can be seen from the two figures that the analytical and simulation results are well within agreement taking the continuous simulation results as a benchmark the summary statistics indicate that the derived analytical solutions can provide an accurate and reliable method for estimating stormwater capture efficiencies to save space only some cases in atlanta are illustrated in figs 4 and 5 the two figures show that the stormwater capture efficiency of a rwh system would generally rise with the increase of the storage tank size and the water use rate and rapidly drop with the increase of the contributing ratio additionally in fig 4 the derived stochastic solution is also compared with the analytical probabilistic solution that adopted the same water use pattern pattern 1 and derived by guo and baetz 2007 as previously discussed a simplifying assumption about the initial water content of the storage tank had to be made in that event based probabilistic approach in the guo and baetz s 2007 solution it was assumed that the storage unit would be full at the beginning of a dry period preceding a rainfall event which is the end of the last rainfall event only small storage units e g rain barrels were considered and probabilistic results were obtained by analyzing the operation of the system during the dry and subsequent rainfall period preceded by the last rainfall event in comparison with the continuous simulation results results based on the guo and baetz s 2007 solution performed well when the storage volume is relatively small but would underestimate the stormwater capture efficiency when the storage tank size gets larger and the water use rate also reaches a certain high value or when the contributing ratio is relatively small this is because the contributing ratio determines the amount of inflow into the storage tank and when the contributing ratio is small the inflow volume is small and there is less a possibility for a rwh system with a larger storage capacity to be filled when a rainfall event ends with a large water use rate the runoff into the storage tank can be used quickly during a rainfall event that is why for these cases the assumption that the storage space is filled when the last storm ends becomes more unrealistic the average storage capacity available at the beginning of a random rainfall event would be larger than what is calculated in the analytical probabilistic approach therefore the stormwater capture efficiency for these cases will be slightly underestimated by the previous analytical probabilistic solutions the proposed stochastic method effectively gets rid of the simplifying assumptions about the initial condition of the water level in the storage unit at the start of a random rainfall event and therefore overcomes the resulting limitations it can provide a more general and reliable analytical tool for evaluating the long term average performance of rwh systems with wider application ranges 4 example analysis results in addition to stormwater capture efficiency many other valuable indicators can also be conveniently obtained using the derived formulas these results are also of great interest in the performance evaluation and design of rwh systems but continuous simulation models do not directly output these results the commonly used pattern 2 water use was applied as an example in the following analysis the cumulative frequency distribution of normalized water level in the storage tank and its long term average value can be calculated using eq 20 or eq 21 and 22 or eq 23 respectively taking atlanta as an example fig 6 a c and e show that the fluctuation of the water level in the storage tank is greater with larger contributing ratio larger storage tank size and smaller water demand rate for a given rwh system increases of contributing ratio can provide more available water to fill the storage and a larger storage tank size is able to store more rainwater for later uses therefore as shown in fig 6 b and d the normalized long term average water level s rises with larger contributing ratio and larger storage tank size contrarily higher rates of water use will certainly reduce the average water level in the storage as revealed in fig 6 f note that the rate of change of s with these factors are significantly different this should be taken into account in the optimum design of storage tanks the performance of a rwh system is often discussed in terms of either its water supply reliability r e or its water deficit rate p 0 the derived stochastic solutions indicate that these two indices mainly depend on the rainfall event characteristics and the water use patterns they are complementary to each other example results of the long term water deficit rate p 0 of rwh systems are included in fig 6 and the water supply reliability of rwh systems in atlanta and billings are presented in fig 7 fig 6 shows that increasing the contributing ratio and or the storage size can reduce the water deficit rate of rwh systems whereas increases in water use rate can significantly aggravate water deficit it can be seen from fig 7 that the water supply reliabilities of rwh systems in a humid region atlanta are generally higher than those that can be obtained in an arid region billings fig 7 highlights further that gradual increases of storage tank size and contributing ratio usually help raise water supply reliability but the relationship between r e and these controlling factors are significantly nonlinear which should be adequately considered in the sizing of rwh systems 5 concluding remarks runoff reduction and water supply are the two most important benefits of rainwater harvesting rwh systems based on a stochastic water balance equation analytical solutions which can be used for the detailed analysis of the hydrological performance of rwh systems were derived two typical water use patterns were considered and the analytical solutions for both of them were compared with the corresponding continuous simulation results the analytical solutions are fairly accurate for a wide range of cases with different contributing ratios storage sizes and water use rates located in five representative climate regions in the united states overall it was demonstrated that this stochastic approach is feasible and reliable in modeling the long term water balance of rwh systems it is worth emphasizing that the presented solutions are valid for rwh systems located in regions where the rainfall series may be approximated as marked poisson processes a similar stochastic approach was used recently by pelak and porporato 2016 for the optimal design of rwh systems the mathematical models describing the input rainfall series and the dynamic water balance of rwh systems used in this study are similar to those used by pelak and porporato 2016 however different water use patterns were considered and additional analytical solutions useful for the planning and design of rwh systems were derived in this study in addition the analytical solutions presented in this paper were also verified for their accuracies by comparing with continuous simulation results whereas the analytical solutions provided by pelak and porporato 2016 were not verified for their accuracies the analytical solutions presented in this paper relate the stormwater capture efficiency and water supply reliability of rwh systems directly and explicitly to the rainfall conditions sizes of contributing areas water collection conveyance efficiencies storage tank sizes and average water use rates significant nonlinear dependencies of the system performance on these factors have been observed design optimization is therefore necessary to balance the cost and performance the proposed analytical solutions are accurate concise and can be conveniently implemented in computer spreadsheets they may provide a robust and easy to use tool for the performance evaluation and optimum design of rwh systems acknowledgements this work has been supported by

equations the expression of f y s as given by eq 8 needs to be substituted into eq 12 in order to solve it rodríguez iturbe and porporato 2004 proved that substitution of the portion of eq 8 that contains the dirac delta function into eq 12 would eventually lead to the same equation as substituting the other portion of eq 8 into eq 12 therefore only the portion of eq 8 that does not contain the dirac delta function is dealt with here substituting that portion of f y s that does not contain the dirac delta function into eq 12 multiplying the resulting equation by exp γ s differentiating

7207,a geological repository for low and intermediate radioactive waste bottom at 130 m a s l was constructed from 2008 to 2014 in the southeastern coastal area in korea this research aimed to evaluate the hydrogeochemistry in this area during the construction period and to determine the characteristics that should be monitored during the operational period during construction the groundwater level decreased up to 136 m and the upper groundwater flow in the southeastern area reversed after the groundwater level dropped below the sea level the electrical conductivity ec in several wells along the coastal line started to increase 23 2 of the measured water was classified as brackish water and the highest ec observed in groundwater was 18 9 ms cm nearly 38 of ec in seawater the response time of the groundwater chemistry differs depending on the depth even in wells because of fracture networks among locations that showed drastic changes in ec only the shallow depth of gm 4 showed a peak pattern in ec but other locations showed increasing ec patterns or patterns with initial increase and sustained high till the end of the construction period based on the cl br ratio the source of the groundwater salinity was seawater intrusion and ion exchange played an important role compared to cl concentration sodium was depleted and calcium was in excess in brackish water however the so4 cl ratio remained constant at a level similar to seawater ca and fe concentrations showed distinguishable characteristics depending on the location suggesting differences in geological media during the operational period periodical evaluation of the groundwater chemistry in the mixing zone and continuous monitoring of ec patterns and seawater fractions are required keywords radioactive waste disposal underground construction seawater intrusion cation exchange fractured aquifer 1 introduction nuclear energy and radioactive materials have many beneficial uses for human life such as high electric power and development of the imaging technology but the associated radioactive waste becomes intractable underground isolation of radioactive waste is considered a safe and reliable method and therefore it was adopted in several countries rempe 2007 however there are several hydrologic issues based on the host rock type tsang et al 2015 flow and transport are the main issues in fractured crystalline rocks in which sweden and finland excavated repositories therefore the äspö hard rock laboratory sweden published many articles on hydrological processes and reactions within the fracture zone banwart et al 1999 molinero and samper 2006 facilities related to radioactive waste require a site monitoring program at different periods during its lifetime according to the international atomic energy agency iaea 2011 and nuclear safety act nssc 2014 1 during the preoperational period to obtain baseline data to characterize the site 2 during the operational period to obtain data to verify the characterization of the site safety evaluation and design and 3 during the post closure period to acquire data for the early warning with respect to radionuclide releases from the disposal site and to verify the characterization of the site and safety evaluation in korea the geological repository for low and intermediate radioactive waste lilrw is located in the southeastern coastal area the site is currently in the operational stage the monitoring program of this stage started in 2015 at least quarterly monitoring will be continued over 60 years until closure before starting construction a detailed survey was conducted to assess the feasibility of the location for lilrw several research papers were published kim et al 2008a kim et al 2008b the groundwater in this area was fresh at that time however the electrical conductivity ec in several groundwater sampling locations started to increase during construction fresh groundwater then changed to brackish groundwater to estimate the status of seawater intrusion swi monitoring wells equipped with a multi packer were installed along the coastal line because the geology at the depth of dome bodies is characterized by fractured aquifers swi is a worldwide issue especially with respect to freshwater conservation because many coastal aquifers are threatened by swi custodio and bruggeman 1987 goswami and clement 2007 werner et al 2013a groundwater depletion caused by intensive pumping and increased water use is one of the reasons leading to swi in coastal areas and changing fresh groundwater to brackish or saline water usgs 2000 werner et al 2013b underground structures in coastal areas also cause the decrease of the groundwater level leading to swi because drainage of the groundwater inflow into underground structures is required fernandez and moon 2010 attard et al 2016 additionally construction activities such as excavation cutting the mountain and building underground facilities can affect the groundwater flow system ding et al 2008 hyun 2013 despite extensive studies on the swi process there are knowledge gaps particularly with respect to the transient state therefore long term high density monitoring of field scale swi is required werner et al 2013a swi dynamics have been studied with laboratory experiments and numerical simulations goswami and clement 2007 lu and werner 2013 however the distribution of saline water and the nature of the swi in fractured coastal systems remain poorly understood werner et al 2013a sebben et al 2015 numerical investigations of the effect of high permeability fractures are in the preliminary stage sebben et al 2015 modeling of heterogeneity effects reflecting stratified geological formations indicated that the difference in the permeability across layers causes broad mixing zones in low permeability layers but narrower zones in higher permeability layers dagan and zeitoun 1998 lu et al 2013 kim et al 2013 based on several case studies of swi in fractured aquifers lim et al 2013 park et al 2012 it was concluded that fractures provide preferential flow and transport pathways the chemical process of swi with time is usually investigated with laboratory experiments such as column tests and reactive transport modeling apple et al 1990 russak and sivan 2010 russak et al 2016 boluda botella et al 2008 boluda botella et al 2014 the groundwater chemistry in the area affected by swi is controlled by conservative mixing between saline and fresh water and various water rock interactions such as cation exchange and mineral dissolution precipitation russak and sivan 2010 because the constituents of seawater are different than that of fresh water relative changes in constituents such as ca and na and sometimes sr li and mn indicate a characteristic development of water types and chromatographic patterns appelo and postma 2005 russak et al 2016 therefore the ratio or patterns of these constituents are used as a reliable tool to characterize the swi status however unlike in lab experiments or modeling studies many factors affect the major constituents during field observations preliminary source tracking of groundwater salinity is required because there may be various salinity sources richter and kreitler 1993 alcalá and custodio 2008 giambastiani et al 2013 fresh saline water interfaces might fluctuate because of rainfall recharge tides global sea level rise and changes of the artificial pumping rate leading to complex swi stages such as salinization or freshening russak and sivan 2010 therefore contour mapping of cl or total dissolved solid tds is usually adapted to estimate the region affected by swi during field observations barlow 2003 han et al 2014 the purpose of this study was to understand the hydrology and hydrogeochemistry in the coastal area during the construction of the geological repository and determine characteristics that should be carefully monitored during the operational period of the geological repository for lilrw in korea our study area is a good field site to study the swi process in a fractured aquifer at the field scale because of great advantages with respect to obtaining long term periodical groundwater data as a facility related to radioactive waste we propose a conceptual model for this area that explains the hydrogeochemical evolution during the construction period and suggest characteristics to be monitored during the operational period 2 site description 2 1 general information the study area the geological repository for lilrw is located in the coastal area of southeastern korea fig 1 six dome bodies with a height of 50 m and inner diameter of 30 m are located between 80 and 130 m below the mean sea level and several hundred meters away from the coast this study used the data provided by the korea radioactive waste agency korad 2015 2 2 geomorphology and geology before construction the study area was hilly land with 45 7 of the total area at an elevation 100 m 46 9 of the area had a slight land slope 20 kim et al 2008a the geomorphology did not significantly change after construction the geology of the site mainly consists of cretaceous sedimentary rock with granite intrusions fig 1a the center of the intrusion body is granodiorite its boundary with the sedimentary rock was thermally metamorphosed five fractured zones z21 23 and z31 32 with a width of 10 m were identified on a surface around the site and three fractured zones f31 33 which did not reach the surface were found during underground construction based on the report by kim et al 2008b the minerals in fracture fillings are montmorillonite most abundant chlorite illite and zeolite minerals pyrite fes2 is widely observed from trace to vein calcite caco3 occurs only in sedimentary rock 2 3 hydrology and hydrogeology the groundwater table before construction is shown in fig 2 a april 2008 the recharge area was the hilly region in the west and the base flow moved to the east seaside the massive granite area northeast of the silos showed low hydraulic conductivity 10 8 m s compared with the southeastern area with fracture zones 10 6 10 7 m s personal communication the groundwater chemistry was affected by base rock weathering and reactions with secondary minerals the ec of groundwater in 2006 7 boreholes sampled four times ranged from 116 to 486 μs cm with an average of 241 μs cm and median of 198 μs cm the chloride concentrations were below 71 8 mg l with an average of 11 8 mg l table s1 2 4 water sampling and analysis groundwater monitoring during the preoperational period was performed quarterly from september 2008 to december 2014 the groundwater level was monitored at 24 wells every hour and groundwater samples were quarterly collected from 8 gm series wells equipped multi packer for the sampling from each depth fig 1b because our study focused on the groundwater chemistry related to the construction of underground facilities and seawater intrusion the southeastern wells along the coast gm 1 2 4 and 6 and a well for background data gm 7 were evaluated in detail the sampling depths are shown in table 1 part of the gm series wells were installed during construction therefore the start time providing valid data differed depending on the wells gm 1 and 2 from the beginning of construction september 2008 gm 4 and 6 from september 2010 and gm 7 from september 2011 seawater was also sampled quarterly at two locations and those analytical data was provided as table s2 in supplementary data in addition to field measurements of alkalinity ec ph eh and temperature the sampled groundwater and seawater were analyzed in the laboratory using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes icp mass spectrometry ms and ion chromatography ic to determine major cations minor elemental constituents and anions respectively these data were analyzed and interpreted using various hydrogeochemical diagrams statistical methods spss 21 and geochemical modeling phreeqc interactive 3 3 5 3 results 3 1 groundwater level changes fig 2a shows that the groundwater level in the study area was above the sea level before construction affected by topography however it decreased up to 136 m at the end of construction thus several inland areas had a groundwater level below the sea level the decrease of the groundwater level during construction was related to excavation activities for transit tunnels and silos when the tunnel construction faced fractured zones f31 and f33 in 2009 a great decrease in groundwater level occurred fig 2b after several construction events the groundwater level had a conical shape and the depth of the point was lowered close to the bottom of the silos 130 m a s l fig 2c d the excavation and grouting were finished in may 2013 fig 2e the groundwater level is stabilizing without drastic changes fig 2f the construction of a geological repository designed with drainage tunnel caused a reversal of the shallow groundwater flow between silos and sea because of differences in hydraulic conductivities the dominant groundwater flow between the sea and silos originated southeast at the end of construction when the tunnel construction faced fractured zones the water levels of the wells in the southeastern area gm 2 4 6 and other monitoring wells responded furthermore these wells showed a wide range in ec especially after the decrease of the water level however other wells maintained a ec with a narrow range fig 3 a 3 2 changes in ec the ec measured at the gm series wells during the preoperational period showed a bimodal distribution with a boundary line of 2000 µs cm fig 3b according to the guidelines from the u s geological survey barlow 2003 a water body can be classified as fresh or brackish at 1000 mg kg of total dissolved solid tds all samples with low ec 2000 µs cm were classified as fresh water because the tds value was under 1000 mg kg otherwise high ec water samples n 108 23 2 of samples were classified as brackish water 1000 mg kg in tds the ec of brackish groundwater showed a linear correlation with the cl concentration fig 4 a r2 0 9617 the highest ec observed in groundwater was 18 9 ms cm nearly 38 of ec in seawater the cl br ratio can be used as tracer to identify the cause of the groundwater salinity because of its non reactive nature alcalá and custodio 2008 when comparing the cl br molar ratio with the 5 year average value of seawater of 642 118 mean standard deviation sd the proportion of brackish groundwater with a cl br ratio within a range of 1 and 2 sd from that of seawater was 74 and 94 fig 4b respectively therefore the source of groundwater salinization in the study area was seawater intrusion fig 3a shows that gm 1 and 7 and the deep depths of gm 2 4 and 6 remained fresh until the end of the preoperational period however the shallow and middle depth of gm 2 4 and 6 showed drastic ec changes because these wells indicated a great decrease in the groundwater level when facing fractured zones during construction we interpret the changes in ec with time by comparing them with the groundwater levels fig 5 a fast response was observed at shallow depth at gm 2 and 4 and in the middle at gm 6 the ec started to rise one year after the groundwater lowered below the sea level even in a well the ec response time differed depending on the depth gm 4 3 showed a retardation of 1 5 year compared with gm 4 1 fig 5d the shallow depth data at gm 4 showed a peak pattern in ec it started to rise in 2010 maximized in 2013 and then decreased in 2014 at the end of the preoperational period the other locations still showed an increasing pattern or maintained the highest ec value 3 3 changes in water type changes in the water type were interpreted using a piper diagram the relationship with ec patterns are shown in fig 6 and concentration data of major constituents are provided as supplementary data table s3 when ec was low there was no dominant water type plotted in central region of rhombus however the water type changed to cl type when ec started to rise the water type changed to cacl type in an early stage of ec increase and then steadily shifted toward nacl type close to seawater well gm 4 1 a showed the fastest response followed by the shallow depth at gm 2 b and middle depth at gm 6 c however the middle depth at gm 4 d maintained the cacl type at the end of preoperational period brackish groundwater showed a lower na cl molar ratio than seawater 0 81 in our study indicating na depletion fig 7 a the na cl ratio of gm 4 1 in 2014 which showed a decrease in ec is marked in the diagram with increasing ec na depleted but became constant with decreasing ec custodio 1987 showed that the decrease in the na cl ratio balances the increase in ca mg cl ratio when swi occurred in the coastal aquifer containing freshwater the value of na k cl with ca mg so4 hco3 is widely used to identify ion exchange these values show 1 1 matching slope of 1 when ion exchange is dominant in the system rajmohan and elango 2004 a diagram for these values in brackish groundwater showed the slope of 0 9650 fig 7b indicating the importance of the ion exchange in this area the equivalent ratio of so4 cl in brackish groundwater was similar to that of seawater 0 10 in our study indicating that seawater was the source of the groundwater salinity although sometimes so4 enrichment was observed in fresh groundwater fig 8 a the saturation indices si of gypsum caso4 2h2o of 4 locations showing drastic changes in ec gm 2 4 gm 4 1 and 4 3 and gm 6 3 were calculated using phreeqc interactive and then plotted in fig 8b they indicate that gypsum precipitation did not occur at these locations when seawater intruded therefore the sulfate ion was conservative during swi well gm 6 showed so4 enrichment in the initial sampling stages which disappeared within one year the source of so4 enrichment cannot be clarified here however gypsum dissolution can be considered because the si of gypsum was below 0 5 indicating the possibility of gypsum dissolution 3 4 site specific characteristics as explained above the hydrogeochemistry in study area was mainly affected by swi and the accompanying cation exchange the cation exchange capacity cec which might differ at each location affects the development of chromatographic groundwater patterns the ca concentrations of gm 6 3 which showed the maximum amount of exchanged cations 120 meq l in winter 2013 fig 7b were compared with gm 4 1 with a similar cl concentration range fig 9 a well gm 6 3 showed a nearly two times higher ca concentration than gm 4 1 at the same cl concentration indicating a higher cec or different dispersion at gm 6 3 based on the results of geochemical modeling using phreeqc interactive gm 4 1 did not reach saturation of carbonate minerals however gm 2 4 and gm 6 3 were oversaturated fig 9b d to identify factors controlling the hydrochemistry of brackish groundwater other than swi principle component analysis pca was performed using the spss program brackish groundwater was analyzed both with and without seawater the result is shown in table s4 in the supplementary data the first and second factors suggested the effect of seawater however the ion exchange differentiated the factors factor 1 had a high correlation with na and k but factor 2 strongly correlated with ca the pca analysis did not indicate a significant difference in cl br so4 and mg with and without seawater because both factors originate from seawater which is the source of these constituents however fe and mn showed a significant difference due to their absence in seawater shallow depths at gm 2 and gm 4 showed high fe and mn concentrations up to 70 3 and 33 4 mg l in gm 2 4 in june 2013 respectively although mn was absent from seawater mn showed an weak increase with ec r 2 0 6050 however fe showed a different behavior when ec was low only up to 1 3 mg l fe was detected in gm 2 4 fe then increased with ec increase at shallow depth at gm 2 and gm 4 fig 10 meanwhile gm 6 and the middle depth at gm 4 showed low to moderate fe concentrations 5 mg l despite of high ec 4 discussion 4 1 hydrogeochemical evolution based on swi the construction of a geological repository required the drainage of groundwater inflow it led to a reversal of the upper groundwater flow groundwater salinization then started from seaside in the dominant flow direction fig 5 many processes and factors are associated with swi including dispersive mixing tidal effects density effects and geological characteristics werner et al 2013a in this area the advective forces caused by the drainage of groundwater inflow were the most significant factor the shallow depth at gm 4 showed a peak in ec fig 5 which matched the drained groundwater inflow from underground facilities with 1 5 year time lags r 2 0 8000 fig s1 well the most cation exchangeable site of terrestrial aquifer materials is occupied with ca however it changes to na when seawater intrudes appelo and postma 2005 the ca peak caused by cation exchange is an important indicator of the advancing front when seawater intrudes richter and kreitler 1993 after the cation exchange reaches an equilibrium na and ca proportion of groundwater becomes similar with seawater and the water type changes to nacl the same as seawater richter and kreitler 1993 although the response time differs at each sampling location in our study the water type changed to cacl in the very beginning of ec increase and then changes to nacl close to seawater fig 6 sodium depletion was observed in brackish groundwater its amount of 1 1 matched the ca excess indicating that cation exchange occurred fig 7 the shallow depth at gm 4 showed the limited exchangeable ca amount fig 9a therefore minerals containing ca such as gypsum and calcite did not reach saturation fig 9b and the water type quickly changed to nacl fig 6a in the simulation of salt water intrusion by advective transport into a fresh water aquifer using phreeqc appelo and postma 2005 the ionic constituents showed significant patterns cl is conservative but na is delayed because of ion exchange accompanying ca and mg peak patterns however dispersion and cec can differentiate the shapes of ion concentration curves even in the same aquifer materials boluda botella et al 2008 2014 our results for the locations showed a drastic change in ec gypsum precipitation was not observed when sulfate increased fig 8b our chromatographic patterns were similar to the experimental result for high dispersion caused by high velocity experiment a boluda botella et al 2008 4 2 characteristics caused by geology southeastern wells showed drastic changes in ec during construction fig 3a however the response time differed with depth even in a well fig 5 the fastest response was observed at shallow depth at gm 4 followed by shallow depth at gm 2 middle depth at gm 6 and middle depth at gm 4 fig 6 the bottom of gm 2 4 and 6 remained fresh groundwater until the end of preoperational period fig 3a based on this observation we inferred that the hydraulic connection was different depending on the depth this area therefore had preferential flow caused by the fracture network furthermore when ec started to rise the slope of ec increase with time decreased with increasing response time fig 5d indicating the broadening of the advancing front our observation corresponds to the numerical modeling of stratified aquifers lu et al 2013 kim et al 2013 well gm 4 1 showed a limited amount of exchangeable ca compared with gm 6 3 fig 9a calcite only occurred in sedimentary rocks and the dominant fracture filling materials were montmorillonite and then chlorite illite and zeolite minerals as explained in section 2 2 the cec of montmorillonite is 800 1200 meq kg larger than that of illite 200 500 meq kg or chlorite 100 400 meq kg appleo and postma 2005 because gm 4 was located in granodiorite bedrock fig 1a and the shallow depth showed undersaturation of calcite fig 9b the main source of ca was fracture filling material well gm 6 located at the boundary of the granodiorite intrusion body equilibrated with calcite fig 9d and therefore might contain more exchangeable or dissolvable ca than gm 4 1 additionally the distribution of fracture filling material in the preferential flow path was inferred to affect the cec at each location the fe concentrations showed different patterns at each location depending on ec only a part of the locations showed fe increase in accordance with ec increase fig 10 these different patterns indicated the effect of geological variation pyrite fes2 in bedrock can be considered as a source of fe in groundwater because it was widely observed in this area from trace to vein kim et al 2008a however based on the phreeqci results data not shown here the reactive minerals containing fe 2 si 2 were amorphous fe oh 3 and siderite feco3 indicating that altered or secondary fe minerals were the direct sources of fe increase therefore only the fe concentration at locations connected with fractures filled with secondary fe minerals were assumed to increase with increasing ec 4 3 characteristics to be monitored during the operational period the hydrogeochemical evolution stage of each location appeared to be different according to fracture network and filling materials fig 6 shows that the shallow depth at gm 2 and gm 4 and middle depth at gm 6 passed cacl type and then changed to nacl type in the end of preoperational period however the middle depth at gm 4 gm 4 3 where ec started to increase with a retardation of 1 5 years showed a stage of cacl type water cation exchange occurred in the advancing front of seawater that intruded the aquifer richter and kreitler 1993 therefore it is concluded that the advancing front of seawater already passed the shallow depth of gm 2 and gm 4 and middle depth of gm 6 landward but was close to the middle depth of gm 4 based on the cec and seawater mixing ratio of preferential flow the time at which the water type changed might differ at each sampling location in the mixing zone the major constituent ratio might change due to mineral alteration precipitation or dissolution of specific minerals and or sulfate reduction richter and kreitler 1993 appelo and postma 2005 therefore continuous monitoring of the water type and periodical evaluation of its effects on the groundwater chemistry are required in the study area ec significantly increased after the groundwater level decreased due to construction activities only shallow water at gm 4 showed a peak pattern in ec during the preoperational period however ec increased and sustained high at other points fig 6 here we hypothesized that the drainage of groundwater inflow caused swi as discussed in section 4 1 because the amount of groundwater drained from underground facilities causing the advective force showed a peak pattern and then stabilized fig s1 the seawater fraction was expected to have an initial peak in an early stage of swi especially in locations with good fracture networks both sea and underground facilities if the advective force is small other factors can significantly affect seawater intrusion and these locations will show other ec patterns therefore the ec pattern in wells needs to be monitored during the operational period and the seawater fraction needs to be confirmed using other tracers such as stable isotope ratios 5 conclusions the hydrogeochemistry in a coastal area was investigated during a 6 year construction period a conceptual model explaining changes was created the study area is the site of a geological repository for lilrw located in the southeastern coastal area in korea during construction the groundwater inflow into underground facilities drained and the groundwater level dropped significantly as a result the upper groundwater flow in the southeastern area reversed and seawater intrusion occurred where seawater intruded fresh groundwater was changed to brackish groundwater and cation exchange occurred in the aquifer based on fracture networks and fracture filling materials such as montmorillonite the ec response time and seawater fraction varied depending on each location and depth based on this work the characteristics that should be carefully monitored during the operational period of over 60 years were determined 1 periodical evaluation of the groundwater chemistry especially for where the advancing front is and what the chemistry is in the mixing zone and 2 monitoring how ec patterns and seawater fraction are changing because seawater can alter cement and steel and affect the stability of concrete structures hyun 2013 luo et al 2015 the seawater fraction in groundwater contacting concrete structures needs to be monitored carefully although the structures were reinforced the fracture networks between gm series wells and silos are unknown therefore another monitoring well needs to be installed in this area to tracking the advancing front of seawater intrusion acknowledgements the authors appreciate korad for providing

7207,a geological repository for low and intermediate radioactive waste bottom at 130 m a s l was constructed from 2008 to 2014 in the southeastern coastal area in korea this research aimed to evaluate the hydrogeochemistry in this area during the construction period and to determine the characteristics that should be monitored during the operational period during construction the groundwater level decreased up to 136 m and the upper groundwater flow in the southeastern area reversed after the groundwater level dropped below the sea level the electrical conductivity ec in several wells along the coastal line started to increase 23 2 of the measured water was classified as brackish water and the highest ec observed in groundwater was 18 9 ms cm nearly 38 of ec in seawater the response time of the groundwater chemistry differs depending on the depth even in wells because of fracture networks among locations that showed drastic changes in ec only the shallow depth of gm 4 showed a peak pattern in ec but other locations showed increasing ec patterns or patterns with initial increase and sustained high till the end of the construction period based on the cl br ratio the source of the groundwater salinity was seawater intrusion and ion exchange played an important role compared to cl concentration sodium was depleted and calcium was in excess in brackish water however the so4 cl ratio remained constant at a level similar to seawater ca and fe concentrations showed distinguishable characteristics depending on the location suggesting differences in geological media during the operational period periodical evaluation of the groundwater chemistry in the mixing zone and continuous monitoring of ec patterns and seawater fractions are required keywords radioactive waste disposal underground construction seawater intrusion cation exchange fractured aquifer 1 introduction nuclear energy and radioactive materials have many beneficial uses for human life such as high electric power and development of the imaging technology but the associated radioactive waste becomes intractable underground isolation of radioactive waste is considered a safe and reliable method and therefore it was adopted in several countries rempe 2007 however there are several hydrologic issues based on the host rock type tsang et al 2015 flow and transport are the main issues in fractured crystalline rocks in which sweden and finland excavated repositories therefore the äspö hard rock laboratory sweden published many articles on hydrological processes and reactions within the fracture zone banwart et al 1999 molinero and samper 2006 facilities related to radioactive waste require a site monitoring program at different periods during its lifetime according to the international atomic energy agency iaea 2011 and nuclear safety act nssc 2014 1 during the preoperational period to obtain baseline data to characterize the site 2 during the operational period to obtain data to verify the characterization of the site safety evaluation and design and 3 during the post closure period to acquire data for the early warning with respect to radionuclide releases from the disposal site and to verify the characterization of the site and safety evaluation in korea the geological repository for low and intermediate radioactive waste lilrw is located in the southeastern coastal area the site is currently in the operational stage the monitoring program of this stage started in 2015 at least quarterly monitoring will be continued over 60 years until closure before starting construction a detailed survey was conducted to assess the feasibility of the location for lilrw several research papers were published kim et al 2008a kim et al 2008b the groundwater in this area was fresh at that time however the electrical conductivity ec in several groundwater sampling locations started to increase during construction fresh groundwater then changed to brackish groundwater to estimate the status of seawater intrusion swi monitoring wells equipped with a multi packer were installed along the coastal line because the geology at the depth of dome bodies is characterized by fractured aquifers swi is a worldwide issue especially with respect to freshwater conservation because many coastal aquifers are threatened by swi custodio and bruggeman 1987 goswami and clement 2007 werner et al 2013a groundwater depletion caused by intensive pumping and increased water use is one of the reasons leading to swi in coastal areas and changing fresh groundwater to brackish or saline water usgs 2000 werner et al 2013b underground structures in coastal areas also cause the decrease of the groundwater level leading to swi because drainage of the groundwater inflow into underground structures is required fernandez and moon 2010 attard et al 2016 additionally construction activities such as excavation cutting the mountain and building underground facilities can affect the groundwater flow system ding et al 2008 hyun 2013 despite extensive studies on the swi process there are knowledge gaps particularly with respect to the transient state therefore long term high density monitoring of field scale swi is required werner et al 2013a swi dynamics have been studied with laboratory experiments and numerical simulations goswami and clement 2007 lu and werner 2013 however the distribution of saline water and the nature of the swi in fractured coastal systems remain poorly understood werner et al 2013a sebben et al 2015 numerical investigations of the effect of high permeability fractures are in the preliminary stage sebben et al 2015 modeling of heterogeneity effects reflecting stratified geological formations indicated that the difference in the permeability across layers causes broad mixing zones in low permeability layers but narrower zones in higher permeability layers dagan and zeitoun 1998 lu et al 2013 kim et al 2013 based on several case studies of swi in fractured aquifers lim et al 2013 park et al 2012 it was concluded that fractures provide preferential flow and transport pathways the chemical process of swi with time is usually investigated with laboratory experiments such as column tests and reactive transport modeling apple et al 1990 russak and sivan 2010 russak et al 2016 boluda botella et al 2008 boluda botella et al 2014 the groundwater chemistry in the area affected by swi is controlled by conservative mixing between saline and fresh water and various water rock interactions such as cation exchange and mineral dissolution precipitation russak and sivan 2010 because the constituents of seawater are different than that of fresh water relative changes in constituents such as ca and na and sometimes sr li and mn indicate a characteristic development of water types and chromatographic patterns appelo and postma 2005 russak et al 2016 therefore the ratio or patterns of these constituents are used as a reliable tool to characterize the swi status however unlike in lab experiments or modeling studies many factors affect the major constituents during field observations preliminary source tracking of groundwater salinity is required because there may be various salinity sources richter and kreitler 1993 alcalá and custodio 2008 giambastiani et al 2013 fresh saline water interfaces might fluctuate because of rainfall recharge tides global sea level rise and changes of the artificial pumping rate leading to complex swi stages such as salinization or freshening russak and sivan 2010 therefore contour mapping of cl or total dissolved solid tds is usually adapted to estimate the region affected by swi during field observations barlow 2003 han et al 2014 the purpose of this study was to understand the hydrology and hydrogeochemistry in the coastal area during the construction of the geological repository and determine characteristics that should be carefully monitored during the operational period of the geological repository for lilrw in korea our study area is a good field site to study the swi process in a fractured aquifer at the field scale because of great advantages with respect to obtaining long term periodical groundwater data as a facility related to radioactive waste we propose a conceptual model for this area that explains the hydrogeochemical evolution during the construction period and suggest characteristics to be monitored during the operational period 2 site description 2 1 general information the study area the geological repository for lilrw is located in the coastal area of southeastern korea fig 1 six dome bodies with a height of 50 m and inner diameter of 30 m are located between 80 and 130 m below the mean sea level and several hundred meters away from the coast this study used the data provided by the korea radioactive waste agency korad 2015 2 2 geomorphology and geology before construction the study area was hilly land with 45 7 of the total area at an elevation 100 m 46 9 of the area had a slight land slope 20 kim et al 2008a the geomorphology did not significantly change after construction the geology of the site mainly consists of cretaceous sedimentary rock with granite intrusions fig 1a the center of the intrusion body is granodiorite its boundary with the sedimentary rock was thermally metamorphosed five fractured zones z21 23 and z31 32 with a width of 10 m were identified on a surface around the site and three fractured zones f31 33 which did not reach the surface were found during underground construction based on the report by kim et al 2008b the minerals in fracture fillings are montmorillonite most abundant chlorite illite and zeolite minerals pyrite fes2 is widely observed from trace to vein calcite caco3 occurs only in sedimentary rock 2 3 hydrology and hydrogeology the groundwater table before construction is shown in fig 2 a april 2008 the recharge area was the hilly region in the west and the base flow moved to the east seaside the massive granite area northeast of the silos showed low hydraulic conductivity 10 8 m s compared with the southeastern area with fracture zones 10 6 10 7 m s personal communication the groundwater chemistry was affected by base rock weathering and reactions with secondary minerals the ec of groundwater in 2006 7 boreholes sampled four times ranged from 116 to 486 μs cm with an average of 241 μs cm and median of 198 μs cm the chloride concentrations were below 71 8 mg l with an average of 11 8 mg l table s1 2 4 water sampling and analysis groundwater monitoring during the preoperational period was performed quarterly from september 2008 to december 2014 the groundwater level was monitored at 24 wells every hour and groundwater samples were quarterly collected from 8 gm series wells equipped multi packer for the sampling from each depth fig 1b because our study focused on the groundwater chemistry related to the construction of underground facilities and seawater intrusion the southeastern wells along the coast gm 1 2 4 and 6 and a well for background data gm 7 were evaluated in detail the sampling depths are shown in table 1 part of the gm series wells were installed during construction therefore the start time providing valid data differed depending on the wells gm 1 and 2 from the beginning of construction september 2008 gm 4 and 6 from september 2010 and gm 7 from september 2011 seawater was also sampled quarterly at two locations and those analytical data was provided as table s2 in supplementary data in addition to field measurements of alkalinity ec ph eh and temperature the sampled groundwater and seawater were analyzed in the laboratory using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes icp mass spectrometry ms and ion chromatography ic to determine major cations minor elemental constituents and anions respectively these data were analyzed and interpreted using various hydrogeochemical diagrams statistical methods spss 21 and geochemical modeling phreeqc interactive 3 3 5 3 results 3 1 groundwater level changes fig 2a shows that the groundwater level in the study area was above the sea level before construction affected by topography however it decreased up to 136 m at the end of construction thus several inland areas had a groundwater level below the sea level the decrease of the groundwater level during construction was related to excavation activities for transit tunnels and silos when the tunnel construction faced fractured zones f31 and f33 in 2009 a great decrease in groundwater level occurred fig 2b after several construction events the groundwater level had a conical shape and the depth of the point was lowered close to the bottom of the silos 130 m a s l fig 2c d the excavation and grouting were finished in may 2013 fig 2e the groundwater level is stabilizing without drastic changes fig 2f the construction of a geological repository designed with drainage tunnel caused a reversal of the shallow groundwater flow between silos and sea because of differences in hydraulic conductivities the dominant groundwater flow between the sea and silos originated southeast at the end of construction when the tunnel construction faced fractured zones the water levels of the wells in the southeastern area gm 2 4 6 and other monitoring wells responded furthermore these wells showed a wide range in ec especially after the decrease of the water level however other wells maintained a ec with a narrow range fig 3 a 3 2 changes in ec the ec measured at the gm series wells during the preoperational period showed a bimodal distribution with a boundary line of 2000 µs cm fig 3b according to the guidelines from the u s geological survey barlow 2003 a water body can be classified as fresh or brackish at 1000 mg kg of total dissolved solid tds all samples with low ec 2000 µs cm were classified as fresh water because the tds value was under 1000 mg kg otherwise high ec water samples n 108 23 2 of samples were classified as brackish water 1000 mg kg in tds the ec of brackish groundwater showed a linear correlation with the cl concentration fig 4 a r2 0 9617 the highest ec observed in groundwater was 18 9 ms cm nearly 38 of ec in seawater the cl br ratio can be used as tracer to identify the cause of the groundwater salinity because of its non reactive nature alcalá and custodio 2008 when comparing the cl br molar ratio with the 5 year average value of seawater of 642 118 mean standard deviation sd the proportion of brackish groundwater with a cl br ratio within a range of 1 and 2 sd from that of seawater was 74 and 94 fig 4b respectively therefore the source of groundwater salinization in the study area was seawater intrusion fig 3a shows that gm 1 and 7 and the deep depths of gm 2 4 and 6 remained fresh until the end of the preoperational period however the shallow and middle depth of gm 2 4 and 6 showed drastic ec changes because these wells indicated a great decrease in the groundwater level when facing fractured zones during construction we interpret the changes in ec with time by comparing them with the groundwater levels fig 5 a fast response was observed at shallow depth at gm 2 and 4 and in the middle at gm 6 the ec started to rise one year after the groundwater lowered below the sea level even in a well the ec response time differed depending on the depth gm 4 3 showed a retardation of 1 5 year compared with gm 4 1 fig 5d the shallow depth data at gm 4 showed a peak pattern in ec it started to rise in 2010 maximized in 2013 and then decreased in 2014 at the end of the preoperational period the other locations still showed an increasing pattern or maintained the highest ec value 3 3 changes in water type changes in the water type were interpreted using a piper diagram the relationship with ec patterns are shown in fig 6 and concentration data of major constituents are provided as supplementary data table s3 when ec was low there was no dominant water type plotted in central region of rhombus however the water type changed to cl type when ec started to rise the water type changed to cacl type in an early stage of ec increase and then steadily shifted toward nacl type close to seawater well gm 4 1 a showed the fastest response followed by the shallow depth at gm 2 b and middle depth at gm 6 c however the middle depth at gm 4 d maintained the cacl type at the end of preoperational period brackish groundwater showed a lower na cl molar ratio than seawater 0 81 in our study indicating na depletion fig 7 a the na cl ratio of gm 4 1 in 2014 which showed a decrease in ec is marked in the diagram with increasing ec na depleted but became constant with decreasing ec custodio 1987 showed that the decrease in the na cl ratio balances the increase in ca mg cl ratio when swi occurred in the coastal aquifer containing freshwater the value of na k cl with ca mg so4 hco3 is widely used to identify ion exchange these values show 1 1 matching slope of 1 when ion exchange is dominant in the system rajmohan and elango 2004 a diagram for these values in brackish groundwater showed the slope of 0 9650 fig 7b indicating the importance of the ion exchange in this area the equivalent ratio of so4 cl in brackish groundwater was similar to that of seawater 0 10 in our study indicating that seawater was the source of the groundwater salinity although sometimes so4 enrichment was observed in fresh groundwater fig 8 a the saturation indices si of gypsum caso4 2h2o of 4 locations showing drastic changes in ec gm 2 4 gm 4 1 and 4 3 and gm 6 3 were calculated using phreeqc interactive and then plotted in fig 8b they indicate that gypsum precipitation did not occur at these locations when seawater intruded therefore the sulfate ion was conservative during swi well gm 6 showed so4 enrichment in the initial sampling stages which disappeared within one year the source of so4 enrichment cannot be clarified here however gypsum dissolution can be considered because the si of gypsum was below 0 5 indicating the possibility of gypsum dissolution 3 4 site specific characteristics as explained above the hydrogeochemistry in study area was mainly affected by swi and the accompanying cation

gm 4 1 at the same cl concentration indicating a higher cec or different dispersion at gm 6 3 based on the results of geochemical modeling using phreeqc interactive gm 4 1 did not reach saturation of carbonate minerals however gm 2 4 and gm 6 3 were oversaturated fig 9b d to identify factors controlling the hydrochemistry of brackish groundwater other than swi principle component analysis pca was performed using the spss program brackish groundwater was analyzed both with and without seawater the result is shown in table s4 in the supplementary data the first and second factors suggested the effect of seawater however the ion exchange differentiated the factors factor 1 had a high correlation with na and k but factor 2 strongly correlated with ca the pca analysis did not indicate a

to vein kim et al 2008a however based on the phreeqci results data not shown here the reactive minerals containing fe 2 si 2 were amorphous fe oh 3 and siderite feco3 indicating that altered or secondary fe minerals were the direct sources of fe increase therefore only the fe concentration at locations connected with fractures filled with secondary fe minerals were assumed to increase with increasing ec 4 3 characteristics to be monitored during the operational period the hydrogeochemical evolution stage of each location appeared to be different according to fracture network and filling materials fig 6 shows that the shallow depth at gm 2 and gm 4 and middle depth at gm 6 passed cacl type and then changed to nacl type in the end of preoperational period however the middle depth at gm 4 gm 4 3 where ec started to increase with a retardation of 1 5 years showed a stage of cacl type water cation exchange occurred in the advancing front of seawater that intruded the aquifer richter and kreitler 1993 therefore it is concluded that the advancing front of seawater already passed the shallow depth of gm 2 and gm 4 and middle depth of gm 6 landward but was close to the middle depth of gm 4 based on the cec and seawater mixing ratio of preferential flow the time at which the water type changed might differ at each sampling location in the mixing zone the major constituent ratio might change due to mineral alteration precipitation or dissolution of specific minerals and or sulfate reduction richter and kreitler 1993 appelo and postma 2005 therefore continuous monitoring of the water type and periodical evaluation of its effects on the groundwater chemistry are required in the study area ec significantly increased after the groundwater level decreased due to construction activities only shallow water at gm 4 showed a peak pattern in ec during the preoperational period however ec increased and sustained high at other points fig 6 here we hypothesized that the drainage of groundwater inflow caused swi as discussed in section 4 1 because the amount of groundwater drained from underground facilities causing the advective force showed a peak pattern and then stabilized fig s1 the seawater fraction was expected to have an initial peak in an early stage of swi especially in locations with good fracture networks both sea and underground facilities if the advective force is small other factors can significantly affect seawater intrusion and these locations will show other ec patterns therefore the ec pattern in wells needs to be monitored during the operational period and the seawater fraction needs to be confirmed using other tracers such as stable isotope ratios 5 conclusions the hydrogeochemistry in a coastal area was investigated during a 6 year construction period a conceptual model explaining changes was created the study area is the site of a geological repository for lilrw located in the southeastern coastal area in korea during construction the groundwater inflow into underground facilities drained and the groundwater level dropped significantly as a result the upper groundwater flow in the southeastern area reversed and seawater intrusion occurred where seawater intruded fresh groundwater was changed to brackish groundwater and cation exchange occurred in the aquifer based on fracture networks and fracture filling materials such as montmorillonite the ec response time and seawater fraction varied depending on each location and depth based on this work the characteristics that should be carefully monitored during the operational period of over 60 years were determined 1 periodical evaluation of the groundwater chemistry especially for where the advancing front is and what the chemistry is in the mixing zone and 2 monitoring how ec patterns and seawater fraction are changing because seawater can alter cement and steel and affect the stability of concrete structures hyun 2013 luo et al 2015 the seawater fraction in groundwater contacting concrete structures needs to be monitored carefully although the structures were reinforced the fracture networks between gm series wells and silos are unknown therefore another monitoring well needs to be installed in this area to tracking the advancing front of seawater intrusion acknowledgements the authors appreciate korad for providing

7208,evaluating the reliability of satellite and reanalysis precipitation products is critical but challenging over ungauged or poorly gauged regions the triple collocation tc method is a reliable approach to estimate the accuracy of any three independent inputs in the absence of truth values this study assesses the uncertainty of three types of independent precipitation products i e satellite based ground based and model reanalysis over mainland china using the tc method the ground based data set is gauge based daily precipitation analysis cgdpa the reanalysis data set is european reanalysis agency reanalysis product era interim the satellite based products include five mainstream satellite products the comparison and evaluation are conducted at 0 25 and daily resolutions from 2013 to 2015 first the effectiveness of the tc method is evaluated in south china with dense gauge network the results demonstrate that the tc method is reliable because the correlation coefficient cc and root mean square error rmse derived from tc are close to those derived from ground observations with only 9 and 7 mean relative differences respectively then the tc method is applied in mainland china with special attention paid to the tibetan plateau tp known as the earth s third pole with few ground stations results indicate that 1 the overall performance of imerg is better than the other satellite products over mainland china followed by 3b42v7 cmorph crt and persiann cdr 2 in the tp cgdpa shows the best overall performance over gauged grid cells however over ungauged regions imerg and era interim slightly outperform cgdpa with similar rmse but higher mean cc 0 63 0 61 and 0 58 respectively it highlights the strengths and potentiality of remote sensing and reanalysis data over the tp and reconfirms the cons of the inherent uncertainty of cgdpa due to interpolation from sparsely gauged data the study concludes that the tc method provides not only reliable cross validation results over mainland china but also a new perspective for comparatively assessing multi source precipitation products particularly over poorly gauged regions such as the tp keywords triple collocation precipitation evaluation china tibetan plateau 1 introduction precipitation is a key component of the hydrological cycle and a primary input for hydro meteorological and climate models behrangi et al 2011 therefore accurate precipitation estimates are essential for studying the mechanism of the water cycle there stands a wide suite of instruments monitoring precipitation including rain gauge weather radar and satellite based sensors in addition reanalysis products based on meteorological or weather forecast models are also provided in recent years affected by different factors depending on the measurement instrument precipitation estimates are inevitably subject to various error sources for instance the rain gauge can provide only point scale data at special sites and requires interpolation to obtain gridded data sets which may cause significant sampling error over mountainous or high altitude areas where gauges are scarce in regard to weather radars the signal beam interception and reduction in the radar beam power over complex terrain are the leading factors causing errors germann et al 2006 in addition although satellite based products including infrared ir and microwave mw signals are able to retrieve precipitation information over the large scale they contain random errors and systematic bias because of inadequate sampling and algorithm imperfections xie and arkin 1997 as for reanalysis products like the latest version of european reanalysis agency reanalysis product era interim and the national center for environmental prediction ncep reanalysis they are the fusion of observed data and forecast model outputs therefore the quality of the reanalysis products will inevitably be affected by the forcing data sets the prediction model and the assimilation method previous studies demonstrate that changes in the observing system and uncertainties of the merged data are the main sources of reanalysis product error hodges et al 2003 inoue and matsumoto 2004 marshall et al 2002 overall the assessment of uncertainties of multi source precipitation products is essential before application all along during the last two decades a great number of studies have investigated uncertainties in different precipitation products at various spatiotemporal scales mccollum et al 2002 hong et al 2006 goudenhoofdt et al 2009 tian and lidard 2010 yong et al 2010 shen et al 2014 tang et al 2016a b however most studies use in situ gauge observations as the reference which is usually regarded as approximation of the true value this may lead to error at the global scale especially over data missing areas like the tibetan plateau tp where reliable ground based data sets are absent triple collocation tc is a method that objectively obtains error estimation of three independent products without knowing the true value this method was originally introduced by stoffelen 1998 to evaluate wind speed products mccoll et al 2014 introduced the extend triple collocation etc method based on the original mathematical assumptions making tc capable of solving root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient cc between any of the three products and the unknown truth at the same time lately the tc method has been widely applied in characterizing uncertainties of various geographical variables estimates including soil moisture products dorigo et al 2010 miralles et al 2010 hain et al 2011 draper et al 2013 ocean wind speed stoffelen 1998 portabella et al 2009 leaf area index lai fang et al 2013 total water storage van dijk et al 2014 sea ice thickness scott et al 2014 sea surface salinity ratheesh et al 2013 ocean wind and wave data caires 2003 roebeling et al 2012 for the first time applied the tc method in the evaluation of precipitation estimates between three weather radars across europe lately alemohammad et al 2015 characterized the error of four precipitation products over the united states including the national weather service ground based wsr 88d radar network nexrad iv the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa 3b42 the global online enrollment system goes precipitation index gpi and the global precipitation climatology project gpcp using the multiplicative triple collocation mtc method the mtc method is an improvement on the original version by replacing the additive error model with the multiplicative error model to represent the relationship between observations and reference data which is more appropriate for precipitation assessment hossain and anagnostou 2006 however most tc based studies in the precipitation products evaluation are generally in sparse temporal biweekly or monthly and spatial resolution which can provide only limited information on their reliability and accuracy thus assessment with high resolution is required for better usage of various products moreover the tc method has not been applied in mainland china yet which contains the most part of tp as the third pole of the earth the tp is a typical data missing area and previous studies based on the traditional evaluation method can only employ limited ground gauges in the eastern part gao and liu 2013 wang and zeng 2012 tong et al 2014 shen et al 2014 tang et al 2016a b ma et al 2016 the objectives of this study are twofold 1 investigating the reliability and application prospect of the tc method in south china where rain gauges are dense enough to act as the benchmark 2 evaluating the uncertainties of five satellite based products over mainland china using the tc method with special attention paid to the tp the designed triplet includes the gauge based daily precipitation analysis cgdpa shen and xiong 2016 provided by

organized as follows section 2 introduces the study domain and data sets section 3 explains the basic mathematical principle of tc and discusses some considerations about this method section 4 shows the results of a method validation process over south china section 5 represents the outputs of the tc method finally section 6 concludes 2 study domain and data sets 2 1 study domain the study domain is mainland china located between 18 54 n latitude and 75 136 e longitude the digital elevation data is shown in fig 1 as it can be seen the terrain of mainland china is high in the west and low to the east forming a three ladder pattern the climate in mainland china is complex due to the drastically changing terrain and is mainly modulated by the monsoon system according to the 2016 china climate bulletin provided by cma china can be divided into three main climate regions the east monsoon region northwest arid or semi arid region and tp alpine plateau region the temporal and spatial variability of precipitation is large all over china showing a declining trend from the southeast to the northwest tang et al 2016a b the majority of tp is located in china as the highest plateau in the world tp strongly influences the regional climate and weather system as well as water and energy budgets playing an important role in the asian monsoon establishment and maintenance duzheng and youxi 1979 hsu and liu 2003 ye and gao 1979 yanai et al 1992 in fig 1 a the region marked out in dark red line is named south china for simplicity tang et al 2017 which is chosen as the method validation area this region contains 13 provinces and is mainly composed of plains according to the 2016 china climate bulletin except for the western part of sichuan province which is controlled by the tp alpine plateau climate the other areas of south china are modulated by the monsoon system with about 1500 mm annual mean precipitation moreover about 1300 in situ gauges are well distributed over south china which can provide reliable ground based observations therefore with uniform climate and adequate data this region is suitable for method validation process 2 2 data sets the tc method is based on three collocated input data sets which are assumed to be totally independent of each other in this study the designed triplet is a ground based product a reanalysis product and a satellite based product 2 2 1 gauge precipitation observation a daily gridded ground based precipitation data set cgdpa provided by cma is selected this data set is constructed at a resolution of 0 25 by optimizing the daily climatological precipitation field and amassing around 2400 gauge reports over mainland china using the optimal interpolation oi method shen and xiong 2016 the input data of cgdpa is the manually recorded daily accumulated rainfall observations by bucket rain gauges all the report data are subject to strict quality control including an extreme check and an internal consistency check the minimum detectable hourly rainfall is 0 1 mm h by involving a larger number of gauges cgdpa outshines the climate prediction center unified gauge data set cpc uni in china shen and xiong 2016 however the gauge distribution is very sparse over northwestern china and the tp thus the quality of cgdpa over these areas still remains to be improved since it is difficult to validate the quality of ground based data sets in absence of more accurate observations the tc method may provide us with another prospective to obtain a first insight to the quantitative performance cgdpa in ungauged regions 2 2 2 reanalysis precipitation product the era interim reanalysis data is selected as the second input of the tc method era interim is a global atmospheric reanalysis product generated by ecmwf using the weather forecast model the estimate of precipitation is based on temperature and humidity information dee et al 2011 by completely revising the method for correcting bias in radiance data and the humidity analysis the latest era interim is an improvement on the previous era 40 for high latitude regions era 40 provides better depictions than gpcp serreze et al 2005 as the improved version of era 40 it s reasonable to regard era interim with the same advantage over the high latitude areas the era interim daily reanalysis data set is downloaded from the ecmwf website

meteorological satellite gms the european meteorological satellite meteosat series goes 8 and goes 10 satellites gpcc monthly rain gauge analysis and the climate assessment and monitoring system cams monthly rain gauge observations are also employed for the validation of the results the 3b42v7 and 3b42rt products of tmpa at 0 25 and daily resolutions are used in this study in addition it should be noted that the spatial extent for 3b42rt and 3b42v7 products is limited to 50 n the data sets can be downloaded from nasa s pps server website ftp arthurhou pps eosdis nasa gov trmmdata 2 imerg as the successor of trmm the gpm core observatory was launched by nasa and national space development agency nasda on february 27 2014 the imerg is intended to inter calibrate merge and interpolate all satellite microwave precipitation estimates together with microwave calibrated ir satellite estimates precipitation gauge observations over the entire global huffman et al 2014 the pmw information is obtained from gpm trmm deactivated at april 9 2015 dmsp aqua and noaa satellite series geo ir information is from the same signals of trmm sensors and gpcc rain gauge observation is also used as the monitoring data the final run data of imerg at 0 1 and half hourly resolutions is used and resampled to 0 25 the imerg data can be downloaded from the precipitation measurement missions pmm website https pmm nasa gov data access downloads gpm 3 persiann cdr persiann cdr is the bias corrected data set of the original persiann product to address the need for a consistent long time high resolution and global precipitation data set it s developed by the university of california irvine ashouri et al 2015 the persiann cdr algorithm employs the infrared brightness temperature data from geostationary satellites to estimate rainfall the core of this algorithm is an adaptive artificial neural network ann model which updates its parameters based on a pre training process using ncep stage iv hourly precipitation data sorooshian et al 2000 by utilizing the 2 5 monthly gpcp precipitation data to maintain a monthly total consistency of the two data sets persiann cdr can provide a bias corrected near global precipitation data set at 0 25 and daily resolutions the global ir data is available through the international satellite cloud climatology project isccp provided by noaa

of the tc method and introduce the evaluation indicators used in this study finally some considerations while applying this method will be discussed 3 1 mathematical description given an affine error model relating measurements to a geophysical variable a standard form used in the triple collocation literature zwieback et al 2012 1 r i α i β i t ε i where the r i i 1 2 3 represents any of the three collocated estimates of true value t with observation error ε i i 1 2 3 respectively α i and β i are the ordinary least squares ols intercept and slope respectively it has been widely accepted that the multiplicative model is more appropriate to represent the relationship between observation error and the true value for precipitation estimates hossain and anagnostou 2006 chen et al 2013 compared the results based on two different models over conus at the daily scale indicating that the multiplicative model has advantages in terms of predictability and adaptability by replacing the additive error model with the multiplicative error model alemohammad et al 2015 introduced the mtc method and draw the conclusion that additive model tends to overestimate the accuracy of rainfall products and underestimate the errors therefore the mtc method is used in this study with the basic function shown below 2 r i a i t β i e i defining a i ln a i r i ln r i t ln t ε i ln e i the function can be simplified as 3 r i α i β i t ε i the mathematical assumptions of tc method are mainly threefold and the naming of each assumption is given in previous studies zwieback et al 2012 1 the triple input products are totally independent of each other ρ r i r j 0 i j referred as the zero cross correlation assumption 2 the errors for different products are independent of each other and unrelated to other products as long as the truth value ρ ε i ε j 0 ρ r i ε j 0 ρ ε j t i j referred as the zero error cross correlation assumption 3 the expected values of the errors are zeros e ε i 0 referred as the zero error expectation assumption the covariance between two different input data defined as c ij i j is given by 4 c ij β i β j σ t 2 β j e ε i t β i e ε j t α i e ε j α j e ε i e ε i ε j based on the zero error expectation and zero cross correlation assumptions all the expectation terms in eq 4 vanish therefore the covariance value is given as 5 c ij cov r i r j β i β j σ t 2 i j β i 2 σ t 2 σ ε i 2 i j defining θ i β i σ t the covariance value of each two data is given by 6 c 11 θ 1 2 σ ε 1 2 c 22 θ 2 2 σ ε 2 2 c 33 θ 3 2 σ ε 3 2 c 12 θ 1 2 θ 2 2 c 13 θ 1 2 θ 3 2 c 23 θ 2 2 θ 3 2 then we can solve rmse between any of the three satellite products and the true value 7 σ r 1 2 c 11 c 12 c 13 c 23 8 σ r 2 2 c 22 c 12 c 23 c 13 9 σ r 3 2 c 33 c 13 c 23 c 12 mccoll et al 2014 introduced the etc method to calculate cc in addition to rmse the etc shares the same mathematical assumption of the original tc as a derivative version in term of the correlation coefficient cc between any of the three products and the true represented as ρ t i 2 i 1 2 3 we can write 10 ρ r i t cov r i t σ r i 2 σ t 2 β i σ t β i 2 σ t 2 σ ε i 2 θ i c ii thus the equations to solve cc of each collocated data set are shown below 11 ρ t 1 2 c 12 c 13 c 11 c 23 12 ρ t 2 2 c 12 c 23 c 22 c 13 13 ρ t 3 2 c 13 c 23 c 33 c 12 it should be noted that the result of rmse is absolute a gruber et al 2016 and can only reflect limited information about the estimates because all kinds of accepted and unaccepted noise have been taken into account compared to rmse cc are relative and unbiased to noise representing the similarity of two signals more directly mccoll et al 2014 proposed that cc can provide more important information about the accuracy of three collocated estimates with respect to the absolute variance therefore we focus on cc and rmse is taken as a verification to the reliability of the results 3 2 evaluation indicators five metrics are chosen to evaluate the performance of satellite products comprehensively which can be divided into three categories yong et al 2010 cc describes the agreement with two data sets and it s classified into the first category the second category includes rmse representing the bias and error of satellite estimates with ground based observations the final category includes the probability of detection pod the false alarm ratio far and the critical success index csi pod describes the fraction of real rainfall events captured by satellite among all actual rainfall events while far is the opposite ebert 2007 csi is a more balanced score which combines the information about false alarm and missed events which can be regarded as the fraction of pod and far gerapetritis and pelissier 2004 all equations and perfect values of the metrics are listed in table 1 3 3 considerations about the application of triple collocation to precipitation estimates 3 3 1 design of input triplet as the prerequisites of tc method the results are based on the independence assumption error orthogonality and zero cross correlation assumptions the collocated input of the triplets should be independent of each other both for the estimate data and relative error what s more we assume that the errors of each collocated data have zero mean therefore the error of tc method is mainly caused by the breach of the precondition stoffelen 1998 yilmaz and crow 2014 conducted an evaluation of assumptions in soil moisture using the tc method which witnessed an underestimation of the true random error of soil moisture products because of the reason mentioned above moreover results demonstrate that more independent between any two collocated estimates are the smaller the error of tc based results will be since the required tc method assumptions of zero error across covariance do not generally hold for typical precipitation estimates efforts must be made to minimize the impact of this problem the collocation of triplets should consider the relevance of input data to minimize the influence to the output in this study the triplets used in tc are chosen as cgdpa era interim plus one of the five satellite products for remote sensing precipitation estimates both the satellite based and reanalysis products take the ground based observation as reference in general persiann cdr tmpa 3b42 imerg and era interim products choose monthly gpcc global data set as the benchmark for validation huffman et al 2007 dee et al 2011 huffman and bolvin 2015 ashouri et al 2015 which includes some gauges that are mostly located in the southeastern part of mainland china similar to that cmorph crt utilizes cpc gauge data over conus as reference joyce et al 2004 therefore satellite based and reanalysis products are not completely independent of each other to some extent to reduce this influence we choose cgdpa data set as the ground precipitation observation other than gpcc or cpc since it amassed much more sites than gpcc with better accuracy and higher resolution by choosing this combination we are meant to reduce the impact of the zero across covariance error to some degree 3 3 2 treatment of zero rainfall since the multiplicative error model is used in this study a log transform data preprocessing is required therefore the problem has been arisen about how to deal with the zero rainfall data since it will influence the accuracy of assessment results in the previous study over conus alemohammad et al 2015 utilized the biweekly accumulated rainfall product and removed the remaining zeros roebeling et al 2012 merged satellite and radar products and assigning zeros to10 3 massari et al 2017 simply removed the zeros nevertheless he also indicates that removing zeroes for obtaining log transformed rainfall shortens the sample size thus providing less robust tc results all present tc based studies about precipitation assessment are at sparse resolution both temporally and spatially and the influence of this problem is reduced to some degree in view of the atlas of climate of people s republic of china 1979 provided by cma the weather over west china 72 100 e is mainly modulated by temperate continental climate in xinjiang province and alpine plateau climate in the tp where the climate is perennial drought based on the cgdpa data set from 1998 to 2014 the ratio of zeros to all records is quite high across west china with the mean value up to 30 and up to 70 during winter at the daily scale therefore in this study simply removing zeros will cause unacceptable data loss in such regions influencing the accuracy of tc results for the above reasons a replacement approach for zero data should be taken into consideration to investigate the feasibility and influence of the replacement scheme tc results on different replacement values among 10 9 10 6 and 10 3 are compared based on the triples cgdpa era interim and cmorph crt as seen in the rb distribution maps of fig 2 though slight change in replacement value will result in big change in the log transformed value due to steep gradient of log function three results three replacement values generate nearly identical results with average relative bias rb value between any two outputs about 2 3 over most part of mainland china this may benefit from the low ratio of zero rainfall presence however this ratio increases rapidly over some grid cells with larger difference rb value over 30 which are mainly located around the boundary of the tp previous studies demonstrate that complex topography causes the underestimation of satellite precipitation products dinku et al 2007 gao and liu 2013 which may be the main reason why the impact of zero replacement scheme is magnified in addition higher replacement value seems to result in better cc results bringing in overestimation of the product meanwhile since the closer selected alternative is the more consistent with the observed rainfall the replacement value is chosen as 10 9 in this study 4 validation of the triple collocation method south china is chosen to validate the effectiveness of the tc method in addition the performance of additive and multiplicative errors in tc is also compared to avoid the influence of interpolation only grid cells with at least one gauge are involved during the process first the quality of five satellite products over south china is investigated based on the traditional method via comparing satellite estimates and cgdpa directly then the reliability of the tc method is examined by comparing the cc and rmse derived from tc and traditional methods fig 3 shows the distribution of pod far and csi for imerg and cmorph crt over south china taking cgdpa as reference as the magnitude and spatial distribution of tmpa 3b42 and persiann cdr are similar to those of imerg only results of imerg and cmorph crt are shown to avoid the influence of interpolation during the calculation of the three indicators pod far and csi the threshold for daily gauge rain is set as 0 5 mm d since the precision of rain gauge measurements in china is 0 1 mm h as suggested by previous studies takido et al 2016 ward et al 2011 dinku et al 2011 zhou et al 2008 yang et al 2006 it should be noted that this threshold is only used here imerg performed better than cmorph crt as a whole with higher pod and lower far in the northwestern part of sichuan province both pod and far are low for cmorph crt indicating that the uncertainty of this product is high in this region in view of csi cmorph crt outshines imerg in the southwest part which is caused by low pod and high far of cmorph crt the average values of the three indicators are shown in fig 4 results illustrate that all satellite data sets show high pod 0 6 and low far 0 4 imerg shows better performance than the others overall the quality of satellite data sets over south china is good the validation results are shown in table 2 after filtering out grid cells without gauges there remain about 1100 grid cells over south china both the additive and multiplicative error models are applied in the validation process to assess the robustness of the tc method to measure how well the results cc and rmse of tc approximate that of the traditional method the goodness of fit also shown in cc between results of two methods for both error models are also given tc and traditional methods exhibit similar mean cc and rmse values with each other nevertheless by applying the multiplicative model the goodness of fit of results between tc and traditional methods is significantly improved compared with the additive model for example the value associated with cc for persiann cdr is improved from 0 84 to 0 96 the value associated with rmse for imerg is improved from 0 82 to 0 90 results based on the multiplicative model are more consistent with the traditional method than the additive model for all products therefore the multiplicative model is more suitable in this study however it should be noted that the tc method using the multiplicative model tends to generate better cc and rmse compared with the traditional method leading to the risk of overestimating the performance of satellite products as a whole the tc method has good reliability and can be applied in the assessment of various satellite products over mainland china 5 multi source products evaluation using triple collocation considering the availability of different satellite products two study time periods are designed the longer period is from march 2013 to march 2015 during which 3b42rt 3b42v7 cmorph crt and persiann cdr are available the shorter period is from march 2014 to march 2015 because imerg is released from march 2014 5 1 evaluation over mainland china tc based cc and rmse of five satellite products along with cgdpa and era interim are shown in fig 4 based on functions 7 9 and functions 11 13 larger cc is accompanied by smaller rmse which is in consistence with the results shown in the first two columns over mainland china all five satellite products share relative similar distribution of cc and perform reasonably well in the east over the west overall imerg shows the best performance of the five satellite products with highest mean cc value of 0 72 followed by 0 62 for cmorph crt 0 60 for 3b42v7 0 58 for 3b42rt and 0 44 for persiann cdr 3b42rt and 3b42v7 exhibit similar cc and rmse in most parts of china with a slight difference over the west this is reasonable since these two products share the same remote sensing inputs and only have differences in the producing process huffman et al 2007 in addition by comparison with neighboring grid cells we can find some anomalously lower cc values over about 350 grid cells along with higher rmse and average daily precipitation amount for 3b42rt 3b42v7 and cmorph crt further investigation indicates that 94 of irregular grid cells are inland water bodies tian et al 2007 found trmm 3b42v6 and cmorph tend to overestimate rainfall amount over inland water bodies with about twice as many raining days than land over the southeastern united states seus tang et al 2016a b reported the systematical overestimation over inland water bodies of 3b42rt and 3b42v7 in high mountain asia hma while imerg products eliminate the problem in this study raining days of these grid cells over water bodies are found about 1 5 times more than those over land causing a high false alarm rate over water bodies this is the main reason to the anomalous cc values over certain grid cells for 3b42rt 3b42v7 and cmorph crt persiann cdr shows a relatively poorer performance than the other satellite products the mean cc value is 0 56 over mainland china moreover in the western and northwestern regions the agreement between average daily rainfall of cgdpa and persiann cdr is weaker previous studies found that persiann cdr generally tended to underestimate the rainfall amount over arid or semi arid regions such as the tp and taklamakan desert that is mainly due to the inherent uncertainty of the employed ir data ashouri et al 2015 miao et al 2015 while other satellite products concerned in this study are generally motivated by pmw data with higher accuracy than the ir data huffman and bolvin 2015 which may be the main factor for the relatively poorer performance of persiann cdr besides the advantage of persiann cdr lies in climate studies with a long time period usually up to five years compared to that with a short time period zhu et al 2016a b miao et al 2015 in addition an interesting feature that can be found in the results is a significant reduction of cc in the red box marked area in fig 5 the marked region is located at the plateau area of sichuan province on the map which is the south part of the hengduan mountains where the second ladder of china terrain is laid therefore the area is characterized by drastic topography change which contributes to the significant reduce of cc for all products including ground observations cgdpa and the reanalysis product era interim in addition cc of all products is significantly lower alongside the upper boundary of tp than the other area where the kunlun mountains are laid it can be concluded that all products fail to provide high quality precipitation estimates or observations in the very complex mountains such phenomenon can hardly be identified using traditional evaluation methods because there are generally few gauges in regions with drastic elevation change and the ground based product self also suffers from the problem era interim suffers less to terrain change compared with satellite products the reanalysis data involved both temperature and humidity information reducing the impact of topography to some degrees dee et al 2011 moreover era interim presents much better performance over high latitude region like the takalamaham desert compared with satellite products and cgdpa this further proves the high accuracy of era interim reanalysis product over high latitude regions bosilovich et al 2008 su et al 2006 conclude that reanalysis products are valuable for studying the high latitude water cycle due to the employment of historical data 5 2 stability of the triple collocation method the tc method requires the inputs of three collocated data sets however different combinations may influence the outputs cc and rmse for the same product belonging to different triplets if the uncertainty is large the effectiveness of the tc method could be diminished here using the variable control method we investigate the stability of the tc method through comparing cc of cgdpa based on four different combinations by changing the input satellite product fig 6 triplet a is cgdpa era interim plus imerg triplet b is cgdpa era interim plus cmorph crt triplet c is cgdpa era interim plus persiann cdr triplet d is cgdpa era interim plus tmpa 3b42v7 regardless of the triplets tc results shown in fig 6 indicate that cgdpa is the most accurate product with mean tc based cc close to 0 70 over mainland china which further illustrates that cgdpa can be used as a benchmark to satellite estimates its correlation pattern performs well in eastern parts where rain gauges are denser whereas the tc based correlation is significantly lower in the western part of tp this is reasonable given that cgdpa still contains errors due to the limitation of rain gauge density while tc should theoretically provide the correlation with respect to the truth meanwhile the agreement of tc results for the four triplets is high in the eastern part of mainland china both in spatial distribution and value however the results vary significantly in west china especially over the upper boundary of the tp in west china various factors such as higher altitude and much more complex topography than the relative homogeneous eastern part of mainland china jointly contribute to the degraded quality of all related products the mean cc values over this region are 0 52 for triplet a 0 43 for triplet b 0 32 for triplet c and 0 36 for triplet d respectively the difference in the results may have something to do with the quality of satellite products since cgdpa and era interim are employed in all triplets results also represent that the input satellite product with better quality outputs better tc based correlation for cgdpa based on eqs 11 13 the results of cc for cgdpa should be identical regardless of the input satellite products while this conclusion is made only when the error orthogonality and zero error cross covariance assumptions are met which does not generally hold for typical remote sensing products yilmaz and crow 2014 reported that the breach of zero error cross covariance contributes significantly to tc bias while this influence can be reduced via proper rescaling based on ground observations in this study the grid cell is set as square 0 25 which is in consistent with the spatial resolution of cgdpa to reduce the bias 5 2 1 comparison over the tibetan plateau as earth s third pole the tp and adjacent mountain regions play an essential role in the downstream hydrology and climate as a controlling factor for the asia monsoon system in addition it s also a typical region where rain gauge distribution is extremely sparse previous studies that evaluate the performance of satellite or reanalysis products are subject to various sources of uncertainty due to the lack of sufficient ground observations wang and zeng 2012 tong et al 2014 ma et al 2016 in contrast tc provides an alternative without the need for true observations and thus is born for such ungauged regions in this section the uncertainties of different precipitation products over the tp is further investigated based on the tc method the number of gauges significantly decreases in the tp with only 254 gauges just 9 to the total gauges in the whole china therefore we evaluate the performance of multi source products over the grid cells with and without gauges respectively to further ensure the reliability of the tc method over the tp cc and rmse of five satellite products and era interim based on tc and traditional methods are compared over grid cells with at least one gauge from the same angle in the validation section the validation results are shown in table 3 analogously tc and traditional methods exhibit approximate mean cc and rmse values the cc between the result of tc and traditional methods of all products is lower than that in south china which is mainly due to the decrease in the length of data as only 248 grid cells contain gauge stations while it still illustrates the high agreement between results of the two methods in sum the tc method has good reliability and can be applied over the tp table 4 to specify the distribution of cc and rmse the cumulated distribution function cdf curves for all precipitation products in tp over gauged and ungauged regions are calculated and shown in fig 7 with black and gray dashed line representing cgdpa and era interim meanwhile the cdf of average daily rainfall for all products are also presented in statistics x values cc corresponding to 60 probability can be chosen as the indicators for evaluation tuller and brett 1984 referred as x 60 hereafter in the tp number of gauged grid cells 254 is far smaller than that of ungauged ones 3833 therefore it is reasonable that the cdf curves over ungauged cells fig 7a and b are more continuous and smoother than the gauged ones fig 7c and 7d since the results of rmse is consistent with those of cc we only discuss the cdf curve for cc fig 7a and b over gauged region the highest cc of x 60 is 0 83 for cgdpa followed by era interim 0 65 imerg 0 65 3b42v7 0 63 3b42rt 0 62 and persiann cdr 0 60 with the lowest 0 40 for cmorph crt fig 7b overall cgdpa presents better performance than the other products however its quality drastically degrades over ungauged region the probability of cc under 0 5 increases from 8 to about 40 along with rmse of x 60 varying from 6 2 mm d to 8 9 mm d the performance of cgdpa is also much poorer in the west and mid west part see in fig 4f where the kunlun mountains are laid results reveal the inherent uncertainty of the ground based observation cgdpa over tp which is mainly due to the lack of sufficient gauge data and the influence of topography furthermore the main rain type varies largely from orographic in the south to convective in the central and north of tp the interpolation method applied in cgdpa does not well reflect the spatial variability of precipitation which may be the leading factor to its degraded quality fig 8 imerg surpasses other satellite products with cc of x 60 to be 0 65 followed by 3b42v7 0 63 3b42rt 0 62 persiann cdr 0 60 and cmorph crt 0 40 cmorph crt shows the relative poorest performance with 70 of the grid cells containing cc value under 0 4 the quality of satellite products also degrades over the ungauged regions while the gap between cgdpa is reduced for the reanalysis product era interim shows a good performance next to cgdpa the difference in results under two conditions is not much which is reasonable since the independence between cgdpa and era interim is better than that of the satellite products nevertheless the cc value of era interim even outshines cgdpa over the upper boundary of the tp era interim only employs temperature and humidity information to retrieve precipitation thus the influence of topography is reduced to some degree so that it s able to better characterize the variability of precipitation in tp in regard to the cdf of average daily rainfall the performance of all products shown here is in consistent with that based on the cdf of cc and rmse over gauged region where the quality of cgdpa can be better guaranteed bias between cgdpa and other products is mainly found over grid cells with light rain under 2 mm d this contributes as the main error source for other products while over ungauged region imerg era interim and cgdpa exhibit similar cdf curve with higher difference over slightly heavier rainfall over 2 mm d areas moreover the rainfall measured by cmorph crt is generally lower than that of other products which may be one of the many reasons why cmorph crt performs the relative lowest cc shown in fig 7 a table 3 shows the mean cc value of all precipitation products over gauged and ungauged regions in the tp including ground based cgdpa and reanalysis era interim over gauged regions cgdpa is the best product with the highest cc 0 80 and lowest rmse 5 93 mm d however over the ungauged regions the indicators for cgdpa drops to 0 58 for cc and 8 47 mm d for rmse imerg along with era interim slightly outshine cgdpa with a mean cc value of 0 63 and 0 61 respectively in spite of the potential overestimation due to the usage of multiplicative model results still demonstrates the expected usage of satellite based and reanalysis products and the inherent uncertainty of ground observation over ungauged regions due to the interpolation using sparsely gauge data it reminds us that evaluation of satellite precipitation products only based on interpolated data may suffer from large uncertainties when the gauge density is low 6 summary and conclusions in this study we apply the tc method to evaluate five satellite based precipitation products and assess uncertainties of satellite based ground observed and model reanalysis data sets over mainland china for the first time in summary we can draw the conclusions that 1 the tc method is effective in evaluating precipitation products through comparison with the traditional evaluation method based in south china tc based cc and rmse agree well with the metrics calculated using ground based rain gauges with the mean relative differences of 9 and 7 for cc and rmse respectively in addition results based on the multiplicative error model are better than the additive error model but probably overestimate the performance of products used in tc 2 all the five satellite products perform better in east china than west china mainly due to the topography and climate differences overall imerg performs the best with the highest mean cc 0 72 over mainland china followed by 0 62 for cmorph crt 0 60 for 3b42v7 0 58 for 3b42rt and 0 44 for persiann cdr satellite ground and reanalysis data sets all exhibit degraded quality in regions with drastic topography change according to the tc method which can hardly be revealed by traditional evaluation methods due to sparse gauges 3 grid cells containing inland water bodies have systematic anomalies of precipitation overestimation for tmpa 3b42 3b42rt and cmorph crt the tc method can reveal this phenomenon in the absence of the ground observations which in turn verifies the effectiveness of tc 4 the quality of cgdpa significantly degrades over grid cells without gauges in comparison to those with gauges the probability of cc under 0 5 increases from 8 to about 30 for cgdpa while era interim performs nearly identical results in both conditions overall in the tp imerg and era interim slightly outshine cgdpa over ungauged grid cells with mean cc value of 0 60 and 0 63 indicating the potential of remote sensing and reanalysis products over sparsely gauged regions the tc method provides us with a new perspective for the evaluation of precipitation estimates without the ground truth thus the application of tc based results for merging multi source products is promising and will be addressed in the future also new strategies for reducing the bias of tc based results due to the violation against its mathematical assumptions should be considered acknowledgements this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 7146101701 and china national 973 project grant no 2013cb036406 the authors great gratitude is extended to the china meteorological administration for providing ground based rainfall data the efforts of research communities are also highly appreciated for making all the data available for international users 
7208,evaluating the reliability of satellite and reanalysis precipitation products is critical but challenging over ungauged or poorly gauged regions the triple collocation tc method is a reliable approach to estimate the accuracy of any three independent inputs in the absence of truth values this study assesses the uncertainty of three types of independent precipitation products i e satellite based ground based and model reanalysis over mainland china using the tc method the ground based data set is gauge based daily precipitation analysis cgdpa the reanalysis data set is european reanalysis agency reanalysis product era interim the satellite based products include five mainstream satellite products the comparison and evaluation are conducted at 0 25 and daily resolutions from 2013 to 2015 first the effectiveness of the tc method is evaluated in south china with dense gauge network the results demonstrate that the tc method is reliable because the correlation coefficient cc and root mean square error rmse derived from tc are close to those derived from ground observations with only 9 and 7 mean relative differences respectively then the tc method is applied in mainland china with special attention paid to the tibetan plateau tp known as the earth s third pole with few ground stations results indicate that 1 the overall performance of imerg is better than the other satellite products over mainland china followed by 3b42v7 cmorph crt and persiann cdr 2 in the tp cgdpa shows the best overall performance over gauged grid cells however over ungauged regions imerg and era interim slightly outperform cgdpa with similar rmse but higher mean cc 0 63 0 61 and 0 58 respectively it highlights the strengths and potentiality of remote sensing and reanalysis data over the tp and reconfirms the cons of the inherent uncertainty of cgdpa due to interpolation from sparsely gauged data the study concludes that the tc method provides not only reliable cross validation results over mainland china but also a new perspective for comparatively assessing multi source precipitation products particularly over poorly gauged regions such as the tp keywords triple collocation precipitation evaluation china tibetan plateau 1 introduction precipitation is a key component of the hydrological cycle and a primary input for hydro meteorological and climate models behrangi et al 2011 therefore accurate precipitation estimates are essential for studying the mechanism of the water cycle there stands a wide suite of instruments monitoring precipitation including rain gauge weather radar and satellite based sensors in addition reanalysis products based on meteorological or weather forecast models are also provided in recent years affected by different factors depending on the measurement instrument precipitation estimates are inevitably subject to various error sources for instance the rain gauge can provide only point scale data at special sites and requires interpolation to obtain gridded data sets which may cause significant sampling error over mountainous or high altitude areas where gauges are scarce in regard to weather radars the signal beam interception and reduction in the radar beam power over complex terrain are the leading factors causing errors germann et al 2006 in addition although satellite based products including infrared ir and microwave mw signals are able to retrieve precipitation information over the large scale they contain random errors and systematic bias because of inadequate sampling and algorithm imperfections xie and arkin 1997 as for reanalysis products like the latest version of european reanalysis agency reanalysis product era interim and the national center for environmental prediction ncep reanalysis they are the fusion of observed data and forecast model outputs therefore the quality of the reanalysis products will inevitably be affected by the forcing data sets the prediction model and the assimilation method previous studies demonstrate that changes in the observing system and uncertainties of the merged data are the main sources of reanalysis product error hodges et al 2003 inoue and matsumoto 2004 marshall et al 2002 overall the assessment of uncertainties of multi source precipitation products is essential before application all along during the last two decades a great number of studies have investigated uncertainties in different precipitation products at various spatiotemporal scales mccollum et al 2002 hong et al 2006 goudenhoofdt et al 2009 tian and lidard 2010 yong et al 2010 shen et al 2014 tang et al 2016a b however most studies use in situ gauge observations as the reference which is usually regarded as approximation of the true value this may lead to error at the global scale especially over data missing areas like the tibetan plateau tp where reliable ground based data sets are absent triple collocation tc is a method that objectively obtains error estimation of three independent products without knowing the true value this method was originally introduced by stoffelen 1998 to evaluate wind speed products mccoll et al 2014 introduced the extend triple collocation etc method based on the original mathematical assumptions making tc capable of solving root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient cc between any of the three products and the unknown truth at the same time lately the tc method has been widely applied in characterizing uncertainties of various geographical variables estimates including soil moisture products dorigo et al 2010 miralles et al 2010 hain et al 2011 draper et al 2013 ocean wind speed stoffelen 1998 portabella et al 2009 leaf area index lai fang et al 2013 total water storage van dijk et al 2014 sea ice thickness scott et al 2014 sea surface salinity ratheesh et al 2013 ocean wind and wave data caires 2003 roebeling et al 2012 for the first time applied the tc method in the evaluation of precipitation estimates between three weather radars across europe lately alemohammad et al 2015 characterized the error of four precipitation products over the united states including the national weather service ground based wsr 88d radar network nexrad iv the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa 3b42 the global online enrollment system goes precipitation index gpi and the global precipitation climatology project gpcp using the multiplicative triple collocation mtc method the mtc method is an improvement on the original version by replacing the additive error model with the multiplicative error model to represent the relationship between observations and reference data which is more appropriate for precipitation assessment hossain and anagnostou 2006 however most tc based studies in the precipitation products evaluation are generally in sparse temporal biweekly or monthly and spatial resolution which can provide only limited information on their reliability and accuracy thus assessment with high resolution is required for better usage of various products moreover the tc method has not been applied in mainland china yet which contains the most part of tp as the third pole of the earth the tp is a typical data missing area and previous studies based on the traditional evaluation method can only employ limited ground gauges in the eastern part gao and liu 2013 wang and zeng 2012 tong et al 2014 shen et al 2014 tang et al 2016a b ma et al 2016 the objectives of this study are twofold 1 investigating the reliability and application prospect of the tc method in south china where rain gauges are dense enough to act as the benchmark 2 evaluating the uncertainties of five satellite based

the results of a method validation process over south china section 5 represents the outputs of the tc method finally section 6 concludes 2 study domain and data sets 2 1 study domain the study domain is mainland china located between 18 54 n latitude and 75 136 e longitude the digital elevation data is shown in fig 1 as it can be seen the terrain of mainland china is high in the west and low to the east forming a three ladder pattern the climate in mainland china is complex due to the drastically changing terrain and is mainly modulated by the monsoon system according to the 2016 china climate bulletin provided by cma china can be divided into three main climate regions the east monsoon region northwest arid or semi arid region and tp alpine plateau region the temporal and spatial variability of precipitation is large all over china showing a declining trend from the southeast to the northwest tang et al 2016a b the majority of tp is located in china as the highest plateau in the world tp strongly influences the regional climate and weather system as well as water and energy budgets playing an important role in the asian monsoon establishment and maintenance duzheng and youxi 1979 hsu and liu 2003 ye and gao 1979 yanai et al 1992 in fig 1 a the region marked out in dark red line is named south china for simplicity tang et al 2017 which is chosen as the method validation area this region contains 13 provinces and is mainly composed of plains according to the 2016 china climate bulletin except for the western part of sichuan province which is controlled by the tp alpine plateau climate the other areas of south china are modulated by the monsoon system with about 1500 mm annual mean precipitation moreover about 1300 in situ gauges are well distributed over south china which can provide reliable ground based observations therefore with uniform climate and adequate data this region is suitable for method validation process 2 2 data sets the tc method is based on three collocated input data sets which are assumed to be totally independent of each other in this study the designed triplet is a ground based product a reanalysis product and a satellite based product 2 2 1 gauge precipitation observation a daily gridded ground based precipitation data set cgdpa provided by cma is selected this data set is constructed at a resolution of 0 25 by optimizing the daily climatological precipitation field and amassing around 2400 gauge reports over mainland china using the optimal interpolation oi method shen and xiong 2016 the input data of cgdpa is the manually recorded daily accumulated rainfall observations by bucket rain gauges all the report data are subject to strict quality control including an extreme check and an internal consistency check the minimum detectable hourly rainfall is 0 1 mm h by involving a larger number of gauges cgdpa outshines the climate prediction center unified gauge data set cpc uni in china shen and xiong 2016 however the gauge distribution is very sparse over northwestern china and the tp thus the quality of cgdpa over these areas still remains to be improved since it is difficult to validate the quality of ground based data sets in absence of more accurate observations the tc method may provide us with another prospective to obtain a first insight to the quantitative performance cgdpa in ungauged regions 2 2 2 reanalysis precipitation product the era interim reanalysis data is selected as the second input of the tc method era interim is a global atmospheric reanalysis product generated by ecmwf using the weather forecast model the estimate of precipitation is based on temperature and humidity information dee et al 2011 by completely revising the method for correcting bias in radiance data and the humidity analysis the latest era interim is an improvement on the previous era 40 for high latitude regions era 40 provides better depictions than gpcp serreze et al 2005 as the improved version of era 40 it s reasonable to regard era interim with the same advantage over the high latitude areas the era interim daily reanalysis data set is downloaded from the ecmwf website

meteorological satellite gms the european meteorological satellite meteosat series goes 8 and goes 10 satellites gpcc monthly rain gauge analysis and the climate assessment and monitoring system cams monthly rain gauge observations are also employed for the validation of the results the 3b42v7 and 3b42rt products of tmpa at 0 25 and daily resolutions are used in this study in addition it should be noted that the spatial extent for 3b42rt and 3b42v7 products is limited to 50 n the data sets can be downloaded from nasa s pps server website ftp arthurhou pps eosdis nasa gov trmmdata 2 imerg as the successor of trmm the gpm core observatory was launched by nasa and national space development agency nasda on february 27 2014 the imerg is intended to inter calibrate merge and interpolate all

obtained from gpm trmm deactivated at april 9 2015 dmsp aqua and noaa satellite series geo ir information is from the same signals of trmm sensors and gpcc rain gauge observation is also used as the monitoring data the final run data of imerg at 0 1 and half hourly resolutions is used and resampled to 0 25 the imerg data can be downloaded from the precipitation measurement missions pmm website

and global precipitation data set it s developed by the university of california irvine ashouri et al 2015 the persiann cdr algorithm employs the infrared brightness temperature data from geostationary satellites to estimate rainfall the core of this algorithm is an adaptive artificial neural network ann model which updates its parameters based on a pre training process using ncep stage iv hourly precipitation data sorooshian et al 2000 by utilizing the 2 5 monthly gpcp precipitation data to maintain a monthly total consistency of the two data sets persiann cdr can provide a

of the tc method and introduce the evaluation indicators used in this study finally some considerations while applying this method will be discussed 3 1 mathematical description given an affine error model relating measurements to a geophysical variable a standard form used in the triple collocation literature zwieback et al 2012 1 r i α i β i t ε i where the r i i 1 2 3 represents any of the three collocated estimates of true value t with observation error ε i i 1 2 3 respectively α i and β i are the ordinary least squares ols intercept and slope respectively it has been widely accepted that the multiplicative model is more appropriate to represent the relationship between observation error and the true value for precipitation estimates hossain and anagnostou 2006 chen et al 2013 compared the results based on two different models over conus at the daily scale indicating that the multiplicative model has advantages in terms of predictability and adaptability by replacing the additive error model with the multiplicative error model alemohammad et al 2015 introduced the mtc method and draw the conclusion that additive model tends to overestimate the accuracy of rainfall products and underestimate the errors therefore the mtc method is used in this study with the basic function shown below 2 r i a i t β i e i defining a i ln a i r i ln r i t ln t ε i ln e i the function can be simplified as 3 r i α i β i t ε i the mathematical assumptions of tc method are mainly threefold and the naming of each assumption is given in previous studies zwieback et al 2012 1 the triple input products are totally independent of each other ρ r i r j 0 i j referred as the zero cross correlation assumption 2 the errors for different products are independent of each other and unrelated to other products as long as the truth value ρ ε i ε j 0 ρ r i ε j 0 ρ ε j t i j referred as the zero error cross correlation assumption 3 the expected values of the errors are zeros e ε i 0 referred as the zero error expectation assumption the covariance between two different input data defined as c ij i j is given by 4 c ij β i β j σ t 2 β j e ε i t β i e ε j t α i e ε j α j e ε i e ε i ε j based on the zero error expectation and zero cross correlation assumptions all the expectation terms in eq 4 vanish therefore the covariance value is given as 5 c ij cov r i r j β i β j σ t 2 i j β i 2 σ t 2 σ ε i 2 i j defining θ i β i σ t the covariance value of each two data is given by 6 c 11 θ 1 2 σ ε 1 2 c 22 θ 2 2 σ ε 2 2 c 33 θ 3 2 σ ε 3 2 c 12 θ 1 2 θ 2 2 c 13 θ 1 2 θ 3 2 c 23 θ 2 2 θ 3 2 then we can solve rmse between any of the three satellite products and the true value 7 σ r 1 2 c 11 c 12 c 13 c 23 8 σ r 2 2 c 22 c 12 c 23 c 13 9 σ r 3 2 c 33 c 13 c 23 c 12 mccoll et al 2014 introduced the etc method to calculate cc in addition to rmse the etc shares the same mathematical assumption of the original tc as a derivative version in term of the correlation coefficient cc between any of the three products and the true represented as ρ t i 2 i 1 2 3 we can write 10 ρ r i t cov r i t σ r i 2 σ t 2 β i σ t β i 2 σ t 2 σ ε i 2 θ i c ii thus the equations to solve cc of each collocated data set are shown below 11 ρ t 1 2 c 12 c 13 c 11 c 23 12 ρ t 2 2 c 12 c 23 c 22 c 13 13 ρ t 3 2 c 13 c 23 c 33 c 12 it should be noted that the result of rmse is absolute a gruber et al 2016 and can only reflect limited information about the estimates because all kinds of accepted and unaccepted noise have been taken into account compared to rmse cc are relative and unbiased to noise representing the similarity of two signals more directly mccoll et al 2014 proposed that cc can provide more important information about the accuracy of three collocated estimates with respect to the absolute variance therefore we focus on cc and rmse is taken as a verification to the reliability of the results 3 2 evaluation indicators five metrics are chosen to evaluate the performance of satellite products comprehensively which can be divided into three categories yong et al 2010 cc describes the agreement with two data sets and it s classified into the first category the second category includes rmse representing the bias and error of satellite estimates with ground based observations the final category includes the probability of detection pod the false alarm ratio far and the critical success index csi pod describes the fraction of real rainfall events captured by satellite among all actual rainfall events while far is the opposite ebert 2007 csi is a more balanced score which combines the information about false alarm and missed events which can be regarded as the fraction of pod and far gerapetritis and pelissier 2004 all equations and perfect values of the metrics are listed in table 1 3 3 considerations about the application of triple collocation to precipitation estimates 3 3 1 design of input triplet as the prerequisites of tc method the results are based on the independence assumption error orthogonality and zero cross correlation assumptions the collocated input of the triplets should be independent of each other both for the estimate data and relative error what s more we assume that the errors of each collocated data have zero mean therefore the error of tc method is mainly caused by the breach of the precondition stoffelen 1998 yilmaz and crow 2014 conducted an evaluation of assumptions in soil moisture using the tc method which witnessed an underestimation of the true random error of soil moisture products because of the reason mentioned above moreover results demonstrate that more independent between any two collocated estimates are the smaller the error of tc based results will be since the required tc method assumptions of zero error across covariance do not generally hold for typical precipitation estimates efforts must be made to minimize the impact of this problem the collocation of triplets should consider the relevance of input data to minimize the influence to the output in this study the triplets used in tc are chosen as cgdpa era interim plus one of the five satellite products for remote sensing precipitation estimates both the satellite based and reanalysis products take the ground based observation as reference in general persiann cdr tmpa 3b42 imerg and era interim products choose monthly gpcc global data set as the benchmark for validation huffman et al 2007 dee et al 2011 huffman and bolvin 2015 ashouri et al 2015 which includes some gauges that are mostly located in the southeastern part of mainland china similar to that cmorph crt utilizes cpc gauge data over conus as reference joyce et al 2004 therefore satellite based and reanalysis products are not completely independent of each other to some extent to reduce this influence we choose cgdpa data set as the ground precipitation observation other than gpcc or cpc since it amassed much more sites than gpcc with better accuracy and higher resolution by choosing this combination we are meant to reduce the impact of the zero across covariance error to some degree 3 3 2 treatment of zero rainfall since the multiplicative error model is used in this study a log transform data preprocessing is required therefore the problem has been arisen about how to deal with the zero rainfall data since it will influence the accuracy of assessment results in the previous study over conus alemohammad et al 2015 utilized the biweekly accumulated rainfall product and removed the remaining zeros roebeling et al 2012 merged satellite and radar products and assigning zeros to10 3 massari et al 2017 simply removed the zeros nevertheless he also indicates that removing zeroes for obtaining log transformed rainfall shortens the sample size thus providing less robust tc results all present tc based studies about precipitation assessment are at sparse resolution both temporally and spatially and the influence of this problem is reduced to some degree in view of the atlas of climate of people s republic of china 1979 provided by cma the weather over west china 72 100 e is mainly modulated by temperate continental climate in xinjiang province and alpine plateau climate in the tp where the climate is perennial drought based on the cgdpa data set from 1998 to 2014 the ratio of zeros to all records is quite high across west china with the mean value up to 30 and up to 70 during winter at the daily scale therefore in this study simply removing zeros will cause unacceptable data loss in such regions influencing the accuracy of tc results for the above reasons a replacement approach for zero data should be taken into consideration to investigate the feasibility and influence of the replacement scheme tc results on different replacement values among 10 9 10 6 and 10 3 are compared based on the triples cgdpa era interim and cmorph crt as seen in the rb distribution maps of fig 2 though slight change in replacement value will result in big change in the log transformed value due to steep gradient of log function three results three replacement values generate nearly identical results with average relative bias rb value between any two outputs about 2 3 over most part of mainland china this may benefit from the low ratio of zero rainfall presence however this ratio increases rapidly over some grid cells with larger difference rb value over 30 which are mainly located around the boundary of the tp previous studies demonstrate that complex topography causes the underestimation of satellite precipitation products dinku et al 2007 gao and liu 2013 which may be the main reason why the impact of zero replacement scheme is magnified in addition higher replacement value seems to result in better cc results bringing in overestimation of the product meanwhile since the closer selected alternative is the more consistent with the observed rainfall the replacement value is chosen as 10 9 in this study 4 validation of the triple collocation method south china is chosen to validate the effectiveness of the tc method in addition the performance of additive and multiplicative errors in tc is also compared to avoid the influence of interpolation only grid cells with at least one gauge are involved during the process first the quality of five satellite products over south china is investigated based on the traditional method via comparing satellite estimates and cgdpa directly then the reliability of the tc method is examined by comparing the cc and rmse derived from tc and traditional methods fig 3 shows the distribution of pod far and csi for imerg and cmorph crt over south china taking cgdpa as reference as the magnitude and spatial distribution of tmpa 3b42 and persiann cdr are similar to those of imerg only results of imerg and cmorph crt are shown to avoid the influence of interpolation during the calculation of the three indicators pod far and csi the threshold for daily gauge rain is set as 0 5 mm d since the precision of rain gauge measurements in china is 0 1 mm h as suggested by previous studies takido et al 2016 ward et al 2011 dinku et al 2011 zhou et al 2008 yang et al 2006 it should be noted that this threshold is only used here imerg performed better than cmorph crt as a whole with higher pod and lower far in the northwestern part of sichuan province both pod and far are low for cmorph crt indicating that the uncertainty of this product is high in this region in view of csi cmorph crt outshines imerg in the southwest part which is caused by low pod and high far of cmorph crt the average values of the three indicators are shown in fig 4 results illustrate that all satellite data sets show high pod 0 6 and low far 0 4 imerg shows better performance than the others overall the quality of satellite data sets over south china is good the validation results are shown in table 2 after filtering out grid cells without gauges there remain about 1100 grid cells over south china both the additive and multiplicative error models are applied in the validation process to assess the robustness of the tc method to measure how well the results cc and rmse of tc approximate that of the traditional method the goodness of fit also shown in cc between results of two methods for both error models are also given tc and traditional methods exhibit similar mean cc and rmse values with each other nevertheless by applying the multiplicative model the goodness of fit of results between tc and traditional methods is significantly improved compared with the additive model for example the value associated with cc for persiann cdr is improved from 0 84 to 0 96 the value associated with rmse for imerg is improved from 0 82 to 0 90 results based on the multiplicative model are more consistent with the traditional method than the additive model for all products therefore the multiplicative model is more suitable in this study however it should be noted that the tc method using the multiplicative model tends to generate better cc and rmse compared with the traditional method leading to the risk of overestimating the performance of satellite products as a whole the tc method has good reliability and can be applied in the assessment of various satellite products over mainland china 5 multi source products evaluation using triple collocation considering the availability of different satellite products two study time periods are designed the longer period is from march 2013 to march 2015 during which 3b42rt 3b42v7 cmorph crt and persiann cdr are available the shorter period is from march 2014 to march 2015 because imerg is released from march 2014 5 1 evaluation over mainland china tc based cc and rmse of five satellite products along with cgdpa and era interim are shown in fig 4 based on functions 7 9 and functions 11 13 larger cc is accompanied by smaller rmse which is in consistence with the results shown in the first two columns over mainland china all five satellite products share relative similar distribution of cc and perform reasonably well in the east over the west overall imerg shows the best performance of the five satellite products with highest mean cc value of 0 72 followed by 0 62 for cmorph crt 0 60 for 3b42v7 0 58 for 3b42rt and 0 44 for persiann cdr 3b42rt and 3b42v7 exhibit similar cc and rmse in most parts of china with a slight difference over the west this is reasonable since these two products share the same remote sensing inputs and only have differences in the producing process huffman et al 2007 in addition by comparison with neighboring grid cells we can find some anomalously lower cc values over about 350 grid cells along with higher rmse and average daily precipitation amount for 3b42rt 3b42v7 and cmorph crt further investigation indicates that 94 of irregular grid cells are inland water bodies tian et al 2007 found trmm 3b42v6 and cmorph tend to overestimate rainfall amount over inland water bodies with about twice as many raining days than land over the southeastern united states seus tang et al 2016a b reported the systematical overestimation over inland water bodies of 3b42rt and 3b42v7 in high mountain asia hma while imerg products eliminate the problem in this study raining days of these grid cells over water bodies are found about 1 5 times more than those over land causing a high false alarm rate over water bodies this is the main reason to the anomalous cc values over certain grid cells for 3b42rt 3b42v7 and cmorph crt persiann cdr shows a relatively poorer performance than the other satellite products the mean cc value is 0 56 over mainland china moreover in the western and northwestern regions the agreement between average daily rainfall of cgdpa and persiann cdr is weaker previous studies found that persiann cdr generally tended to underestimate the rainfall amount over arid or semi arid regions such as the tp and taklamakan desert that is mainly due to the inherent uncertainty of the employed ir data ashouri et al 2015 miao et al 2015 while other satellite products concerned in this study are generally motivated by pmw data with higher accuracy than the ir data huffman and bolvin 2015 which may be the main factor for the relatively poorer performance of persiann cdr besides the advantage of persiann cdr lies in climate studies with a long time period usually up to five years compared to that with a short time period zhu et al 2016a b miao et al 2015 in addition an interesting feature that can be found in the results is a significant reduction of cc in the red box marked area in fig 5 the marked region is located at the plateau area of sichuan province on the map which is the south part of the hengduan mountains where the second ladder of china terrain is laid therefore the area is characterized by drastic topography change which contributes to the significant reduce of cc for all products including ground observations cgdpa and the reanalysis product era interim in addition cc of all products is significantly lower alongside the upper boundary of tp than the other area where the kunlun mountains are laid it can be concluded that all products fail to provide high quality precipitation estimates or observations in the very complex mountains such phenomenon can hardly be identified using traditional evaluation methods because there are generally few gauges in regions with drastic elevation change and the ground based product self also suffers from the problem era interim suffers less to terrain change compared with satellite products the reanalysis data involved both temperature and humidity information reducing the impact of topography to some degrees dee et al 2011 moreover era interim presents much better performance over high latitude region like the takalamaham desert compared with satellite products and cgdpa this further proves the high accuracy of era interim reanalysis product over high latitude regions bosilovich et al 2008 su et al 2006 conclude that reanalysis products are valuable for studying the high latitude water cycle due to the employment of historical data 5 2 stability of the triple collocation method the tc method requires the inputs of three collocated data sets however different combinations may influence the outputs cc and rmse for the same product belonging to different triplets if the uncertainty is large the effectiveness of the tc method could be diminished here using the variable control method we investigate the stability of the tc method through comparing cc of cgdpa based on four different combinations by changing the input satellite product fig 6 triplet a is cgdpa era interim plus imerg triplet b is cgdpa era interim plus cmorph crt triplet c is cgdpa era interim plus persiann cdr triplet d is cgdpa era interim plus tmpa 3b42v7 regardless of the triplets tc results shown in fig 6 indicate that cgdpa is the most accurate product with mean tc based cc close to 0 70 over mainland china which further illustrates that cgdpa can be used as a benchmark to satellite estimates its correlation pattern performs well in eastern parts where rain gauges are denser whereas the tc based correlation is significantly lower in the western part of tp this is reasonable given that cgdpa still contains errors due to the limitation of rain gauge density while tc should theoretically provide the correlation with respect to the truth meanwhile the agreement of tc results for the four triplets is high in the eastern part of mainland china both in spatial distribution and value however the results vary significantly in west china especially over the upper boundary of the tp in west china various factors such as higher altitude and much more complex topography than the relative homogeneous eastern part of mainland china jointly contribute to the degraded quality of all related products the mean cc values over this region are 0 52 for triplet a 0 43 for triplet b 0 32 for triplet c and 0 36 for triplet d respectively the difference in the results may have something to do with the quality of satellite products since cgdpa and era interim are employed in all triplets results also represent that the input satellite product with better quality outputs better tc based correlation for cgdpa based on eqs 11 13 the results of cc for cgdpa should be identical regardless of the input satellite products while this conclusion is made only when the error orthogonality and zero error cross covariance assumptions are met which does not generally hold for typical remote sensing products yilmaz and crow 2014 reported that the breach of zero error cross covariance contributes significantly to tc bias while this influence can be reduced via proper rescaling based on ground observations in this study the grid cell is set as square 0 25 which is in consistent with the spatial resolution of cgdpa to reduce the bias 5 2 1 comparison over the tibetan plateau as earth s third pole the tp and adjacent mountain regions play an essential role in the downstream hydrology and climate as a controlling factor for the asia monsoon system in addition it s also a typical region where rain gauge distribution is extremely sparse previous studies that evaluate the performance of satellite or reanalysis products are subject to various sources of uncertainty due to the lack of sufficient ground observations wang and zeng 2012 tong et al 2014 ma et al 2016 in contrast tc provides an alternative without the need for true observations and thus is born for such ungauged regions in this section the uncertainties of different precipitation products over the tp is further investigated based on the tc method the number of gauges significantly decreases in the tp with only 254 gauges just 9 to the total gauges in the whole china therefore we evaluate the performance of multi source products over the grid cells with and without gauges respectively to further ensure the reliability of the tc method over the tp cc and rmse of five satellite products and era interim based on tc and traditional methods are compared over grid cells with at least one gauge from the same angle in the validation section the validation results are shown in table 3 analogously tc and traditional methods exhibit approximate mean cc and rmse values the cc between the result of tc and traditional methods of all products is lower than that in south china which is mainly due to the decrease in the length of data as only 248 grid cells contain gauge stations while it still illustrates the high agreement between results of the two methods in sum the tc method has good reliability and can be applied over the tp table 4 to specify the distribution of cc and rmse the cumulated distribution function cdf curves for all precipitation products in tp over gauged and ungauged regions are calculated and shown in fig 7 with black and gray dashed line representing cgdpa and era interim meanwhile the cdf of average daily rainfall for all products are also presented in statistics x values cc corresponding to 60 probability can be chosen as the indicators for evaluation tuller and brett 1984 referred as x 60 hereafter in the tp number of gauged grid cells 254 is far smaller than that of ungauged ones 3833 therefore it is reasonable that the cdf curves over ungauged cells fig 7a and b are more continuous and smoother than the gauged ones fig 7c and 7d since the results of rmse is consistent with those of cc we only discuss the cdf curve for cc fig 7a and b over gauged region the highest cc of x 60 is 0 83 for cgdpa followed by era interim 0 65 imerg 0 65 3b42v7 0 63 3b42rt 0 62 and persiann cdr 0 60 with the lowest 0 40 for cmorph crt fig 7b overall cgdpa presents better performance than the other products however its quality drastically degrades over ungauged region the probability of cc under 0 5 increases from 8 to about 40 along with rmse of x 60 varying from 6 2 mm d to 8 9 mm d the performance of cgdpa is also much poorer in the west and mid west part see in fig 4f where the kunlun mountains are laid results reveal the inherent uncertainty of the ground based observation cgdpa over tp which is mainly due to the lack of sufficient gauge data and the influence of topography furthermore the main rain type varies largely from orographic in the south to convective in the central and north of tp the interpolation method applied in cgdpa does not well reflect the spatial variability of precipitation which may be the leading factor to its degraded quality fig 8 imerg surpasses other satellite products with cc of x 60 to be 0 65 followed by 3b42v7 0 63 3b42rt 0 62 persiann cdr 0 60 and cmorph crt 0 40 cmorph crt shows the relative poorest performance with 70 of the grid cells containing cc value under 0 4 the quality of satellite products also degrades over the ungauged regions while the gap between cgdpa is reduced for the reanalysis product era interim shows a good performance next to cgdpa the difference in results under two conditions is not much which is reasonable since the independence between cgdpa and era interim is better than that of the satellite products nevertheless the cc value of era interim even outshines cgdpa over the upper boundary of the tp era interim only employs temperature and humidity information to retrieve precipitation thus the influence of topography is reduced to some degree so that it s able to better characterize the variability of precipitation in tp in regard to the cdf of average daily rainfall the performance of all products shown here is in consistent with that based on the cdf of cc and rmse over gauged region where the quality of cgdpa can be better guaranteed bias between cgdpa and other products is mainly found over grid cells with light rain under 2 mm d this contributes as the main error source for other products while over ungauged region imerg era interim and cgdpa exhibit similar cdf curve with higher difference over slightly heavier rainfall over 2 mm d areas moreover the rainfall measured by cmorph crt is generally lower than that of other products which may be one of the many reasons why cmorph crt performs the relative lowest cc shown in fig 7 a table 3 shows the mean cc value of all precipitation products over gauged and ungauged regions in the tp including ground based cgdpa and reanalysis era interim over gauged regions cgdpa is the best product with the highest cc 0 80 and lowest rmse 5 93 mm d however over the ungauged regions the indicators for cgdpa drops to 0 58 for cc and 8 47 mm d for rmse imerg along with era interim slightly outshine cgdpa with a mean cc value of 0 63 and 0 61 respectively in spite of the potential overestimation due to the usage of multiplicative model results still demonstrates the expected usage of satellite based and reanalysis products and the inherent uncertainty of ground observation over ungauged regions due to the interpolation using sparsely gauge data it reminds us that evaluation of satellite precipitation products only based on interpolated data may suffer from large uncertainties when the gauge density is low 6 summary and conclusions in this study we apply the tc method to evaluate five satellite based precipitation products and assess uncertainties of satellite based ground observed and model reanalysis data sets over mainland china for the first time in summary we can draw the conclusions that 1 the tc method is effective in evaluating precipitation products through comparison with the traditional evaluation method based in south china tc based cc and rmse agree well with the metrics calculated using ground based rain gauges with the mean relative differences of 9 and 7 for cc and rmse respectively in addition results based on the multiplicative error model are better than the additive error model but probably overestimate the performance of products used in tc 2 all the five satellite products perform better in east china than west china mainly due to the topography and climate differences overall imerg performs the best with the highest mean cc 0 72 over mainland china followed by 0 62 for cmorph crt 0 60 for 3b42v7 0 58 for 3b42rt and 0 44 for persiann cdr satellite ground and reanalysis data sets all exhibit degraded quality in regions with drastic topography change according to the tc method which can hardly be revealed by traditional evaluation methods due to sparse gauges 3 grid cells containing inland water bodies have systematic anomalies of precipitation overestimation for tmpa 3b42 3b42rt and cmorph crt the tc method can reveal this phenomenon in the absence of the ground observations which in turn verifies the effectiveness of tc 4 the quality of cgdpa significantly degrades over grid cells without gauges in comparison to those with gauges the probability of cc under 0 5 increases from 8 to about 30 for cgdpa while era interim performs nearly identical results in both conditions overall in the tp imerg and era interim slightly outshine cgdpa over ungauged grid cells with mean cc value of 0 60 and 0 63 indicating the potential of remote sensing and reanalysis products over sparsely gauged regions the tc method provides us with a new perspective for the evaluation of precipitation estimates without the ground truth thus the application of tc based results for merging multi source products is promising and will be addressed in the future also new strategies for reducing the bias of tc based results due to the violation against its mathematical assumptions should be considered acknowledgements this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 7146101701 and china national 973 project grant no 2013cb036406 the authors great gratitude is extended to the china meteorological administration for providing ground based rainfall data the efforts of research communities are also highly appreciated for making all the data available for international users 
7209,looking only at climate change impacts provides partial information about a changing hydrologic regime understanding the spatio temporal nature of change in hydrologic processes and the explicit contributions from both climate and land use drivers holds more practical value for water resources management and policy intervention this study presents a comprehensive assessment on the spatio temporal trend of blue water bw and green water gw in a 490 000 km2 temperate mid latitude basin ohio river basin over the past 80 years 1935 2014 and from thereon quantifies the combined as well as relative contributions of climate and land use changes the soil and water assessment tool swat is adopted to simulate hydrologic fluxes mann kendall and theil sen statistical tests are performed on the modeled outputs to detect respectively the trend and magnitude of changes at three different spatial scales the entire basin regional level and sub basin level despite the overall volumetric increase of both bw and gw in the entire basin changes in their annual average values during the period of simulation reveal a distinctive spatial pattern gw has increased significantly in the upper and lower parts of the basin which can be related to the prominent land use change in those areas bw has increased significantly only in the lower part likely being associated with the notable precipitation change there furthermore the simulation under a time varying climate but constant land use scenario identifies climate change in the ohio river basin to be influential on bw while the impact is relatively nominal on gw whereas land use change increases gw remarkably but is counterproductive on bw the approach to quantify combined relative effects of climate and land use change as shown in this study can be replicated to understand bw gw dynamics in similar large basins around the globe keywords climate change land use change ohio river basin swat hydrologic modeling 1 introduction under the increasing threats of climate and land use change fresh water availability will eventually become a limiting resource for many regions across the globe in the near future faramarzi et al 2017 the dynamics of water availability within a region can be analyzed in multiple ways including statistical methods sensitivity based methods and distributed hydrologic modeling statistical methods mostly involve time series analysis and nonparametric tests of a particular hydrologic indicator such as streamflow e g kumar et al 2009 sadri et al 2016 zhang and schilling 2006 a widely used method is the budyko based sensitivity analysis framework budyko 1974 donohue et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 roderick and farquhar 2011 tan and gan 2015 wang and tang 2014 wang and hejazi 2011 to differentiate the role of land use change from that of climate in altering the hydrologic processes despite its wide spread usage budyko framework has several conceptual limitations such as the mutual independence of precipitation evaporation and evapotranspiration as well as the assumption of steady state water balance with no temporal change in sub surface storage carmona et al 2016 greve et al 2015 most importantly use of both the statistical trend analysis and the sensitivity budyko framework approaches requires past hydro climatic data which limits their applicability at required spatio temporal resolution in contrast hydrologic modeling can provide spatially and temporally explicit assessments on surface sub surface components by partitioning the water into blue water bw total water yield and deep aquifer recharge and green water gw soil water content and actual evapotranspiration e g gerten et al 2005 zang et al 2012 bw includes the water in rivers aquifers and lakes reservoirs that collectively account for approximately one third of the total available fresh water the remaining two third of the total fresh water is the gw that is stored in the vadose zone and circulates within the water cycle through evapotranspiration et feedbacks falkenmark and rockström 2006 bw is critical for domestic and industrial water consumption döll and siebert 2002 whereas gw plays a key role in crop production and other ecosystem services zang et al 2012 long term model simulation of bw and gw facilitates identification of hotspots that show abrupt temporal change points e g zang and liu 2013 and locations particular sub basins at which water shortage or excess are more likely to occur e g schuol et al 2008a b identification of such hotspots is critical for water resources managers stakeholders where surface or groundwater needs to be abstracted with possible limiting availability without hampering the requirement of the downstream users rodrigues et al 2014 thus bw and gw have evolved as the major building blocks for the water footprint concept hoekstra and hung 2002 hoekstra et al 2011 which essentially redefine the perception of integrated water resources management by considering not just streamflow at discrete locations but the entire water balance of the basin as manageable falkenmark and rockström 2006 regardless long term spatio temporal changes in bw gw in a basin essentially indicate the change in overall hydrologic regime with the advent of advanced hydrologic models and computational resources several large scale modeling studies focusing on bw gw dynamics exist for a few regions across the globe table 1 most of these studies investigated the role of changing climate on the long term changes in bw and gw while assuming a constant land use e g abbaspour et al 2009 faramarzi et al 2009 schuol et al 2008a zang and liu 2013 zang et al 2012 some studies attempted to model bw gw considering both time varying climate and

2016 though for a very limited length of analysis e g 20 years unavailability of historical land use data is the main factor that hinders quantifying the relative contribution of climate and land use change with this inability their spatially explicit correlation with bw and gw could not be deduced in any previous study accordingly calculating the temporal trend or volumetric change in bw gw without looking into the spatially explicit pattern of climate land use change masks the hydrologic responses from individual sub basins e g li et al 2009 xu 2013 although such lumped assessments provide insights on how the hydrologic regime is evolving in a particular watershed these may not be sufficiently helpful in detecting the actual drivers at larger spatial scales large scale studies with spatially explicit characterization of climate land use change impacts are more effective to provide holistic solution at regional and national levels thereby holding more practical value for future water resources management and policy intervention the overall goal of this study is to perform a spatially explicit assessment of changing hydrologic regime in terms of bw gw dynamics in a temperate mid latitude river basin by i providing a general evaluation on the historical changes in climate and land use in the past 80 years 1935 2014 ii creating multiple configurations of a large scale hydrologic model that are representative of each decade iii conducting temporal trend analyses of bw gw using model simulated outputs at three spatial levels individual sub basins larger sub regions and the entire basin and iv quantifying the relative contribution of climate and land use change while relating their respective spatial patterns with bw gw dynamics 2 study area this study is conducted on the 491 000 km2 ohio river basin orb in the united states which is the largest tributary of the mississippi basin by water volume fig 1 orb provides a unique test case because land use data for this region are available for past decades from tayyebi et al 2015 the elevation in orb ranges from 30 m above sea level in the flat western parts to 1745 m in the hilly eastern areas the predominant land use in the western parts of orb is agriculture due to its flat topography and low elevation whereas the eastern part is mostly forested according to the recorded climate data during 1935 2014 annual precipitation for the whole basin ranges from 840 mm year to 1484 mm year the annual average maximum and minimum temperature range from 16 6 to 20 0 c and 2 5 to 7 3 c respectively the annual precipitation increases slightly from southeast to northwest due to higher elevations in the southeast while snow accumulation being significant in the north and along the appalachians in the southeast white et al 2005 the majority portion of orb lies within the corn belt region of the u s midwest and produces nearly 15 25 of the total corn and soybean in the country schnitkey 2013 in addition to agriculture orb serves drinking water demand for about 10 of the population and produces about 20 of the electricity for the entire country america s watershed initiative 2014 considering the changes in both climate and land use there is a need to understand how water resources within orb have been affected in the last several decades a regional hydro climatic trend analysis between 1895 and 2011 by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration shows that the average air temperature and annual precipitation in the u s midwest including orb have increased by 0 07 c and 7 5 mm per decade respectively kunkel et al 2013 with the increasing population associated food demand and rising grain prices conversion of native grassland to agricultural areas has been the primary land use change in the midwest great plains states after mid 20th century paul et al 2017 sleeter et al 2013 however orb has experienced a unique land transformation from agriculture to forest since 1950s mainly due to the agricultural act of 1956 and conservation reserve program of 1985 lytle 2010 usfs 2009 usda 2015 these conservation policies encouraged farmers to convert erodible or environmentally sensitive croplands into forests with the enactment of a more recent public policy energy independence and security act of 2007 there has been another paradigm shift in orb s land use practice as the farmers have started growing biofuel pastures on degraded marginally suitable lands drummond et al 2012 rajib et al 2016a schilling et al 2008 sohl et al 2014 sohl et al 2012 the population is also continuously growing in the midwestern states with an average annual growth rate of 3 8 during 2000 2009 eathington 2010 giving way to increasing urbanization against this background an improved understanding of the combined and the relative role of climate and land use changes will afford effective management of current and future water resources in this region 3 methods 3 1 evaluating historical changes in climate and land use 1935 2014 representative land use data for the past 80 years 1935 2014 are analyzed to determine a temporal pattern of interchanges among different land use classes sub basins experiencing land use change are identified through gis processing such that the dominant land use within a sub basin got shifted from one type to another statistical trend analyses are performed using the basin average annual precipitation air temperature and potential evapotranspiration pet data enabling the identification of a relatively prominent indicator of climate change 3 2 creating multiple configurations of a large scale hydrologic model for each decade hydrologic simulation to evaluate the combined and relative influence of climate and land use change on bw gw is performed by the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012 neitsch et al 2011 swat is chosen because it is extensively tested in large spatial scales under different geophysical settings e g abbaspour et al 2015 faramarzi et al 2017 rajib and merwade 2017 schuol et al 2008a zang et al 2012 accordingly similar modeling approach such as the one presented here can be replicated for other large basins across the globe 3 2 1 input data the topography data for swat modeling is obtained from us geological survey s usgs 30 m resolution national elevation dataset usgs ned 2015 the 1 250 000 scale state soil geographic data statsgo is included from the model s built in database five historical land use data sets one for each decade during 1935 1985 are obtained from the human environment modeling and analysis laboratory department of forestry and natural resource at the purdue university tayyebi et al 2015 these land use maps feature four major land cover classes forest and rangeland agriculture urban and others e g wetland barren for the remaining three decades of the study period 1985 2014 land use maps are obtained from multi year usgs national land cover database 1992 2001 and 2011 usgs nlcd 2016 the original nlcd maps are reclassified into the same generic classes as in the historical land use maps for 1935 1985 to reduce uncertainty that might have evolved from dissimilar techniques used in generating the datasets the climate data are obtained from 112 national climatic data center ncdc weather stations fig 1 which are uniformly distributed within the basin and have continuous records these stations provide total daily precipitation average daily maximum and minimum temperature covering the entire period of simulation ncdc maintains a nationally recognized database that goes through standard quality checks so no prior statistical tests are performed on the climate data all other relevant data such as solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity are created through the internal weather generator in swat observed daily streamflow time series for model calibration and validation are obtained from selected usgs gauge stations fig 1 3 2 2 model configurations nine swat models divided under two different configurations are developed to evaluate the combined and individual impacts of climate and land use on bw gw the first model configuration incorporates the combined effect of climate and land use for which the entire 80 year study period 1935 2014 is divided into 10 year segments eight swat models are created one separate model for each decade by using the corresponding representative land use and climate data in the second model configuration the impacts of climate and land use are isolated by creating a single swat model based on the 1940s land use and historical climate data over the same 80 year span in simple terms the first model configuration involves variable land use and variable climate and the second configuration involves constant land use and variable climate the spatial heterogeneity is represented in the models by dividing orb into 125 sub basins using 2500 km2 as the threshold area for stream network delineation to reduce computational burden all geospatial datasets are processed at 90 m spatial resolution similarly a single hydrologic response unit hru is created for each sub basin based on the dominant land use soil type and slope class following several other swat applications faramarzi et al 2017 ndomba et al 2008 oeurng et al 2011 schuol et al 2008a b tibebe and bewket 2011 considering the elevation difference across the basin slope is divided into three classes 0 4 4 10 and 10 because the changes in bw gw will be eventually quantified at a sub basin scale it is assumed that single hru sub basins will produce reasonable results to validate this assumption a prototype swat model was created for the variable climate variable land use configuration with 10 area aggregation threshold for soil slope and land use to generate 1670 hrus for the 125 sub basins although the daily simulated outputs from this porotype model were not identical as in the dominant model setup the aggregated annual sub basin averages of the bw gw components did not show any noticeable difference this is analogous to the findings by her et al 2015 as well penman monteith equation is selected for computing pet and the hydrologic processes related to surface runoff generation and channel routing are simulated using the curve number and variable storage methods neitsch et al 2011 respectively nearly 30 of orb has artificial subsurface drainage tile drainage sugg 2007 a big portion of which was installed before 1960s zucker and brown 1998 due to the absence of a database listing the actual spatial coverage of subsurface drainage their depth spacing and actual date of installation all the sub basins having poorly drained and very poorly drained soil are simulated by using the tile drainage routine in swat e g boles et al 2015 boles 2013 du et al 2005 green et al 2006 in swat four major parameters dep imp depth to impermeable layer mm ddrain depth to drain mm tdrain time to drain soil to field capacity hr and gdrain drain tile lag time hr are responsible in simulating flow through the tile drains neitsch et al 2011 here values for these four parameters are set to 1200 mm 1000 mm 24 h and 48 h respectively following previous studies on several agricultural watersheds within orb e g boles et al 2015 boles 2013 kladivko et al 1991 larose et al 2007 3 2 3 model calibration and validation for the first modeling configuration to study the combined impact of land use and climate change on bw gw swat model is calibrated for each decade by using daily streamflow observations from nine usgs gauge stations fig 1 the calibration stations are selected based on data availability along the 80 year span as well as the uniform distribution of station locations across the basin as recommended by daggupati et al 2015a the last three years from the previous decade are used as initialization warm up period in every case after obtaining the best estimates most optimal of the parameters from calibration models are cross validated for each decade by using three different usgs gauge stations that are not included in the calibration phase fig 1 the validation stations are chosen to capture the varied topography and land use in the basin the above mentioned setup results into eight sets of calibrated parameters one for each decade for the first model configuration for the second configuration which isolates the impact of land use the model is calibrated for 75 years 1935 2014 with a 5 year warm up period 1935 1939 by using the same calibration and validation stations as in the first model configuration a total of 18 parameters involving surface subsurface and channel hydrologic responses are used for calibration table a 1 in appendix a the selection of parameters and their initial ranges are based on the review of existing literature and prior knowledge of the u s midwestern watersheds e g ahiablame et al 2017 rajib and merwade 2017 as well as suggestions from model developers neitsch et al 2011 calibration is conducted using the sequential uncertainty fitting alogorithm version2 sufi 2 which is a semi automated inverse modeling procedure available inside swat cup abbaspour 2015 kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 is used as the goal objective function to measure the association between simulated and observed streamflow hydrographs in this multi objective parameter optimization the best estimates of the parameters are sought through an aggregated value of the goal kge eq 1 following the approach of rajib et al 2016b 1 kge i 1 n w i kge i where i denotes the streamflow gauge stations brought under calibration and w is the weight assigned to each of them n is the total number of gauge stations involved observational datasets here equal weights are assigned to every gauge station w i 1 n thus kge calculated for individual sets of observed and simulated streamflow hydrographs are aggregated into kge and it is maximized towards an optimal solution after calibration and validation both model configurations are re run for 1935 2014 by using the respective calibrated parameter set s to obtain continuous output over the 80 year time span all the change assessments on bw gw performed in this study are based on average annual model outputs which are aggregated from the calibrated daily simulations 3 3 conducting temporal trend analyses of bw gw using model simulated outputs the mann kendall mk mann 1945 kendall 1948 test is used to detect the monotonic trends in annual precipitation temperature pet bw and gw mk is a rank based nonparametric trend test that does not require the data to follow a specific statistical distribution however hydroclimatic time series often have significant serial correlations auto correlations which can affect the accuracy of mk results that is positive serial correlation in a time series increases the probability for mk to detect a significant trend von storch 1999 yue et al 2002 an autocorrelation test on bw and gw indicated that the influence of serial correlation in the data can be neglected in this study fig b 1 in appendix b the mk rank correlation coefficient tau τ is calculated to determine whether the trend is increasing τ 0 decreasing τ 0 or not changing τ 0 three significance levels are classified based on the p values not significant ns p 0 1 significant s 0 1 p 0 01 and very significant vs p 0 01 following mk test slope of the trend is calculated using theil sen approach ts sen 1968 the slope determined by ts is the estimator of change magnitude 3 4 quantifying the relative contribution of climate and land use change the relative effects of climate and land use changes on bw and gw are quantified using an approach similar to the one applied by guo et al 2016 li et al 2015 li et al 2014 and li et al 2012 application of this approach involves the following two assumptions i climate and land use changes are the sole factors affecting the spatio temporal trend of bw gw and ii impacts of climate and land use change on bw and gw are independent to be consistent with these assumptions the two model configurations must be mutually exclusive not calibrating the second configuration variable climate steady land use rather constructing it simply based on the calibrated parameters of the first configuration variable climate variable land use would make the second fully dependent on the first turning the above assumptions invalid based on the outputs from the first model configuration involving variable climate variable land use the difference in annual values of bw and gw between two discrete time periods can be expressed by equations 2 and 3 2 δ bw bw 2014 bw 1935 3 δ gw gw 2014 gw 1935 where subscripts 1935 and 2014 represent the annual values for bw and gw given by the ts trend line corresponding to the initial 1935 and final 2014 year of comparison δbw and δgw are the respective differences between 1935 and 2014 in response to both climate and land use changes first model configuration likewise equations 4 and 5 can be used with outputs from the second model configuration variable climate steady land use to obtain the change in annual bw and gw resulted from climate change only δ bw c and δ gw c 4 δ bw c bw 2014 bw 1935 5 δ gw c gw 2014 gw 1935 where bw and gw represent the corresponding annual bw and gw values given by the ts trend line under the second configuration by subtracting the second configuration equations 4 and 5 from the first one equations 2 and 3 change in bw and gw due to land use change δ bw l and δ gw l can be obtained as the following 6 δ bw l δ bw δ bw c 7 δ gw l δ gw δ gw c then the change ratios are defined representing the relative effect of climate and land use changes as described by equations 8 and 9 8 bw c δ bw c δ bw and bw l δ bw l δ bw 9 gw c δ gw c δ gw and gw l δ gw l δ gw where bwc gwc and bwl gwl give the relative effect on blue water green water due to climate and land use change respectively 4 results in this section a general assessment of climate and land use change in orb is first presented based on past climate records and land use databases during the 80 year study period 1935 2014 after the evaluation of calibrated model performances against observed streamflow data trend of changes in bw and gw from the first modeling configuration variable climate variable land use are presented at the sub basin regional and basin level finally the relative contribution of climate and land use change on bw and gw is evaluated based on the second modeling configuration variable climate steady land use the dominant land use in orb during 1940s was agriculture covering 55 of the total basin area while forest and urban area constituted 35 and 7 respectively fig 2 in the following decades both forest and urban land uses increased by partially replacing agricultural areas the forest cover has significantly increased in the upper region more specifically the northeast part of the basin by 2010 forest and urban areas were covering 51 and 10 of the total basin area respectively thereby reducing the agricultural land use from 55 to 37 the increase in urban area by 3 was much less compared to the change in forest area which increased by 16 based on the mk ts test results annual precipitation increased by 78 mm in 2014 which is about 8 higher than the precipitation in 1935 fig 3 nevertheless prominent fluctuations from the trend line fig 3 a throughout the study period are indicative of persistent climate variability in orb fig 3 b shows a statistically insignificant decreasing trend of pet across orb in this case pet is calculated with swat s built in penman monteith equation neitsch et al 2011 using all the relevant energy related weather inputs including air temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity annual maximum temperature dropped by 1 c and the annual minimum temperature increased by 0 4 c indicating a trend of cooler days and warmer nights fig 3 c as a result of the opposing trends in the maximum and minimum temperature no clear trend is visible in average temperature it is well accepted that the statistical trend of a hydro climatologic time series depends on the length of data that is included in the test looking only at a specific span of time may create a different impression contrary to what would have been identified from a much longer time series from this aspect using 80 years of data is rather indicative of the analytical strength to capture hydrologic changes more realistically contrary to the previous studies that are based on much shorter time spans table 1 fig 4 shows the change in annual precipitation in each sub basin by comparing the annual average in 1985 2014 to that in 1935 1964 in general precipitation has increased remarkably in majority of the sub basins which is analogous to the findings shown in fig 3 a increased precipitation amount is observed mostly in the northeast and northwest parts while a slight decrease is noticeable in the middle and southern parts current version of swat assigns the nearest climate station to each sub basin not an interpolation because the calculated change in precipitation is representative of an entire sub basin there can be abrupt differences in the change values among adjacent sub basins based on the spatial characterization of sub basin scale land use and precipitation changes the entire basin can be divided into three regions the upper region upstream middle region and lower region downstream accordingly fig 4 shows sub basins that have experienced change either in land use or precipitation or both the quantitative assessment of precipitation and land use change in orb as shown in table 2 validates the rationale for aforementioned regional sub divisions to ascertain that the calibrated swat models are representative of orb s geophysical characteristics simulated daily streamflow at three validation locations fig 1 are compared with usgs gauge data for the 80 year simulation period fig 5 it should be noted that the hydrographs presented in fig 5 correspond to the variable climate variable land use configuration asserting the credibility of the models to capture climate and land use change impacts the goodness of fit scores kge nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias expressed in units for both model configurations variable steady land use are summarized in table 3 separately for the calibration and validation phases regardless of calibration or validation kge and nse in daily simulation range from 0 38 to 0 85 with pbias from 20 to 1 fig 6 shows the goodness of the model in terms of seasonal and annual variability in streamflow where simulated average annual streamflow is found to have kge ranging from 0 69 to 0 82 in all the three validation locations table a 2 appendix a reports the optimized parameter values best estimates assessments of trends in bw gw are performed based on average annual swat outputs figs 7 and 8 shows trend analyses results for bw gw for each of the 125 sub basins featuring the combined effects of climate and land use such spatially explicit assessment helps to relate changes in bw gw with their corresponding driving factors at the sub basin level fig 9 presents the trend results for the three regions separately upper middle and lower while fig 10 shows the same when analyzed at the entire basin scale significant or very significant increases in both bw and gw trends are found in the lower region for the basin as a whole the amount of both bw and gw has increased during the study period however with different levels of statistical significance results from the ts test as summarized in table 4 show a basin average increase in bw by 35 5 mm although the trend of change mk test is found insignificant p 0 1 as estimated by the ts trend line basin average gw has changed very significantly p 0 01 with an increase of 64 5 mm in 2014 compared to that in 1935 5 discussion 5 1 characterizing historical changes in land use and climate any sub basin in orb experiencing change of land use such that the past dominant land use therein got shifted to another type is identified in fig 2 c and also in fig 4 although fig 2 d shows a basin level generic trend in orb with agricultural areas being converted into forest and urban areas that trend has all but ceased since the last two decades lytle 2010 accordingly there is evidence of continuous agricultural intensification in the lower downstream region especially due to growing interests for producing biofuel pastures in marginal lands e g rajib et al 2016a overall one third of orb experienced noticeable land use change over a span of 80 years most of which occurred in the northeast and southwest regions these temporal changes in land use practices are crucial for capturing bw gw dynamics more realistically which is not possible by considering only climate change in the hydrologic simulation because of the relatively small increase in urban areas compared to other land uses it is assumed that the effect of urbanization on basin scale hydrology is nominal increasing annual precipitation in orb indicates more availability of water albeit inter annual variability fig 3 a while precipitation is the supply of water potential evapotranspiration pet is the index of available energy that drives water back to atmosphere several studies have shown altered trends of solar radiation wild 2009 vapor pressure willett et al 2008 and wind speed mcvicar et al 2012 in different parts of the globe which are the key determinants of pet in addition to just air temperature therefore looking only into temperature might not provide a holistic perspective on the changing trend of atmospheric evaporative demand donohue et al 2010 hence the whole water balance donohue et al 2011 liu and mcvicar 2012 for orb a declining trend of pet is detected in fig 3 b which is supported by the declining wind speed observed in past several decades in the u s midwest pryor et al 2009 and also by the invariant average temperature trend in fig 3 c these results are often specific to the period of study which may be different from what could have been observed in a longer duration trend analysis for example rogers 2013 showed a cooling trend of average annual temperature 0 5 c century in the most parts of orb during 1895 2007 karl et al 1996 found the same over the period of 1900 1994 under the particular context of this study absence of noteworthy trends in average temperature and pet but a significant increasing trend of precipitation suggests that precipitation is the primary indicator of climate change in orb it is important to detect a characteristic spatial pattern of precipitation and land use changes across the basin so that a coherence can be established with the corresponding changes in bw gw both qualitatively and quantitatively the regional sub divisions presented in fig 4 are derived solely from such perspective in general land use change in both upper and lower regions of orb is substantial while the precipitation increase in the lower region is relatively greater than that in the upper region changes in land use and precipitation in the middle region are not as extensive as they are in the other two regions table 2 5 2 model evaluation reasonably good agreement with the observed streamflow data at seasonal and annual time scale as revealed by fig 6 shows the efficacy of simulated bw gw components to realistically capture the hydrologic responses all bw gw components are calculated here using the annual outputs that are originally simulated at daily time scale despite being computationally intensive daily calibration is preferred over monthly or annual calibration with an expectation of better constraining the model the calibrated daily streamflow hydrographs from swat match well with the observed data except for several high flow events this is analogous to findings from many past studies across different regions that report deficiency of the swat model in simulating extreme flow conditions e g daggupati et al 2016 rajib and merwade 2016 performance measures in the variable climate variable land use configuration are relatively better than the variable climate steady land use configuration for most of the stations table 3 thus demonstrating the effect of using representative land use in the model for each decade relatively higher pbias values in some locations can be partly attributed to the insufficient representation of precipitation dynamics in certain portions of orb the 112 weather stations though uniformly distributed over the 490 000 km2 basin area provide only one point input approximately for each 4500 km2 advanced remotely sensed gridded precipitation estimates are not suitable for this study because of their issues related to relatively short period of data availability and possible uncertainty compared to ground observations price et al 2014 regardless of the variable constant land use configurations or calibration validation persistence of apparently systematic and noticeably higher pbias in the forested region table 3 is most likely caused by the assumption of constant surface canopy resistance in pet calculation milly and dunne 2016 use of a coarse resolution dem 90 m could also be a factor in this case given the fact that much of the mid basin and upstream forested region of orb has high topographic variability these cause and effect evaluations are detectable from fig 5 where the simulated daily streamflow hydrograph in a validation location usgs 03025500 forested region with high topographic relief is prominently underperforming compared to another location usgs 03340500 representing flat agricultural landscape an obvious reason for large variability in pbias estimates across the basin or between two model configurations at the same station could be the sub optimality in streamflow only calibrations this problem can be addressed through a multi variable spatially distributed calibration scheme e g kunnath poovakka et al 2016 rajib et al 2016b regardless a high pbias value in a daily calibration can be significantly influenced by the biases in few events e g model not capturing the extreme peak flows even though the model performance is generally good overall the calibrated swat models developed in this study are able to reasonably capture the time response and total volume of fluxes with slight deficiency in some cases considering the complexity in 80 year daily simulation and simultaneous multi gauge optimization at such a large scale the calibration validation results can be considered satisfactory for long term land use climate change impact assessments according to the evaluation guidelines from swat developers moriasi et al 2007 2015a b the model performance shown here is comparable to various other large scale swat applications as well e g abbaspour et al 2015 daggupati et al 2015b 2016 faramarzi et al 2017 rajib and merwade 2017 5 3 spatio temporal dynamics of blue and green water 5 3 1 sub basin scale trend analyses sub basin level mk test results provide spatially explicit information on bw gw dynamics showing their respective trends of change and associated level of significance trends in gw are more pronounced because the number of sub basins showing significant changes in gw trends fig 8 is higher than that for bw trend fig 7 although figs 7 and 8 represent the combined effects of climate and land use an analogy with fig 4 reveals bw being affected more by the changes in precipitation while land use change being more influential on gw for example significant changes in gw p 0 01 either increasing or decreasing are noticeable in the sub basins with prominent land use change specifically 35 out of the 43 sub basins that experienced land use change fig 4 show very significant increasing trends in gw fig 8 for some of the sub basins in the southern portion of both the middle and upper regions where no significant land use change has been detected the decrease in precipitation is likely the main driver for decreasing gw amount similarly significant increasing trend in bw in the northwestern sub basins fig 7 can be related to the increase in precipitation because these sub basins did not experience change in land use however both increased precipitation and significant land use change might counteract each other causing bw to decrease or stay consistent this is the case for some of the sub basins in the northeastern part overall increase in precipitation has been contributing to the increasing trend of bw and gw in orb and vice versa although the extent of effect on gw trend is nominal on the contrary land use change in majority of the sub basins has been causing gw to increase but bw to decrease 5 3 2 regional and basin scale trend analyses the middle region shows the least change in bw gw trend fig 9 which can be related to the least impacted land use and precipitation pattern there fig 4 table 2 contrary to the other two regions bw is slightly decreasing in the middle region follwing the dereasing unaltered trend of precipitation over 78 of its area however land use change over 15 of its area has caused gw to increase but the trend is statistically insignificant the lower region shows the most significant change in the trends of both bw and gw in response to the pronounced change in both land use and climate similarly in conjunction with the prominent land use change in the upper region the gw amount has increased significantly p 0 1 the upper region also shows an increasing but insignificant trend in bw in response to relatively smaller changes in precipitation amount compared to that in the lower region table 2 while land use and climate change have different extent of influence on bw gw across three regions the trends in fig 10 showing comparatively more significant rate of increase in gw imply equal importance of land use change as a determinant of hydrologic regime for the whole basin and may be the u s midwest in general e g ahiablame et al 2017 rajib and merwade 2017 therefore studies looking only at climate change would provide partial information which may not be representative of reality 5 4 relative effect of climate and land use change the change in land use has caused more than 70 of the volumetric increment in gw across all three regions table 4 land use change alone has led to decreases in bw by 103 and 42 respectively in the upper and lower regions but it is the more pronounced effect of climate change i e precipitation given the context of this study which has resulted into a net positive change in bw the relatively consistent climate in the middle region i e unaltered decreasing precipitation in most parts table 2 is responsible for decrease in both bw and gw by 252 and 9 respectively but the change in land use though nominal ultimately resulted into net increase in gw there these quantitative assessments coupled with sub basin regional basin level trend analyses establish land use change as the controlling factor of gw in orb climate change can affect both bw and gw however with stronger influence on bw therefore if the hydrologic flux components of bw and gw are analyzed separately land use change can be found more responsible for changes in et and root zone soil water gw and climate change for water yield and deep aquifer recharge bw although zhao et al 2016 obtained nearly similar results showing land use gw and climate bw connectivity for another mid latitude basin in the asia pacific there is still not enough evidence to apporve this as a generic cause and effect relationship some of the previous studies e g abbaspour et al 2009 fu et al 2007 jha et al 2004 legesse et al 2003 van roosmalen et al 2009 have shown that both temperature and precipitation can be critical on bw gw however these findings are region specific and may not be analogous to orb because of the insignificant change in average temperature over the past 80 years fig 3 c slightly increasing minimum temperature in orb may still impact hydrologic responses in the northeastern part more specifically in terms of the volume and timing of snow melt thereby affecting the seasonal variability of runoff water yield e g paul et al 2017 however such seasonal aspects have not been analyzed in this study gradual lowering of pet limit fig 3 b has a decreasing effect on the actual et hence gw which might have been counteracted by the higher precipitation availability hence more water available for et even under the same pet limit paul et al 2017 besides these correlated hydro climatic processes a land use climate circular effect is possible too the apparent increase in transpiration from the expanding vegetation due to re forestation and agricultural intensification upper and lower region of orb respectively might have led to cooler day temperature and subsequent reduction in pet e g mueller et al 2016 fig 3 alternatively a staggering 65 mm increase in gw i e et and soil water in 2010s with respect to that in 1940s table 4 estimated by the ts trend line can also be linked with the notable rise of dew point temperature observed across the u s midwest over the last century brown and degaetano 2013 thus the increased et in orb might not be causing the temperature to soar but it is adding to the humidity affecting the timing intensity and spatial pattern of precipitation pertinent to the circular effect between climate and land use land cover co2 fertilization is another important factor that needs attention it is a well established fact that atmospheric co2 has increased substantially over the past century with minimal change in vapor pressure deficit which is likely in orb as indicated by the trends in temperature and pet fig 3 increase in co2 can cause co2 fertilization by raising the water use efficiency in photosynthesis process e g donohue et al 2013 2017 if there is no change in climate land use this extra efficiency could ideally cause photosynthesis to increase while transpiration stays constant or photosynthesis would remain constant while transpiration declines in orb increase in gw outpaced bw in the forested middle upper regions table 4 thus a profound indication from this study is that higher precipitation and afforestation have caused increase in the amount of transpiration while elevated co2 concentration might have been enhancing the vegetative productivity in the forests through co2 fertilization this is analogous to the recent findings for tropical forests yang et al 2016 and for many parts of the globe zhu et al 2016 another important attribute of this vegetation productivity is the increase in root depths in response to elevated co2 bond and midgley 2012 iversen 2010 which has profound implication on how vegetation evolves adapts over time and effects water balance via transpiration however changed extent of forested area must not be misinterpreted with the same meaning as the change in vegetative productivity although this study has considered varying land use climate over the 80 year study period in one of the configurations all simulations are conducted assuming a constant co2 concentration in this way swat only simulates annual growth cycles of particular vegetation types following an optimal leaf area development curve which basically ignores the long term co2 fertilization effect such limitation might have imparted some inaccuracies in the results especially in the forested sub basins 5 5 implications of a changing hydrologic regime implications of altered bw gw dynamics span beyond just water availability for example increase in bw essentially indicates a directly proportional increase of flooding potential in orb this is because water yield a component of bw is simulated as the amount of water leaving the landscape and becoming available in the main channel water yield surface runoff base flow lateral flow losses neitsch et al 2011 as deep aquifer recharge the other component of bw can only have a trifling change in the 80 year time span a basin average 35 5 mm increase of bw in table 4 essentially mean a 0 5 mm year increase in water yield however results for the lower region suggest much adverse situation with a statistically significant increasing rate of 1 mm year this means higher expectancy of flooding in the lower region whole state of indiana southeastern part of illinois and northwestern part of kentucky in current times and in near future even in case of a relatively low magnitude rainfall event on the contrary the middle and upper regions states of ohio west virginia and pennsylvania have relatively timid change in flooding potential as indicated by decreasing insignificant increasing trends in bw therein table 4 fig 9 such spatially explicit attribution of flood hazards supplements the findings from other relevant studies e g mallakpour and villarini 2015 the increased water yield or bw can also be responsible for higher sediment and nutrient runoff thus worsening the surface water quality pryor et al 2014 local governments would require more investments to prevent increasing threats of contamination and protection of water resources in such contexts change in gw in orb provides a unique example of human influence on climate change due to the elevated et i e gw from the increased extent of agriculture and forested landscape respectively in the lower and upper regions frequent summer droughts are becoming more likely even with precipitation quantity that is slightly less than the average usepa 2016 accordingly this might cause reduced crop yield unless additional supply can be allocated for irrigation water higher irrigation demand or lower crop yield means more trade off complexity in the food energy water nexus while these are some of the plausible implications of a changing hydrologic regime that can be inferred from the outcomes of this study model configurations developed here retain their value to be reused in more exhaustive impact assessments 5 6 limitations of the study the following discussion acknowledges some of the limitations of this study 1 use of single hru for each sub basin limits finer resolution assessment on local level evolution of hydrologic fluxes detailed hru scale simulation would cost enormous computational resource and time for such a large scale model 2 the same spatial coverage of artificial subsurface tile drainage and the same draining techniques depth to drain spacing etc since 1935 are also gross approximations although effects of tile drainage over the long term annual volumetric change in bw and gw can be trivial 3 land use data for past years have agriculture or forest as generic classes without any

informed assessment showing a prediction range for the bw gw outputs e g faramarzi et al 2017 could be performed in a future study beside precipitation and or temperature spatial changes of wind speed solar radiation and humidity could also be the important indicators of climate change as such their effects on changing hydrologic processes need better understanding therefore additional multi variate spatial statistical analyses would potentially solidify the findings on changing hydrologic regime 6 conclusion this is the first study on 490 000 km2 ohio river basin orb a significant eco region in the united states enabling spatio temporal characterization of climate and land use change impacts on blue water bw and green water gw dynamics swat models are created under two different configurations in order to quantify the combined as well as the relative impacts of climate and land use change in altering the dynamics of bw and gw over an 80 year period 1935 2014 it should be noted that most of the past studies on bw gw dynamics have assumed constant land use although some of the studies have used variable land use in model simulations the relative influence of climate and land use change on bw gw dynamics have not been quantified the current study overcomes these limitations by incorporating representative decadal land use data during 80 years of simulation and hence the modeling results are expected to be more representative of the actual hydrologic responses based on the statistical trend analyses of modeled outputs at three different spatial scales the entire basin 3 sub regions and each of the 125 sub basins following conclusions can be drawn 1 increased precipitation and re forestation are found as the dominant indicators of climate and land use change in orb while changes in precipitation and land use are evident in the upper and lower regions during the 80 years of study the middle region is relatively least impacted 2 between 1935 and 2014 the changing climate and land use have increased both bw and gw across the basin although change magnitude of gw is twice the magnitude of bw the lower region exhibits maximum changes where the land use and climate changes have led to significant increasing trends in both bw and gw similarly the gw in upper region has increased significantly in response to land use change the amount of bw has also increased in the upper region but the trend is not significant which corresponds to the relatively smaller changes in precipitation amount in the upper region compared to that in the lower region the middle region shows the least changes in both bw and gw 3 based on the independent contribution of climate and land use a causal relationship is detected showing that land use change in orb generally exerts stronger influence on gw dynamics climate change affects both bw and gw but the effects are more pronounced on bw overall this study identifies the hotspots within the ohio river basin which have been experiencing major changes in bw gw dynamics in response to climate and land use changes sub basin scale attribution of land use and climate more specifically precipitation change impacts will provide valuable insights to the local stakeholders whereas regional and basin level assessments will help appropriate decision making on water resources management protection and restoration by both the regional watershed managers and the national policy makers relative impacts of climate and land use in changing the dynamics of bw and gw as quantified in this study will allow adopting mitigation measures in a more efficient and targeted way depending on whether climate change or land use change is the governing factor for a region of interest acknowledgements drs adnan rajib and

7209,looking only at climate change impacts provides partial information about a changing hydrologic regime understanding the spatio temporal nature of change in hydrologic processes and the explicit contributions from both climate and land use drivers holds more practical value for water resources management and policy intervention this study presents a comprehensive assessment on the spatio temporal trend of blue water bw and green water gw in a 490 000 km2 temperate mid latitude basin ohio river basin over the past 80 years 1935 2014 and from thereon quantifies the combined as well as relative contributions of climate and land use changes the soil and water assessment tool swat is adopted to simulate hydrologic fluxes mann kendall and theil sen statistical tests are performed on the modeled outputs to detect respectively the trend and magnitude of changes at three different spatial scales the entire basin regional level and sub basin level despite the overall volumetric increase of both bw and gw in the entire basin changes in their annual average values during the period of simulation reveal a distinctive spatial pattern gw has increased significantly in the upper and lower parts of the basin which can be related to the prominent land use change in those areas bw has increased significantly only in the lower part likely being associated with the notable precipitation change there furthermore the simulation under a time varying climate but constant land use scenario identifies climate change in the ohio river basin to be influential on bw while the impact is relatively nominal on gw whereas land use change increases gw remarkably but is counterproductive on bw the approach to quantify combined relative effects of climate and land use change as shown in this study can be replicated to understand bw gw dynamics in similar large basins around the globe keywords climate change land use change ohio river basin swat hydrologic modeling 1 introduction under the increasing threats of climate and land use change fresh water availability will eventually become a limiting resource for many regions across the globe in the near future faramarzi et al 2017 the dynamics of water availability within a region can be analyzed in multiple ways including statistical methods sensitivity based methods and distributed hydrologic modeling statistical methods mostly involve time series analysis and nonparametric tests of a particular hydrologic indicator such as streamflow e g kumar et al 2009 sadri et al 2016 zhang and schilling 2006 a widely used method is the budyko based sensitivity analysis framework budyko 1974 donohue et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 roderick and farquhar 2011 tan and gan 2015 wang and tang 2014 wang and hejazi 2011 to differentiate the role of land use change from that of climate in altering the hydrologic processes despite its wide spread usage budyko framework has several conceptual limitations such as the mutual independence of precipitation evaporation and evapotranspiration as well as the assumption of steady state water balance with no temporal change in sub surface storage carmona et al 2016 greve et al 2015 most importantly use of both the statistical trend analysis and the sensitivity budyko framework approaches requires past hydro climatic data which limits their applicability at required spatio temporal resolution in contrast hydrologic modeling can provide spatially and temporally explicit assessments on surface sub surface components by partitioning the water into blue water bw total water yield and deep aquifer recharge and green water gw soil water content and actual evapotranspiration e g gerten et al 2005 zang et al 2012 bw includes the water in rivers aquifers and lakes reservoirs that collectively account for approximately one third of the total available fresh water the remaining two third of the total fresh water is the gw that is stored in the vadose zone and circulates within the water cycle through evapotranspiration et feedbacks falkenmark and rockström 2006 bw is critical for domestic and industrial water consumption döll and siebert 2002 whereas gw plays a key role in crop production and other ecosystem services zang et al 2012 long term model simulation of bw and gw facilitates identification of hotspots that show abrupt temporal change points e g zang and liu 2013 and locations particular sub basins at which water shortage or excess are more likely to occur e g schuol et al 2008a b identification of such hotspots is critical for water resources managers stakeholders where surface or groundwater needs to be abstracted with possible limiting availability without hampering the requirement of the downstream users rodrigues et al 2014 thus bw and gw have evolved as the major building blocks for the water footprint concept hoekstra and hung 2002 hoekstra et al 2011 which essentially redefine the perception of integrated water resources management by considering not just streamflow at discrete locations but the entire water balance of the basin as manageable falkenmark and rockström 2006 regardless long term spatio temporal changes in bw gw in a basin essentially indicate the change in overall hydrologic regime with the advent of advanced hydrologic models and computational resources several large scale modeling studies focusing on bw gw dynamics exist for a few regions across the globe table 1 most of these studies investigated the role of changing climate on the long term changes in bw and gw while assuming a constant land use e g abbaspour et al 2009 faramarzi et al 2009 schuol et al 2008a zang and liu 2013 zang et al 2012 some studies attempted to model bw gw considering both time varying climate and land use together e g liu et al 2009 li et al 2009 xu 2013 zhao et al 2016 only a few studies quantified the relative influence of climate and land use on bw gw dynamics e g li et al 2009 zhao et al 2016 though for a very limited length of analysis e g 20 years unavailability of historical land use data is the main factor that hinders quantifying the relative contribution of climate and land use change with this inability their spatially explicit correlation with bw and gw could not be deduced in any previous study accordingly calculating the temporal trend or volumetric change in bw gw without looking into the spatially explicit pattern of climate land use change masks the hydrologic responses from individual sub basins e g li et al 2009 xu 2013 although such lumped assessments provide insights on how the hydrologic regime is evolving in a particular watershed these may not be sufficiently helpful in detecting the actual drivers at larger spatial scales large scale studies with spatially explicit characterization of climate land use change impacts are more effective to provide holistic solution at regional and national levels thereby holding more practical value for future water resources management and policy intervention the overall goal of this study is to perform a spatially explicit assessment of changing hydrologic regime in terms of bw gw dynamics in a temperate mid latitude river basin by i providing a general evaluation on the historical changes in climate and land use in the past 80 years 1935 2014 ii creating multiple configurations of a large scale hydrologic model that are representative of each decade iii conducting temporal trend analyses of bw gw using model simulated outputs at three spatial levels individual sub basins larger sub regions and the entire basin and iv quantifying the relative contribution of climate and land use change while relating their respective spatial patterns with bw gw dynamics 2 study area this study is conducted on the 491 000 km2 ohio river basin orb in the united states which is the largest tributary of the mississippi basin by water volume fig 1 orb provides a unique test case because land use data for this region are available for past decades from tayyebi et al 2015 the elevation in orb ranges from 30 m above sea level in the flat western parts to 1745 m in the hilly eastern areas the predominant land use in the western parts of orb is agriculture due to its flat topography and low elevation whereas the eastern part is mostly forested according to the recorded climate data during 1935 2014 annual precipitation for the whole basin ranges from 840 mm year to 1484 mm year the annual average maximum and minimum temperature range from 16 6 to 20 0 c and 2 5 to 7 3 c respectively the annual precipitation increases slightly from southeast to northwest due to higher elevations in the southeast while snow accumulation being significant in the north and along the appalachians in the southeast white et al 2005 the majority portion of orb lies within the corn belt region of the u s midwest and produces nearly 15 25 of the total corn and soybean in the country schnitkey 2013 in addition to agriculture orb serves drinking water demand for about 10 of the population and produces about 20 of the electricity for the entire country america s watershed initiative 2014 considering the changes in both climate and land use there is a need to understand how water resources within orb have been affected in the last several decades a regional hydro climatic trend analysis between 1895 and 2011 by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration shows that the average air temperature and annual precipitation in the u s midwest including orb have increased by 0 07 c and 7 5 mm per decade respectively kunkel et al 2013 with the increasing population associated food demand and rising grain prices conversion of native grassland to agricultural areas has been the primary land use change in the midwest great plains states after mid 20th century paul et al 2017 sleeter et al 2013 however orb has experienced a unique land transformation from agriculture to forest since 1950s mainly due to the agricultural act of 1956 and conservation reserve program of 1985 lytle 2010 usfs 2009 usda 2015 these conservation policies encouraged farmers to convert erodible or environmentally sensitive croplands into forests with the enactment of a more recent public policy energy independence and security act of 2007 there has been another paradigm shift in orb s land use practice as the farmers have started growing biofuel pastures on degraded marginally suitable lands drummond et al 2012 rajib et al 2016a schilling et al 2008 sohl et al 2014 sohl et al 2012 the population is also continuously growing in the midwestern states with an average annual growth rate of 3 8 during 2000 2009 eathington 2010 giving way to increasing urbanization against this background an improved understanding of the combined and the relative role of climate and land use changes will afford effective management of current and future water resources in this region 3 methods 3 1 evaluating historical changes in climate and land use 1935 2014 representative land use data for the past 80 years 1935 2014 are analyzed to determine a temporal pattern of interchanges among different land use classes sub basins experiencing land use change are identified through gis processing such that the dominant land use within a sub basin got shifted from one type to another statistical trend analyses are performed using the basin average annual precipitation air temperature and potential evapotranspiration pet data enabling the identification of a relatively prominent indicator of climate change 3 2 creating multiple configurations of a large scale hydrologic model for each decade hydrologic simulation to evaluate the combined and relative influence of climate and land use change on bw gw is performed by the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012 neitsch et al 2011 swat is chosen because it is extensively tested in large spatial scales under different geophysical settings e g abbaspour et al 2015 faramarzi et al 2017 rajib and merwade 2017 schuol et al 2008a zang et al 2012 accordingly similar modeling approach such as the one presented here can be replicated for other large basins across the globe 3 2 1 input data the topography data for swat modeling is obtained from us geological survey s usgs 30 m resolution national elevation dataset usgs ned 2015 the 1 250 000 scale state soil geographic data statsgo is included from the model s built in database five historical land use data sets one for each decade during 1935 1985 are obtained from the human environment modeling and analysis laboratory department of forestry and natural resource at the purdue university tayyebi et al 2015 these land use maps feature four major land cover classes forest and rangeland agriculture urban and others e g wetland barren for the remaining three decades of the study period 1985 2014 land use maps are obtained from multi year usgs national land cover database 1992 2001 and 2011 usgs nlcd 2016 the original nlcd maps are reclassified into the same generic classes as in the historical land use maps for 1935 1985 to reduce uncertainty that might have evolved from dissimilar techniques used in generating the datasets the climate data are obtained from 112 national climatic data center ncdc weather stations fig 1 which are uniformly distributed within the basin and have continuous records these stations provide total daily precipitation average daily maximum and minimum temperature covering the entire period of simulation ncdc maintains a nationally recognized database that goes through standard quality checks so no prior statistical tests are performed on the climate data all other relevant data such as solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity are created through the internal weather generator in swat observed daily streamflow time series for model calibration and validation are obtained from selected usgs gauge stations fig 1 3 2 2 model configurations nine swat models divided under two different configurations are developed to evaluate the combined and individual impacts of climate and land use on bw gw the first model configuration incorporates the combined effect of climate and land use for which the entire 80 year study period 1935 2014 is divided into 10 year segments eight swat models are created one separate model for each decade by using the corresponding representative land use and climate data in the second model configuration the impacts of climate and land use are isolated by creating a single swat model based on the 1940s land use and historical climate data over the same 80 year span in simple terms the first model configuration involves variable land use and variable climate and the second configuration involves constant land use and variable climate the spatial heterogeneity is represented in the models by dividing orb into 125 sub basins using 2500 km2 as the threshold area for stream network delineation to reduce computational burden all geospatial datasets are processed at 90 m spatial resolution similarly a single hydrologic response unit hru is created for each sub basin based on the dominant land use soil type and slope class following several other swat applications faramarzi et al 2017 ndomba et al 2008 oeurng et al 2011 schuol et al 2008a b tibebe and bewket 2011 considering the elevation difference across the basin slope is divided into three classes 0 4 4 10 and 10 because the changes in bw gw will be eventually quantified at a sub basin scale it is assumed that single hru sub basins will produce reasonable results to validate this assumption a prototype swat model was created for the variable climate variable land use configuration with 10 area aggregation threshold for soil slope and land use to generate 1670 hrus for the 125 sub basins although the daily simulated outputs from this porotype model were not identical as in the dominant model setup the aggregated annual sub basin averages of the bw gw components did not show any noticeable difference this is analogous to the findings by her et al 2015 as well penman monteith equation is selected for computing pet and the hydrologic processes related to surface runoff generation and channel routing are simulated using the curve number and variable storage methods neitsch et al 2011 respectively nearly 30 of orb has artificial subsurface drainage tile drainage sugg 2007 a big portion of which was installed before 1960s zucker and brown 1998 due to the absence of a database listing the actual spatial coverage of subsurface drainage their depth spacing and actual date of installation all the sub basins having poorly drained and very poorly drained soil are simulated by using the tile drainage routine in swat e g boles et al 2015 boles 2013 du et al 2005 green et al 2006 in swat four major parameters dep imp depth to impermeable layer mm ddrain depth to drain mm tdrain time to drain soil to field capacity hr and gdrain drain tile lag time hr are responsible in simulating flow through the tile drains neitsch et al 2011 here values for these four parameters are set to 1200 mm 1000 mm 24 h and 48 h respectively following previous studies on several agricultural watersheds within orb e g boles et al 2015 boles 2013 kladivko et al 1991 larose et al 2007 3 2 3 model calibration and validation for the first modeling configuration to study the combined impact of land use and climate change on bw gw swat model is calibrated for each decade by using daily streamflow observations from nine usgs gauge stations fig 1 the calibration stations are selected based on data availability along the 80 year span as well as the uniform distribution of station locations across the basin as recommended by daggupati et al 2015a the last three years from the previous decade are used as initialization warm up period in every case after obtaining the best estimates most optimal of the parameters from calibration models are cross validated for each decade by using three different usgs gauge stations that are not included in the calibration phase fig 1 the validation stations are chosen to capture the varied topography and land use in the basin the above mentioned setup results into eight sets of calibrated parameters one for each decade for the first model configuration for the second configuration which isolates the impact of land use the model is calibrated for 75 years 1935 2014 with a 5 year warm up period 1935 1939 by using the same calibration and validation stations as in the first model configuration a total of 18 parameters involving surface subsurface and channel hydrologic responses are used for calibration table a 1 in appendix a the selection of parameters and their initial ranges are based on the review of existing literature and prior knowledge of the u s midwestern watersheds e g ahiablame et al 2017 rajib and merwade 2017 as well as suggestions from model developers neitsch et al 2011 calibration is conducted using the sequential uncertainty fitting alogorithm version2 sufi 2 which is a semi automated inverse modeling procedure available inside swat cup abbaspour 2015 kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 is used as the goal objective function to measure the association between simulated and observed streamflow hydrographs in this multi objective parameter optimization the best estimates of the parameters are sought through an aggregated value of the goal kge eq 1 following the approach of rajib et al 2016b 1 kge i 1 n w i kge i where i denotes the streamflow gauge stations brought under calibration and w is the weight assigned to each of them n is the total number of gauge stations involved observational datasets here equal weights are assigned to every gauge station w i 1 n thus kge calculated for individual sets of observed and simulated streamflow hydrographs are aggregated into kge and it is maximized towards an optimal solution after calibration and validation both model configurations are re run for 1935 2014 by using the respective calibrated parameter set s to obtain continuous output over the 80 year time span all the change assessments on bw gw performed in this study are based on average annual model outputs which are aggregated from the calibrated daily simulations 3 3 conducting temporal trend analyses of bw gw using model simulated outputs the mann kendall mk mann 1945 kendall 1948 test is used to detect the monotonic trends in annual precipitation temperature pet bw and gw mk is a rank based nonparametric trend test that does not require the data to follow a specific statistical distribution however hydroclimatic time series often have significant serial correlations auto correlations which can affect the accuracy of mk results that is positive serial correlation in a time series increases the probability for mk to detect a significant trend von storch 1999 yue et al 2002 an autocorrelation test on bw and gw indicated that the influence of serial correlation in the data can be neglected in this study fig b 1 in appendix b the mk rank correlation coefficient tau τ is calculated to determine whether the trend is increasing τ 0 decreasing τ 0 or not changing τ 0 three significance levels are classified based on the p values not significant ns p 0 1 significant s 0 1 p 0 01 and very significant vs p 0 01 following mk test slope of the trend is calculated using theil sen approach ts sen 1968 the slope determined by ts is the estimator of change magnitude 3 4 quantifying the relative contribution of climate and land use change the relative effects of climate and land use changes on bw and gw are quantified using an approach similar to the one applied by guo et al 2016 li et al 2015 li et al 2014 and li et al 2012 application of this approach involves the following two assumptions i climate and land use changes are the sole factors affecting the spatio temporal trend of bw gw and ii impacts of climate and land use change on bw and gw are independent to be consistent with these assumptions the two model configurations must be mutually exclusive not calibrating the second configuration variable climate steady land use rather constructing it simply based on the calibrated parameters of the first configuration variable climate variable land use would make the second fully dependent on the first turning the above assumptions invalid based on the outputs from the first model configuration involving variable climate variable land use the difference in annual values of bw and gw between two discrete time periods can be expressed by equations 2 and 3 2 δ bw bw 2014 bw 1935 3 δ gw gw 2014 gw 1935 where subscripts 1935 and 2014 represent the annual values for bw and gw given by the ts trend line corresponding to the initial 1935 and final 2014 year of comparison δbw and δgw are the respective differences between 1935 and 2014 in response to both climate and land use changes first model configuration likewise equations 4 and 5 can be used with outputs from the second model configuration variable climate steady land use to obtain the change in annual bw and gw resulted from climate change only δ bw c and δ gw c 4 δ bw c bw 2014 bw 1935 5 δ gw c gw 2014 gw 1935 where bw and gw represent the corresponding annual bw and gw values given by the ts trend line under the second configuration by subtracting the second configuration equations 4 and 5 from the first one equations 2 and 3 change in bw and gw due to land use change δ bw l and δ gw l can be obtained as the following 6 δ bw l δ bw δ bw c 7 δ gw l δ gw δ gw c then the change ratios are defined representing the relative effect of climate and land use changes as described by equations 8 and 9 8 bw c δ bw c δ bw and bw l δ bw l δ bw 9 gw c δ gw c δ gw and gw l δ gw l δ gw where bwc gwc and bwl gwl give the relative effect on blue water green water due to climate and land use change respectively 4 results in this section a general assessment of climate and land use change in orb is first presented based on past climate records and land use databases during the 80 year study period 1935 2014 after the evaluation of calibrated model performances against observed streamflow data trend of changes in bw and gw from the first modeling configuration variable climate variable land use are presented at the sub basin regional and basin level finally the relative contribution of climate and land use change on bw and gw is evaluated based on the second modeling configuration variable climate steady land use the dominant land use in orb during 1940s was agriculture covering 55 of the total basin area while forest and urban area constituted 35 and 7 respectively fig 2 in the following decades both forest and urban land uses increased by partially replacing agricultural areas the forest cover has significantly increased in the upper region more specifically the northeast part of the basin by 2010 forest and urban areas were covering 51 and 10 of the total basin area respectively thereby reducing the agricultural land use from 55 to 37 the increase in urban area by 3 was much less compared to the change in forest area which increased by 16 based on the mk ts test results annual precipitation increased by 78 mm in 2014 which is about 8 higher than the precipitation in 1935 fig 3 nevertheless prominent fluctuations from the trend line fig 3 a throughout the study period are indicative of persistent climate variability in orb fig 3 b shows a statistically insignificant decreasing trend of pet across orb in this case pet is calculated with swat s built in penman monteith equation neitsch et al 2011 using all the relevant energy related weather inputs including air temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity annual maximum temperature dropped by 1 c and the annual minimum temperature increased by 0 4 c indicating a trend of cooler days and warmer nights fig 3 c as a result of the opposing trends in the maximum and minimum temperature no clear trend is visible in average temperature it is well accepted that the statistical trend of a hydro climatologic time series depends on the length of data that is included in the test looking only at a specific span of time may create a different impression contrary to what would have been identified from a much longer time series from this aspect using 80 years of data is rather indicative of the analytical strength to capture hydrologic changes more realistically contrary to the previous studies that are based on much shorter time spans table 1 fig 4 shows the change in annual precipitation in each sub basin by comparing the annual average in 1985 2014 to that in 1935 1964 in general precipitation has increased remarkably in majority of the sub basins which is analogous to the findings shown in fig 3 a increased precipitation amount is observed mostly in the northeast and northwest parts while a slight decrease is noticeable in the middle and southern parts current version of swat assigns the nearest climate station to each sub basin not an interpolation because the calculated change in precipitation is representative of an entire sub basin there can be abrupt differences in the change values among adjacent sub basins based on the spatial characterization of sub basin scale land use and precipitation changes the entire basin can be divided into three regions the upper region upstream middle region and lower region downstream accordingly fig 4 shows sub basins that have experienced change either in land use or precipitation or both the quantitative assessment of precipitation and land use change in orb as shown in table 2 validates the rationale for aforementioned regional sub divisions to ascertain that the calibrated swat models are representative of orb s geophysical characteristics simulated daily streamflow at three validation locations fig 1 are compared with usgs gauge data for the 80 year simulation period fig 5 it should be noted that the hydrographs presented in fig 5 correspond to the variable climate variable land use configuration asserting the credibility of the models to capture climate and land use change impacts the goodness of fit scores kge nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias expressed in units for both model configurations variable steady land use are summarized in table 3 separately for the calibration and validation phases regardless of calibration or validation kge and nse in daily simulation range from 0 38 to 0 85 with pbias from 20 to 1 fig 6 shows the goodness of the model in terms of seasonal and annual variability in streamflow where simulated average annual streamflow is found to have kge ranging from 0 69 to 0 82 in all the three validation locations table a 2 appendix a reports the optimized parameter values best estimates assessments of trends in bw gw are performed based on average annual swat outputs figs 7 and 8 shows trend analyses results for bw gw for each of the 125 sub basins featuring the combined effects of climate and land use such spatially explicit assessment helps to relate changes in bw gw with their corresponding driving factors at the sub basin level fig 9 presents the trend results for the three regions separately upper middle and lower while fig 10 shows the same when analyzed at the entire basin scale significant or very significant increases in both bw and gw trends are found in the lower region for the basin as a whole the amount of both bw and gw has increased during the study period however with different levels of statistical significance results from the ts test as summarized in table 4 show a basin average increase in bw by 35 5 mm although the trend of change mk test is found insignificant p 0 1 as estimated by the ts trend line basin average gw has changed very significantly p 0 01 with an increase of 64 5 mm in 2014 compared to that in 1935 5 discussion 5 1 characterizing historical changes in land use and climate any sub basin in orb experiencing change of land use such that the past dominant land use therein got shifted to another type is identified in fig 2 c and also in fig 4 although fig 2 d shows a basin level generic trend in orb with agricultural areas being converted into forest and urban areas that trend has all but ceased since the last two decades lytle 2010 accordingly there is evidence of continuous agricultural intensification in the lower downstream region especially due to growing interests for producing biofuel pastures in marginal lands e g rajib et al 2016a overall one third of orb experienced noticeable land use change over a span of 80 years most of which occurred in the northeast and southwest regions these temporal changes in land use practices are crucial for capturing bw gw dynamics more realistically which is not possible by considering only climate change in the hydrologic simulation because of the relatively small increase in urban areas compared to other land uses it is assumed that the effect of urbanization on basin scale hydrology is nominal increasing annual precipitation in orb indicates more availability of water albeit inter annual variability fig 3 a while precipitation is the supply of water potential evapotranspiration pet is the index of available energy that drives water back to atmosphere several studies have shown altered trends of solar radiation wild 2009 vapor pressure willett et al 2008 and wind speed mcvicar et al 2012 in different parts of the globe which are the key determinants of pet in addition to just air temperature therefore looking only into temperature might not provide a holistic perspective on the changing trend of atmospheric evaporative demand donohue et al 2010 hence the whole water balance donohue et al 2011 liu and mcvicar 2012 for orb a declining trend of pet is detected in fig 3 b which is supported by the declining wind speed observed in past several decades in the u s midwest pryor et al 2009 and also by the invariant average temperature trend in fig 3 c these results are often specific to the period of study which may be different from what could have been observed in a longer duration trend analysis for example rogers 2013 showed a cooling trend of average annual temperature 0 5 c century in the most parts of orb during 1895 2007 karl et al 1996 found the same over the period of 1900 1994 under the particular context of this study absence of noteworthy trends in average temperature and pet but a significant increasing trend of precipitation suggests that precipitation is the primary indicator of climate change in orb it is important to detect a characteristic spatial pattern of precipitation and land use changes across the basin so that a coherence can be established with the corresponding changes in bw gw both qualitatively and quantitatively the regional sub divisions presented in fig 4 are derived solely from such perspective in general land use change in both upper and lower regions of orb is substantial while the precipitation increase in the lower region is relatively greater than that in the upper region changes in land use and precipitation in the middle region are not as extensive as they are in the other two regions table 2 5 2 model evaluation reasonably good agreement with the observed streamflow data at seasonal and annual time scale as revealed by fig 6 shows the efficacy of simulated bw gw components to realistically capture the hydrologic responses all bw gw components are calculated here using the annual outputs that are originally simulated at daily time scale despite being computationally intensive daily calibration is preferred over monthly or annual calibration with an expectation of better constraining the model the calibrated daily streamflow hydrographs from swat match well with the observed data except for several high flow events this is analogous to findings from many past studies across different regions that report deficiency of the swat model in simulating extreme flow conditions e g daggupati et al 2016 rajib and merwade 2016 performance measures in the variable climate variable land use configuration are relatively better than the variable climate steady land use configuration for most of the stations table 3 thus demonstrating the effect of using representative land use in the model for each decade relatively higher pbias values in some locations can be partly attributed to the insufficient representation of precipitation dynamics in certain portions of orb the 112 weather stations though uniformly distributed over the 490 000 km2 basin area provide only one point input approximately for each 4500 km2 advanced remotely sensed gridded precipitation estimates are not suitable for this study because of their issues related to relatively short period of data availability and possible uncertainty compared to ground observations price et al 2014 regardless of the variable constant land use configurations or calibration validation persistence of apparently systematic and noticeably higher pbias in the forested region table 3 is most likely caused by the assumption of constant surface canopy resistance in pet calculation milly and dunne 2016 use of a coarse resolution dem 90 m could also be a factor in this case given the fact that much of the mid basin and upstream forested region of orb has high topographic variability these cause and effect evaluations are detectable from fig 5 where the simulated daily streamflow hydrograph in a validation location usgs 03025500 forested region with high topographic relief is prominently underperforming compared to another location usgs 03340500 representing flat agricultural landscape an obvious reason for large variability in pbias estimates across the basin or between two model configurations at the same station could be the sub optimality in streamflow only calibrations this problem can be addressed through a multi variable spatially distributed calibration scheme e g kunnath poovakka et al 2016 rajib et al 2016b regardless a high pbias value in a daily calibration can be significantly influenced by the biases in few events e g model not capturing the extreme peak flows even though the model performance is generally good overall the calibrated swat models developed in this study are able to reasonably capture the time response and total volume of fluxes with slight deficiency in some cases considering the complexity in 80 year daily simulation and simultaneous multi gauge optimization at such a large scale the calibration validation results can be considered satisfactory for long term land use climate change impact assessments according to the evaluation guidelines from swat developers moriasi et al 2007 2015a b the model performance shown here is comparable to various other large scale swat applications as well e g abbaspour et al 2015 daggupati et al 2015b 2016 faramarzi et al 2017 rajib and merwade 2017 5 3 spatio temporal dynamics of blue and green water 5 3 1 sub basin scale trend analyses sub basin level mk test results provide spatially explicit information on bw gw dynamics showing their respective trends of change and associated level of significance trends in gw are more pronounced because the number of sub basins showing significant changes in gw trends fig 8 is higher than that for bw trend fig 7 although figs 7 and 8 represent the combined effects of climate and land use an analogy with fig 4 reveals bw being affected more by the changes in precipitation while land use change being more influential on gw for example significant changes in gw p 0 01 either increasing or decreasing are noticeable in the sub basins with prominent land use change specifically 35 out of the 43 sub basins that experienced land use change fig 4 show very significant increasing trends in gw fig 8 for some of the sub basins in the southern portion of both the middle and upper regions where no significant land use change has been detected the decrease in precipitation is likely the main driver for decreasing gw amount similarly significant increasing trend in bw in the northwestern sub basins fig 7 can be related to the increase in precipitation because these sub basins did not experience change in land use however both increased precipitation and significant land use change might counteract each other causing bw to decrease or stay consistent this is the case for some of the sub basins in the northeastern part overall increase in precipitation has been contributing to the increasing trend of bw and gw in orb and vice versa although the extent of effect on gw trend is nominal on the contrary land use change in majority of the sub basins has been causing gw to increase but bw to decrease 5 3 2 regional and basin scale trend analyses the middle region shows the least change in bw gw trend fig 9 which can be related to the least impacted land use and precipitation pattern there fig 4 table 2 contrary to the other two regions bw is slightly decreasing in the middle region follwing the dereasing unaltered trend of precipitation over 78 of its area however land use change over 15 of its area has caused gw to increase but the trend is statistically insignificant the lower region shows the most significant change in the trends of both bw and gw in response to the pronounced change in both land use and climate similarly in conjunction with the prominent land use change in the upper region the gw amount has increased significantly p 0 1 the upper region also shows an increasing but insignificant trend in bw in response to relatively smaller changes in precipitation amount compared to that in the lower region table 2 while land use and climate change have different extent of influence on bw gw across three regions the trends in fig 10 showing comparatively more significant rate of increase in gw imply equal importance of land use change as a determinant of hydrologic regime for the whole basin and may be the u s midwest in general e g ahiablame et al 2017 rajib and merwade 2017 therefore studies looking only at climate change would provide partial information which may not be representative of reality 5 4 relative effect of climate and land use change the change in land use has caused more than 70 of the volumetric increment in gw across all three regions table 4 land use change alone has led to decreases in bw by 103 and 42 respectively in the upper and lower regions but it is the more pronounced effect of climate change i e precipitation given the context of this study which has resulted into a net positive change in bw the relatively consistent climate in the middle region i e unaltered decreasing precipitation in most parts table 2 is responsible for decrease in both bw and gw by 252 and 9 respectively but the change in land use though nominal ultimately resulted into net increase in gw there these quantitative assessments coupled with sub basin regional basin level trend analyses establish land use change as the controlling factor of gw in orb climate change can affect both bw and gw however with stronger influence on bw therefore if the hydrologic flux components of bw and gw are analyzed separately land use change can be found more responsible for changes in et and root zone soil water gw and climate change for water yield and deep aquifer recharge bw although zhao et al 2016 obtained nearly similar results showing land use gw and climate bw connectivity for another mid latitude basin in the asia pacific there is still not enough evidence to apporve this as a generic cause and effect relationship some of the previous studies e g abbaspour et al 2009 fu et al 2007 jha et al 2004 legesse et al 2003 van roosmalen et al 2009 have shown that both temperature and precipitation can be critical on bw gw however these findings are region specific and may not be analogous to orb because of the insignificant change in average temperature over the past 80 years fig 3 c slightly increasing minimum temperature in orb may still impact hydrologic responses in the northeastern part more specifically in terms of the volume and timing of snow melt thereby affecting the seasonal variability of runoff water yield e g paul et al 2017 however such seasonal aspects have not been analyzed in this study gradual lowering of pet limit fig 3 b has a decreasing effect on the actual et hence gw which might have been counteracted by the higher precipitation availability hence more water available for et even under the same pet limit paul et al 2017 besides these correlated hydro climatic processes a land use climate circular effect is possible too the apparent increase in transpiration from the expanding vegetation due to re forestation and agricultural intensification upper and lower region of orb respectively might have led to cooler day temperature and subsequent reduction in pet e g mueller et al 2016 fig 3 alternatively a staggering 65 mm increase in gw i e et and soil water in 2010s with respect to that in 1940s table 4 estimated by the ts trend line can also be linked with the notable rise of dew point temperature observed across the u s midwest over the last century brown and degaetano 2013 thus the increased et in orb might not be causing the temperature to soar but it is adding to the humidity affecting the timing intensity and spatial pattern of precipitation pertinent to the circular effect between climate and land use land cover co2 fertilization is another important factor that needs attention it is a well established fact that atmospheric co2 has increased substantially over the past century with minimal change in vapor pressure deficit which is likely in orb as indicated by the trends in temperature and pet fig 3 increase in co2 can cause co2 fertilization by raising the water use efficiency in photosynthesis process e g donohue et al 2013 2017 if there is no change in climate land use this extra efficiency could ideally cause photosynthesis to increase while transpiration stays constant or photosynthesis would remain constant while transpiration declines in orb increase in gw outpaced bw in the forested middle upper regions table 4 thus a profound indication from this study is that higher precipitation and afforestation have caused increase in the amount of transpiration while elevated co2 concentration might have been enhancing the vegetative productivity in the forests through co2 fertilization this is analogous to the recent findings for tropical forests yang et al 2016 and for many parts of the globe zhu et al 2016 another important attribute of this vegetation productivity is the increase in root depths in response to elevated co2 bond and midgley 2012 iversen 2010 which has profound implication on how vegetation evolves adapts over time and effects water balance via transpiration however changed extent of forested area must not be misinterpreted with the same meaning as the change in vegetative productivity although this study has considered varying land use climate over the 80 year study period in one of the configurations all simulations are conducted assuming a constant co2 concentration in this way swat only simulates annual growth cycles of particular vegetation types following an optimal leaf area development curve which basically ignores the long term co2 fertilization effect such limitation might have imparted some inaccuracies in the results especially in the forested sub basins 5 5 implications of a changing hydrologic regime implications of altered bw gw dynamics span beyond just water availability for example increase in bw essentially indicates a directly proportional increase of flooding potential in orb this is because water yield a component of bw is simulated as the amount of water leaving the landscape and becoming available in the main channel water yield surface runoff base flow lateral flow losses neitsch et al 2011 as deep aquifer recharge the other component of bw can only have a trifling change in the 80 year time span a basin average 35 5 mm increase of bw in table 4 essentially mean a 0 5 mm year increase in water yield however results for the lower region suggest much adverse situation with a statistically significant increasing rate of 1 mm year this means higher expectancy of flooding in the lower region whole state of indiana southeastern part of illinois and northwestern part of kentucky in current times and in near future even in case of a relatively low magnitude rainfall event on the contrary the middle and upper regions states of ohio west virginia and pennsylvania have relatively timid change in flooding potential as indicated by decreasing insignificant increasing trends in bw therein table 4 fig 9 such spatially explicit attribution of flood hazards supplements the findings from other relevant studies e g mallakpour and villarini 2015 the increased water yield or bw can also be responsible for higher sediment and nutrient runoff thus worsening the surface water quality pryor et al 2014 local governments would require more investments to prevent increasing threats of contamination and protection of water resources in such contexts change in gw in orb provides a unique example of human influence on climate change due to the elevated et i e gw from the increased extent of agriculture and forested landscape respectively in the lower and upper regions frequent summer droughts are becoming more likely even with precipitation quantity that is slightly less than the average usepa 2016 accordingly this might cause reduced crop yield unless additional supply can be allocated for irrigation water higher irrigation demand or lower crop yield means more trade off complexity in the food energy water nexus while these are some of the plausible implications of a changing hydrologic regime that can be inferred from the outcomes of this study model configurations developed here retain their value to be reused in more exhaustive impact assessments 5 6 limitations of the study the following discussion acknowledges some of the limitations of this study 1 use of single hru for each sub basin limits finer resolution assessment on local level evolution of hydrologic fluxes detailed hru scale simulation would cost enormous computational resource and time for such a large scale model 2 the same spatial coverage of artificial subsurface tile drainage and the same draining techniques depth to drain spacing etc since 1935 are also gross approximations although effects of tile drainage over the long term annual volumetric change in bw and gw can be trivial 3 land use data for past years have agriculture or forest as generic classes without any spatially explicit detail on crop plant types use of cropland data layer cdl https nassgeodata gmu edu cropscape and associated management operations e g timing of crop planting harvest fertilization irrigation etc could be an option enabling better representation of soil water and et by the model e g faramarzi et al 2009 however such data resources for orb are available only after year 2000 4 sub basin specific co2 level during 1935 2014 in the orb region is not explicitly known assumed co2 level spatially constant aerodynamic and canopy resistance terms in pet calculation have imparted some uncertainty in the model 5 reservoir operation is not considered due to the lack of storage release data over the entire 80 year study period to mitigate some of these limitations an uncertainty informed assessment showing a prediction range for the bw gw outputs e g faramarzi et al 2017 could be performed in a future study beside precipitation and or temperature spatial changes of wind speed solar radiation and humidity could also be the important indicators of climate change as such their effects on changing hydrologic processes need better understanding therefore additional multi variate spatial statistical analyses would potentially solidify the findings on changing hydrologic regime 6 conclusion this is the first study on 490 000 km2 ohio river basin orb a significant eco region in the united states enabling spatio temporal characterization of climate and land use change impacts on blue water bw and green water gw dynamics swat models are created under two different configurations in order to quantify the combined as well as the relative impacts of climate and land use change in altering the dynamics of bw and gw over an 80 year period 1935 2014 it should be noted that most of the past studies on bw gw dynamics have assumed constant land use although some of the studies have used variable land use in model simulations the relative influence of climate and land use change on bw gw dynamics have not been quantified the current study overcomes these limitations by incorporating representative decadal land use data during 80 years of simulation and hence the modeling results are expected to be more representative of the actual hydrologic responses based on the statistical trend analyses of modeled outputs at three different spatial scales the entire basin 3 sub regions and each of the 125 sub basins following conclusions can be drawn 1 increased precipitation and re forestation are found as the dominant indicators of climate and land use change in orb while changes in precipitation and land use are evident in the upper and lower regions during the 80 years of study the middle region is relatively least impacted 2 between 1935 and 2014 the changing climate and land use have increased both bw and gw across the basin although change magnitude of gw is twice the magnitude of bw the lower region exhibits maximum changes where the land use and climate changes have led to significant increasing trends in both bw and gw similarly the gw in upper region has increased significantly in response to land use change the amount of bw has also increased in the upper region but the trend is not significant which corresponds to the relatively smaller changes in precipitation amount in the upper region compared to that in the lower region the middle region shows the least changes in both bw and gw 3 based on the independent contribution of climate and land use a causal relationship is detected showing that land use change in orb generally exerts stronger influence on gw dynamics climate change affects both bw and gw but the effects are more pronounced on bw overall this study identifies the hotspots within the ohio river basin which have been experiencing major changes in bw gw dynamics in response to climate and land use changes sub basin scale attribution of land use and climate more specifically precipitation change impacts will provide valuable insights to the local stakeholders whereas regional and basin level assessments will help appropriate decision making on water resources management protection and restoration by both the regional watershed managers and the national policy makers relative impacts of climate and land use in changing the dynamics of bw and gw as quantified in this study will allow adopting mitigation measures in a more efficient and targeted way depending on whether climate change or land use change is the governing factor for a region of interest acknowledgements drs adnan rajib and
