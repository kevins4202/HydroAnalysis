9975,the impact of climate change on agriculture is projected to be more severe over the coming years due to changing intensity magnitude and distribution of precipitation soil water content atmospheric water vapor higher temperatures and thus larger evapotranspiration this will have significant consequences for irrigation requirements especially in semi arid area of southern europe which is recognised as a climate change hotspot since the total water use to satisfy agricultural demand is currently about 25 of total water withdrawal in europe and up to 80 in some mediterranean countries improvements in water management are needed to cope with worsening climate conditions although several crop models e g epic wofost ceres maize and hydrological models e g dream swat hydrus have been developed the call for developing models able to couple crop growth soil water balance and irrigation practices to assess agricultural water management both at local and regional scale is increasing in this work the simulation of evapotranspiration of applied water simetaw model is implemented in r programming language with two new versions able to estimate crop water consumption irrigation demand and scheduling at local simetaw r and regional scale simetaw gis platform using extensive climate and environmental geospatial datasets simetaw r was validated in ten experimental sites and simetaw gis performance in mediterranean countries was assessed by estimating the impact of climate change on maize wheat and wine grape water requirements in the past 1976 2005 and future climate conditions 2036 2065 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios results show that in mediterranean countries maize wheat and grape production will require on average about 13 16 and 10 more water respectively under future climate this represents a considerable challenge for water resources management especially with demand increasing in other sectors the tool showed great potential in estimating climate change impact on crop water consumption and irrigation requirements both at local and regional scale and offers new analytical skills for water resources management planners for improved decision making keywords crop water requirements evapotranspiration simetaw model spatial modeling water scarcity rcps 1 introduction climate change is one of the most important challenges in the 21st century the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc stated that climate related hazards will worsen in the coming decades with significant variations in the earth s climate ipcc et al 2013 ipcc et al 2018a rising greenhouse gas ghg concentration in the atmosphere is causing strong changes in the hydrological cycle ipcc 2014 kleidon and renner 2018 that are expected to intensify by the end of the century when high flood frequency and perennial drought may characterize large areas ipcc 2018b eea 2019 climate models foresee non uniform variation in global hydrological cycles an increase in annual precipitation is foreseen in northern europe whereas a strong reduction in the number of rainy days with a consequent higher risk of drought periods is predicted in central europe and mediterranean areas ipcc et al 2013 water scarcity is expected to increase worldwide and this trend will be exacerbated not only by climate change but also by demographic growth socio economic development increasing demand for raw materials and energy extension of residential centres as well as improvement of quality of life and technology brooks 2012 increasing competition for water resources threatening a sustainable balance between water demand and supply is expected to worsen water scarcity globally with the mediterranean expected to be a water scarcity hotspot giorgi 2006 oecd 2017 cramer et al 2018 agriculture is one of the most water demanding sectors in mediterranean countries the agricultural sector is responsible for about 70 of water withdrawal globally world bank 2017 at the european level it is about 25 with the percentage in central and western areas 27 being slightly higher than in eastern areas 21 fao 2016 this is much higher in southern europe and the mediterranean region where some countries stand out with extremely high values i e syria 88 morocco 87 egypt 86 and libya 83 climate adapt 2016 ferragina and canitano 2014 in some southern and eastern mediterranean countries ferragina and canitano 2014 reported water exploitation index wei values for several countries a wei 40 indicates water stress condition and they reported wei values of 99 in jordan 94 in egypt 86 in syria and 80 in israel this highlights a severe impact on renewable water resource exploitation and suggests a significant water management challenge under changing water and socio economic conditions the overexploitation of both surface and ground water resources requires further efforts to improve irrigation efficiency to compensate increases in crop water demand due to climate change and to identify strategies to sustain food security fader et al 2016 masia et al 2018 despite the high percentages of agricultural water use it is crucial to emphasize the water food nexus to explain the critical role of water to guarantee food security to supply the growing population to alleviate poverty and to stimulate the rural socio economic development ferragina and canitano 2014 world bank 2017 given the large irrigated areas in mediterranean regions and projected influence of climate change the development of models in the agricultural sector becomes essential to simulate current and expected future water requirements under different emissions scenarios climatic conditions and crop management regimes this can help farmers decision and policy makers to develop optimal strategies balancing economic growth and environmental sustainability i e water demand vs available resources although the number of crop models e g wofost van diepen et al

effort is needed to improve the simulation on the effect of irrigation management and practices both at local and regional scale this requires estimating the soil water balance and crop water consumption to determine irrigation demand crop growth and yield even though model coupling requires further development ahead siad et al 2019 there is an advantage of this approach for quantifying interactions among different elements in complex systems more specifically there is a growing need of coupled models that are able to estimate and forecast atmosphere soil water crop irrigation interactions at different temporal and spatial scales to improve water system management the simulation of evapotranspiration of applied water model simetaw model mancosu et al 2016 is used to estimate the daily reference well watered crop and actual evapotranspiration et o et c et a the evapotranspiration of applied water et aw an irrigation schedule and crop growth and yield for a specific site in this work simetaw was implemented using the r platform simetaw r to estimate crop consumption and irrigation requirements at local scale the new tool was then integrated into a gis spatial platform under r thus named simetaw gis which couples and processes different geospatial climate and environmental data and reiterates simulations over regional scales the aim of this paper is to introduce and demonstrate both new simetaw versions r and gis and to highlight their combined value for water resources planning and management under expected climate change conditions in the mediterranean region the definition of the abbreviations used in this work is shown in appendix 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 simetaw r and simetaw gis model description two new versions of simetaw mancosu et al 2016 are introduced described and tested in this work the new versions are able to perform at local i e site specific simetaw r and wider spatial scale simetaw gis fig 1 full details of the original simetaw model is found in mancosu et al 2016 the simetaw r modelling scheme designed for site specific applications was validated at ten experimental sites it was subsequently implemented for spatially distributed applications using gis libraries available in r within the spatial platform named simetaw gis fig 1 the spatial platform couples and automates interactions with large geodata sets of climate variables environmental conditions and agronomic practices to process the soil water balance for multiple years and pixels across regional and continental scales simetaw gis was tested by running regional simulation of water consumption and net water application in the mediterranean domain see cordex www cordex org domains region 12 mediterranean for the domain definition under past 1976 2005 and future 2036 2065 climate conditions under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios both versions were tested for grape maize and wheat simetaw r gis are daily crop soil water balance models developed to compute the reference evapotranspiration et o the crop evapotranspiration et c the actual evapotranspiration et a and the evapotranspiration of applied water et aw note that et o is the evapotranspiration from a virtual reference surface having known aerodynamic and canopy resistances and is based on an equation using data from a well designed and managed weather station surrounded by an extensive grass surface while the surface is virtual the equation was developed by comparing it with energy limited evapotranspiration from a well watered 12 cm tall cool season grass the crop evapotranspiration et c is the energy limited evapotranspiration from a large field of a well watered healthy crop that is experiencing little or no stress the et a is actual evapotranspiration which is what would be measured over a crop whether stressed or not the energy limited et c is calculated as et c et o k c where k c is the crop coefficient the actual et a is calculated as et a et c k s where k s is the stress coefficient note that k s 0 00 when there is no et and k s 1 00 when there is no et reducing stress and et a et c in addition the actual et a is calculated as et a et o k c k s et o k a where k a is the actual coefficient the et of applied water et aw is an estimate of how much water from the irrigation of a crop contributes to the crop evapotranspiration during a season it does not include water from other sources like preseason stored soil water in season effective rainfall seepage from levees or water from water tables once the et aw is estimated the required water diversion for irrigation can be assessed by dividing the et aw by the irrigation system distribution uniformity du assuming that the low quarter 1 1 the low quarter water application is the mean irrigation applied to the quarter which receives the least amount of water while the high quarter water application is the mean depth of water applied to the quarter which receives the largest quantity of water the second and the third quarters water application are the mean depths of water applied to the intermediate quarters mancosu et al 2016 mancosu et al 2016 is refilled at each irrigation the et aw is calculated as 1 et aw i 1 n na i cet c ce spg ce r sw where i 1 n n a i is the sum of the net applications i e depths applied to the low quarter of the field cet c is the

soil water simetaw estimates the amount of water required by irrigated crops schedules the number of irrigation events and the net amount of water to be applied per each event net application na the simetaw model was improved by integrating into simetaw r and gis program the computation of the reference evapotranspiration et o daily et o is estimated with three alternative methods i the original equation from hargreaves and samani 1985 et o hs ii the modified hs equation samani 2000 and iii standardized reference evapotranspiration equation for short canopies et o pm allen et al 1998 2005

2 ms 1 one of the most relevant characteristics of the model is that it computes the seasonal crop coefficient k c trend using inflection points identified as a percentage of the growing season and daily k c values at the beginning of the season midseason and at the end of late season to define the seasonal crop coefficient changes this allows users to easily define the daily crop coefficients they need by changing the starting and ending of the growing season dates simetaw allows for adjustment of the midseason k c kc mid as a function of the local climate as 3 k cmid k ctab 0 261 et 0 7 3

higher k cmid in a climate with et o 7 3 in a climate with et o 7 3 mm day 1 a lower k cmid is expected the allowable depletion ad i e the amount of available water which corresponds to the yield threshold depletion is a default value in the model equal to 50 of the plant available water the model also estimates the soil water depletion swd fc swc where fc is the soil field capacity and swc is

the computation of mad is essential to define irrigation scheduling mad is the amount of water that can be depleted between water irrigation applications without incurring water deficit it is considered as the water amount necessary to refill the soil to field capacity net application na mm the model computes the evapotranspiration of the applied water et aw mm i e the sum of the net irrigation application na at the end of the initial growth period only 10 of soil is covered by the crop during this growth stage the crop evaporation is considered equal to the soil evaporation

period i e from planting to 10 ground shading which is stage a to b of the growing season and d e the number of water applications during this time frame it is assumed that the et from a crop having less than 10 ground shading is equal to bare soil evaporation the k e is computed as 6 k e 2 54 cet 0 where 2 54 represents a typical soil hydraulic factor and cet o is the cumulative et o from

threshold depletion during the off season simetaw and simetaw r estimate the yield losses at a specific site considering that the irrigation in the field is not uniform see mancosu et al 2016 while in simetaw gis the yield losses at regional scale is computed following steduto et al 2009 13 1 y a y m k y 1 et a et c where y a is the actual crop yield y m the maximum expected crop yield and k y the yield response factor this equation explains the link between water use and crop yield and shows how yield losses relate to a reduction in evapotranspiration further details of the original simetaw model are found in mancosu et al 2016 2 2 simetaw r validation and simetaw gis application 2 2 1 simetaw r validation simetaw r was validated at ten european sites table 1 selected through the international fluxnet network fluxnet https fluxnet org model performance was assessed by comparing actual evapotranspiration simulated by the model and the latent heat flux le measured through the eddy covariance technique in each site le was converted from w m 2 to mj m 2 d 1 using the conversion factor of 0 0864 and from mj m 2 d 1 to mm d 1 using the conversion factor of 0 408 maize wheat and grape crop water consumption were estimated for each stage of the growing season and under different soil and climatic characteristics relative to each site eddy covariance fluxes and climate data for each site were provided by meteorological radiometric and micrometeorological stations set up at each experimental site in addition a questionnaire was circulated to collect information about crop and soil characteristics and irrigation practices additional supplementary information was obtained through a literature review pearson s coefficient r root mean square error rmse mean bias error mbe mean absolute error mba and index of agreement ai were used to evaluate the simetaw r performance in addition explained model performance was also considered by taking into account the percentage of gap filled observed data missing measured data were gap filled following falge et al 2001 days with less than 30 missing half hourly observations were acceptable for the model evaluation the flux energy budget closure ebc was used to assess half hour measured data reliability by plotting the ratio h le vs r n g where r n is the net radiation w m 2 g is the soil heat flux w m 2 h is the sensible heat flux w m 2 and le is the latent heat flux w m 2 measured data are considered reliable when the sum of h le is similar to rn g according to the literature baldocchi et al 1988 twine et al 2000 wilson et al 2002 an energy balance closure deviation of 20 30 is acceptable the residual of the energy balance was also computed as le rn g h to assess the quality of the half hourly measured data in addition simetaw r performance in assessing et o was evaluated for both hargreaves and samani et o hs and the standardized fao 56 penman monteith et o pm equations calculated using gridded datasets and observed daily climate data obtained for each site the e obs european high resolution gridded data set gridded observation climate data haylock et al 2008 and the cosmo clm rcm consortium for small scale modeling in climate model rockel et al 2008 forced by era interim reanalysis were used as climate gridded datasets for the comparison 2 2 2 climate data the simulations covered the mediterranean domain daily climate variables derived from the global circulation model cmcc med coupled model of atmosphere ocean sea ice with a focus on mediterranean region developed by the euro mediterranean center on climate change scoccimarro et al 2011 gualdi et al 2013 have been downscaled to a spatial resolution of 14 km with the regional climate model cosmo clm rcm these data were used to estimate daily et c et a and et aw at mediterranean scale for the baseline 1976 2005 and future 2036 2065 climate periods the climate representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios with projected radiative forcing for the future taylor et al 2012 were used for climate change projections the cosmo clm rcm forced by era interim reanalysis ei produced by ecmwf the european centre for medium range weather forecasts dee et al 2011 and the e obs data were used for assessing and validating et o for the past period ei data downscaled with cosmo clm rcm and e obs have a resolution of 14 and 21 km respectively e obs data are the result of the gridded interpolation of several meteorological stations over europe this dataset is known as the largest resolution of daily historical climate gridded dataset for europe hofstra et al 2009 2 2 3 soil and crop input data soil data were included as parameters in the soil water budget to compute et c et a and et aw the soil water holding capacity from the isric wise global data set of derived soil properties 5 min grid batjes 2000 database and the maximum soil depth from the hwsd v1 2 30 arc second raster harmonized world soil database wieder et al 2014 were used the spatial distribution of sowing and harvest dates for maize and wheat both under irrigated and rainfed conditions were obtained from the agmip agricultural model inter comparison and improvement project database elliott et al 2015 a netcdf file containing the mean grape bud break and harvest julian day jd was created mean values for the growing season stages were obtained from the literature and through the pep725 database pan european phenology project templ et al 2018 see appendix 2 three assumptions were made i the mean values are uniform within any country ii no differences in vitis vinifera varieties between countries and iii the dates are averaged among those found in the literature review see appendix 2 the countries for which bud break and harvest have been defined included those considering a grape producing area greater than 10 000 ha according to faostat faostat http www fao org faostat en data qc data and the availability of bud break and harvest data from literature and from pep725 database appendix 2 the maximum rooting depths suggested by the fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 allen et al 1998 are used for crop at maturity and scaled down for the other stages specifically the maximum rooting depths of 1 35 m maize 1 65 m winter wheat and 1 50 m wine grape were used the spam database spatial production allocation model from you et al 2014 was used to define the maize and wheat spatial distribution the spatial crop allocation was expressed in hectares both for irrigated and rainfed crops with a resolution of 5 min grape distribution was obtained from the mirca 2000 global data set of monthly irrigated and rainfed crop areas around the year 2000 database portmann et al 2010 2 2 4 crop management data the crops under investigation were not pre irrigated water applications did not occur during the initial growth stage the soil water depletion swd value at the beginning of simulations was predetermined by the soil water balance running for the offseason before the first crop growing season i e between end of the season and the leaf out a reduction of planted land during future was not considered and the water application percentage i e the percentage of full water application for the specific crop allocated for the crop growing season wap was set equal to 100 for irrigated crops the allowable depletion ad was set equal to 50 thus the yield threshold depletion ytd when irrigation was applied was equal to half of the plant available water paw the sprinkler irrigation method with a distribution uniformity du of 75 and an application rate ar of 3 2 mm h 1 was applied to run simulations for maize and irrigated wheat at mediterranean scale the drip method was chosen to simulate grape water consumption and the related net water applications in this case du and ar were set equal to 85 and 0 7 mm h 1 respectively the runoff was set equal to zero the use of neither pesticides nor fertilisers is considered the length of the growing season is assumed not to change in future the main model inputs and outputs and the used datasets with relative references are shown in appendix 3 3 results model performances are shown both at local and regional scale local simulations of et a are compared with observed le converted to et a section 3 1 1 at regional scale observed et o calculations are compared using gridded input data simulated by simetaw gis section 3 1 2 model validation is accomplished by estimating eta in the mediterranean domain section 3 2 3 1 simetaw r and gis model validation 3 1 1 simetaw r model performance in estimating actual evapotranspiration at local scale the simetaw r performances are showed in table 2 in general the model performance was good at all experimental sites the promising ability of the model to estimate crop water consumption is confirmed by a mean r equal to 0 80 which was statistically significant at each site p 0 001 furthermore the mean rmse is equal to 0 99 mm mean mbe to 0 36 mm mean mba to 0 77 mm and mean ai to 81 demonstrating high modelling performance for estimating et a table 2 in general the model tends to slightly overestimate et a the lowest and highest model overestimation of et a was observed for wine grape in it vda mbe 0 06 mm and it neg mbe 1 30 mm respectively the et a overestimation tendency was also reported in mancosu et al 2016 when fruit tree evapotranspiration was assessed the model underestimates the actual crop water consumption in ch oe2 fr lam 2006 2007 and nl dij sites during the rainfed season however best model performances are reported for the ch oe2 site where no le data were gap filled even if only years with less than 30 of missing half hourly le measured data were considered the amount of available meteorological data and le data affected model performance rmse was higher than 1 20 during each season in it bci site mainly due to both a short period with a high percentage of le gap filled data and energy balance closure table 2 in general the highest rmse values have a lower energy balance closure table 2 some differences between measured and modelled data were attributed to rainy conditions during le measurements that can reduce sensor accuracy when measuring le fluxes burba 2013 even after quality check controls are performed in this work the energy balance closure from available half hourly data of missing data is shown in table 2 was acceptable with the mean slope of 0 75 and with the mean r 2 equal to 81 showing a good reliability of the eddy covariance measured data in addition the measured data accuracy is shown by a mean r of 0 84 between le and le the statistics in table 2 indicate that the simetaw r model fits the observed data reasonably well and could be used for predictive analysis for agricultural water management purposes 3 1 2 simetaw gis model performance in estimating reference evapotranspiration at regional scale the penman monteith pm method generally performs better than hargreaves samani hs for computing et o table 3 unlike ei the eobs provides fewer climate variables sufficient to parameterize the hs method alone both hs and pm method can be implemented with ei correlation values higher than 0 80 were computed by comparing gridded pm estimates of et o using ei data against observations in almost all sites located in northern europe the best correlations for hs and pm were obtained for crops with longer growing seasons as these data sets tend to have more pronounced seasonal et o variation which reduces ratio between data noise and variation in ch oe2 fr gri 2005 2006 de geb 2006 2007 and be lon 2004 2005 sites a correlation higher than 0 80 was observed considering results with the hs and pm equations using both climate datasets at these sites model accuracy was confirmed by an index of agreement higher than 85 as observed by other authors allen et al 1998 temesgen et al 1999 droogers and allen 2002 martinez cob and tejero juste 2004 alexandris et al 2008 de sousa lima et al 2013 an overestimation of et o with hs was noticed at sites characterized by high humidity klingenberg grignon oensingen characterized by more rainy days based on this finding the et o pm was used for regional et a simulations section 3 2 3 2 simetaw gis application at mediterranean scale simetaw gis model was applied to estimate et c et a yield and irrigation requirements for maize grape and wheat in the mediterranean domain for the baseline 1976 2006 and future period 2036 2065 under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 climate scenarios 3 2 1 climate projections for precipitation the most severe impact of climate change on precipitation in mediterranean countries is expected under rcp 8 5 table 4 historically highest precipitation occurred in the balkan countries with a peak of 1441 mm in montenegro the lowest precipitation occurred in libya egypt and israel table 4 under climate change conditions a precipitation reduction higher than 15 was estimated in algeria greece morocco and tunisia under both rcps and in libya under rcp 8 5 the lowest precipitation decrease is expected to occur in france and israel under rcp 8 5 and in cyprus under rcp 4 5 pcp reduction 1 no changes are projected in egypt under rcp 4 5 in the other mediterranean countries precipitation reduction ranged from 1 to 14 in some countries i e croatia egypt france and slovenia with rcp 8 5 israel and syria with rcp 4 5 the projected cumulated precipitation values are higher than in the baseline period table 4 3 2 2 impact of climate change on crop water consumption and irrigation requirement regional baseline values for maize grape and wheat et c et a and et aw are shown in fig 2 for the mediterranean domain and discussed for each crop in the next sub sections the estimated actual evapotranspiration fig 2b e h is lower than the crop water consumption fig 2a d and g highlighting a

maximum rooting depth conditions and management practices i e assumptions about 1 the percentage of full water allocation applied 2 planted area 3 irrigation system and 4 allowable depletion 3 2 2 1 maize the mediterranean region baseline crop evapotranspiration estimated for maize under optimal water supply on a country average varied in a range from 533 mm morocco to 893 mm algeria fig 2a under climate change an overall increase of et c was foreseen high rates of change increase of 5 6 were observed in most balkan countries the most severe impact of climate change was found in italy where future maize water consumption increase under both rcps by about 7 8 fig 4e in general the largest changes were estimated under rcp8 5 except for spain and syria slight differences between the two climate scenarios were estimated the trend of et a is the same as et c but due to stress conditions the values estimated for et a in 2036 2065 were slightly lower than et c 1 2 fig 4a b e the evapotranspiration of applied water et aw within the baseline period ranged from 210 mm slovenia to 769 mm algeria fig 2c in most countries the changes in et aw follow the precipitation variability under the two scenarios table 4 a future increase in irrigation demand was observed in all mediterranean countries with peaks of 25 28 found in france italy slovenia and montenegro the lowest increase of crop water demand 1 6 was estimated under rcp4 5 in algeria israel egypt lebanon syria and turkey irrigation demand was expected to increase by about 14 17 in morocco spain croatia and albania fig 4c d e despite maize being irrigated both during baseline and future periods water applications were not completely adequate to fully satisfy crop water needs causing a limited water stress which led to yield losses figs 3 and 4e the highest difference of yield losses between future and past values were estimated in france italy slovenia bosnia and herzegovina and montenegro the lowest changes were estimated in turkey rcp 4 5 and syria both rcps maize production was found to be higher i e lower losses under climate change in algeria israel rcp 8 5 and morocco rcp 4 5 fig 4e in general a trend of maize yield reduction is in line with giannakopoulos et al 2005 gallo 2015 and tubiello et al 2000 the impact of climate change on future et c et a and et aw for maize in the mediterranean countries under both rcps is expected to be on average about 4 3 and 13 higher than the baseline respectively the trend for increasing maize water requirement from northern to southern italy under both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios is in line with gallo 2015 an increase between 7 and 9 of maize irrigation requirement under the 5 c climate trajectory was estimated by fader et al 2016 in mediterranean countries furthermore an increase of maize et aw of 35 was found by kapur et al 2007 under climate change conditions lower change increase of 5 was estimated by mancosu 2013 for maize cultivated in sardinia italy increasing irrigation needs of spring summer crops were also projected by lovelli et al 2010 3 2 2 2 grape the largest mean crop water consumption in the baseline was estimated for turkey 888 mm while the lowest for slovenia 570 mm values between 700 and 800 mm were found in spain and greece and between 600 mm and 700 mm in all other mediterranean countries fig 2d under future climate change conditions a slight increase 3 of crop evapotranspiration was expected in the mediterranean countries with peaks about 6 in france and italy under the rcp 4 5 scenario the crop water consumption estimated under rcp 8 5 was slightly lower 0 70 on average than under rcp 4 5 in france croatia italy slovenia spain and turkey during the baseline the spatial trend of et a mostly followed that estimated for et c fig 2e although actual grape water consumption is expected to rise in all countries under climate change conditions it is still lower than full crop water requirements optimal water irrigation supply except for turkey where no relevant difference was found a negative trend was shown in tunisia where the et a values were about 4 lower than in the baseline fig 5e the highest yield reduction occurs in greece 19 and morocco and spain 10 whereas the lowest were in italy and croatia 1 fig 3 no changes between future and past yield losses were observed in turkey under both rcps and slovenia under rcp 8 5 under rcp 4 5 the yield losses in morocco and slovenia are slightly lower than during the baseline about 2 3 the peak of future yield reduction is projected for tunisia under both rcps with losses increasing by up to 51 rcp 4 5 using different meteorological gridded input data moriondo et al 2011 projected a decrease in future yield in tuscany italy ferrise et al 2016 attribute the negative impact of increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation on grape yield in the mediterranean basin to shorter phenological growth

tunisia and spain where values between 400 mm and 500 mm are reported lower values 400 500 mm occur in italy algeria france croatia and morocco fig 2f in general the grape irrigation demand et aw followed precipitation patterns table 4 the largest increase of irrigation requirement under both rcps is expected in france about 19 and italy about 15 followed by slovenia croatia and spain about 11 changes no higher than about 6 are predicted for tunisia greece and turkey fig 5c e a focus on the mediterranean countries shows a mean et aw value about 10 higher in the future under both rcps although grape is usually cultivated under rainfed conditions in sardinia region the et aw is expected to increase by about 6 with climate change mancosu 2013 3 2 2 3 irrigated wheat although wheat is generally cultivated under rainfed conditions there are some irrigated areas in the mediterranean basin the trend of wheat evapotranspiration for the baseline period estimated in this work is in line with saadi et al 2014 even if two different approaches were adopted mediterranean country yield losses are estimated as the difference between et c and et a values losses up to 40 are shown for cyprus and lebanon during the baseline period fig 3 under climate change the highest difference between future and past climate are estimated for albania france montenegro and spain ya yc 20 while lower losses are predicted in egypt both rcps and israel rcp 4 5 these trends are in line with saadi et al 2014 and in contrast with moriondo et al 2011 who project an increase for non irrigated winter wheat yield in the same area in this analysis et c values ranged from 409 to 631 mm fig 2g where the lowest and the highest values are 100 mm higher and 233 mm lower respectively than the values estimated by saadi et al 2014 the highest mean difference of wheat water consumption is estimated for morocco increase of about 4 under both rcps negative et c rate of change values are expected in albania libya and tunisia under both rcps and in egypt france slovenia and spain under rcp 8 5 in these countries the et c values predicted under future climate conditions are lower than the ones estimated in the baseline fig 6a b e in the baseline et a values range from 525 mm italy to 277 mm cyprus fig 2h in several countries fig 6a b e under climate change conditions the values of et a increased in relation to the baseline indeed negative changes between future and baseline et a values countries with peak of 5 and 4 are expected in albania under rcp 4 5 and in spain under rcp 8 5 fig 2i shows crop irrigation requirement values lower than 100 mm in albania france montenegro and spain the highest applied water demand in the baseline is reported for syria and turkey 304 mm irrigation demand under climate change is expected to slightly decrease in egypt under both rcps while in israel lebanon and syria only under rcp 4 5 a noticeable increase of about 40 46 wheat irrigation demand under climate change is projected for france spain montenegro and albania under rcp 4 5 as a result of slightly higher precipitation under rcp 8 5 compared to rcp 4 5 table 4 in the same countries lower et aw values were found under rcp 8 5 fig 6c and d the highest difference between the two climate scenarios arises in france 27 with the lowest in italy 0 2 considering a doubling of atmospheric co2 concentration wheat et a values are expected to decrease by about 28 cgm2 data 8 rcm data in the period 2070 2079 in turkey according to yano et al 2007 while increasing et c values are projected in this work decreasing et c in no stress conditions are reported in saadi et al 2014 and supit et al 2010 they attribute the change in et c to a shorter growing season the negative impact of climate change i e the increase of wheat net water application is in agreement with other studies tubiello et al 2000 yano et al 2007 özdoğan 2011 saadi et al 2014 valizadeh et al 2014 lovelli et al 2010 project increasing et aw for spring summer crops but no significant increase in et aw for autumn winter crops in southern italy around 2070 4 discussion the findings show an overall reduction of projected precipitation in southern mediterranean countries which in line with keuler et al 2016 is in general greater under rcp 8 5 the simulated reference crop and actual evapotranspiration as well as irrigation requirement are projected to increase under future climate conditions and often differences between future and past climate conditions are greater under the rcp 4 5 scenario on average the maize and grape crop water consumption in the mediterranean countries is expected to increase on average about 3 4 under both rcps with the most consistent increases in italy about 7 under both rcps and in france about 6 under rcp 4 5 lower values are projected for wheat which is expected to consume on average about 0 5 more under climate change conditions with peak of about 4 in morocco generally under both rcps the rate of change of maize wheat and grape water consumption under deficit water and non optimal pedo climatic conditions et a are on average lower than in well watered conditions in mediterranean countries maize wheat and grape production will require on average about 13 16 and 10 more applied water under climate change conditions respectively the amount of water applied to satisfy grape needs in the future decades is higher in relevant wine producing countries such as france about 19 italy 15 and spain 11 than in other mediterranean countries rates of change are particularly high in the southern part of these countries fig 5c and d where conflicts on water use and less favorable conditions could lead to impact on crop productivity the lowest impact of climate change on grape irrigation demand is expected in turkey tunisia and greece increase of about 6 a future increase of applied water between about 20 29 is expected for maize production in bosnia and herzegovina france italy slovenia and montenegro due to reduced precipitation during 2036 2065 table 4 in france albania spain and morocco the wheat irrigation is estimated to increase under climate change by more than about 40 under rcp 4 5 in general egypt israel and lebanon show the least change for maize water needs et aw increase about 3 under both rcps whereas the lowest wheat water applications are needed in cyprus egypt israel libya and syria 2 et aw 0 under rcp 4 5 although irrigation application is practiced the et a estimated was in general lower than et c due to the pedoclimatic conditions and management practices assumed in this work assuming no changes in input data actual evapotranspiration values may increase changing the frequency and number of irrigation events ad 50 this management strategy can reduce water stress but increase water demand therefore increasing et a which in turn reduces yield losses it is worth noting that in this case much water may be applied for the crop growth and an environmental economic analysis could help in achieving the best balance between the impact on water resources and yield losses in addition the price of water should be considered since it impacts farm business this work is in line with several studies investigating crop water consumption and irrigation requirements using models at different scales and at different resolutions and considering different scenarios keeping a focus on mediterranean irrigated agriculture this study agrees with an expected increase in crop water needs due to increasing drought risk which is expected to characterize southern countries in the near future rodriguez diaz et al 2007 saadi et al 2014 tanasijevic et al 2014 fader et al 2015 fader at al 2016 irrigation practices are exacerbated in mediterranean regions due to the projected warmer and drier summer months when the amount of agricultural water is constrained due to other sectors water needs tourism is a critical economic sector but also demands considerable drinking water and water for leisure facilities leading to increased conflicts among sectors for water use uncontrolled water abstraction may exacerbate the water security issues by creating imbalances between water supply and demand collins 2009 such inter sectoral water related issues could hamper efforts throughout the region in achieving sustainable development goals sdg 6 ambitions this work further highlights the potential severity of increases in water related issues in the mediterranean related to both expected supply decline and demand increase unfortunately in this region water security challenges are not the only issue to be confronted regarding agricultural production this work has shown widespread crop yield declines throughout the mediterranean area resulting from water shortages especially for food supply crops such as maize and wheat despite the crops being irrigated the study shows that water applications are inadequate to fully satisfy crop water needs resulting in a stress coefficient k s 1 and consequent crop yield reductions in mediterranean countries the beneficial effect of future increasing atmospheric co2 concentration on yield losses is more evident on grape and wheat with yield losses limited to about 8 while for maize yield losses can reach about 13 grape yield losses are possibly related to increasing temperature effects on the length of the growing season ferrise et al 2016 although c3 plants i e wheat and grape may benefit from increasing levels of atmospheric co2 due to their physiology patterson et al 1984 cure and acock 1986 this positive effect may be threatened by other factors such as the changes in precipitation frequency and intensity which can lead to negative effects on crop production ipcc 2007 particularly in areas where water resources are scarce in the near future non irrigated crop production in southern europe is expected to decrease by about 50 and this may lead to climate change induced crop abandonment eea 2019 decreases in crop yield and the abandonment of productive land could threaten local regional and european food security which led to the global challenge to achieve the sdg 2 in the mediterranean basin sdsn 2019 furthermore unsustainable agriculture may lead to an increase in food imports with a consequent increase in food prices and food supply vulnerability it can cause lower and or less stable income for farmers with an unavoidable impact on the agricultural sector taken together the potential for agricultural water demand leading to increased water competition and threats to water supply and the expected decreases in crop yields partly due to water and climate impacts strongly suggest that increasing the resilience of agricultural sector to extreme events in mediterranean countries is a critical priority from local to european governments in terms of managing water consumption sdg 6 while also maintaining crop production sdg 2 the first step to cope with these issues is to increase knowledge about the water consumption and irrigation requirements of mediterranean crops to better manage water resources as well as better understanding of yield declines particularly in regions already largely affected by water scarcity and a multitude of water demanding sectors this study further contributes to such knowledge although the adaptation of the agricultural sector to climate change is progressing the process needs to be accelerated policies targeted to facilitate and speed up this transition at different time and spatial scales should be addressed by decision makers faster and better eea 2019 some limitations in this study will be addressed in future work such as i changes in crop breeding new cultural practices and technologies and shifts in sowing bud break and harvest date which may have an impact on crop adaptation to climate change conditions ii changes in the percentage of cultivated areas due to climate or anthropogenic factors iii evaluation of more crops under several water management scenarios iv availability of higher resolution input gridded data to include more details in the outcomes at mediterranean scale and v use of climate models ensemble to reduce result uncertainties and model biases 5 conclusions in this work two new versions of the simulation of evapotranspiration of applied water simetaw model are introduced simetaw was implemented in r to allow crop water consumption and irrigation demand estimations both at local simetaw r and regional scale simetaw gis according to different implementation objectives and stakeholder s needs simetaw r validation was carried out in ten experimental sites while simetaw gis simulation was assessed in mediterranean countries by estimating the impact of climate change on maize wheat and grape water consumption and irrigation requirements for the baseline 1976 2005 and the future climate conditions 2036 2065 under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios simetaw r performed well at the local level estimated increases in crop water needs under future climate conditions in mediterranean countries are predicted irrigation demand increases were often greater under rcp 4 5 than 8 5 scenario crop yields are expected to decline in many southern mediterranean countries the increased water demand and decreasing crop yields pose dual challenges for local to european agricultural policy regarding efforts towards achieving targets in sdg2 and sdg6 the simetaw r model outcomes at local scale as well as the simetaw gis platform gridded outcomes at regional scale contribute to increase awareness on climate change issues regarding crop water consumption and irrigation requirements and agricultural production in mediterranean regions to tackle climate change impact on the agricultural sector adaptation strategies should be developed supported and implemented in view of the rapid demographic growth and the consequent food security issue it is necessary to cope with climate change through strategies targeted to achieve sustainable agricultural production in this context this study adds useful information to better inform such policy decisions surrounding agricultural practices and crop water management both at local

9975,the impact of climate change on agriculture is projected to be more severe over the coming years due to changing intensity magnitude and distribution of precipitation soil water content atmospheric water vapor higher temperatures and thus larger evapotranspiration this will have significant consequences for irrigation requirements especially in semi arid area of southern europe which is recognised as a climate change hotspot since the total water use to satisfy agricultural demand is currently about 25 of total water withdrawal in europe and up to 80 in some mediterranean countries improvements in water management are needed to cope with worsening climate conditions although several crop models e g epic wofost ceres maize and hydrological models e g dream swat hydrus have been developed the call for developing models able to couple crop growth soil water balance and irrigation practices to assess agricultural water management both at local and regional scale is

irrigation demand and scheduling at local simetaw r and regional scale simetaw gis platform using extensive climate and environmental geospatial datasets simetaw r was validated in ten experimental sites and simetaw gis performance in mediterranean countries was assessed by estimating the impact of climate change on maize wheat and wine grape water requirements in the past 1976 2005 and future climate conditions 2036 2065 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios results show that in mediterranean countries maize wheat and grape production will require on average about 13 16 and 10 more water respectively under future climate this represents a considerable challenge for water resources management especially with demand increasing in other sectors the tool showed great potential in estimating climate change impact on crop water consumption and irrigation requirements both at local and regional scale and offers new analytical skills for water resources management planners for improved decision making keywords crop water requirements evapotranspiration simetaw model spatial modeling water scarcity rcps 1 introduction climate change is one of the most important challenges in the 21st century the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc stated that climate related hazards will worsen in the coming decades with significant variations in the earth s climate ipcc et al

increase in annual precipitation is foreseen in northern europe whereas a strong reduction in the number of rainy days with a consequent higher risk of drought periods is predicted in central europe and mediterranean areas ipcc et al 2013 water scarcity is expected to increase worldwide and this trend will be exacerbated not only by climate change but also by demographic growth socio economic development increasing demand for raw materials and energy extension of residential centres as well as improvement of quality of life and technology brooks 2012 increasing competition for water

eastern mediterranean countries ferragina and canitano 2014 reported water exploitation index wei values for several countries a wei 40 indicates water stress condition and they reported wei values of 99 in jordan 94 in egypt 86 in syria and 80 in israel this highlights a severe impact on renewable water resource exploitation and suggests a significant water management challenge under changing water and socio economic conditions the overexploitation of both surface and ground water resources requires further efforts to improve irrigation efficiency to compensate increases in crop water demand due to climate change and to identify strategies to sustain food security fader et al 2016 masia et al 2018 despite the high percentages of agricultural water use it is crucial to emphasize the water food nexus to explain the critical role of water to guarantee food security to supply the growing population to alleviate poverty and to stimulate the rural socio economic development ferragina and canitano 2014 world bank 2017 given the large irrigated areas in mediterranean regions and projected influence of climate change the development of models in the agricultural sector becomes

effort is needed to improve the simulation on the effect of irrigation management and practices both at local and regional scale this requires estimating the soil water balance and crop water consumption to determine irrigation demand crop growth and yield even though model coupling requires further development ahead siad et al 2019 there is an advantage of this approach for quantifying interactions among different elements in complex systems more specifically there is a growing need of coupled models that are able to estimate and forecast atmosphere soil water crop irrigation

estimate the daily reference well watered crop and actual evapotranspiration et o et c et a the evapotranspiration of applied water et aw an irrigation schedule and crop growth and yield for a specific site in this work simetaw was implemented using the r platform simetaw r to estimate crop consumption and irrigation requirements at local scale the new tool was then integrated into a gis spatial platform under r thus named simetaw gis which couples and processes different geospatial climate and environmental data and reiterates simulations over regional scales the aim of this paper is to introduce and demonstrate both new simetaw versions r and gis and to highlight their combined value for water resources planning and management under expected climate change conditions in the mediterranean region the definition of the abbreviations used in this work is shown in appendix 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 simetaw r and simetaw gis model description two new versions of simetaw

the original simetaw model is found in mancosu et al 2016 the simetaw r modelling scheme designed for site specific applications was validated at ten experimental sites it was subsequently implemented for spatially distributed applications using gis libraries available in r within the spatial platform named simetaw gis fig 1 the spatial platform couples and automates interactions with large geodata sets of climate variables environmental conditions and agronomic practices to process the soil water balance for multiple years and pixels across regional and continental scales simetaw gis was tested by running regional simulation of water consumption and net water application in the mediterranean domain see cordex www cordex org domains region 12 mediterranean for the domain definition under past 1976 2005 and future 2036 2065 climate conditions under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios both versions were tested for grape maize and wheat simetaw r gis are daily crop soil water balance models developed to compute the reference evapotranspiration et o the crop evapotranspiration et c the actual evapotranspiration et a and the evapotranspiration of applied water et aw note that et o is the evapotranspiration from a virtual reference surface having known aerodynamic and canopy resistances and is based on an equation using data from a well designed and managed weather station surrounded by an extensive grass surface while the surface is virtual the equation was developed by comparing it with energy limited evapotranspiration from a well watered 12 cm tall cool season grass the crop evapotranspiration et c is the energy limited evapotranspiration from a large field of a well watered healthy crop that is experiencing little or no stress the et a is actual evapotranspiration which is what would be measured over a crop whether stressed or not the energy limited et c is calculated as et c et o k c where k c is the crop coefficient the actual et a is calculated as et a et c k s where k s is the stress coefficient note that k s 0 00 when there is no et and k s 1 00 when there is no et reducing stress and et a et c in addition the actual et a is calculated as et a et o k c k s et o k a where k a is the actual coefficient the et of applied water et aw is an estimate of how much water from the irrigation of a crop contributes to the crop evapotranspiration during a season it does not include water from other sources like preseason stored soil water in season effective rainfall seepage from levees or water from water tables once the et aw is estimated the required water diversion for irrigation can be assessed by dividing the et aw by the irrigation system distribution uniformity du assuming that the low quarter 1 1 the low quarter water application is the mean irrigation applied to the quarter which receives the least amount of water while the high quarter water application is the mean depth of water applied to the quarter which receives the largest quantity of water the second and the third quarters water application are the mean depths of water applied to the intermediate quarters mancosu et al 2016 mancosu et al 2016 is refilled at each

daily k c values at the beginning of the season midseason and at the end of late season to define the seasonal crop coefficient changes this allows users to easily define the daily crop coefficients

international fluxnet network fluxnet https fluxnet org model performance was assessed by comparing actual evapotranspiration simulated by the model and the latent heat flux le measured through the eddy covariance technique in each site le was converted from w m 2 to mj m 2 d 1 using the conversion factor of 0 0864 and from mj m 2 d 1 to mm d 1 using the conversion factor of 0 408 maize wheat and grape crop water consumption were estimated for each stage of the growing season and under different soil and climatic characteristics relative to each site eddy covariance fluxes and climate data for each site were provided by meteorological radiometric and micrometeorological stations set up at each experimental site in addition a questionnaire was circulated to collect information about crop and soil characteristics and irrigation practices additional supplementary information was obtained through a literature review pearson s coefficient r root mean square error rmse mean bias error mbe mean absolute error mba and index of agreement ai were used to evaluate the simetaw r performance in addition explained model performance was also considered by taking into account the percentage of gap filled observed data missing measured data were gap filled following falge et al 2001 days with less than 30 missing half hourly observations were acceptable for the model evaluation the flux energy budget closure ebc was used to assess half hour measured data reliability by plotting the ratio h le vs r n g where r n is the net radiation w m 2 g is the soil heat flux w m 2 h is the sensible heat flux w m 2 and le is the latent heat flux w m 2 measured data are considered reliable when the sum of h le is similar to rn g according to the literature baldocchi et al 1988 twine et al 2000 wilson et al 2002 an energy balance closure deviation of 20 30 is acceptable the residual of the energy balance was also computed as le rn g h to assess the quality of the half hourly measured data in addition simetaw r performance in assessing et o was evaluated for both hargreaves and samani et o hs and the standardized fao 56 penman monteith et o pm equations calculated using gridded datasets and observed daily climate data obtained for each site the e obs european high resolution gridded data set gridded observation climate data haylock et al 2008 and the cosmo clm rcm consortium

mediterranean domain daily climate variables derived from the global circulation model cmcc med coupled model of atmosphere ocean sea ice with a focus on mediterranean region developed by the euro mediterranean center on climate change scoccimarro et al 2011 gualdi et al 2013 have been downscaled to a spatial resolution of 14 km with the regional climate model cosmo clm rcm these data were used to estimate daily et c et a and et aw at mediterranean scale for the baseline 1976 2005 and future 2036 2065 climate periods the climate representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios

of 14 and 21 km respectively e obs data are the result of the gridded interpolation of several meteorological stations over europe this dataset is known as the largest resolution of daily historical climate gridded dataset for europe hofstra et al 2009 2 2 3 soil and crop input data soil data were included as parameters in the soil water budget to compute et c et a and et aw the soil water holding capacity from the isric wise global data set of derived soil properties 5 min grid batjes 2000 database and the maximum soil depth from the hwsd v1 2 30 arc second raster harmonized world soil database wieder et al 2014 were used the spatial distribution of sowing and harvest dates for maize and wheat both under irrigated and rainfed conditions were obtained from the agmip agricultural model inter comparison and improvement project database elliott et al 2015 a netcdf file containing the mean grape bud break and harvest julian day jd was created mean values for the growing season stages were obtained from the literature and through the pep725 database pan european phenology project templ et al 2018 see appendix 2 three assumptions were made i the mean values are uniform within any country ii no differences in vitis vinifera varieties between countries and iii the dates are averaged among those found in the literature review see appendix 2 the countries for which bud break

break and harvest data from literature and from pep725 database appendix 2 the maximum rooting depths suggested by the fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 allen et al 1998 are used for crop at maturity and scaled down for the other stages specifically the maximum rooting depths of 1 35 m maize 1 65 m winter wheat and 1 50 m wine grape were used the spam database spatial production allocation model from you et al 2014 was used to define the maize and wheat spatial distribution the spatial crop allocation was expressed in hectares both for irrigated and rainfed crops with a resolution of 5 min grape distribution was obtained from the mirca 2000 global data set of monthly irrigated and rainfed crop areas around the year 2000 database portmann et al 2010 2 2 4 crop management data the crops under investigation were not pre irrigated water applications did not occur during the initial growth stage the soil water depletion swd value at the beginning of simulations was predetermined by the soil water balance running for the offseason before the first crop growing season i e between end of the season and the leaf out a reduction of planted land during future was not considered and the water application percentage i e the percentage of full water application for the specific crop allocated for the crop growing season wap was set equal to 100 for irrigated crops the allowable depletion ad was set equal to 50 thus the yield threshold depletion ytd when irrigation was applied was equal to half of the plant available water paw the sprinkler irrigation method with a distribution uniformity du of 75 and an application rate ar of 3 2 mm h 1 was applied to run simulations for maize and irrigated wheat at mediterranean scale the drip method was chosen to simulate grape water consumption and the related net water applications in this case du and ar were set equal to 85 and 0 7 mm h 1 respectively the runoff was set equal to zero the use of neither pesticides nor fertilisers is considered the length of the growing season is assumed not to change in future the main model inputs and outputs and the used datasets with relative references are shown in appendix 3 3 results model performances are shown both at local and regional scale local simulations of et a are compared with observed le converted to et a section 3 1 1 at regional scale observed et o calculations are compared using gridded input data simulated by simetaw gis section 3 1 2 model validation is accomplished by estimating eta in the mediterranean domain section 3 2 3 1 simetaw r and gis model validation 3 1 1 simetaw r model performance in estimating actual evapotranspiration at local scale the simetaw r performances are showed in table 2 in general the model performance was good at all experimental sites the promising ability of the model to estimate crop water consumption is confirmed by a mean r equal to 0 80 which was statistically significant at each site p 0 001 furthermore the mean rmse is equal to 0 99 mm mean mbe to 0 36 mm mean mba to 0 77 mm and mean ai to 81 demonstrating high modelling performance for estimating et a table 2 in general the model tends to slightly overestimate et a the lowest and highest model overestimation of et a was observed for wine grape in it vda mbe 0 06 mm and it neg mbe 1 30 mm respectively the et a overestimation tendency was also reported in mancosu et al 2016 when fruit tree evapotranspiration was assessed the model underestimates the actual crop water consumption in ch oe2 fr lam 2006 2007 and nl dij sites during the rainfed season however best model performances are reported for the ch oe2 site where no le data were gap filled even if only years with less than 30 of missing half hourly le measured data were considered the amount of available meteorological data and le data affected model performance rmse was higher than 1 20 during each season in it bci site mainly due to both a short period with a high percentage of le gap filled data and energy balance closure table 2 in general the highest rmse values have a lower energy balance closure table 2 some differences between measured and modelled data were attributed to rainy conditions during le measurements that can reduce sensor accuracy when measuring le fluxes burba 2013 even after quality check controls are performed in this work the energy balance closure from available half hourly data of missing data is shown in table 2 was acceptable with the mean slope of 0 75 and with the mean r 2 equal to 81 showing a good reliability of the eddy covariance measured data in addition the measured data accuracy is shown by a mean r of 0 84 between le and le the statistics in table 2 indicate that the simetaw r model fits the observed data reasonably well and could be used for predictive analysis for agricultural water management purposes 3 1 2 simetaw gis model performance in estimating reference evapotranspiration at regional scale the penman monteith pm method generally performs better than hargreaves samani hs for computing et o table 3 unlike ei the eobs provides fewer climate variables sufficient to parameterize the hs method alone both hs and pm method can be implemented with ei correlation values higher than 0 80 were computed by comparing gridded pm estimates of et o using ei data against observations in almost all sites located in northern europe the best correlations for hs and pm were obtained for crops with longer growing seasons as these data sets tend to have more pronounced seasonal et o variation which reduces ratio between data noise and variation in ch oe2 fr gri 2005 2006 de geb 2006 2007 and be lon 2004 2005 sites a correlation higher than 0 80 was observed considering results with the hs and pm equations using both climate datasets at these sites model accuracy was confirmed by an index of agreement higher than 85 as observed by other authors allen et al 1998 temesgen et al 1999 droogers and allen 2002 martinez cob and tejero juste 2004 alexandris et al 2008 de sousa lima et al 2013 an overestimation of et o with hs was noticed at sites characterized by high humidity klingenberg grignon oensingen characterized by more rainy days based on this finding the et o pm was used for regional et a simulations section 3 2 3 2 simetaw gis application at mediterranean scale simetaw gis model was applied to estimate et c et a yield and irrigation requirements for maize grape and wheat in the mediterranean domain for the baseline 1976 2006 and future period 2036 2065 under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 climate scenarios 3 2 1 climate projections for precipitation the most severe impact of climate change on precipitation in mediterranean countries is expected under rcp 8 5 table 4 historically highest precipitation occurred in the balkan countries with a peak of 1441 mm in montenegro the lowest precipitation occurred in libya egypt and israel table 4 under climate change conditions a precipitation reduction higher than 15 was estimated in algeria greece morocco and tunisia under both rcps and in libya under rcp 8 5 the lowest precipitation decrease is expected to occur in france and israel under rcp 8 5 and in cyprus under rcp 4 5 pcp reduction 1 no changes are projected in egypt under rcp 4 5 in the other mediterranean countries precipitation reduction ranged from 1 to 14 in some countries i e croatia egypt france and slovenia with rcp 8 5 israel and syria with rcp 4 5 the projected cumulated precipitation values are higher than in the baseline period table 4 3 2 2 impact of climate change on crop water consumption and irrigation requirement regional baseline values for maize grape and wheat et c et a and et aw are shown in fig 2 for the mediterranean domain and discussed for each crop in the next sub sections the estimated actual evapotranspiration fig 2b e h is lower than the crop water consumption fig 2a d and g highlighting a

maximum rooting depth conditions and management practices i e assumptions about 1 the percentage of full water allocation applied 2 planted area 3 irrigation system and 4 allowable depletion 3 2 2 1 maize the mediterranean region baseline crop evapotranspiration estimated for maize under optimal water supply on a country average varied in a range from 533 mm morocco to 893 mm algeria fig 2a under climate change an overall increase of et c was foreseen high rates of change increase of 5 6 were observed in most balkan countries the most severe impact of climate change was found in italy where future maize water consumption increase under both rcps by about 7 8 fig 4e in general the largest changes were estimated under rcp8 5 except for spain and syria slight differences between the two climate scenarios were estimated the trend of et a is the same as et c but due to stress conditions the values estimated for et a in 2036 2065 were slightly lower than et c 1 2 fig 4a b e the evapotranspiration of applied water et aw within the baseline period ranged from 210 mm slovenia to 769 mm algeria fig 2c in most countries the changes in et aw follow the precipitation variability under the two scenarios table 4 a future increase in irrigation demand was observed in all mediterranean countries with peaks of 25 28 found in france italy slovenia and montenegro the lowest increase of crop water demand 1 6 was estimated under rcp4 5 in algeria israel egypt lebanon syria and turkey irrigation demand was expected to increase by about 14 17 in morocco spain croatia and albania fig 4c d e despite maize being irrigated both during baseline and future periods water applications were not completely adequate to fully satisfy crop water needs causing a limited water stress which led to yield losses figs 3 and 4e the highest difference of yield losses between future and past values were estimated in france italy slovenia bosnia and herzegovina and montenegro the lowest changes were estimated in turkey rcp 4 5 and syria both rcps maize production was found to be higher i e lower losses under climate change in algeria israel rcp 8 5 and morocco rcp 4 5 fig 4e in general a trend of maize yield reduction is in line with giannakopoulos et al 2005 gallo 2015 and tubiello et al 2000 the impact of climate change on future et c et a and et aw for maize in the mediterranean countries under both rcps is expected to be on average about 4 3 and 13 higher than the baseline respectively the trend for increasing maize water requirement from northern to southern italy under both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios is in line with gallo 2015 an increase between 7 and 9 of maize irrigation requirement under the 5 c climate trajectory was estimated by fader et al 2016 in mediterranean countries furthermore an increase of maize et aw of 35 was found by kapur et al 2007 under climate change conditions lower change increase of 5 was estimated by mancosu 2013 for maize cultivated in sardinia italy increasing irrigation needs of spring summer crops were also projected by lovelli et al 2010 3 2 2 2 grape the largest mean crop water consumption in the baseline was estimated for turkey 888 mm while the lowest for slovenia 570 mm values between 700 and 800 mm were found in spain and greece and between 600 mm and 700 mm in all other mediterranean countries fig 2d under future climate change conditions a slight increase 3 of crop evapotranspiration was expected in the mediterranean countries with peaks about 6 in france and italy under the rcp 4 5 scenario the crop water consumption estimated under rcp 8 5 was slightly lower 0 70 on average than under rcp 4 5 in france croatia italy slovenia spain and turkey during the baseline the spatial trend of et a mostly followed that estimated for et c fig 2e although actual grape water consumption is expected to rise in all countries under climate change conditions it is still lower than full crop water requirements optimal water irrigation supply except for turkey where no relevant difference was found a negative trend was shown in tunisia where the et a values were about 4 lower than in the baseline fig 5e the highest yield reduction occurs in greece 19 and morocco and spain 10 whereas the lowest were in italy and croatia 1 fig 3 no changes between future and past yield losses were observed in turkey under both rcps and slovenia under rcp 8 5 under rcp 4 5 the yield losses in morocco and slovenia are slightly lower than during the baseline about 2 3 the peak of future yield reduction is projected for tunisia under both rcps with losses increasing by up to 51 rcp 4 5 using different meteorological gridded input data moriondo et al 2011 projected a decrease in future yield in tuscany italy ferrise et al 2016 attribute the negative impact of increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation on grape yield in the mediterranean basin to shorter phenological growth periods as for et c and et a the highest irrigation demand et aw in the baseline occurs in turkey 706 mm and the lowest in slovenia 289 mm a peak of about 600 mm was found in greece followed by tunisia and spain where values between 400 mm and 500 mm are reported lower values 400 500 mm occur in italy algeria france croatia and morocco fig 2f in general the grape irrigation demand et aw followed precipitation patterns table 4 the largest increase of irrigation requirement under both rcps is expected in france about 19 and italy about 15 followed by slovenia croatia and spain about 11 changes no higher than about 6 are predicted for tunisia greece and turkey fig 5c e a focus on the mediterranean countries shows a mean et aw value about 10 higher in the future under both rcps although grape is usually cultivated under rainfed conditions in sardinia region the et aw is expected to increase by about 6 with climate change mancosu 2013 3 2 2 3 irrigated wheat although wheat is generally cultivated under rainfed conditions there are some irrigated areas in the mediterranean basin the trend of wheat evapotranspiration for the baseline period estimated in this work is in line with saadi et al 2014 even if two different approaches were adopted mediterranean country yield losses are estimated as the difference between et c and et a values losses up to 40 are shown for cyprus and lebanon during the baseline period fig 3 under climate change the highest difference between future and past climate are estimated for albania france montenegro and spain ya yc 20 while lower losses are predicted in egypt both rcps and israel rcp 4 5 these trends are in line with saadi et al 2014 and in contrast with moriondo et al 2011 who project an increase for non irrigated winter wheat yield in the same area in this analysis et c values ranged from 409 to 631 mm fig 2g where the lowest and the highest values are 100 mm higher and 233 mm lower respectively than the values estimated by saadi et al 2014 the highest mean difference of wheat water consumption is estimated for morocco increase of about 4 under both rcps negative et c rate of change values are expected in albania libya and tunisia under both rcps and in egypt france slovenia and spain under rcp 8 5 in these countries the et c values predicted under future climate conditions are lower than the ones estimated in the baseline fig 6a b e in the baseline et a values range from 525 mm italy to 277 mm cyprus fig 2h in several countries fig 6a b e under climate change conditions the values of et a increased in relation to the baseline indeed negative changes between future and baseline et a values countries with peak of 5 and 4 are expected in albania under rcp 4 5 and in spain under rcp 8 5 fig 2i shows crop irrigation requirement values lower than 100 mm in albania france montenegro and spain the highest applied water demand in the baseline is reported for syria and turkey 304 mm irrigation demand under climate change is expected to slightly decrease in egypt under both rcps while in israel lebanon and syria only under rcp 4 5 a noticeable increase of about 40 46 wheat irrigation demand under climate change is projected for france spain montenegro and albania under rcp 4 5 as a result of slightly higher precipitation under rcp 8 5 compared to rcp 4 5 table 4 in the same countries lower et aw values were found under rcp 8 5 fig 6c and d the highest difference between the two climate scenarios arises in france 27 with the lowest in italy 0 2 considering a doubling of atmospheric co2 concentration wheat et a values are expected to decrease by about 28 cgm2 data 8 rcm data in the period 2070 2079 in turkey according to yano et al 2007 while increasing et c values are projected in this work decreasing et c in no stress conditions are reported in saadi et al 2014 and supit et al 2010 they attribute the change in et c to a shorter growing season the negative impact of climate change i e the increase of wheat net water application is in agreement with other studies tubiello et al 2000 yano et al 2007 özdoğan 2011 saadi et al 2014 valizadeh et al 2014 lovelli et al 2010 project increasing et aw for spring summer crops but no significant increase in et aw for autumn winter crops in southern italy around 2070 4 discussion the findings show an overall reduction of projected precipitation in southern mediterranean countries which in line with keuler et al 2016 is in general greater under rcp 8 5 the simulated reference crop and actual evapotranspiration as well as irrigation requirement are projected to increase under future climate conditions and often differences between future and past climate conditions are greater under the rcp 4 5 scenario on average the maize and grape crop water consumption in the mediterranean countries is expected to increase on average about 3 4 under both rcps with the most consistent increases in italy about 7 under both rcps and in france about 6 under rcp 4 5 lower values are projected for wheat which is expected to consume on average about 0 5 more under climate change conditions with peak of about 4 in morocco generally under both rcps the rate of change of maize wheat and grape water consumption under deficit water and non optimal pedo climatic conditions et a are on average lower than in well watered conditions in mediterranean countries maize wheat and grape production will require on average about 13 16 and 10 more applied water under climate change conditions respectively the amount of water applied to satisfy grape needs in the future decades is higher in relevant wine producing countries such as france about 19 italy 15 and spain 11 than in other mediterranean countries rates of change are particularly high in the southern part of these countries fig 5c and d where conflicts on water use and less favorable conditions could lead to impact on crop productivity the lowest impact of climate change on grape irrigation demand is expected in turkey tunisia and greece increase of about 6 a future increase of applied water between about 20 29 is expected for maize production in bosnia and herzegovina france italy slovenia and montenegro due to reduced precipitation during 2036 2065 table 4 in france albania spain and morocco the wheat irrigation is estimated to increase under climate change by more than about 40 under rcp 4 5 in general egypt israel and lebanon show the least change for maize water needs et aw increase about 3 under both rcps whereas the lowest wheat water applications are needed in cyprus egypt israel libya and syria 2 et aw 0 under rcp 4 5 although irrigation application is practiced the et a estimated was in general lower than et c due to the pedoclimatic conditions and management practices assumed in this work assuming no changes in input data actual evapotranspiration values may increase changing the frequency and number of irrigation events ad 50 this management strategy can reduce water stress but increase water demand therefore increasing et a which in turn reduces yield losses it is worth noting that in this case much water may be applied for the crop growth and an environmental economic analysis could help in achieving the best balance between the impact on water resources and yield losses in addition the price of water should be considered since it impacts farm business this work is in line with several studies investigating crop water consumption and irrigation requirements using models at different scales and at different resolutions and considering different scenarios keeping a focus on mediterranean irrigated agriculture this study agrees with an expected increase in crop water needs due to increasing drought risk which is expected to characterize southern countries in the near future rodriguez diaz et al 2007 saadi et al 2014 tanasijevic et al 2014 fader et al 2015 fader at al 2016 irrigation practices are exacerbated in mediterranean regions due to the projected warmer and drier summer months when the amount of agricultural water is constrained due to other sectors water needs tourism is a critical economic sector but also demands considerable drinking water and water for leisure facilities leading to increased conflicts among sectors for water use uncontrolled water abstraction may exacerbate the water security issues by creating imbalances between water supply and demand collins 2009 such inter sectoral water related issues could hamper efforts throughout the region in achieving sustainable development goals sdg 6 ambitions this work further highlights the potential severity of increases in water related issues in the mediterranean related to both expected supply decline and demand increase unfortunately in this region water security challenges are not the only issue to be confronted regarding agricultural production this work has shown widespread crop yield declines throughout the mediterranean area resulting from water shortages especially for food supply crops such as maize and wheat despite the crops being irrigated the study shows that water applications are inadequate to fully satisfy crop water needs resulting in a stress coefficient k s 1 and consequent crop yield reductions in mediterranean countries the beneficial effect of future increasing atmospheric co2 concentration on yield losses is more evident on grape and wheat with yield losses limited to about 8 while for maize yield losses can reach about 13 grape yield losses are possibly related to increasing temperature effects on the length of the growing season ferrise et al 2016 although c3 plants i e wheat and grape may benefit from increasing levels of atmospheric co2 due to their physiology patterson et al 1984 cure and acock 1986 this positive effect may be threatened by other factors such as the changes in precipitation frequency and intensity which can lead to negative effects on crop production ipcc 2007 particularly in areas where water resources are scarce in the near future non irrigated crop production in southern europe is expected to decrease by about 50 and this may lead to climate change induced crop abandonment eea 2019 decreases in crop yield and the abandonment of productive land could threaten local regional and european food security which led to the global challenge to achieve the sdg 2 in the mediterranean basin sdsn 2019 furthermore unsustainable agriculture may lead to an increase in food imports with a consequent increase in food prices and food supply vulnerability it can cause lower and or less stable income for farmers with an unavoidable impact on the agricultural sector taken together the potential for agricultural water demand leading to increased water competition and threats to water supply and the expected decreases in crop yields partly due to water and climate impacts strongly suggest that increasing the resilience of agricultural sector to extreme events in mediterranean countries is a critical priority from local to european governments in terms of managing water consumption sdg 6 while also maintaining crop production sdg 2 the first step to cope with these issues is to increase knowledge about the water consumption and irrigation requirements of mediterranean crops to better manage water resources as well as better understanding of yield declines particularly in regions already largely affected by water scarcity and a multitude of water demanding sectors this study further contributes to such knowledge although the adaptation of the agricultural sector to climate change is progressing the process needs to be accelerated policies targeted to facilitate and speed up this transition at different time and spatial scales should be addressed by decision makers faster and better eea 2019 some limitations in this study will be addressed in future work such as i changes in crop breeding new cultural practices and technologies and shifts in sowing bud break and harvest date which may have an impact on crop adaptation to climate change conditions ii changes in the percentage of cultivated areas due to climate or anthropogenic factors iii evaluation of more crops under several water management scenarios iv availability of higher resolution input gridded data to include more details in the outcomes at mediterranean scale and v use of climate models ensemble to reduce result uncertainties and model biases 5 conclusions in this work two new versions of the simulation of evapotranspiration of applied water simetaw model are introduced simetaw was implemented in r to allow crop water consumption and irrigation demand estimations both at local simetaw r and regional scale simetaw gis according to different implementation objectives and stakeholder s needs simetaw r validation was carried out in ten experimental sites while simetaw gis simulation was assessed in mediterranean countries by estimating the impact of climate change on maize wheat and grape water consumption and irrigation requirements for the baseline 1976 2005 and the future climate conditions 2036 2065 under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios simetaw r performed well at the local level estimated increases in crop water needs under future climate conditions in mediterranean countries are predicted irrigation demand increases were often greater under rcp 4 5 than 8 5 scenario crop yields are expected to decline in many southern mediterranean countries the increased water demand and decreasing crop yields pose dual challenges for local to european agricultural policy regarding efforts towards achieving targets in sdg2 and sdg6 the simetaw r model outcomes at local scale as well as the simetaw gis platform gridded outcomes at regional scale contribute to increase awareness on climate change issues regarding crop water consumption and irrigation requirements and agricultural production in mediterranean regions to tackle climate change impact on the agricultural sector adaptation strategies should be developed supported and implemented in view of the rapid demographic growth and the consequent food security issue it is necessary to cope with climate change through strategies targeted to achieve sustainable agricultural production in this context this study adds useful information to better inform such policy decisions surrounding agricultural practices and crop water management both at local

9976,crop water use can be a useful indicator of in season crop conditions including health and greenness on sodic soils however in field manual measurements of crop water use can be tedious time and labour intensive and may also exhibit large spatial variability and inefficient for surveying large areas here we propose a novel approach to estimate in field crop water use of wheat using spatial interpolation techniques at critical crop development stages tillering and close to flowering on a moderately sodic and a highly sodic site in southern queensland australia the six spatial interpolation techniques ordinary kriging empirical bayes kriging inverse distance weighting spline local polynomial interpolation and radial basis function were employed on ground measured crop water use data and compared to accurately estimate the spatial distribution of crop water use initially the comparison was made using root mean square error mean absolute error and coefficient of determination values using cross validation for a more clear comparison and to account for complexities of site specific crop water use distribution the standardized multi component model performance efficiency metrics i e kling gupta efficiency and spatial efficiency were adopted and tested over cross validation techniques results showed that kling gupta efficiency was slightly better at selecting the optimum interpolation models for crop water use estimation at a field scale than the spatial efficiency metric spline and local polynomial interpolation were relatively better estimators of crop water use for both the sites at tillering while the radial basis function and spline were superior close to flowering the estimated crop water use was positively and closely associated with seasonal greenseeker normalized difference vegetation index data r2 0 49 and 0 39 at tillering and r2 0 71 and 0 62 at close to flowering for the moderately sodic and highly sodic sites respectively the research improves our understanding of selecting appropriate spatial interpolation methods for in season crop water use estimation that could help detect changes in crop health due to in field and seasonal variations of crop water use in a sodic soil environment keywords cross validation kling gupta efficiency spatial efficiency normalized difference vegetation index crop development stage seasonal variations 1 introduction sodic soils occupy 581 million ha worldwide with 340 million ha located in australia rengasamy 2006 2016 rengasamy and sumner 1998 in australia sodic soil is categorized as non sodic when the exchangeable sodium percentage esp is 6 moderately sodic at esp 6 15 and highly sodic at esp 15 northcote and skene 1972 crop production on sodic soil is adversely affected due to soil structural degradation which limits water infiltration and decreases soil water holding capacity where dispersive soils are also saline the high salt concentrations can be toxic to plants especially high chloride cl concentrations and this can affect water uptake dalal et al 2002 dang et al 2006 2008 the resulting reduction in water availability poses a significant threat to crop production dang et al 2006 particularly in rain fed areas where crops often rely on stored soil moisture due to seasonal variability in rainfall dang et al 2016 hochman et al 2017 variations in crop water uptake may directly influence crop health and or yield variability in field dang et al 2019 hence accurate estimation of crop water use cwu in the field is an important component to determine seasonal crop water requirements crop growth and health and greenness under sodic soil conditions electromagnetic induction instruments geonics em38 canada have proven to be a useful ground based proximal sensing tool for in season measurements of cwu dang et al 2011 foley 2013 rigney 2011 em38 metres measure apparent electrical conductivity eca of the crop root zone which can be converted to stored soil water mm value using a site specific calibration dang et al 2011 foley 2013 this can be used to calculate cwu by comparing the stored soil water at sowing with succeeding crop growth stages however despite notable advances in proximal sensing techniques they can still be tedious as well as time and labour intensive when surveying large agricultural areas in addition in situ measurements may include errors due to manual handling of an instrument which may increase data variability as an alternative remote sensing and geo spatial modelling can potentially be employed this uses satellite imagery products and or various geo statistical and spatial modelling approaches to provide a wide range of solutions at a field regional and or national scale the use of these methods has been reported for soil moisture estimation crop growth estimation and yield prediction souza et al 2016 yao et al 2013 this can reduce the need for laborious field sampling and data collection nevertheless remote sensing and spatial modelling techniques only provide parameter estimations which need to be validated via adequate field measured data points in addition the accuracy of these techniques might vary on the site specific conditions and sample size which needs to be scrutinized spatial interpolation is one of the popular geo spatial modelling techniques this approach uses geo statistical and deterministic approaches to predict data for unmeasured locations based on the proximity of their nearest neighbourhood or the minimum distance from measured data points chai et al 2011 losser et al 2014 xiao et al 2016 deterministic techniques rely on mathematical functions to create a surface from measured point data in contrast geo statistical techniques utilize both statistical and mathematical functions for interpolating surfaces johnston et al 2001 researchers have been applying geo statistics in preference to classical statistics especially in studies of the distribution of soil properties to estimate outcomes more precisely for unmeasured points behera and shukla 2015 bhunia et al 2018 liu et al 2006 researchers suggested that a minimum of 28 data points are required to produce accurate interpolation results at regional or field scale mapping agerberg 2020 li and heap 2014 however a greater number of data points can be used for more accurate estimations if the data is available a number of studies have been conducted at various scales on spatial interpolation techniques with variable accuracy in their ability to estimate outcomes demonstrated table 1 it is thus clear that spatial interpolation models can be used at various scales field regional national etc to estimate the outcomes and mapping that may reduce the problems associated with rigorous manual field data collection and may also increase data accuracy and precision even with a few measured data points however selecting appropriate interpolation models to provide greater insight into field variability is challenging in addition there is a limited understanding of which spatial models perform best in estimating the outcomes at various spatial extensions since the accuracy of these spatial models is heavily reliant on the closeness of the measured data spatial extension and site specific soil and environmental conditions therefore it is necessary to test and compare a number of models in their ability to estimate the outcomes while a number of studies have been conducted on spatial interpolation techniques at various spatial scales and in different regions however studies have not been reported so far where in season cwu on a field scale is estimated using these interpolation techniques to help understand crop growth greenness and seasonal vigour and that too in water limited sodic soil environments this study thus seeks to understand the ability of a range of spatial interpolation techniques to estimate seasonal variations of cwu on sodic soils in this study we compared a number of spatial interpolation techniques to estimate cwu on moderately sodic ms and highly sodic hs soil at a field scale for estimation and spatial distribution of cwu sim cwu we used seasonal ground measured cwu obs cwu data from an em38 instrument at tillering and close to the flowering of wheat crops we further employed a novel method to compare the accuracy of these interpolation models using the multi component kling gupta efficiency metric kge kling and gupta 2009 and the spatial efficiency metric spaef koch et al 2018 over cross validation methods finally the most accurately estimated sim cwu of both stages and sites were used to estimate seasonal crop health and greenness using greenseeker normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data we hypothesized that appropriate selection of spatial interpolation techniques can provide accurate estimations of seasonal cwu at field scale that can be used to indicate crop health and greenness particularly on rain fed sodic soils which may reduce the need for the extensive labour intensive and tedious process of detailed plot wise measurements of obs cwu in the field the specific objectives of this study are 1 to quantify the impacts of sodic soil constraints on seasonal cwu 2 to evaluate the performance of spatial interpolation techniques for accurate estimation of cwu at field scale and 3 to quantify the impact of seasonal cwu variation on the changes of crop health and greenness on sodic soil the study will provide a basis to develop techniques with the capacity to assist farmers in making suitable management decisions for improving crop performance on sodic soils in water limited environments 2 materials and methods the methodological design of this study consists of the identification of suitable experimental sites collection of in season crop environment and soil data followed by the statistical analysis of this data using a range of analytical approaches fig 1 2 1 site description and experimental design the experiment was performed on two sites one ms 28 15º s and 150 22º e and the other hs 28 08º s and 150 15º e near goondiwindi in southern queensland australia both sites have well structured grey vertisols soils with high clay content and are located at an average elevation of 268 m above mean sea level with 1 m elevation variation within a site both sites are dominated by sodic soil constraints including high esp and cl concentrations especially in the subsoil 100 150 cm das et al 2021b during the normal crop growing season from may to october air temperature varied between 5 and 35 for both sites with seasonal means of 14 7 and 14 9 for the ms and hs sites respectively mean relative humidity was 54 6 and 54 3 and total in season crop rainfall was 86 0 mm and 85 6 mm for the ms and hs site respectively fig 2 das et al 2021b a uniform area was selected for the experiments in both sites based on acquired eca readings we used a randomized complete block design at both the experimental sites each with eight replications four for destructive sampling and plant biophysical measurements i e 72 plots and another four for grain yield 72 plots measurements at maturity yield data was not reported in this study at each experiment site 18 wheat genotypes were tested making a total of 144 plots 4 columns and 36 rows das et al 2021b each plot was 5 2 m and had five planting rows at 30 cm spacing crops at both sites were sown on 24th may 2018 and harvested on 2nd november 2018 2 2 soil sampling and analysis at each site soil samples were collected from a minimum of eight points using a hydraulic sampling rig to take 50 mm diameter soil cores to a depth of 150 cm the soil samples were dried at 40 and ground to 2 mm in a 1 5 soil water suspension iso 2005 ph ec and chloride cl were measured and the ec of saturated extract ecse was then computed from ec 1 5 and clay content was determined using the pipette method day 1965 shaw 1997 exchangeable na and cation exchange capacity cec were measured using a 1 m nh4cl ph 8 5 extraction solution tucker 1985 and esp was calculated from exchangeable na relative to cec the volumetric moisture content in percentage was determined after drying samples at 105 ºc to obtain the gravimetric soil moisture content and multiplying this with the soil bulk density bd das et al 2021b soil physio chemical properties of both sites are illustrated in fig 3 das et al 2021b 2 3 plant reflectance measurements a handheld greenseeker trimble inc sunnyvale ca was used to measure ndvi of each plot at tillering at 65 70 days after sowing das and close to flowering 110 112 das to monitor crop health and growth at both the experimental sites the sensor was operated at an average speed of 0 84 m s at 0 5 m elevation above the canopy 2 4 electro magnetic induction and crop water use measurements plot wise apparent electrical conductivity eca was measured with an electromagnetic induction emi instrument geonics em38 canada at tillering and close to flowering a handheld global position system gps garmin 64sx garmin australasia pty ltd was used to record ground control points to the corresponding plot wise eca values the emi measurements required site specific calibration before commencing the survey the calibration of eca was carried out against cumulative soil water the cumulative soil water can be calculated using eca readings in vertical 0 150 cm depth or horizontal 0 75 cm depth dipole mode or as a function of above ground height if the em38 instrument is lifted off the ground for recording dang et al 2011 we operated the emi instrument in a vertical mode and the eca data were recorded for each plot with the response functions for heterogeneous profiles provided by mcneill 1980 the em measurement for vertical dipole are expressed in eq 1 huth and poulton 2007 1 ecv 0 e c a z ϕ v z z where z is depth explained as depth ratio to the inter coil space e c a z is the reading value of e c a ds m at a z depth ϕ v z are density function of vertical dipoles finally crop water use obs cwu was calculated eq 2 as the sum of the change in soil water within the root zone from sowing to tillering and sowing to close to flowering dang et al 2006 2011 a total of 72 data samples from each site were used for cwu measurements the points were evenly distributed over the sites 2 obs cwu soil water at sowing soil water at tillering or close to flowering in crop rain 2 5 spatial interpolation techniques we applied two geo statistical ok and ebk and four deterministic idw spline lpi and rbf interpolation techniques under spatial interpolation in arcgis 8 0 software platform esri ltd ca usa to estimate and spatially distribute cwu sim cwu on the basis of obs cwu point data at field scale 2 5 1 ordinary kriging the ok follows a constant trend only within a local neighbourhood leroux 2019 this technique explains variation through the spatial correlation between points based on distance or direction by applying a semivariogram to determine spatial continuity the semivariogram explains the statistical correlation strength as a function of distance the application of geostatistics requires the existence of a spatial framework in which observations are proximity to one another than those that are distant can be determined using spatial autocorrelation seyedmohammadi et al 2016 the distance at which spatial correlation disappears is known as a range sill refers to the maximum variation at which the semivariogram stabilizes while nugget is related to short range variation in the dataset bhunia et al 2018 pacific nothwest national laboratory 2015 the nugget sill ratio was computed to determine spatial dependence of the sim cwu a ratio 0 25 signifies strong 0 25 0 75 moderate and 0 75 is considered as a weak spatial autocorrelation respectively bhunia et al 2018 cambardella et al 1994 a variogram y d explains spatial variability of z a regionalized variable can be expressed as eq 3 buytaert et al 2006 gupta et al 2017 haan 2002 3 y d 1 2 n d i 1 n d z x i z x i d ² where y d is the semivariance n d is the number of data pairs in a class of distance d z x i is a data value at i point z x i d is a data value of the nearest point at a distance d the variogram values for a distance d that is half the mean squared difference between z x i and z x i d values lark 2000 the semivariogram for our study was selected after testing them at different lags kernel functions to obtain the best model fit the ok can be expressed as eq 4 leroux 2019 4 z s m s e s where z s is the value of the attribute at s spatial location m is a deterministic trend and e is the autocorrelation error which relies on s spatial location 2 5 2 empirical bayes kriging the ebk method applies an intrinsic random function mirzaei and sakizadeh 2016 this model automates the design function of a kriging model which is regarded as the challenging part of spatial interpolation gupta et al 2017 the ebk relies on the assumption that the approximated semivariogram is the real accurate semivariogram of the area and a linear forecast exemplifies spatial variable damping the resulting good non stationary algorithm stretches local trends when there is sufficient data availability and enables bending to a beforehand mean in poor data coverage knotters et al 2010 krivoruchko 2012 krivoruchko and butler 2013 2 5 3 inverse distance weighting the idw estimates values for un measured location points using the values of linear combination at known nearby locational points the weights allotted to the unknown points are an inverse function of their distance from the known points accordingly it is assumed that the points in proximity acquire higher weights than far off points this can be expressed as eq 5 srivastava et al 2019 5 y l 1 ⅆ i p i 1 n 1 d i p where ⅆ i the distance between known and unknown location points p is the power parameter and n is the number of data points the value of the power parameter in idw can be determined based on the evaluation of errors in estimation collins and bolstad 1996 this power influences the accuracy of idw with the increase of power the weight decreases and distance increases usually a power 2 is mostly recommended which results in inverse squared distance or inverse squared srivastava et al 2019 we have also obtained the best result with power 2 by testing different power parameters and neighbours 2 5 4 spline this method uses a small number of data points at a time to predict the outcomes burrough and mcdonnell 1998 spline uses a polynomial function which expresses pieces of a line or a surface being fitted together smoothly webster and oliver 2001 the places where the pieces join are known as knots they might hold a significant influence on the estimation however knot selection is arbitrary the local surfaces fit polynomial surfaces for prediction by using nearby points burrough and mcdonnell 1998 however the method often requires careful consideration when the input data on a grid shows the absence of direct information for accurate prediction hence the prediction will not show direct outcomes on residual variance isaaks and srivastava 1989 spline produces reliable results with gentle varying surfaces and also in the analysis of local geometry that helps as input in many process based models lam 1983 srivastava et al 2019 consequently this method aids analysis where there is no large change in a topographic gradient within a short distance robinson and metternicht 2006 2 5 5 local polynomial interpolation the lpi uses points within the defined neighbourhood rather than the whole dataset the neighbourhoods tend to overlap and the polynomial fit that estimates the surface value at the centre of the neighbourhood is considered as the predicted outcome esri 2008 the lpi is reported to be reliable and produces a surface with less variation within a short distance bhunia et al 2018 johnston et al 2001 the best results were obtained using an exponential kernel function with polynomial order 2 in the lpi for our study 2 5 6 radial basis function the rbf predicts values identical to those measured at the same point and the generated surface is required to pass through each measured point bhunia et al 2018 the prediction results can be higher or lower than the range of measured values li et al 2007 2011 the rbf fits a surface through measured point values and minimizes the curvature of the surface this method performs well when there is no large change in surface values within a short range of distances johnston et al 2001 the rbf can be mathematically expressed in eq 6 talmi and gilat 1977 the z variable is explained on an x prediction point as the sum of two components mitášová and mitáš 1993 wu et al 2019 6 z x t x i 1 n b i ψ ⅆ i where ψ ⅆ i is the rbf ⅆ i represents a distance between observed and predicted point x n is data points and t x represents the trend function and can be expressed as eq 7 7 t x i 1 m a i f i x where f i x represents a set of linearly independent functions b i and a i are the coefficients acquired from n m system linear equations eqs 8 and 9 8 z x k i 1 m a i f i x k i 1 n b i ψ ⅆ ik for k 1 2 n 9 i 1 n b i f k x i 0 for k 1 2 m in the rbf we have obtained the best fit using an inverse multi quadratic function imq wu et al 2019 xie et al 2011 after testing with different neighbours and functions imq can be expressed in eq 10 10 ψ d 1 d 2 c 2 where d represents a distance from the sample to estimation location and c represents a smoothing function 2 6 statistical analyses 2 6 1 t test we performed a paired sample t test to determine whether any significant differences existed between the site mean of obs cwu at the ms and hs sites at tillering and close to flowering 2 6 2 performance assessment of spatial interpolation models using cross validation methods we used the leave one out and split sampling cross validation approaches to evaluate the performance of spatial interpolation models and compare their ability to accurately predict cwu the leave one out approach excludes a single data value from the dataset and then performs interpolation in its absence the difference between observed and cwu predicted values of that excluded data is computed in the split sampling method the data set is split into a 75 training and 25 testing set erdogan 2009 wu et al 2019 the performance of the interpolation based sim cwu was evaluated with rmse mean absolute error mae and r2 values in prediction eqs 11 13 isaaks and srivastava 1989 li and heap 2014 wu et al 2019 to rank the interpolated models smaller rmse and mae close to zero and higher r2 close to 1 were considered as the selection parameters wu et al 2019 11 r m s e 1 n i 1 n z i z x i 2 12 m a e 1 n i 1 n z i z x i 13 r 2 i 1 n z ⅈ z i z x i z x i i 1 n z i z i 2 i 1 n z x i z x i 2 where n is the total number of data points z i represents observed value at i z x i is the predicted value at i z i represents an average observed value and z x i represents an average predicted value 2 6 3 performance assessment of spatial interpolation models using spatial performance metrics we computed two spatial performance metrics over the cross validation method to evaluate the performance of spatial interpolation models a kling gupta efficiency kge and b spatial efficiency metric spaef the kge metric was first proposed in hydrological modelling for evaluating the performance of simulated discharge patterns kling and gupta 2009 we bring the concept of the kge to evaluate the performance of spatial interpolation models in cwu estimation for agricultural applications this metric is designed with three standardized components correlation variability and bias each of these carries equal weight in the model eqs 14 and 15 the multi component structure is beneficial because it does not rely on a single component and thus it can be considered a more comprehensive approach than cross validation for evaluating the spatial model efficiency koch et al 2018 14 kge 1 α q 1 2 β q 1 2 γ q 1 2 15 α q ρ o b s s i m β q σ s i m σ o b s a n d γ q µ s i m µ o b s where α q is the pearson correlation coefficient between ground measured obs cwu and interpolated cwu sim cwu β q represents variability and γ q represents bias although the multi component nature of kge has been reported to be suitable to evaluate spatial model performance gupta et al 2012 krause et al 2005 some researchers have advocated that a more holistic and balanced metric may be required for a more comprehensive assessment of spatial model performance hence with this idea koch et al 2018 introduced the spatial efficiency metric spaef as a multi component metric in preference to kge we adapted the concept of spaef in our study to compare the efficiency with kge and cross validation for the estimation of cwu through spatial interpolation techniques the spaef values range between and 1 and can be expressed using eqs 16 and 17 demirel et al 2018 koch et al 2018 16 spaef 1 α 1 ² β 1 ² γ 1 ² 17 α ρ o b s s i m β σ s i m μ s i m σ o b s μ o b s and γ j 1 n m i n k j l j j 1 n k j where α is the pearson correlation coefficient between obs cwu and sim cwu β is the fraction of the coefficient indicating coefficient of variation cv ratio between obs cwu and sim cwu γ is the histogram intersection between obs cwu k and sim cwu l the correlation α values range between 0 and 1 indicating a positive or negative association between obs cwu and sim cwu a high cv ratio β indicates greater variability in the sim cwu model and vice versa a higher histogram match γ value indicates similarities between obs cwu and sim cwu we performed a two sample t test one column per variable between the interpolation models based on kge and spaef scores for each site and crop stage to determine whether the performance was significantly different between each interpolation method for estimating cwu sim cwu 2 6 4 crop health forecasting we used a linear regression model using n standardization with a 5 test significance level to forecast crop health in response to cwu we used greenseeker ndvi data obs cwu and sim cwu at tillering and close to the flowering stage to perform the regression analysis a k fold 10 cross validation method was used for validation purposes the accuracy of the model was tested using r2 and rmse in the cross validation 2 6 5 analysis of variance anova anova was performed to determine if there are any significant interactions between wheat genotypes between two soil sites based on the predicted ndvi as a function of cwu the testing of significant differences between levels within each factor was performed using fisher s protected least significant difference lsd test at the 5 significance level the variables were treated as nested effects and replicate was fitted as a random effect all statistical analyses were performed in rstudio 3 6 2 rstudio pbc statistical software platform 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil constraints varied between the ms and hs sites the depth wise distribution of soil physio chemical properties fig 3 showed that both sites have similar clay contents 41 58 and thus are likely to have a similar water holding capacity both sites also have a higher esp in the subsoil 19 for ms and 24 for hs at 100 150 cm than the surface soil 2 7 for ms and 14 for hs at 0 10 cm in addition both sites have high cl concentrations in the subsoil with concentrations substantially higher at the hs site than at the ms site 700 750 mg kg for ms and 2300 mg kg for hs at 100 150 cm high subsoil esp and cl concentrations can restrict root water uptake and reduce rooting depth dang et al 2008 2019 it would be anticipated that the higher esp and cl at the hs site will reduce crop water availability to a greater extent than the ms site in season rainfall data indicated that both sites experienced similar in crop rainfall over the study period fig 2 3 2 impacts of sodic soil constraints on seasonal crop water use cwu for wheat the obs cwu data for both sites were tested for normality table s1 the skewness values between 0 5 and 0 5 indicate that the data is symmetric good data corporation 2020 further a positive kurtosis value close to 3 0 table s1 suggests that our obs cwu data for both sites and crop stages are not flat and followed a nearly normal distribution hence the obs cwu data was considered suitable for spatial interpolation for the estimation of cwu sim cwu this contrasts with another study where the authors performed a square root transformation to normalize the data before performing a kriging based interpolation for estimating groundwater ec in northern iran seyedmohammadi et al 2016 paired sample t test results showed that cwu obs cwu was significantly different between the two sites p 0 0001 close to flowering but not at tillering p 0 93 fig 4 in season meteorological data fig 2 and pre planting volumetric soil moisture data fig 3f suggested that both sites had similar p 0 05 in crop rainfall air temperature and stored soil moisture in the profile therefore the significant difference p 0 0001 in cwu between the two sites close to flowering confirms that crops grown at the hs site were under greater water stress compared to the ms site due to the impact of soil constraints while cwu was similar for both sites up until tillering cwu did not increase significantly between tillering and flowering at the hs site this contrasted with the ms site where nearly 30 mm of water was extracted that made the difference in cwu 30 mm p 0 0001 between the ms and hs site close to the flowering fig 4b this pattern of water use is consistent with the greater cl concentrations in the subsoil of the hs site limiting water uptake later in the growing season as the crop root system expanded into the subsoil overall our results suggest that in a sodic soil environment with a saline subsoil wheat is likely to experience water stress from pre flowering to grain filling 3 3 comparing spatial interpolation models for estimation of cwu the spatial dependence of cwu data was explained by semivariogram models at each site and stage the best fit was obtained using an exponential type at our experiment sites at 12 lags suggesting less structural variation of the data as recommended by the environmental systems research institute esri 2016 a careful selection of lag size is important in an empirical semivariogram choosing a too large or too small lag size may often increase errors in autocorrelation a simple rule for choosing a lag size is to multiply the lag size by the number of lags which should be about half the largest distance among all points esri 2016 in this study the multiplication of lag sizes with a number of lags exhibited about half the largest distance amongst all the data points table 2 the nugget sill ratio 0 25 and or 0 25 0 75 table 2 indicates strong to moderate spatial dependence of the obtained semivariogram for our study a mean error between 0 5 to 0 5 m table 2 suggests less variation in the simulated model wu et al 2019 bhunia et al 2018 reported that the semivariogram for their soil organic matter estimation study showed a varied spatial dependence on the field data our semivariogram statistics indicated a similar and relatively uniform spatial autocorrelation for both sites and cropping stages 3 3 1 performance comparison between spatial interpolation techniques with cross validation methods performance assessment based on the individual model parameter r2 rmse and mae of cross validation showed inconsistent results between the interpolation techniques therefore it was difficult for us to select an appropriate cross validation parameter to compare the model performance overall the leave one out cross validation showed that for the ms site and both crop stages the ebk performed slightly better in predicting cwu sim cwu than other interpolation techniques rmse 10 1 mm mae 7 8 mm r2 0 55 for tillering and rmse 11 9 mm mae 9 8 mm r2 0 57 for tillering and close to flowering whereas for the hs site the rbf performed slightly better than the other interpolation techniques at both crop stages rmse 12 0 mm mae 9 01 mm r2 0 68 for tillering and rmse 8 0 mm mae 6 2 mm r2 0 85 for close to flowering table 3 on the other hand the split sampling cross validation showed that obs cwu and sim cwu together were slightly better correlated for both sites and crop stages with lesser rmse and mae values compared to the leave one out method while comparing between the performance of the interpolation techniques based on split sampling cross validation the ok has performed slightly better in predicting cwu sim cwu at the ms site for both crop stages rmse 5 6 mm mae 4 6 mm r2 0 55 for tillering and rmse 7 6 mm mae 6 1 mm r2 0 55 for close to flowering whereas for the hs site the ok rmse 4 9 mm mae 3 8 mm r2 0 46 at tillering and the idw rmse 4 2 mm mae 3 4 mm r2 0 88 at close to flowering stage has performed slightly better than the other interpolation techniques table 4 the leave one out cross validation method is usually less sensitive to bias as it considers the entire dataset during a run however this method might result in a high variation in the model testing due to considering model testing against one data point thus this method can be more time consuming than split sampling cross validation sharma 2020 while the split sampling cross validation maintains a balance between training and testing data set by splitting them for obtaining stability in estimation by reducing error xu and goodacre 2018 thus a balanced distribution 50 in each or 75 and 25 can potentially reduce the data variability and be faster than a leave one out method however this can be site specific and heavily reliant on the size of the dataset its area coverage and the parameters to be used for prediction wu et al 2019 applied both cross validation methods to compare the interpolation models estimate of river bathymetry and cross sectional sounding of the lowermost mississippi river and found a close association between observed and interpolated data bhunia et al 2018 used a cross validation method to compare the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon estimated from various interpolation techniques and reported that ok was superior having lower rmse and mae our split sampling cross validation results also suggest the ability of ok in cwu estimation at a field scale however the leave one out cross validation suggests a slightly greater ability of ebk and rbf compared to the others in the estimation of cwu hence overall a diversified performance was observed by the interpolation techniques based on the two cross validation methods employed in this study and also it was difficult to discriminate between the model performances using either r2 or rmse or mae this suggested that under certain conditions a single cross validation model component r2 or rmse or mae is not enough to differentiate the ability of interpolation models since these components individually provided a diversified statistic of the model performance to address this issue a multi component metric was adapted demirel et al 2018 kling and gupta 2009 koch et al 2018 that may potentially provide a more comprehensive evaluation in the selection of appropriate interpolation techniques 3 3 2 performance comparison between spatial interpolation techniques with multi component model performance metrics the multi component kge metric scores at the ms site and at tillering stage table 5 and fig 5a b showed that the spline interpolation kge 0 69 ebk kge 0 65 idw kge 0 63 and rbf kge 0 66 were significantly better p 0 05 than ok kge 0 45 and lpi kge 0 59 at the hs site the kge metric scores showed that the performance of lpi kge 0 70 was better p 0 01 than the other interpolation methods at close to flowering the kge metric scores for the ms site table 5 and fig 5a b showed that rbf kge 0 74 and spline kge 0 69 were significantly better than ok kge 0 47 at p 0 01 and better than ebk kge 0 64 idw kge 0 66 and lpi kge 0 59 at p 0 05 whereas at the hs site spline kge 0 82 and rbf kge 0 78 were significantly better than ok kge 0 37 and ebk kge 0 47 at p 0 01 and better than lpi kge 0 49 and idw kge 0 61 at p 0 05 koch et al 2018 reported that the optimal score of kge should be 1 0 later on knoben et al 2019 reported that the kge scores between 0 41 and 1 0 can be considered as satisfactory model performance hence we also found a satisfactory range of kge scores for all the tested interpolation models for both sites for the multi component spaef metric scores at the ms site at tillering table 6 and fig 5c d the rbf spaef 0 27 performed similarly to ebk spaef 0 25 spline spaef 0 23 and lpi spaef 0 20 but was significantly better p 0 05 than ok spaef 0 14 and idw spaef 0 13 at the hs site the performance of lpi spaef 0 31 was significantly better p 0 01 than ok spaef 0 03 and ebk spaef 0 09 and better than spline spaef 0 14 at p 0 05 however no significant differences p 0 05 were observed between lpi with idw spaef 0 26 and rbf spaef 0 25 at close to the flowering the spaef metric scores table 6 and fig 5c d showed that the ebk spaef 0 36 performed similarly to spline spaef 0 30 idw spaef 0 33 and lpi spaef 0 32 but significantly better p 0 05 than ok spaef 0 24 and rbf kge 0 29 at the hs site spline spaef 0 40 and rbf spaef 0 40 had a similar performance p 0 10 however both performed significantly better p 0 05 than ok spaef 0 22 ebk spaef 0 21 idw spaef 0 32 and lpi spaef 0 26 similar to the kge metric score the spaef metric score also has the optimal value of 1 0 koch et al 2018 and we achieved reasonable scores for all the interpolation models which were between 0 03 and 0 4 for both sites table 6 overall we observed that the performance of interpolation models differed between the sites and between the cross validation kge and spaef metric scores considering 1 as an optimal metric score for kge and spaef we found that the kge generally exhibited closer to the optimum than spaef a greater range of values for kge between sites compared to spaef also suggested a clearer distinction at a field scale koch et al 2018 suggested the spaef is a bias insensitive metric that can be utilized to compare the relative variables with different units to optimize spatial model performance however knoben et al 2019 reported that the modelling community is still not aware of any uniformly reliable metric for evaluating model performances that can have greater implications over a broad area of interest thus it is important to test and decide the most important aspects of a model for further utilization of the predicted outcomes on a case by case basis hence we screened out the relatively better performing interpolation models based on cross validation kge and spaef metric scores that have shown a greater ability to predict cwu sim cwu the best estimation and spatial distribution of sim cwu for both the sites and cropping stages was provided in figures s1 s2 3 4 in season crop health forecast in response to crop water use the seasonal cwu was used to forecast the health and greenness of wheat genotypes on sodic soils fig 6 a significant and positive p 0 05 correlation was observed between greenseeker ndvi and cwu for both the sites and cropping stages suggesting that seasonal crop health and greenness for wheat can be heavily reliant on appropriate water use on sodic soil the correlation between greenseeker ndvi and both obs cwu and sim cwu data also indicated a relatively closer association between ndvi and sim cwu compared to obs cwu at both the sites and crop stages fig 6 the results also showed that the kge score based selection of interpolation techniques slightly better predicted ndvi than either spaef or cross validation based selection for both sites and crop stages with r2 of 0 49 for the ms and 0 41 for the hs site at tillering stage and r2 of 0 71 for the ms and 0 62 for the hs site at close to flowering fig 6 when comparing the crop stages and sites we observed a greater association between cwu and ndvi close to flowering compared to tillering suggesting that this is a vital stage before grain filling and can provide maximum insights into crop health and greenness due to the variations in cwu in field overall our results suggest that interpolation based spatial modelling provides accurate estimates of cwu sim cwu on a field scale that could reduce the variability of manually ground measured cwu obs cwu data and has a slightly greater ability to forecast crop health and greenness beisel et al 2018 used ndvi to assess plant health in response to abiotic stress studies reported that the ndvi of healthy vegetation gradually increases from the beginning of the crop season reaches a peak at the middle of the season or before flowering and then saturates before decreasing as the crop senesces towards the season end mkhabela and mashinini 2005 turvey and mclaurin 2012 we also observed that the ndvi reached a peak 0 76 for the ms and 0 55 for the hs site close to flowering compared to tillering 0 65 for the ms and 0 48 for the hs site figs 7 and 8 greater cwu at the ms site near flowering fig 4 corresponds with the higher ndvi and hence healthier crop growth close to flowering at the ms site thus a closer association was observed between ndvi and cwu close to flowering compared to tillering eklundh 1998 reported that 10 36 of the variation in ndvi values could be explained by monthly variation in rainfall further the author observed that vegetation growth and rainfall correlation might be constrained depending on soil type soil water holding capacity and soil constraints in this study we also observed that the crops were healthier at the ms site than at the hs site at both growth stages the lower ndvi at the hs 0 55 compared to the ms site 0 76 close to flowering despite similar in season climatic conditions fig 2 and starting soil moisture fig 3f suggests that the higher sodic soil constraints especially high subsoil cl concentration significantly reduced crop health and greenness by restricting cwu at the hs site variations were also observed between wheat genotypes at both ms and hs sites close to flowering fig 9 further the anova results comparing the ndvi of thirteen wheat genotypes predicted from sim cwu indicated that bremer condo corack elmore emu rock flanker gladius gregory hartog magenta scout sunco and trojan had significantly greater ndvi p 0 05 at the ms than hs site close to flowering however the ndvi of five genotypes janz lancer mace mitch and wallup did not differ significantly p 0 05 between sites or consistent in performance between the ms and hs site due to its higher values at the hs site compared to the other genotypes this suggests that those five wheat genotypes had greater water use in high sodic soil constraints compared to the other genotypes that helped them to maintain sufficient greenness even grown with high soil constraints overall the results suggest that cwu significantly affects the health and greenness of wheat cultivars on sodic soils and can be restricted more in higher sodic soil environments the significant deterioration of genotypic health and greenness at the hs site relative to the ms site close to flowering would be expected to negatively impact yield at maturity a number of studies have reported the efficacy of different spatial interpolation techniques in different environments to estimate parameters at regional to national scales for example rodrigues et al 2018 reported that the idw and rbf can be better estimators of soil physical properties and soil water content than a kriging interpolation in the brazilian semi arid region on non sodic soil later on srivastava et al 2019 reported kriging with external drift ked interpolation n 82 estimated soil moisture content with slightly less error than idw lpi and ok in indian humid subtropical and non sodic soil climatic conditions nazarifar et al 2014 also compared spatial interpolation methods for the estimation of wheat water requirement and distribution under drought conditions on non sodic soils in arid hamedan province iran and reported the suitability of using kriging over other methods overall a diversified performance of interpolation techniques was observed by previous studies in the estimation of soil water content and or soil properties distribution in different geographical locations under variable environmental conditions however we are currently not aware of any reported studies that attempted to evaluate the performance of interpolation models for the estimation of cwu and that too in sodic soil environments recent studies reported that water stress induced by high subsoil constraints esp 15 and cl concentrations 1000 mg kg can be the largest constraint for crop growth and development on rain fed sodic soils das et al 2020 2021a b those studies also report that a higher spatial variability and incomplete canopy cover can be major challenges to representative sampling in the field on sodic soils compared to non sodic soils although spatial variability in crop growth and canopy cover can be tackled using an unmanned aerial vehicle uav imaging and by applying image segmentation thresholding to aid extraction of actual plot wise vegetative cover das et al 2020 2021a b a close and systematic selection of interpolation points 5 m interval uniformly within a site in spatial modelling was important to obtain an accurate estimation of cwu in the present study overall we have successfully demonstrated the potential of interpolation techniques in the estimation of cwu in water limited sodic soil environments results demonstrated that among others the spline lpi and rbf were found effective for estimating cwu on sodic soils at a field scale as mentioned earlier in the sections 2 5 4 2 5 5 and 2 5 6 these three types of interpolation techniques generally perform well in the gently varied surface with no large change in topographic slope within short range of distance as mentioned in section 2 1 the study sites used for this research were nearly flat with a 1 m elevation difference within a site hence the uniform topographic nature of the sites might have improved the estimation using spline and or rbf interpolation techniques when applied to the moderate sample size n 72 with close proximity although mueller et al 2004 suggested that using a large sample size can enhance the accuracy of most of the interpolation techniques however xie et al 2011 reported this as unrealistic since it involves high effort in data collection and model simulation and analysis we also observed that the spline lpi and or rbf perform well with a small or moderate sample size nevertheless the distance based techniques i e ok ebk and idw could not fit better than the spline lpi and or rbf while working with a moderate size of data inputs xie et al 2011 reported that the ok is used for theoretical best linear unbiased prediction and thus obtaining an optimal semivariogram with a small size of data such as dataset at a field scale is difficult while spline or lpi works efficiently with small input parameters however kriging based interpolations better deal with the complexities of a semivariogram model such as autocorrelation transformation structure choosing optimal semi variance fitting functions etc to reduce data variability xie et al 2011 laslett et al 1987 have found the spline and ok performed better than idw for soil ph estimation at a regional scale further simpson and wu 2014 reported with greater accuracy using spline than kriging and or idw for lake sedimentation study when applied on a small input dataset overall results from the previous studies and our current research suggest that the performance of the interpolation techniques most likely vary based on input parameters surface topography slope relief etc size of input data and distribution and data transformation and thus there is no rule of thumb for using an appropriate interpolation technique rather they should be statistically tested and compared using site specific data hence we have focused more on the evaluation of these interpolation models using a number of metrics including cross validation and multi component scores results suggest that under certain conditions multi component metrics kge and or spaef can be a valuable tool for the selection of an appropriate interpolation technique follow up studies should focus on implementing these methods with more diversified interpolation techniques on a wide range of dataset to check the effectiveness of these techniques at different spatial extension 4 conclusions the present study aimed to provide a method to evaluate field data on cwu and ndvi of crops grown on sodic soils with reduced need for rigorous manual crop measurements in the field and increased accuracy by reducing large variability in measured data this is one of the first research that has been undertaken to improve the estimation of cwu on sodic soils using spatial interpolation techniques and multi component metrics performance this will aid understanding of in season crop health and greenness particularly on rain fed sodic soils various spatial interpolation techniques were tested to estimate cwu for wheat in season in a sodic soil environment cross validation methods failed to give a clear ranking of the interpolation techniques therefore we evaluate the accuracy of these interpolation techniques with multi component evaluation over cross validation methods namely spatial performance metrics kge and spaef and found strong potential for these to help discriminate between models spatial interpolation techniques were found to accurately estimate cwu which indicated in season crop health greenness and vigour in the sodic soil environment suggesting there is a reduced need for detailed plot wise field surveying for the measurement of cwu the data set indicated the adverse impacts of sodic soil on seasonal cwu and crop health cwu and ndvi were significantly reduced at the hs site compared to the ms site especially close to flowering this indicates that crops at the hs site were under greater water stress overall the study improves our understanding of the variation of in season crop performance due to the variations of cwu and also provides a clear direction for selecting appropriate spatial interpolation models that can accurately estimate cwu on sodic soils at a field scale moreover this will provide a basis to develop techniques with the capacity to assist farmers in making suitable management decisions for improving crop performance on sodic soils in water

9976,crop water use can be a useful indicator of in season crop conditions including health and greenness on sodic soils however in field manual measurements of crop water use can be tedious time and labour intensive and may also exhibit large spatial variability and inefficient for surveying large areas here we propose a novel approach to estimate in field crop water use of wheat using spatial interpolation techniques at critical crop development stages tillering and close to flowering on a moderately sodic and a highly sodic site in southern queensland australia the six spatial interpolation techniques ordinary kriging empirical bayes kriging inverse distance weighting spline local polynomial interpolation and radial basis function were employed on ground measured crop water use data and compared to accurately estimate the spatial distribution of crop water use initially the comparison was made using root mean square error mean absolute error and coefficient of determination values using cross validation for a more clear comparison and to account for complexities of site specific crop water use distribution the standardized multi component model performance efficiency metrics i e kling gupta efficiency and spatial efficiency were adopted and tested over cross validation techniques results showed that kling gupta efficiency was slightly better at selecting the optimum interpolation models for crop water use estimation at a field scale than the spatial efficiency metric spline and local polynomial interpolation were relatively better estimators of crop water use for both the sites at tillering while the radial basis function and spline were superior close to flowering the estimated crop water use was positively and closely associated with seasonal greenseeker normalized difference vegetation index data r2 0 49 and 0 39 at tillering and r2 0 71 and 0 62 at close to flowering for the moderately sodic and highly sodic sites respectively the research improves our understanding of selecting appropriate spatial interpolation methods for in season crop water use estimation that could help detect changes in crop health due to in field and seasonal variations of crop water use in a sodic soil environment keywords cross validation kling gupta efficiency spatial efficiency normalized difference vegetation index crop development stage seasonal variations 1 introduction sodic soils occupy 581 million ha worldwide with 340 million ha located in australia rengasamy 2006 2016 rengasamy and sumner 1998 in australia sodic soil is categorized as non sodic when the exchangeable sodium percentage esp is 6 moderately sodic at esp 6 15 and highly sodic at esp 15 northcote and skene 1972 crop production on sodic soil is adversely affected due to soil structural degradation which limits water infiltration and decreases soil water holding capacity where dispersive soils are also saline the high salt concentrations can be toxic to plants especially high chloride cl concentrations and this can affect water uptake dalal et al 2002 dang et al 2006 2008 the resulting reduction in water availability poses a significant threat to crop production dang et al 2006 particularly in rain fed areas where crops often rely on stored soil moisture due to seasonal variability in rainfall dang et al 2016 hochman et al 2017 variations in crop water uptake may directly influence crop health and or yield variability in field dang et al 2019 hence accurate estimation of crop water use cwu in the field is an important component to determine seasonal crop water requirements crop growth and health and greenness under sodic soil conditions electromagnetic induction instruments geonics em38 canada have proven to be a useful ground based proximal sensing tool for in season measurements of cwu dang et al 2011 foley 2013 rigney 2011 em38 metres measure apparent electrical conductivity eca of the crop root zone which can be converted to stored soil water mm value using a site specific calibration dang et al 2011 foley 2013 this can be used to calculate cwu by comparing the stored soil water at sowing with succeeding crop growth stages however despite notable advances in proximal sensing techniques they can still be tedious as well as time and labour intensive when surveying large agricultural areas in addition in situ measurements may include errors due to manual handling of an instrument which may increase data variability as an alternative remote sensing and geo spatial modelling can potentially be employed this uses satellite imagery products and or various geo statistical and spatial modelling approaches to provide a wide range of solutions at a field regional and or national scale the use of these methods has been reported for soil moisture estimation crop growth estimation and yield prediction souza et al 2016 yao et al 2013 this can reduce the need for laborious field sampling and data collection nevertheless remote sensing and spatial modelling techniques only provide parameter estimations which need to be validated via adequate field measured data points in addition the accuracy of these techniques might vary on the site specific conditions and sample size which needs to be scrutinized spatial interpolation is one of the popular geo spatial modelling techniques this approach uses geo statistical and deterministic approaches to predict data for unmeasured locations based on the proximity of their nearest neighbourhood or the minimum distance from measured data points chai et al 2011 losser et al 2014 xiao et al 2016 deterministic techniques rely on mathematical functions to create a surface from measured point data in contrast geo statistical techniques utilize both statistical and mathematical functions for interpolating surfaces johnston et al 2001 researchers have been applying geo statistics in preference to classical statistics especially in studies of the distribution of soil properties to estimate outcomes more precisely for unmeasured points behera and shukla 2015 bhunia et al 2018 liu et al 2006 researchers suggested that a minimum of 28 data points are required to produce accurate interpolation results at regional or field scale mapping agerberg 2020 li and heap 2014 however a greater number of data points can be used for more accurate estimations if the data is available a number of studies have been conducted at various scales on spatial interpolation techniques with variable accuracy in their ability to estimate outcomes demonstrated table 1 it is thus clear that spatial interpolation models can be used at various scales field regional national etc to estimate the outcomes and mapping that may reduce the problems associated with rigorous manual field data collection and may also increase data accuracy and precision even with a few measured data points however selecting appropriate interpolation models to provide greater insight into field variability is challenging in addition there is a limited understanding of which spatial models perform best in estimating the outcomes at various spatial extensions since the accuracy of these spatial models is heavily reliant on the closeness of the measured data spatial extension and site specific soil and environmental conditions therefore it is necessary to test and compare a number of models in their ability to estimate the outcomes while a number of studies have been conducted on spatial interpolation techniques at various spatial scales and in different regions however studies have not been reported so far where in season cwu on a field scale is estimated using these interpolation techniques to help understand crop growth greenness and seasonal vigour and that too in water limited sodic soil environments this study thus seeks to understand the ability of a range of spatial interpolation techniques to estimate seasonal variations of cwu on sodic soils in this study we compared a number of spatial interpolation techniques to estimate cwu on moderately sodic ms and highly sodic hs soil at a field scale for estimation and spatial distribution of cwu sim cwu we used seasonal ground measured cwu obs cwu data from an em38 instrument at tillering and close to the flowering of wheat crops we further employed a novel method to compare the accuracy of these interpolation models using the multi component kling gupta efficiency metric kge kling and gupta 2009 and the spatial efficiency metric spaef koch et al 2018 over cross validation methods finally the most accurately estimated sim cwu of both stages and sites were used to estimate seasonal crop health and greenness using greenseeker normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data we hypothesized that appropriate selection of spatial interpolation techniques can provide accurate estimations of seasonal cwu at field scale that can be used to indicate crop health and greenness particularly on rain fed sodic soils which may reduce the need for the extensive labour intensive and tedious process of detailed plot wise measurements of obs cwu in the field the specific objectives of this study are 1 to quantify the impacts of sodic soil constraints on seasonal cwu 2 to evaluate the performance of spatial interpolation techniques for accurate estimation of cwu at field scale and 3 to quantify the impact of seasonal cwu variation on the changes of crop health and greenness on sodic soil the study will provide a basis to develop techniques with the capacity to assist farmers in making suitable management decisions for improving crop performance on sodic soils in water limited environments 2 materials and methods the methodological design of this study consists of the identification of suitable experimental sites collection of in season crop environment and soil data followed by the statistical analysis of this data using a range of analytical approaches fig 1 2 1 site description and experimental design the experiment was performed on two sites one ms 28 15º s and 150 22º e and the other hs 28 08º s and 150 15º e near goondiwindi in southern queensland australia both sites have well structured grey vertisols soils with high clay content and are located at an average elevation of 268 m above mean sea level with 1 m elevation variation within a site both sites are dominated by sodic soil constraints including high esp and cl concentrations especially in the subsoil 100 150 cm das et al 2021b during the normal crop growing season from may to october air temperature varied between 5 and 35 for both sites with seasonal means of 14 7 and 14 9 for the ms and hs sites respectively mean relative humidity was 54 6 and 54 3 and total in season crop rainfall was 86 0 mm and 85 6 mm for the ms and hs site respectively fig 2 das et al 2021b a uniform area was selected for the experiments in both sites based on acquired eca readings we used a randomized complete block design at both the experimental sites each with eight replications four for destructive sampling and plant biophysical measurements i e 72 plots and another four for grain yield 72 plots measurements at maturity yield data was not reported in this study at each experiment site 18 wheat genotypes were tested making a total of 144 plots 4 columns and 36 rows das et al 2021b each plot was 5 2 m and had five planting rows at 30 cm spacing crops at both sites were sown on 24th may 2018 and harvested on 2nd november 2018 2 2 soil sampling and analysis at each site soil samples were collected from a minimum of eight points using a hydraulic sampling rig to take 50 mm diameter soil cores to a depth of 150 cm the soil samples were dried at 40 and ground to 2 mm in a 1 5 soil water suspension iso 2005 ph ec and chloride cl were measured and the ec of saturated extract ecse was then computed from ec 1 5 and clay content was determined using the pipette method day 1965 shaw 1997 exchangeable na and cation exchange capacity cec were measured using a 1 m nh4cl ph 8 5 extraction solution tucker 1985 and esp was calculated from exchangeable na relative to cec the volumetric moisture content in percentage was determined after drying samples at 105 ºc to obtain the gravimetric soil moisture content and multiplying this with the soil bulk density bd das et al 2021b soil physio chemical properties of both sites are illustrated in fig 3 das et al 2021b 2 3 plant reflectance measurements a handheld greenseeker trimble inc sunnyvale ca was used to measure ndvi of each plot at tillering at 65 70 days after sowing das and close to flowering 110 112 das to monitor crop health and growth at both the experimental sites the sensor was operated at an average speed of 0 84 m s at 0 5 m elevation above the canopy 2 4 electro magnetic induction and crop water use measurements plot wise apparent electrical conductivity eca was measured with an electromagnetic induction emi instrument geonics em38 canada at tillering and close to flowering a handheld global position system gps garmin 64sx garmin australasia pty ltd was used to record ground control points to the corresponding plot wise eca values the emi measurements required site specific calibration before commencing the survey the calibration of eca was carried out against cumulative soil water the cumulative soil water can be calculated using eca readings in vertical 0 150 cm depth or horizontal 0 75 cm depth dipole mode or as a function of above ground height if the em38 instrument is lifted off the ground for recording dang et al 2011 we operated the emi instrument in a vertical mode and the eca data were recorded for each plot with the response functions for heterogeneous profiles provided by mcneill 1980 the em measurement for vertical dipole are expressed in eq 1 huth and poulton 2007 1 ecv 0 e c a z ϕ v z z where z is depth explained as depth ratio to the inter coil space e c a z is the reading value of e c a ds m at a z depth ϕ v z are density function of vertical dipoles finally crop water use obs cwu was calculated eq 2 as the sum of the change in soil water within the root zone from sowing to tillering and sowing to close to flowering dang et al 2006 2011 a total of 72 data samples from each site were used for cwu measurements the points were evenly distributed over the sites 2 obs cwu soil water at sowing soil water at tillering or close to flowering in crop rain 2 5 spatial interpolation techniques we applied two geo statistical ok and ebk and four deterministic idw spline lpi and rbf interpolation techniques under spatial interpolation in arcgis 8 0 software platform esri ltd ca usa to estimate and spatially distribute cwu sim cwu on the basis of obs cwu point data at field scale 2 5 1 ordinary kriging the ok follows a constant trend only within a local neighbourhood leroux 2019 this technique explains variation through the spatial correlation between points based on distance or direction by applying a semivariogram to determine spatial continuity the semivariogram explains the statistical correlation strength as a function of distance the application of geostatistics requires the existence of a spatial framework in which observations are proximity to one another than those that are distant can be determined using spatial autocorrelation seyedmohammadi et al 2016 the distance at which spatial correlation disappears is known as a range sill refers to the maximum variation at which the semivariogram stabilizes while nugget is related to short range variation in the dataset bhunia et al 2018 pacific nothwest national laboratory 2015 the nugget sill ratio was computed to determine spatial dependence of the sim cwu a ratio 0 25 signifies strong 0 25 0 75 moderate and 0 75 is considered as a weak spatial autocorrelation respectively bhunia et al 2018 cambardella et al 1994 a variogram y d explains spatial variability of z a regionalized variable can be expressed as eq 3 buytaert et al 2006 gupta et al 2017 haan 2002 3 y d 1 2 n d i 1 n d z x i z x i d ² where y d is the semivariance n d is the number of data pairs in a class of distance d z x i is a data value at i point z x i d is a data value of the nearest point at a distance d the variogram values for a distance d that is half the mean squared difference between z x i and z x i d values lark 2000 the semivariogram for our study was selected after testing them at different lags kernel functions to obtain the best model fit the ok can be expressed as eq 4 leroux 2019 4 z s m s e s where z s is the value of the attribute at s spatial location m is a deterministic trend and e is the autocorrelation error which relies on s spatial location 2 5 2 empirical bayes kriging the ebk method applies an intrinsic random function mirzaei and sakizadeh 2016 this model automates the design function of a kriging model which is regarded as the challenging part of spatial interpolation gupta et al 2017 the ebk relies on the assumption that the approximated semivariogram is the real accurate semivariogram of the area and a linear forecast exemplifies spatial variable damping the resulting good non stationary algorithm stretches local trends when there is sufficient data availability and enables bending to a beforehand mean in poor data coverage knotters et al 2010 krivoruchko 2012 krivoruchko and butler 2013 2 5 3 inverse distance weighting the idw estimates values for un measured location points using the values of linear combination at known nearby locational points the weights allotted to the unknown points are an inverse function of their distance from the known points accordingly it is assumed that the points in proximity acquire higher weights than far off points this can be expressed as eq 5 srivastava et al 2019 5 y l 1 ⅆ i p i 1 n 1 d i p where ⅆ i the distance between known and unknown location points p is the power parameter and n is the number of data points the value of the power parameter in idw can be determined based on the evaluation of errors in estimation collins and bolstad 1996 this power influences the accuracy of idw with the increase of power the weight decreases and distance increases usually a power 2 is mostly recommended which results in inverse squared distance or inverse squared srivastava et al 2019 we have also obtained the best result with power 2 by testing different power parameters and neighbours 2 5 4 spline this method uses a small number of data points at a time to predict the outcomes burrough and mcdonnell 1998 spline uses a polynomial function which expresses pieces of a line or a surface being fitted together smoothly webster and oliver 2001 the places where the pieces join are known as knots they might hold a significant influence on the estimation however knot selection is arbitrary the local surfaces fit polynomial surfaces for prediction by using nearby points burrough and mcdonnell 1998 however the method often requires careful consideration when the input data on a grid shows the absence of direct information for accurate prediction hence the prediction will not show direct outcomes on residual variance isaaks and srivastava 1989 spline produces reliable results with gentle varying surfaces and also in the analysis of local geometry that helps as input in many process based models lam 1983 srivastava et al 2019 consequently this method aids analysis where there is no large change in a topographic gradient within a short distance robinson and metternicht 2006 2 5 5 local polynomial interpolation the lpi uses points within the defined neighbourhood rather than the whole dataset the neighbourhoods tend to overlap and the polynomial fit that estimates the surface value at the centre of the neighbourhood is considered as the predicted outcome esri 2008 the lpi is reported to be reliable and produces a surface with less variation within a short distance bhunia et al 2018 johnston et al 2001 the best results were obtained using an exponential kernel function with polynomial order 2 in the lpi for our study 2 5 6 radial basis function the rbf predicts values identical to those measured at the same point and the generated surface is required to pass through each measured point bhunia et al 2018 the prediction results can be higher or lower than the range of measured values li et al 2007 2011 the rbf fits a surface through measured point values and minimizes the curvature of the surface this method performs well when there is no large change in surface values within a short range of distances johnston et al 2001 the rbf can be mathematically expressed in eq 6 talmi and gilat 1977 the z variable is explained on an x prediction point as the sum of two components mitášová and mitáš 1993 wu et al 2019 6 z x t x i 1 n b i ψ ⅆ i where ψ ⅆ i is the rbf ⅆ i represents a distance between observed and predicted point x n is data points and t x represents the trend function and can be expressed as eq 7 7 t x i 1 m a i f i x where f i x represents a set of linearly independent functions b i and a i are the coefficients acquired from n m system linear equations eqs 8 and 9 8 z x k i 1 m a i f i x k i 1 n b i ψ ⅆ ik for k 1 2 n 9 i 1 n b i f k x i 0 for k 1 2 m in the rbf we have obtained the best fit using an inverse multi quadratic function imq wu et al 2019 xie et al 2011 after testing with different neighbours and functions imq can be expressed in eq 10 10 ψ d 1 d 2 c 2 where d represents a distance from the sample to estimation location and c represents a smoothing function 2 6 statistical analyses 2 6 1 t test we performed a paired sample t test to determine whether any significant differences existed between the site mean of obs cwu at the ms and hs sites at tillering and close to flowering 2 6 2 performance assessment of spatial interpolation models using cross validation methods we used the leave one out and split sampling cross validation approaches to evaluate the performance of spatial interpolation models and compare their ability to accurately predict cwu the leave one out approach excludes a single data value from the dataset and then performs interpolation in its absence the difference between observed and cwu predicted values of that excluded data is computed in the split sampling method the data set is split into a 75 training and 25 testing set erdogan 2009 wu et al 2019 the performance of the interpolation based sim cwu was evaluated with rmse mean absolute error mae and r2 values in prediction eqs 11 13 isaaks and srivastava 1989 li and heap 2014 wu et al 2019 to rank the interpolated models smaller rmse and mae close to zero and higher r2 close to 1 were considered as the selection parameters wu et al 2019 11 r m s e 1 n i 1 n z i z x i 2 12 m a e 1 n i 1 n z i z x i 13 r 2 i 1 n z ⅈ z i z x i z x i i 1 n z i z i 2 i 1 n z x i z x i 2 where n is the total number of data points z i represents observed value at i z x i is the predicted value at i z i represents an average observed value and z x i represents an average predicted value 2 6 3 performance assessment of spatial interpolation models using spatial performance metrics we computed two spatial performance metrics over the cross validation method to evaluate the performance of spatial interpolation models a kling gupta efficiency kge and b spatial efficiency metric spaef the kge metric was first proposed in hydrological modelling for evaluating the performance of simulated discharge patterns kling and gupta 2009 we bring the concept of the kge to evaluate the performance of spatial interpolation models in cwu estimation for agricultural applications this metric is designed with three standardized components correlation variability and bias each of these carries equal weight in the model eqs 14 and 15 the multi component structure is beneficial because it does not rely on a single component and thus it can be considered a more comprehensive approach than cross validation for evaluating the spatial model efficiency koch et al 2018 14 kge 1 α q 1 2 β q 1 2 γ q 1 2 15 α q ρ o b s s i m β q σ s i m σ o b s a n d γ q µ s i m µ o b s where α q is the pearson correlation coefficient between ground measured obs cwu and interpolated cwu sim cwu β q represents variability and γ q represents bias although the multi component nature of kge has been reported to be suitable to evaluate spatial model performance gupta et al 2012 krause et al 2005 some researchers have advocated that a more holistic and balanced metric may be required for a more comprehensive assessment of spatial model performance hence with this idea koch et al 2018 introduced the spatial efficiency metric spaef as a multi component metric in preference to kge we adapted the concept of spaef in our study to compare the efficiency with kge and cross validation for the estimation of cwu through spatial interpolation techniques the spaef values range between and 1 and can be expressed using eqs 16 and 17 demirel et al 2018 koch et al 2018 16 spaef 1 α 1 ² β 1 ² γ 1 ² 17 α ρ o b s s i m β σ s i m μ s i m σ o b s μ o b s and γ j 1 n m i n k j l j j 1 n k j where α is the pearson correlation coefficient between obs cwu and sim cwu β is the fraction of the coefficient indicating coefficient of variation cv ratio between obs cwu and sim cwu γ is the histogram intersection between obs cwu k and sim cwu l the correlation α values range between 0 and 1 indicating a positive or negative association between obs cwu and sim cwu a high cv ratio β indicates greater variability in the sim cwu model and vice versa a higher histogram match γ value indicates similarities between obs cwu and sim cwu we performed a two sample t test one column per variable between the interpolation models based on kge and spaef scores for each site and crop stage to determine whether the performance was significantly different between each interpolation method for estimating cwu sim cwu 2 6 4 crop health forecasting we used a linear regression model using n standardization with a 5 test significance level to forecast crop health in response to cwu we used greenseeker ndvi data obs cwu and sim cwu at tillering and close to the flowering stage to perform the regression analysis a k fold 10 cross validation method was used for validation purposes the accuracy of the model was tested using r2 and rmse in the cross validation 2 6 5 analysis of variance anova anova was performed to determine if there are any significant interactions between wheat genotypes between two soil sites based on the predicted ndvi as a function of cwu the testing of significant differences between levels within each factor was performed using fisher s protected least significant difference lsd test at the 5 significance level the variables were treated as nested effects and replicate was fitted as a random effect all statistical analyses were performed in rstudio 3 6 2 rstudio pbc statistical software platform 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil constraints varied between the ms and hs sites the depth wise distribution of soil physio chemical properties fig 3 showed that both sites have similar clay contents 41 58 and thus are likely to have a similar water holding capacity both sites also have a higher esp in the subsoil 19 for ms and 24 for hs at 100 150 cm than the surface soil 2 7 for ms and 14 for hs at 0 10 cm in addition both sites have high cl concentrations in the subsoil with concentrations substantially higher at the hs site than at the ms site 700 750 mg kg for ms and 2300 mg kg for hs at 100 150 cm high subsoil esp and cl concentrations can restrict root water uptake and reduce rooting depth dang et al 2008 2019 it would be anticipated that the higher esp and cl at the hs site will reduce crop water availability to a greater extent than the ms site in season rainfall data indicated that both sites experienced similar in crop rainfall over the study period fig 2 3 2 impacts of sodic soil constraints on seasonal crop water use cwu for wheat the obs cwu data for both sites were tested for normality table s1 the skewness values between 0 5 and 0 5 indicate that the data is symmetric good data corporation 2020 further a positive kurtosis value close to 3 0 table s1 suggests that our obs cwu data for both sites and crop stages are not flat and followed a nearly normal distribution hence the obs cwu data was considered suitable for spatial interpolation for the estimation of cwu sim cwu this contrasts with another study where the authors performed a square root transformation to normalize the data before performing a kriging based interpolation for estimating groundwater ec in northern iran seyedmohammadi et al 2016 paired sample t test results showed that cwu obs cwu was significantly different between the two sites p 0 0001 close to flowering but not at tillering p 0 93 fig 4 in season meteorological data fig 2 and pre planting volumetric soil moisture data fig 3f suggested that both sites had similar p 0 05 in crop rainfall air temperature and stored soil moisture in the profile therefore the significant difference p 0 0001 in cwu between the two sites close to flowering confirms that crops grown at the hs site were under greater water stress compared to the ms site due to the impact of soil constraints while cwu was similar for both sites up until tillering cwu did not increase significantly between tillering and flowering at the hs site this contrasted with the ms site where nearly 30 mm of water was extracted that made the difference in cwu 30 mm p 0 0001 between the ms and hs site close to the flowering fig 4b this pattern of water use is consistent with the greater cl concentrations in the subsoil of the hs site limiting water uptake later in the growing season as the crop root system expanded into the subsoil overall our results suggest that in a sodic soil environment with a saline subsoil wheat is likely to experience water stress from pre flowering to grain filling 3 3 comparing spatial interpolation models for estimation of cwu the spatial dependence of cwu data was explained by semivariogram models at each site and stage the best fit was obtained using an exponential type at our experiment sites at 12 lags suggesting less structural variation of the data as recommended by the environmental systems research institute esri 2016 a careful selection of lag size is important in an empirical semivariogram choosing a too large or too small lag size may often increase errors in autocorrelation a simple rule for choosing a lag size is to multiply the lag size by the number of lags which should be about half the largest distance among all points esri 2016 in this study the multiplication of lag sizes with a number of lags exhibited about half the largest distance amongst all the data points table 2 the nugget sill ratio 0 25 and or 0 25 0 75 table 2 indicates strong to moderate spatial dependence of the obtained semivariogram for our study a mean error between 0 5 to 0 5 m table 2 suggests less variation in the simulated model wu et al 2019 bhunia et al 2018 reported that the semivariogram for their soil organic matter estimation study showed a varied spatial dependence on the field data our semivariogram statistics indicated a similar and relatively uniform spatial autocorrelation for both sites and cropping stages 3 3 1 performance comparison between spatial interpolation techniques with cross validation methods performance assessment based on the individual model parameter r2 rmse and mae of cross validation showed inconsistent results between the interpolation techniques therefore it was difficult for us to select an appropriate cross validation parameter to compare the model performance overall the leave one out cross validation showed that for the ms site and both crop stages the ebk performed slightly better in predicting cwu sim cwu than other interpolation techniques rmse 10 1 mm mae 7 8 mm r2 0 55 for tillering and rmse 11 9 mm mae 9 8 mm r2 0 57 for tillering and close to flowering whereas for the hs site the rbf performed slightly better than the other interpolation techniques at both crop stages rmse 12 0 mm mae 9 01 mm r2 0 68 for tillering and rmse 8 0 mm mae 6 2 mm r2 0 85 for close to flowering table 3 on the other hand the split sampling cross validation showed that obs cwu and sim cwu together were slightly better correlated for both sites and crop stages with lesser rmse and mae values compared to the leave one out method while comparing between the performance of the interpolation techniques based on split sampling cross validation the ok has performed slightly better in predicting cwu sim cwu at the ms site for both crop stages rmse 5 6 mm mae 4 6 mm r2 0 55 for tillering and rmse 7 6 mm mae 6 1 mm r2 0 55 for close to flowering whereas for the hs site the ok rmse 4 9 mm mae 3 8 mm r2 0 46 at tillering and the idw rmse 4 2 mm mae 3 4 mm r2 0 88 at close to flowering stage has performed slightly better than the other interpolation techniques table 4 the leave one out cross validation method is usually less sensitive to bias as it considers the entire dataset during a run however this method might result in a high variation in the model testing due to considering model testing against one data point thus this method can be more time consuming than split sampling cross validation sharma 2020 while the split sampling cross validation maintains a balance between training and testing data set by splitting them for obtaining stability in estimation by reducing error xu and goodacre 2018 thus a balanced distribution 50 in each or 75 and 25 can potentially reduce the data variability and be faster than a leave one out method however this can be site specific and heavily reliant on the size of the dataset its area coverage and the parameters to be used for prediction wu et al 2019 applied both cross validation methods to compare the interpolation models estimate of river bathymetry and cross sectional sounding of the lowermost mississippi river and found a close association between observed and interpolated data bhunia et al 2018 used a cross validation method to compare the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon estimated from various interpolation techniques and reported that ok was superior having lower rmse and mae our split sampling cross validation results also suggest the ability of ok in cwu estimation at a field scale however the leave one out cross validation suggests a slightly greater ability of ebk and rbf compared to the others in the estimation of cwu hence overall a diversified performance was observed by the interpolation techniques based on the two cross validation methods employed in this study and also it was difficult to discriminate between the model performances using either r2 or rmse or mae this suggested that under certain conditions a single cross validation model component r2 or rmse or mae is not enough to differentiate the ability of interpolation models since these components individually provided a diversified statistic of the model performance to address this issue a multi component metric was adapted demirel et al 2018 kling and gupta 2009 koch et al 2018 that may potentially provide a more comprehensive evaluation in the selection of appropriate interpolation techniques 3 3 2 performance comparison between spatial interpolation techniques with multi component model performance metrics the multi component kge metric scores at the ms site and at tillering stage table 5 and fig 5a b showed that the spline interpolation kge 0 69 ebk kge 0 65 idw kge 0 63 and rbf kge 0 66 were significantly better p 0 05 than ok kge 0 45 and lpi kge 0 59 at the hs site the kge metric scores showed that the performance of lpi kge 0 70 was better p 0 01 than the other interpolation methods at close to flowering the kge metric scores for the ms site table 5 and fig 5a b showed that rbf kge 0 74 and spline kge 0 69 were significantly better than ok kge 0 47 at p 0 01 and better than ebk kge 0 64 idw kge 0 66 and lpi kge 0 59 at p 0 05 whereas at the hs site spline kge 0 82 and rbf kge 0 78 were significantly better than ok kge 0 37 and ebk kge 0 47 at p 0 01 and better than lpi kge 0 49 and idw kge 0 61 at p 0 05 koch et al 2018 reported that the optimal score of kge should be 1 0 later on knoben et al 2019 reported that the kge scores between 0 41 and 1 0 can be considered as satisfactory model performance hence we also found a satisfactory range of kge scores for all the tested interpolation models for both sites for the multi component spaef metric scores at the ms site at tillering table 6 and fig 5c d the rbf spaef 0 27 performed similarly to ebk spaef 0 25 spline spaef 0 23 and lpi spaef 0 20 but was significantly better p 0 05 than ok spaef 0 14 and idw spaef 0 13 at the hs site the performance of lpi spaef 0 31 was significantly better p 0 01 than ok spaef 0 03 and ebk spaef 0 09 and better than spline spaef 0 14 at p 0 05 however no significant differences p 0 05 were observed between lpi with idw spaef 0 26 and rbf spaef 0 25 at close to the flowering the spaef metric scores table 6 and fig 5c d showed that the ebk spaef 0 36 performed similarly to spline spaef 0 30 idw spaef 0 33 and lpi spaef 0 32 but significantly better p 0 05 than ok spaef 0 24 and rbf kge 0 29 at the hs site spline spaef 0 40 and rbf spaef 0 40 had a similar performance p 0 10 however both performed significantly better p 0 05 than ok spaef 0 22 ebk spaef 0 21 idw spaef 0 32 and lpi spaef 0 26 similar to the kge metric score the spaef metric score also has the optimal value of 1 0 koch et al 2018 and we achieved reasonable scores for all the interpolation models which were between 0 03 and 0 4 for both sites table 6 overall we observed that the performance of interpolation models differed between the sites and between the cross validation kge and spaef metric scores considering 1 as an optimal metric score for kge and spaef we found that the kge generally exhibited closer to the optimum than spaef a greater range of values for kge between sites compared to spaef also suggested a clearer distinction at a field scale koch et al 2018 suggested the spaef is a bias insensitive metric that can be utilized to compare the relative variables with different units to optimize spatial model performance however knoben et al 2019 reported that the modelling community is still not aware of any uniformly reliable metric for evaluating model performances that can have greater implications over a broad area of interest thus it is important to test and decide the most important aspects of a model for further utilization of the predicted outcomes on a case by case basis hence we screened out the relatively better performing interpolation models based on cross validation kge and spaef metric scores that have shown a greater ability to predict cwu sim cwu the best estimation and spatial distribution of sim cwu for both the sites and cropping stages was provided in figures s1 s2 3 4 in season crop health forecast in response to crop water use the seasonal cwu was used to forecast the health and greenness of wheat genotypes on sodic soils fig 6 a significant and positive p 0 05 correlation was observed between greenseeker ndvi and cwu for both the sites and cropping stages suggesting that seasonal crop health and greenness for wheat can be heavily reliant on appropriate water use on sodic soil the correlation between greenseeker ndvi and both obs cwu and sim cwu data also indicated a relatively closer association between ndvi and sim cwu compared to obs cwu at both the sites and crop stages fig 6 the results also showed that the kge score based selection of interpolation techniques slightly better predicted ndvi than either spaef or cross validation based selection for both sites and crop stages with r2 of 0 49 for the ms and 0 41 for the hs site at tillering stage and r2 of 0 71 for the ms and 0 62 for the hs site at close to flowering fig 6 when comparing the crop stages and sites we observed a greater association between cwu and ndvi close to flowering compared to tillering suggesting that this is a vital stage before grain filling and can provide maximum insights into crop health and greenness due to the variations in cwu in field overall our results suggest that interpolation based spatial modelling provides accurate estimates of cwu sim cwu on a field scale that could reduce the variability of manually ground measured cwu obs cwu data and has a slightly greater ability to forecast crop health and greenness beisel et al 2018 used ndvi to assess plant health in response to abiotic stress studies reported that the ndvi of healthy vegetation gradually increases from the beginning of the crop season reaches a peak at the middle of the season or before flowering and then saturates before decreasing as the crop senesces towards the season end mkhabela and mashinini 2005 turvey and mclaurin 2012 we also observed that the ndvi reached a peak 0 76 for the ms and 0 55 for the hs site close to flowering compared to tillering 0 65 for the ms and 0 48 for the hs site figs 7 and 8 greater cwu at the ms site near flowering fig 4 corresponds with the higher ndvi and hence healthier crop growth close to flowering at the ms site thus a closer association was observed between ndvi and cwu close to flowering compared to tillering eklundh 1998 reported that 10 36 of the variation in ndvi values could be explained by monthly variation in rainfall further the author observed that vegetation growth and rainfall correlation might be constrained depending on soil type soil water holding capacity and soil constraints in this study we also observed that the crops were healthier at the ms site than at the hs site at both growth stages the lower ndvi at the hs 0 55 compared to the ms site 0 76 close to flowering despite similar in season climatic conditions fig 2 and starting soil moisture fig 3f suggests that the higher sodic soil constraints especially high subsoil cl concentration significantly reduced crop health and greenness by restricting cwu at the hs site variations were also observed between wheat genotypes at both ms and hs sites close to flowering fig 9 further the anova results comparing the ndvi of thirteen wheat genotypes predicted from sim cwu indicated that bremer condo corack elmore emu rock flanker gladius gregory hartog magenta scout sunco and trojan had significantly greater ndvi p 0 05 at the ms than hs site close to flowering however the ndvi of five genotypes janz lancer mace mitch and wallup did not differ significantly p 0 05 between sites or consistent in performance between the ms and hs site due to its higher values at the hs site compared to the other genotypes this suggests that those five wheat genotypes had greater water use in high sodic soil constraints compared to the other genotypes that helped them to maintain sufficient greenness even grown with high soil constraints overall the results suggest that cwu significantly affects the health and greenness of wheat cultivars on sodic soils and can be restricted more in higher sodic soil environments the significant deterioration of genotypic health and greenness at the hs site relative to the ms site close to flowering would be expected to negatively impact yield at maturity a number of studies have reported the efficacy of different spatial interpolation techniques in different environments to estimate parameters at regional to national scales for example rodrigues et al 2018 reported that the idw and rbf can be better estimators of soil physical properties and soil water content than a kriging interpolation in the brazilian semi arid region on non sodic soil later on srivastava et al 2019 reported kriging with external drift ked interpolation n 82 estimated soil moisture content with slightly less error than idw lpi and ok in indian humid subtropical and non sodic soil climatic conditions nazarifar et al 2014 also compared spatial interpolation methods for the estimation of wheat water requirement and distribution under drought conditions on non sodic soils in arid hamedan province iran and reported the suitability of using kriging over other methods overall a diversified performance of interpolation techniques was observed by previous studies in the estimation of soil water content and or soil properties distribution in different geographical locations under variable environmental conditions however we are currently not aware of any reported studies that attempted to evaluate the performance of interpolation models for the estimation of cwu and that too in sodic soil environments recent studies reported that water stress induced by high subsoil constraints esp 15 and cl concentrations 1000 mg kg can be the largest constraint for crop growth and development on rain fed sodic soils das et al 2020 2021a b those studies also report that a higher spatial variability and incomplete canopy cover can be major challenges to representative sampling in the field on sodic soils compared to non sodic soils although spatial variability in crop growth and canopy cover can be tackled using an unmanned aerial vehicle uav imaging and by applying image segmentation thresholding to aid extraction of actual plot wise vegetative cover das et al 2020 2021a b a close and systematic selection of interpolation points 5 m interval uniformly within a site in spatial modelling was important to obtain an accurate estimation of cwu in the present study overall we have successfully demonstrated the potential of interpolation techniques in the estimation of cwu in water limited sodic soil environments results demonstrated that among others the spline lpi and rbf were found effective for estimating cwu on sodic soils at a field scale as mentioned earlier in the sections 2 5 4 2 5 5 and 2 5 6 these three types of interpolation techniques generally perform well in the gently varied surface with no large change in topographic slope within short range of distance as mentioned in section 2 1 the study sites used for this research were nearly flat with a 1 m elevation difference within a site hence the uniform topographic nature of the sites might have improved the estimation using spline and or rbf interpolation techniques when applied to the moderate sample size n 72 with close proximity although mueller et al 2004 suggested that using a large sample size can enhance the accuracy of most of the interpolation techniques however xie et al 2011 reported this as unrealistic since it involves high effort in data collection and model simulation and analysis we also observed that the spline lpi and or rbf perform well with a small or moderate sample size nevertheless the distance based techniques i e ok ebk and idw could not fit better than the spline lpi and or rbf while working with a moderate size of data inputs xie et al 2011 reported that the ok is used for theoretical best linear unbiased prediction and thus obtaining an optimal semivariogram with a small size of data such as dataset at a field scale is difficult while spline or lpi works efficiently with small input parameters however kriging based interpolations better deal with the complexities of a semivariogram model such as autocorrelation transformation structure choosing optimal semi variance fitting functions etc to reduce data variability xie et al 2011 laslett et al 1987 have found the spline and ok performed better than idw for soil ph estimation at a regional scale further simpson and wu 2014 reported with greater accuracy using spline than kriging and or idw for lake sedimentation study when applied on a small input dataset overall results from the previous studies and our current research suggest that the performance of the interpolation techniques most likely vary based on input parameters surface topography slope relief etc size of input data and distribution and data transformation and thus there is no rule of thumb for using an appropriate interpolation technique rather they should be statistically tested and compared using site specific data hence we have focused more on the evaluation of these interpolation models using a number of metrics including cross validation and multi component scores results suggest that under certain conditions multi component metrics kge and or spaef can be a valuable tool for the selection of an appropriate interpolation technique follow up studies should focus on implementing these methods with more diversified interpolation techniques on a wide range of dataset to check the effectiveness of these techniques at different spatial extension 4 conclusions the present study aimed to provide a method to evaluate field data on cwu and ndvi of crops grown on sodic soils with reduced need for rigorous manual crop measurements in the field and increased accuracy by reducing large variability in measured data this is one of the first research that has been undertaken to improve the estimation of cwu on sodic soils using spatial interpolation techniques and multi component metrics performance this will aid understanding of in season crop health and greenness particularly on rain fed sodic soils various spatial interpolation techniques were tested to estimate cwu for wheat in season in a sodic soil environment cross validation methods failed to give a clear ranking of the interpolation techniques therefore we evaluate the accuracy of these interpolation techniques with multi component evaluation over cross validation methods namely spatial performance metrics kge and spaef and found strong potential for these to help discriminate between models spatial interpolation techniques were found to accurately estimate cwu which indicated in season crop health greenness and vigour in the sodic soil environment suggesting there is a reduced need for detailed plot wise field surveying for the measurement of cwu the data set indicated the adverse impacts of sodic soil on seasonal cwu and crop health cwu and ndvi were significantly reduced at the hs site compared to the ms site especially close to flowering this indicates that crops at the hs site were under greater water stress overall the study improves our understanding of the variation of in season crop performance due to the variations of cwu and also provides a clear direction for selecting appropriate spatial interpolation models that can accurately estimate cwu on sodic soils at a field scale moreover this will provide a basis to develop techniques with the capacity to assist farmers in making suitable management decisions for improving crop performance on sodic soils in water

9977,drought propagation describes the changes in a drought signal as it moves from one major type of drought to another it is important to investigate the propagation among meteorological agricultural and hydrological drought as well as their major impacting factors to improve understanding of the drought propagation relationship monitor agricultural drought and reduce crop losses this study presents the first exploration of the interplay between multiple droughts among different climate zones and seasons in china the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei standardized runoff index sri and self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi were used to represent meteorological agricultural and hydrological drought respectively the pearson correlation coefficient was used to analyze the propagation relationships among different droughts and identify the most sensitive season for drought propagation the lindeman merenda gold lmg method was used to quantify the relative importance of pre precipitation pet potential evapotranspiration and sm soil moisture to hydrological and agricultural drought the propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought was prominent in different seasons at the annual scale over china in general the propagation relationship from agricultural to hydrological drought was weaker than that from meteorological to agricultural drought in northern china arid and semi arid areas there was a stronger propagation relationship from agricultural to hydrological drought in summer and autumn than in spring there was also stronger propagation from agricultural to hydrological drought in eastern china than in western china different climate regions had different major factors driving hydrological drought because of the different climate characteristics however sm was generally the most important driving factor for agricultural drought in all climate regions mulching plastic film might be an effective and feasible method to reduce pet from soil evaporation in sub regions that apply high irrigation levels these findings may also be applied to strengthen the study of artificial regulation of water resources which could be an approach to reducing crop losses from drought keywords meteorological drought hydrological drought agricultural drought china 1 introduction droughts are natural disasters caused by long term water shortage and are fundamentally different from floods and other natural disasters because they usually develop slowly despite the slow development of drought its impact on regional ecology hydrology and economy is huge because the recovery period can be lengthy after the end of the drought jasechko and perrone 2020 mishra and singh 2010 song et al 2020a wang et al 2019a xing et al 2017 the frequency and intensity of drought events have increased under the background of climate warming mishra and singh 2010 yao et al 2018a the demand for water resources in industry and agriculture has increased in line with increases in human population and development huang et al 2015 li et al 2020a therefore it is essential to understand the occurrence and mechanisms behind drought at different spatial and temporal scales in general drought can be divided into meteorological drought hydrological drought agricultural drought and socio economic drought according to different water shortage conditions for meteorological hydrological soil and social systems ding et al 2020 gu et al 2020 lu et al 2017 shi et al 2018 socio economic drought is associated with water resources systems that cannot meet water demands of society and thus affect economic development mishra and singh 2010 shi et al 2018 meteorological drought is defined as a lack of precipitation over a region for a period of time hydrological drought is defined as a period with inadequate water resources surface and subsurface and agricultural drought is usually related to soil moisture and can also lead to crop failure mishra and singh 2010 meteorological drought caused by precipitation shortage is usually the initiator of the other types of drought gu et al 2020 meteorological drought may lead to a decrease in surface runoff or groundwater level resulting in hydrological drought when the duration is sufficient hao and singh 2015 mishra and singh 2010 this decrease in soil water content will affect the process of runoff generation precipitation also needs to replenish soil water deficiency before runoff can be generated as a result agricultural drought can be expected to affect the occurrence of hydrological drought huang et al 2015 li et al 2020a wu et al 2020 china is one of the largest agricultural countries in the world with a large human population there is a considerable range of different terrains and elevations in china leading to a great variation in climate zones under the influence of current and future climate change china is likely to face a severe drought risk wu et al 2019 it is therefore important to study the mechanisms of drought propagation in china much of the current research has focused on the development and use of reliable drought indexes to identify and analyze different types of drought some studies have used the single drought index to investigate drought characteristics for example yao et al 2018a analyzed characteristics of the temporal and spatial variation of meteorological drought in china based on the standardized precipitation index spi and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei forootan et al 2019 used the sea surface temperature and terrestrial water storage to analyze global hydrological drought and found that droughts on 3 6 month timescales were most frequent worldwide shi et al 2018 constructed a new social and economic drought index sedi and analyzed the social and economic drought characteristics of the dongjiang river basin zhang et al 2015 developed the standardized moisture anomaly index szi which combines the advantages of the self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi and spei and accurately determined the characteristics of drought on the loess plateau some scholars have also studied and analyzed the relationship between different types of drought wang et al 2019a comprehensively evaluated the correlation between meteorological drought and hydrological drought in the yellow river basin and found that meteorological drought occurred earlier than hydrological drought huang et al 2015 studied the response of agricultural drought to meteorological drought in the weihe river basin and found that agricultural drought is closely related to meteorological drought and atmospheric circulation was an important factor affecting the drought propagation time leng et al 2015 simulated the future drought change in china and projected that meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts would become more severe and have higher frequencies moreover high temperatures may seriously threaten agricultural drought in future li et al 2020a found that the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought was less than one month whereas it was less than two months from hydrological to agricultural drought although the above studies have deepened our basic understanding of drought propagation and evolution most of the current studies focus on the regional or watershed scale and do not consider the mechanism and differences of drought propagation among different climate zones seasonality is also an important factor affecting drought characteristics aryal and zhu 2020 song et al 2019 however to our knowledge no studies have comparatively analyzed the relationship of drought propagation to agriculture in different climate zones and seasons because the causes of drought formation are extremely complex and the physical factors leading to drought are still poorly understood the formation mechanism varies among different types of drought it is therefore necessary to study the propagation relationship between different types of drought in different climatic regions and seasons to assist in drought early warning both spi and spei are commonly used meteorological drought indicators with multi scale characteristics however spi cannot reflect the drought conditions caused by warming because it only considers precipitation therefore spei is generally considered most suitable for studying the impact of global warming on the severity of meteorological drought yao et al 2018a in addition sri is easy to calculate and has multi scale characteristics and is widely used in the study of hydrological drought ding et al 2021 zhou et al 2021b the calculation of pdsi includes the whole water balance including precipitation soil water content runoff and potential evapotranspiration and thus it can comprehensively describe the regional drought situation song et al 2020b wells et al 2004 proposed scpdsi an improved pdsi that greatly increased the spatial comparability of the indicator and has been widely used in agricultural drought monitoring mishra and singh 2010 wang et al 2015 the overall aim of this study was to better understand the propagation relationships of different types of drought in different seasons and different climate zones the objectives of this study were as follows 1 to analyze the drought propagation relationships in different climate zones according to the sequence of drought occurrence 2 to analyze the differences in the drought propagation relationships in different seasons and 3 to identify the main factors affecting the drought propagation relationships the results will provide a basis for the study and prediction of drought evolution among seasons and in different climatic zones in china and other regions of the world the findings could also be used to inform future early warning and monitoring systems for agricultural drought 2 data and methods 2 1 study area china is located in east asia 3 51 n 53 34 n 73 29 e 135 04 e its land area is approximately 9 63 106 km2 based on ding et al 2020 and zhao et al 2009 we split the study area into eight sub regions based on climate zone sub regions i ii iii iv v vi vii and viii fig 1a for convenience of presentation we included the main plain and plateau regions of china including the northeastern plain qinghai tibet plateau inner mongolia plain yun gui plateau loess plateau north china plain and changjiang downstream plain previous studies have shown that the drought risk in six of the seven regions has generally increased and a decreasing trend of meteorological drought hydrological drought and agricultural drought is apparent in eastern china yao et al 2020b meteorological drought is mainly concentrated in southwest china while agricultural drought and hydrological drought are mainly concentrated in northwest china yao et al 2018a ding et al 2020 and he et al 2017 showed that the vegetation type of china land cover includes cropland 18 total area forest 23 total area desert 14 total area and grassland 32 total area cropland is mainly distributed in the northeastern plain sub region vi sichuan basin and north china plain sub region iii fig 1b forest is mostly located in sub regions i ii iv and v desert is mostly located in northwestern china sub region vii and grassland is mainly distributed in the inner mongolia plain sub region vi and the qinghai tibet plateau sub region viii 2 2 datasets in this study the runoff spei and scpdsi were computed and used to represent the hydrological drought yang et al 2019 meteorological drought guo et al 2020 and agricultural drought ding et al 2020 respectively the runoff data were provided by land climate dynamics institute for atmospheric and climate science eth zurich ghiggi et al 2019 the spatial resolution of data was 0 5 0 5 and the temporal resolution was the monthly average during 1902 2014 the data were produced by the random forest algorithm and trained on observation results streamflow precipitation and temperature the results of the presented dataset were better than an ensemble of 13 state of the art global hydrological model runoff simulations as shown at https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 9228176 the scpdsi data were provided by the climatic research unit university of east anglia uk the dataset also had a 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution and monthly temporal resolution this dataset has been shown to be superior to the scpdsi based on other model simulations van der schrier et al 2013 the spei dataset was provided by vicente serrano et al 2014 the datasets also had spatial and temporal resolution of 0 5 0 5 and a monthly time scale the spei dataset was based on the precipitation and temperature of the climatic research unit cru ts3 0 dataset to compute vicente serrano et al 2010b the datasets of vicente serrano et al 2010b provided spei data at multiple time scales temporal resolution from 1 to 48 month time scales herein we used the spei at 1 month time scales to investigate the seasonal drought relationships https digital csic es handle 10261 153475 the model estimates of soil moisture sm were obtained from european reanalysis interim erai reanalysis products and were provided by the climate data interface cdl version 1 6 9 http mpimet mpg de cdi the spatial resolution was 1 25 0 94 and the temporal resolution was monthly we selected the sm dataset of mean 0 1 m underground because this was the depth used to compute scpdsi in previous studies van der schrier et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 and strongly influenced the crop growth wang et al 2009 the spatial resolution was solved similarly to the other datasets 0 5 0 5 by using the linear interpolation method bigaignon et al 2020 the time series of sm datasets was from 1979 to 2016 to match the time series of the drought index we selected the time series of sm from 1979 to 2014 which has been tested in previous research umair et al 2018 zohaib et al 2019 the precipitation pre and potential evapotranspiration pet data were provided by the cru dataset and were also used to compute spei vicente serrano et al 2010a the datasets also had a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 and a monthly temporal resolution to match the time series of other datasets we selected time series of pre and pet from 1979 to 2014 these pre and pet datasets have been shown to be reliable and accurate by many studies shi et al 2017 vicente serrano et al 2010a 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 drought index analysis the spei is widely used to assess the characteristics of drought vicente serrano et al 2010a 2014 yao et al 2018a the computation procedure of the spei used in the current study followed that of vicente serrano et al 2010a the calculation process of spei was as follows 1 estimation of pet based on the penman s equation 2 determining the accumulation of water deficit d pre pet at different time scales where pre represents precipitation and then 3 normalizing d into a log logistic probability distribution to obtain spei using eqs 1 and 2 the log logistic distribution was defined as 1 f x β α x γ α 1 x γ α β 2 where α β and γ are coefficients to describe the scale and shape of this distribution the spei was calculated as follows 2 spei 2 ln p c 0 c 1 t c 2 t 2 1 d 1 t d 2 t 2 d 3 t 3 where p is the probability of exceeding a determined d value given as p 1 f x the constants expressed above were as follows c0 2 515517 d1 1 432788 c1 0 802853 d2 0 189269 c2 0 010328 and d3 0 001308 the computation method of sri was similar to that of spei gu et al 2020 pointed out that runoff is more in line with the log normal distribution the difference calculation process between sri and spei is that the runoff time series data were inputted in sri to fit the log normal distribution function pdsi is based on the change of evaporation demand of water not just the precipitation anomaly the whole calculation process of pdsi includes many empirical parameters which were evaluated according to the hydrothermal conditions of the study area wells et al 2004 developed a scpdsi algorithm which can determine the weight factor and duration factor according to the hydrological and meteorological variables observed on site it can use the dynamic estimation values to replace the empirical constant used at any point on earth in the original pdsi algorithm and can self correct the empirical parameters the scpdsi enhances the comparison of time and space of drought monitoring results yu et al 2019 more detailed algorithms and computation procedures can be found in wells et al 2004 2 3 2 drought correlation and propagation time analysis the maximum pearson correlation coefficient mpcc method was employed to analyze the propagation relationship between different kinds of drought the method has been used in many similar studies ding et al 2020 vicente serrano et al 2014 xu et al 2019 and can effectively show the differences in response intensity and time among different drought types we employed this method to compute the correlation coefficient between spi and scpdsi and between sri and scpdsi in different seasons based on ding et al 2020 the method was also used to analyze the response relationship for spring march to may summer june to august autumn september to november and the full growing season march to october the mpcc of month in the growing season was defined as the month of strongest response for each different drought type for each grid cell we calculated the correlation coefficient and significance level p 0 05 for every grid cell if the correlation coefficient did not pass the significance test it was excluded from further calculations 2 3 3 drought attribution analysis we used the lindeman merenda gold lmg method to quantify the relative importance of natural driving factors affecting drought for each cell li et al 2021 the method can avoid the order effect of regression variables and quantify the relative importance of the explanatory variable gromping 2006 therefore the lmg method can quantify the influence degree of drought factors with pet pre and sm based on relative importation we analyzed distribution characteristics of influencing factors on drought in different climate regions fig 2 shows the analysis process of this study 3 results 3 1 the propagation between meteorological and agricultural drought in this study spei sri and scpdsi were used to represent meteorological drought hydrological drought and agricultural drought respectively according to the sequence of drought occurrence the maximum correlation coefficient was used to analyze the propagation relationship of different types of drought in different seasons and different climate zones and the main factors affecting the propagation relationship of drought were quantitatively analyzed by the lmg attribution method a flow chart of the approach taken in this study is shown in fig 2 a homologous drought propagation relationship was found across china figs 3 and 4 the growing season and summer had stronger responses of drought propagation correlation coefficient 0 5 0 7 compared with spring and autumn 0 4 0 6 fig 3a d these findings support the seasonal scale and time lag results reported by huang et al 2015 and li et al 2020a similarly sub regions v vii and viii had higher coefficients 0 5 0 6 than sub regions i ii iii iv and vi 0 4 0 5 the higher coefficients were mainly distributed in the qinghai tibet plateau sub region viii and central sub region vii whereas the lower coefficients were mainly distributed in the northeast plain sub regions vi and ii and northern north china plain sub region iii fig 4 therefore western china had a stronger propagation relationship than eastern china the sub region iv of lower coefficient showed a uniform distribution similarly leng et al 2015 found that the propagation of meteorological drought to agricultural drought is complex and non linear and the drought response varied among different climate regions the finding of different responses and complex conditions for multiple drought also supported this result fig 3b and d also show that sub regions iii vi vii and viii had a higher coefficient 0 6 0 7 than sub regions i ii and iv 0 5 0 6 this shows that the response relationship between meteorological and agricultural drought was stronger in summer than in spring and autumn figs 3e and 4e fig 3 b and d show that the higher coefficients were mainly distributed in the qinghai tibet plateau sub region viii central sub region vii the northeast plain sub region vi and the north china plain sub region iii 3 2 the propagation between agricultural and hydrological drought fig 5 shows that eastern china had a strong propagation relationship between agricultural and hydrological drought fig 5 shows that sub regions iii and v had stronger propagation than other sub regions fig 6 also shows that the strongest propagation was mainly found in northeastern and southern china the weaker responses were mainly distributed in northwestern china sub region vii and the qinghai tibet plateau sub region viii similarly fig 5 b d shows that the strongest relationships occurred in sub regions ii iii iv and vi coefficient 0 55 0 7 sub regions i and v had a strong relationship 0 4 0 6 whereas sub regions vii and viii had the weakest relationship 0 2 0 4 sub regions i ii iii and vi had weaker propagation with coefficients mainly distributed between 0 3 and 0 5 fig 5a furthermore the many grid cells showed a lower coefficient with a non significant relationship p 0 05 in northeastern and northwestern china and inner mongolia which was mainly distributed in sub regions vi and vii fig 6a many non significant relationship grid cells in spring caused sub region vi fig 4a had a lower response in spring than other seasons sub regions i ii iii and vi had the strongest drought response between august to october in the growing season whereas sub regions iv vii and viii showed the strongest response between june to october and sub region v had the strongest response between april to october sub region v showed strongest response between march and october sub region v was considerably different than other sub regions suggesting that more complex factors may drive drought propagation in this region propagation from agricultural to hydrological drought showed greater variation among different sub regions than that from meteorological to hydrological drought figs 3 and 4 li et al 2020a and sun et al 2019 also observed that the hydrological and meteorological drought had different impacts on agricultural drought in terms of both influence degree and propagation time 3 3 syncing of the annual data and propagation relationship among droughts the variation trend of drought indexes was applied to compare yearly fluctuations among drought types wang et al 2019b which was applied to indicate the trend of drought change for convenient comparison of the annual scale propagation relationship of drought indexes we averaged the grid cells and months in the growing season in addition normalization and smoothing were conducted to more intuitively show the trend of drought change there was a significant annual scale propagation relationship in sync over time among the three kinds of drought and agricultural drought was more consistent than hydrological drought following meteorological drought fig 7 fig 7 a c show that large drought events took place in the 1920 s 1970 s and 2000 s chen et al 2020 also found and recorded a large drought event during the 2000 s in the north china plain sub region iii events in northeastern china sub regions i and ii during the 1980 s and 2000 s were also found by zhou et al 2020 and yang et al 2016 figs 7 d and 6 e similarly show large events during the 1940 s and 2000 s in sub regions iv and v but only hydrological drought with poor cooperativity between spei and sri occurred in sub region v in the 2000 s lu et al 2017 also found that agricultural drought occurred at high frequency during the 2000 s in south china fig 7 f and 6 g show serious drought during the 1940 s however sub region vii had serious hydrological drought but meteorological and agricultural conditions were moister than other decades the multiple droughts of sub region vi showed a slowly decreasing trend from the 1950 s to the 2010 s fig 7f wang et al 2019b also confirmed that meteorological drought in the inner mongolia plain showed a sudden change in the 1940 s and has declined since the 1940 s yang et al 2018 also found that agricultural drought in sub region vii occurred under moist conditions during the 1990 2000 s from the 1900 1950 s in sub region viii the spei and scpdsi showed a stable and consistently deceasing trend but the sri fluctuated fig 7h both scpdsi and spei showed a low ebb and peak in the 1960 s and 1980 2010 s but the sri showed the opposite direction of change to scpdsi and spei fig 7h based on fig 8 meteorological and agricultural annual drought showed a high correlation coefficient 0 60 in different sub regions hydrological and agricultural annual drought showed a high correlation coefficient 0 60 in sub regions i ii iii and vi based on the above analysis we found that meteorological and agricultural drought had a strong propagation relationship and agricultural drought usually showed fluctuations of greater magnitude than meteorological drought and hydrological drought especially when major drought events occurred larger meteorological drought events might have led to the serious agricultural events in 1990 2014 over sub regions v vii and viii fig 7e h 3 4 relative importance of driving factors to hydrological and agricultural drought based on the lmg method we further determined the degree of relative importance fig 7 and dominance map fig 9 of driving factors of pet pre and sm on the hydrological and agricultural drought the factors showing a high relative importance in driving hydrological drought were pet and sm in sub region i pre and sm in sub region ii and iii pre in sub region iv and v pet and sm in sub region vi and vii and pet in sub region viii fig 7a overall the dominance of sm and pet in driving hydrological drought was mainly distributed over arid and semi arid regions in northern china fig 9a that of pre was concentrated in humid and semi humid regions in southern china and sm was mainly dominant in the qinghai tibet plateau table 1 shows that sm and pet had a high proportion of major hydrological drought driving factors in sub region i pre sm and pet had a high proportion of major hydrological drought driving factors in sub region ii pre and sm had a high proportion of major hydrological drought driving factors in sub region iii pre and sm had a high proportion of major hydrological drought driving factors in sub region iv pre and sm had a high proportion of major hydrological drought driving factors in sub region v sm and pet had a high proportion of major hydrological drought driving factors in sub region vi sm pet and pre had a high proportion of major hydrological drought driving factors in sub region vii and sm had a high proportion of major hydrological drought driving factors in sub region vii pet pre and sm represented area proportions of 18 02 37 64 and 44 33 respectively in china fig 7 b shows the degree of relative importance of pet pre and sm as driving factors of agricultural drought sm had a high relative importance in driving agricultural drought in sub region i ii iii iv v vi and vii pet pre and sm showed similar high importance in sub region viii overall sm was identified as the dominant factor of agricultural drought in eastern china whereas pet pre and sm were the dominant factors of agricultural drought in western china fig 9b table 1 shows that the driving factors pet pre and sm of agricultural drought accounted for 9 18 10 40 and 80 42 of the total area respectively sm had a high area proportion of major agricultural drought driving factors in sub regions i ii iii iv v and vi sm and pre had a high area proportion of major agricultural drought driving factors in sub region vii and pet sm and pre had a high area proportion of major agricultural drought driving factors in sub region viii 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of drought causes in different climate regions based on the analysis in section 3 4 we found that pre and sm played a key role in driving drought in sub regions ii and iii figs 9a and 10a zhou et al 2021a found that sm was less important in arid and semi arid areas of northern china than in humid and semi humid of southern china fig 11 also shows that sm was also a major driver in sub regions iv and v the field capacity of sm was not reached in sub region ii zhou et al 2021a and it is hard to produce runoff when pre intensity is less than the soil infiltration capacity of unsaturated sm shrestha et al 2020 moreover runoff is important to alleviate hydrological drought ding et al 2021 gu et al 2020 when sm was less than field capacity sm was an important driving factor of hydrological drought in sub regions ii and iii however it is easy to produce runoff when pre intensity exceeds the soil infiltration capacity of unsaturated sm shrestha et al 2020 when sm achieved field capacity pre was an important driving factor of hydrological drought in sub regions ii and iii yang et al 2016 also found that decreased pre was a direct factor causing drought in northeast china mountainous areas also produce more runoff than plain areas khosh bin ghomash et al 2019 fig 12 shows that sub region iii had a large plain area however sub region ii had a large mountain area moreover fig 9 a also shows that pre and sm had a higher relative importance in sub region iii than they did in sub region ii pre had a high relative importance in sub regions iv and v sm has higher ability to reach field capacity and can more easily produce runoff following pre shrestha et al 2020 zhang et al 2012 therefore pre was the major driving factor of hydrological drought in sub regions iv and v sun et al 2019 fig 9 a shows that sm played an important role in driving hydrological drought in sub regions vi vii and viii although pet had a similar proportion in different climate regions pre had a lower proportion in sub region vi and vii fig 11d ding et al 2021 and xu et al 2018 also found that pre and water deficits led to hydrological drought it should be noted that sm might not be adequately supplemented by pre and runoff was also hard to produce in sub region vi vii and viii fig 9 b shows that sm was a relatively important driving factor of agricultural drought in sub regions i ii iii iv vi and vii zhou et al 2021a also found that sm had a close relationship with agricultural drought in china the sm of regional water deficit is controlled by pre and pet xu et al 2018 zhou et al 2021a fig 11 ad shows the relative importance of pre and pet on sm in different climate regions pet had a higher relative importance than pre in sub regions ii vi vii and viii fig 11a whereas pre had a higher relative importance than pre in sub region vi sub regions vi and vii had a lower pre yao et al 2018b and thus sm change might be more sensitive to pet when sm is insufficient sub region iv had a higher pre yao et al 2020a therefore sm change might more sensitive to pet when sm is sufficient pre had a low relative importance in sub regions i and ii fig 11a when pre had higher level to supply sm yao et al 2018b snowmelt can supply sm in spring in northeastern china wu et al 2018 xing et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 spring snowmelt could reduce sm sensitivity to pre levels in sub regions i and ii in addition snowmelt may also relieve agricultural drought in these subregions wu et al 2018 4 2 drought propagation relationship and coping strategy in different seasons in section 4 1 we discussed the driving factors of hydrological and agricultural drought in different climate regions these driving factors could help to understand the drought propagation relationship in different seasons bhardwaj et al 2020 li et al 2021 the correlation coefficient between spei and scpdsi in summer and the growing season was higher than that in spring and autumn figs 3 and 4 therefore we found that the meteorological to agricultural drought propagation relationship was stronger in summer and the growing season than in spring and autumn fig 9 b shows that the main driving factor of agricultural drought was sm in the different climate regions zhou et al 2021a summer has more pre than spring and autumn to supply sm yao et al 2018b and thus agricultural drought might be more sensitive to meteorological drought in summer figs 2 e and 3 e also show that mpcc was mainly distributed in summer june to aug figs 5 and 6 show that the correlation coefficient between scpdsi and sri in spring was lower than that in summer autumn and the growing season in sub regions i ii and vi based on the analysis presented in section 4 1 sm did not reach field capacity in arid and semi arid northern china zhou et al 2021a therefore pre intensity and sm are key factors relating to runoff production in northern china hailegeorgis and alfredsen 2017 tian et al 2018 however snowmelt in spring could supply sm and produce snowmelt runoff in sub regions i ii zhou et al 2020 vi and vii li et al 2020b hydrological drought could be relieved by runoff of snowmelt and pre in sub regions i ii vi and vii and therefore hydrological drought was not sensitive to agricultural drought in spring sub region iii also had a lower correlation coefficient between scpdsi and sri in spring than in summer and autumn figs 5 and 6 zhou et al 2021a and yao et al 2018b found that sm and pre in spring were at a lower level than in summer and autumn in the north china plain fig 12b sm of plain areas is more difficult to move and recharge than mountainous areas because sm can be shifted as a result of the slope in mountainous areas shrestha et al 2020 therefore sm and pre seasonal differences might lead to hydrological drought in summer and autumn that is more sensitive than spring to agricultural drought sub regions iv and v showed a similar correlation coefficient level between scpdsi and sri in different seasons fig 5 the sm level is high and the differences are small in different seasons in sub regions iv and v zhou et al 2021a mountainous regions fig 12b are also favorable for sm to move and recharge shrestha et al 2020 therefore sub regions iv and v might be sensitive to agricultural drought based on the above analysis we identified the key driving factors on hydrological and agricultural drought in different climate regions understanding these driving factors can help policymakers to develop a coping strategy for drought mishra and singh 2010 agricultural drought is closely related to crop growth wu et al 2020 and sm is the major factor controlling agricultural drought fig 1 b shows that cropland in china is mainly distributed in the north china plain the sichuan basin yangtze plain and the northeast plain and fig 11 c shows that sub regions ii iii iv v and vi had a high proportion of cropland of these fig 11 b also shows that sub region iii had the highest irrigation degree however fig 11 a shows that pre and pet had a similar level of importance to sm in sub region iii the soil pet can be reduced by the use of mulched plastic film in cropland gong et al 2017 irrigation was applied in sub region iii fig 11b therefore this method could be employed in the growing season when the degree of irrigation could be greatly increased fig 11b in sub region iii based on fig 11 a and b sub region ii and vi could consider increasing irrigation and using mulching plastic film in cropland to reduce the effect of pet on sm 4 3 limitations although valuable results were found in this study there are a few points that require further attention the scpdsi spei and runoff datasets have been applied in many studies and have been verified by measured data ghiggi et al 2019 van der schrier et al 2013 vicente serrano et al 2010b however empirical data could not be recorded in this study because of restrictions such as national policy and a lack of historical data and thus simulation data were employed wongchuig et al 2019 therefore the results presented herein based on simulation data have value but supplementary measurement data are required in further analysis in addition because the effects of drought management efforts such as water resource management shi et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 and agricultural crop technology ding et al 2020 have changed with the development of science and technology it was difficult to account for these measures and their influence was thus excluded from direct analysis finally we did not separate the impact of hydrological and meteorological drought on agriculture it is possible that the influence of hydrological drought on agriculture included indirect effects of meteorological drought and thus we may have overestimated the influence of hydrological drought alone 5 conclusions in this study we investigated the propagation of drought for various seasons and for multiple time scales from meteorology agriculture and hydrology correlation analysis attribution analysis and raster data in addition to simulated datasets were applied to assess the factors driving drought and the drought propagation the main conclusions were as follows 1 there was a strong propagation relationship between meteorological and agricultural drought the propagation relationship was similar among different seasons western china showed a stronger propagation relationship from meteorological to agricultural drought than eastern china mpcc was mainly concentrated in summer june to aug 2 agricultural drought had a strong propagation relationship with hydrological drought in eastern china agricultural to hydrological drought showed the strongest propagation in summer and autumn june to oct sub regions iv and v showed a strong propagation relationship in different seasons however sub regions i ii iii and vi of spring showed a weaker propagation relationship from agricultural to hydrological drought than other seasons 3 in general propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought was strong and similar among the different climate regions at the annual scale however propagation from agricultural to hydrological drought had the strongest relationship in northeastern china and north china at the annual scale the propagation relationship from agricultural to hydrological drought was weaker in southern and western china larger meteorological drought events might lead to serious agricultural events in 1990 2014 in sub regions v vii and viii 4 the main driving factors of hydrological drought were pre in sub regions iv and v sm and pre in sub regions ii and iii and sm and pet in sub region i vi and vii sm was the key driving factor of agricultural drought in sub regions i vii declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

9977,drought propagation describes the changes in a drought signal as it moves from one major type of drought to another it is important to investigate the propagation among meteorological agricultural and hydrological drought as well as their major impacting factors to improve understanding of the drought propagation relationship monitor agricultural drought and reduce crop losses this study presents the first exploration of the interplay between multiple droughts among different climate zones and seasons in china the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei standardized runoff index sri and self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi were used to represent meteorological agricultural and hydrological drought respectively the pearson correlation coefficient was used to analyze the propagation relationships among different droughts and identify the most sensitive season for drought propagation the lindeman merenda gold lmg method was used to quantify the relative importance of pre precipitation pet potential evapotranspiration and sm soil moisture to hydrological and agricultural drought the propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought was prominent in different seasons at the annual scale over china in general the propagation relationship from agricultural to hydrological drought was weaker than that from meteorological to agricultural drought in northern china arid and semi arid areas there was a stronger propagation relationship from agricultural to hydrological drought in summer and autumn than in spring there was also stronger propagation from agricultural to hydrological drought in eastern china than in western china different climate regions had different major factors driving hydrological drought because of the different climate characteristics however sm was generally the most important driving factor for agricultural drought in all climate regions mulching plastic film might be an effective and feasible method to reduce pet from soil evaporation in sub regions that apply high irrigation levels these findings may also be applied to strengthen the study of artificial regulation of water resources which could be an approach to reducing crop losses from drought keywords meteorological drought hydrological drought agricultural drought china 1 introduction droughts are natural disasters caused by long term water shortage and are fundamentally different from floods and other natural disasters because they usually develop slowly despite the slow development of drought its impact on regional ecology hydrology and economy is huge because the recovery period can be lengthy after the end of the drought jasechko and perrone 2020 mishra and singh 2010 song et al 2020a wang et al 2019a xing et al 2017 the frequency and intensity of drought events have increased under the background of climate warming mishra and singh 2010 yao et al 2018a the demand for water resources in industry and agriculture has increased in line with increases in human population and development huang et al 2015 li et al 2020a therefore it is essential to understand the occurrence and mechanisms behind drought at different spatial and temporal scales in general drought can be divided into meteorological drought hydrological drought agricultural drought and socio economic drought according to different water shortage conditions for meteorological hydrological soil and social systems ding et al 2020 gu et al 2020 lu et al 2017 shi et al 2018 socio economic drought is associated with water resources systems that cannot meet water demands of society and thus affect economic development mishra and singh 2010 shi et al 2018 meteorological drought is defined as a lack of precipitation over a region for a period of time hydrological drought is defined as a period with inadequate water resources surface and subsurface and agricultural drought is usually related to soil moisture and can also lead to crop failure mishra and singh 2010 meteorological drought caused by precipitation shortage is usually the initiator of the other types of drought gu et al 2020 meteorological drought may lead to a decrease in surface runoff or groundwater level resulting in hydrological drought when the duration is sufficient hao and singh 2015 mishra and singh 2010 this decrease in soil water content will affect the process of runoff generation precipitation also needs to replenish soil water deficiency before runoff can be generated as a result agricultural drought can be expected to affect the occurrence of hydrological drought huang et al 2015 li et al 2020a wu et al 2020 china is one of the largest agricultural countries in the world with a large human population there is a considerable range of different terrains and elevations in china leading to a great variation in climate zones under the influence of current and future climate change china is likely to face a severe drought risk wu et al 2019 it is therefore important to study the mechanisms of drought propagation in china much of the current research has focused on the development and use of reliable drought indexes to identify and analyze different types of drought some studies have used the single drought index to investigate drought characteristics for example yao et al 2018a analyzed characteristics of the temporal and spatial variation of meteorological drought in china based on the standardized precipitation index spi and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei forootan et al 2019 used the sea surface temperature and terrestrial water storage to analyze global hydrological drought and found that droughts on 3 6 month timescales were most frequent worldwide shi et al 2018 constructed a new social and economic drought index sedi and analyzed the social and economic drought characteristics of the dongjiang river basin zhang et al 2015 developed the standardized moisture anomaly index szi which combines the advantages of the self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi and spei and accurately determined the characteristics of drought on the loess plateau some scholars have also studied and analyzed the relationship between different types of drought wang et al 2019a comprehensively evaluated the correlation between meteorological drought and hydrological drought in the yellow river basin and found that meteorological drought occurred earlier than hydrological drought huang et al 2015 studied the response of agricultural drought to meteorological drought in the weihe river basin and found that agricultural drought is closely related to meteorological drought and atmospheric circulation was an important factor affecting the drought propagation time leng et al 2015 simulated the future drought change in china and projected that meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts would become more severe and have higher frequencies moreover high temperatures may seriously threaten agricultural drought in future li et al 2020a found that the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought was less than one month whereas it was less than two months from hydrological to agricultural drought although the above studies have deepened our basic understanding of drought propagation and evolution most of the current studies focus on the regional or watershed scale and do not consider the mechanism and differences of drought propagation among different climate zones seasonality is also an important factor affecting drought characteristics aryal and zhu 2020 song et al 2019 however to our knowledge no studies have comparatively analyzed the relationship of drought propagation to agriculture in different climate zones and seasons because the causes of drought formation are extremely complex and the physical factors leading to drought are still poorly understood the formation mechanism varies among different types of drought it is therefore necessary to study the propagation relationship between different types of drought in different climatic regions and seasons to assist in drought early warning both spi and spei are commonly used meteorological drought indicators with multi scale characteristics however spi cannot reflect the drought conditions caused by warming because it only considers precipitation therefore spei is generally considered most suitable for studying the impact of global warming on the severity of meteorological drought yao et al 2018a in addition sri is easy to calculate and has multi scale characteristics and is widely used in the study of hydrological drought ding et al 2021 zhou et al 2021b the calculation of pdsi includes the whole water balance including precipitation soil water content runoff and potential evapotranspiration and thus it can comprehensively describe the regional drought situation song et al 2020b wells et al 2004 proposed scpdsi an improved pdsi that greatly increased the spatial comparability of the indicator and has been widely used in agricultural drought monitoring mishra and singh 2010 wang et al 2015 the overall aim of this study was to better understand the propagation relationships of different types of drought in different seasons and different climate zones the objectives of this study were as follows 1 to analyze the drought propagation relationships in different climate zones according to the sequence of drought occurrence 2 to analyze the differences in the drought propagation relationships in different seasons and 3 to identify the main factors affecting the drought propagation relationships the results will provide a basis for the study and prediction of drought evolution among seasons and in different climatic zones in china and other regions of the world the findings could also be used to inform future early warning and monitoring systems for agricultural drought 2 data and methods 2 1 study area china is located in east asia 3 51 n 53 34 n 73 29 e 135 04 e its land area is approximately 9 63 106 km2 based on ding et al 2020 and zhao et al 2009 we split the study area into eight sub regions based on climate zone sub regions i ii iii iv v vi vii and viii fig 1a for convenience of presentation we included the main plain and plateau regions of china including the northeastern plain qinghai tibet plateau inner mongolia plain yun gui plateau loess plateau north china plain and changjiang downstream plain previous studies have shown that the drought risk in six of the seven regions has generally increased and a decreasing trend of meteorological drought hydrological drought and agricultural drought is apparent in eastern china yao et al 2020b meteorological drought is mainly concentrated in southwest china while agricultural drought and hydrological drought are mainly concentrated in northwest china yao et al 2018a ding et al 2020 and he et al 2017 showed that the vegetation type of china land cover includes cropland 18 total area forest 23 total area desert 14 total area and grassland 32 total area cropland is mainly distributed in the northeastern plain sub region vi sichuan basin and north china plain sub region iii fig 1b forest is mostly located in sub regions i ii iv and v desert is mostly located in northwestern china sub region vii and grassland is mainly distributed in the inner mongolia plain sub region vi and the qinghai tibet plateau sub region viii 2 2 datasets in this study the runoff spei and scpdsi were computed and used to represent the hydrological drought yang et al 2019 meteorological drought guo et al 2020 and agricultural drought ding et al 2020 respectively the runoff data were provided by land climate dynamics institute for atmospheric and climate science eth zurich ghiggi et al 2019 the spatial resolution of data was 0 5 0 5 and the temporal resolution was the monthly average during 1902 2014 the data were produced by the random forest algorithm and trained on observation results streamflow precipitation and temperature the results of the presented dataset were better than an ensemble of 13 state of the art global hydrological model runoff simulations as shown at https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 9228176 the scpdsi data were provided by the climatic research unit university of east anglia uk the dataset also had a 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution and monthly temporal resolution this dataset has been shown to be superior to the scpdsi based on other model simulations van der schrier et al 2013 the spei dataset was provided by vicente serrano et al 2014 the datasets also had spatial and temporal resolution of 0 5 0 5 and a monthly time scale the spei dataset was based on the precipitation and temperature of the climatic research unit cru ts3 0 dataset to compute vicente serrano et al 2010b the datasets of vicente serrano et al 2010b provided spei data at multiple time scales temporal resolution from 1 to 48 month time scales herein we used the spei at 1 month time scales to investigate the seasonal drought relationships https digital csic es handle 10261 153475 the model estimates of soil moisture sm were obtained from european reanalysis interim erai reanalysis products and were provided by the climate data interface cdl version 1 6 9 http mpimet mpg de cdi the spatial resolution was 1 25 0 94 and the temporal resolution was monthly we selected the sm dataset of mean 0 1 m underground because this was the depth used to compute scpdsi in previous studies van der schrier et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 and strongly influenced the crop growth wang et al 2009 the spatial resolution was solved similarly to the other datasets 0 5 0 5 by using the linear interpolation method bigaignon et al 2020 the time series of sm datasets was from 1979 to 2016 to match the time series of the drought index we selected the time series of sm from 1979 to 2014 which has been tested in previous research umair et al 2018 zohaib et al 2019 the precipitation pre and potential evapotranspiration pet data were provided by the cru dataset and were also used to compute spei vicente serrano et al 2010a the datasets also had a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 and a monthly temporal resolution to match the time series of other datasets we selected time series of pre and pet from 1979 to 2014 these pre and pet datasets have been shown to be reliable and accurate by many studies shi et al 2017 vicente serrano et al 2010a 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 drought index analysis the spei is widely used to assess the characteristics of drought vicente serrano et al 2010a 2014 yao et al 2018a the computation procedure of the spei used in the current study followed that of vicente serrano et al 2010a the calculation process of spei was as follows 1 estimation of pet based on the penman s equation 2 determining the accumulation of water deficit d pre pet at different time scales where pre represents precipitation and then 3 normalizing d into a log logistic probability distribution to obtain spei using eqs 1 and 2 the log logistic distribution was defined as 1 f x β α x γ α 1 x γ α β 2 where α β and γ are coefficients to describe the scale and shape of this distribution the spei was calculated as follows 2 spei 2 ln p c 0 c 1 t c 2 t 2 1 d 1 t d 2 t 2 d 3 t 3 where p is the probability of exceeding a determined d value given as p 1 f x the constants expressed above were as follows c0 2 515517 d1 1 432788 c1 0 802853 d2 0 189269 c2 0 010328 and d3 0 001308 the computation method of sri was similar to that of spei gu et al 2020 pointed out that runoff is more in line with the log normal distribution the difference calculation process between sri and spei is that the runoff time series data were inputted in sri to fit the log normal distribution function pdsi is based on the change of evaporation demand of water not just the precipitation anomaly the whole calculation process of pdsi includes many empirical parameters which were evaluated according to the hydrothermal conditions of the study area wells et al 2004 developed a scpdsi algorithm which can determine the weight factor and duration factor according to the hydrological and meteorological variables observed on site it can use the dynamic estimation values to replace the empirical constant used at any point on earth in the original pdsi algorithm and can self correct the empirical parameters the scpdsi enhances the comparison of time and space of drought monitoring results yu et al 2019 more detailed algorithms and computation procedures can be found in wells et al 2004 2 3 2 drought correlation and propagation time analysis the maximum pearson correlation coefficient mpcc method was employed to analyze the propagation relationship between different kinds of drought the method has been used in many similar studies ding et al 2020 vicente serrano et al 2014 xu et al 2019 and can effectively show the differences in response intensity and time among different drought types we employed this method to compute the correlation coefficient between spi and scpdsi and between sri and scpdsi in different seasons based on ding et al 2020 the method was also used to analyze the response relationship for spring march to may summer june to august autumn september to november and the full growing season march to october the mpcc of month in the growing season was defined as the month of strongest response for each different drought type for each grid cell we calculated the correlation coefficient and significance level p 0 05 for every grid cell if the correlation coefficient did not pass the significance test it was excluded from further calculations 2 3 3 drought attribution analysis we used the lindeman merenda gold lmg method to quantify the relative importance of natural driving factors affecting drought for each cell li et al 2021 the method can avoid the order effect of regression variables and quantify the relative importance of the explanatory variable gromping 2006 therefore the lmg method can quantify the influence degree of drought factors with pet pre and sm based on relative importation we analyzed distribution characteristics of influencing factors on drought in different climate regions fig 2 shows the analysis process of this study 3 results 3 1 the propagation between meteorological and agricultural drought in this study spei sri and scpdsi were used to represent meteorological drought hydrological drought and agricultural drought respectively according to the sequence of drought occurrence the maximum correlation coefficient was used to analyze the propagation relationship of different types of drought in different seasons and different climate zones and the main factors affecting the propagation relationship of drought were quantitatively analyzed by the lmg attribution method a flow chart of the approach taken in this study is shown in fig 2 a homologous drought propagation relationship was found across china figs 3 and 4 the growing season and summer had stronger responses of drought propagation correlation coefficient 0 5 0 7 compared with spring and autumn 0 4 0 6 fig 3a d these findings support the seasonal scale and time lag results reported by huang et al 2015 and li et al 2020a similarly sub regions v vii and viii had higher coefficients 0 5 0 6 than sub regions i ii iii iv and vi 0 4 0 5 the higher coefficients were mainly distributed in the qinghai tibet plateau sub region viii and central sub region vii whereas the lower coefficients were mainly distributed in the northeast plain sub regions vi and ii and northern north china plain sub region iii fig 4 therefore western china had a stronger propagation relationship than eastern china the sub region iv of lower coefficient showed a uniform distribution similarly leng et al 2015 found that the propagation of meteorological drought to agricultural drought is complex and non linear and the drought response varied among different climate regions the finding of different responses and complex conditions for multiple drought also supported this result fig 3b and d also show that sub regions iii vi vii and viii had a higher coefficient 0 6 0 7 than sub regions i ii and iv 0 5 0 6 this shows that the response relationship between meteorological and agricultural drought was stronger in summer than in spring and autumn figs 3e and 4e fig 3 b and d show that the higher coefficients were mainly distributed in the qinghai tibet plateau sub region viii central sub region vii the northeast plain sub region vi and the north china plain sub region iii 3 2 the propagation between agricultural and hydrological drought fig 5 shows that eastern china had a strong propagation relationship between agricultural and hydrological drought fig 5 shows that sub regions iii and v had stronger propagation than other sub regions fig 6 also shows that the strongest propagation was mainly found in northeastern and southern china the weaker responses were mainly distributed in northwestern china sub region vii and the qinghai tibet plateau sub region viii similarly fig 5 b d shows that the strongest relationships occurred in sub regions ii iii iv and vi coefficient 0 55 0 7 sub regions i and v had a strong relationship 0 4 0 6 whereas sub regions vii and viii had the weakest relationship 0 2 0 4 sub regions i ii iii and vi had weaker propagation with coefficients mainly distributed between 0 3 and 0 5 fig 5a furthermore the many grid cells showed a lower coefficient with a non significant relationship p 0 05 in northeastern and northwestern china and inner mongolia which was mainly distributed in sub regions vi and vii fig 6a many non significant relationship grid cells in spring caused sub region vi fig 4a had a lower response in spring than other seasons sub regions i ii iii and vi had the strongest drought response between august to october in the growing season whereas sub regions iv vii and viii showed the strongest response between june to october and sub region v had the strongest response between april to october sub region v showed strongest response between march and october sub region v was considerably different than other sub regions suggesting that more complex factors may drive drought propagation in this region propagation from agricultural to hydrological drought showed greater variation among different sub regions than that from meteorological to hydrological drought figs 3 and 4 li et al 2020a and sun et al 2019 also observed that the hydrological and meteorological drought had different impacts on agricultural drought in terms of both influence degree and propagation time 3 3 syncing of the annual data and propagation relationship among droughts the variation trend of drought indexes was applied to compare yearly fluctuations among drought types wang et al 2019b which was applied to indicate the trend of drought change for convenient comparison of the annual scale propagation relationship of drought indexes we averaged the grid cells and months in the growing season in addition normalization and smoothing were conducted to more intuitively show the trend of drought change there was a significant annual scale propagation relationship in sync over time among the three kinds of drought and agricultural drought was more consistent than hydrological drought following meteorological drought fig 7 fig 7 a c show that large drought events took place in the 1920 s 1970 s and 2000 s chen et al 2020 also found and recorded a large drought event during the 2000 s in the north china plain sub region iii events in northeastern china sub regions i and ii during the 1980 s and 2000 s were also found by zhou et al 2020 and yang et al 2016 figs 7 d and 6 e similarly show large events during the 1940 s and 2000 s in sub regions iv and v but only hydrological drought with poor cooperativity between spei and sri occurred in sub region v in the 2000 s lu et al 2017 also found that agricultural drought occurred at high frequency during the 2000 s in south china fig 7 f and 6 g show serious drought during the 1940 s however sub region vii had serious hydrological drought but meteorological and agricultural conditions were moister than other decades the multiple droughts of sub region vi showed a slowly decreasing trend from the 1950 s to the 2010 s fig 7f wang et al 2019b also confirmed that meteorological drought in the inner mongolia plain showed a sudden change in the 1940 s and has declined since the 1940 s yang et al 2018 also found that agricultural drought in sub region vii occurred under moist conditions during the 1990 2000 s from the 1900 1950 s in sub region viii the spei and scpdsi showed a stable and consistently deceasing trend but the sri fluctuated fig 7h both scpdsi and spei showed a low ebb and peak in the 1960 s and 1980 2010 s but the sri showed the opposite direction of change to scpdsi and spei fig 7h based on fig 8 meteorological and agricultural annual drought showed a high correlation coefficient 0 60 in different sub regions hydrological and agricultural annual drought showed a high correlation coefficient 0 60 in sub regions i ii iii and vi based on the above analysis we found that meteorological and agricultural drought had a strong propagation relationship and agricultural drought usually showed fluctuations of greater magnitude than meteorological drought and hydrological drought especially when major drought events occurred larger meteorological drought events might have led to the serious agricultural events in 1990 2014 over sub regions v vii and viii fig 7e h 3 4 relative importance of driving factors to hydrological and agricultural drought based on the lmg method we further determined the degree of relative importance fig 7 and dominance map fig 9 of driving factors of pet pre and sm on the hydrological and agricultural drought the factors showing a high relative importance in driving hydrological drought were pet and sm in sub region i pre and sm in sub region ii and iii pre in sub region iv and v pet and sm in sub region vi and vii and pet in sub region viii fig 7a overall the dominance of sm and pet in driving hydrological drought was mainly distributed over arid and semi arid regions in northern china fig 9a that of pre was concentrated in humid and semi humid regions in southern china and sm was mainly dominant in the qinghai tibet plateau table 1 shows that sm and pet had a high proportion of major hydrological drought driving factors in sub region i pre sm and pet had a high proportion of major hydrological drought driving factors in sub region ii pre and sm had a high proportion of major hydrological drought driving factors in sub region iii pre and sm had a high proportion of major hydrological drought driving factors in sub region iv pre and sm had a high proportion of major hydrological drought driving factors in sub region v sm and pet had a high proportion of major hydrological drought driving factors in sub region vi sm pet and pre had a high proportion of major hydrological drought driving factors in sub region vii and sm had a high proportion of major hydrological drought driving factors in sub region vii pet pre and sm represented area proportions of 18 02 37 64 and 44 33 respectively in china fig 7 b shows the degree of relative importance of pet pre and sm as driving factors of agricultural drought sm had a high relative importance in driving agricultural drought in sub region i ii iii iv v vi and vii pet pre and sm showed similar high importance in sub region viii overall sm was identified as the dominant factor of agricultural drought in eastern china whereas pet pre and sm were the dominant factors of agricultural drought in western china fig 9b table 1 shows that the driving factors pet pre and sm of agricultural drought accounted for 9 18 10 40 and 80 42 of the total area respectively sm had a high area proportion of major agricultural drought driving factors in sub regions i ii iii iv v and vi sm and pre had a high area proportion of major agricultural drought driving factors in sub region vii and pet sm and pre had a high area proportion of major agricultural drought driving factors in sub region viii 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of drought causes in different climate regions based on the analysis in section 3 4 we found that pre and sm played a key role in driving drought in sub regions ii and iii figs 9a and 10a zhou et al 2021a found that sm was less important in arid and semi arid areas of northern china than in humid and semi humid of southern china fig 11 also shows that sm was also a major driver in sub regions iv and v the field capacity of sm was not reached in sub region ii zhou et al 2021a and it is hard to produce runoff when pre intensity is less than the soil infiltration capacity of unsaturated sm shrestha et al 2020 moreover runoff is important to alleviate hydrological drought ding et al 2021 gu et al 2020 when sm was less than field capacity sm was an important driving factor of hydrological drought in sub regions ii and iii however it is easy to produce runoff when pre intensity exceeds the soil infiltration capacity of unsaturated sm shrestha et al 2020 when sm achieved field capacity pre was an important driving factor of hydrological drought in sub regions ii and iii yang et al 2016 also found that decreased pre was a direct factor causing drought in northeast china mountainous areas also produce more runoff than plain areas khosh bin ghomash et al 2019 fig 12 shows that sub region iii had a large plain area however sub region ii had a large mountain area moreover fig 9 a also shows that pre and sm had a higher relative importance in sub region iii than they did in sub region ii pre had a high relative importance in sub regions iv and v sm has higher ability to reach field capacity and can more easily produce runoff following pre shrestha et al 2020 zhang et al 2012 therefore pre was the major driving factor of hydrological drought in sub regions iv and v sun et al 2019 fig 9 a shows that sm played an important role in driving hydrological drought in sub regions vi vii and viii although pet had a similar proportion in different climate regions pre had a lower proportion in sub region vi and vii fig 11d ding et al 2021 and xu et al 2018 also found that pre and water deficits led to hydrological drought it should be noted that sm might not be adequately supplemented by pre and runoff was also hard to produce in sub region vi vii and viii fig 9 b shows that sm was a relatively important driving factor of agricultural drought in sub regions i ii iii iv vi and vii zhou et al 2021a also found that sm had a close relationship with agricultural drought in china the sm of regional water deficit is controlled by pre and pet xu et al 2018 zhou et al 2021a fig 11 ad shows the relative importance of pre and pet on sm in different climate regions pet had a higher relative importance than pre in sub regions ii vi vii and viii fig 11a whereas pre had a higher relative importance than pre in sub region vi sub regions vi and vii had a lower pre yao et al 2018b and thus sm change might be more sensitive to pet when sm is insufficient sub region iv had a higher pre yao et al 2020a therefore sm change might more sensitive to pet when sm is sufficient pre had a low relative importance in sub regions i and ii fig 11a when pre had higher level to supply sm yao et al 2018b snowmelt can supply sm in spring in northeastern china wu et al 2018 xing et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 spring snowmelt could reduce sm sensitivity to pre levels in sub regions i and ii in addition snowmelt may also relieve agricultural drought in these subregions wu et al 2018 4 2 drought propagation relationship and coping strategy in different seasons in section 4 1 we discussed the driving factors of hydrological and agricultural drought in different climate regions these driving factors could help to understand the drought propagation relationship in different seasons bhardwaj et al 2020 li et al 2021 the correlation coefficient between spei and scpdsi in summer and the growing season was higher than that in spring and autumn figs 3 and 4 therefore we found that the meteorological to agricultural drought propagation relationship was stronger in summer and the growing season than in spring and autumn fig 9 b shows that the main driving factor of agricultural drought was sm in the different climate regions zhou et al 2021a summer has more pre than spring and autumn to supply sm yao et al 2018b and thus agricultural drought might be more sensitive to meteorological drought in summer figs 2 e and 3 e also show that mpcc was mainly distributed in summer june to aug figs 5 and 6 show that the correlation coefficient between scpdsi and sri in spring was lower than that in summer autumn and the growing season in sub regions i ii and vi based on the analysis presented in section 4 1 sm did not reach field capacity in arid and semi arid northern china zhou et al 2021a therefore pre intensity and sm are key factors relating to runoff production in northern china hailegeorgis and alfredsen 2017 tian et al 2018 however snowmelt in spring could supply sm and produce snowmelt runoff in sub regions i ii zhou et al 2020 vi and vii li et al 2020b hydrological drought could be relieved by runoff of snowmelt and pre in sub regions i ii vi and vii and therefore hydrological drought was not sensitive to agricultural drought in spring sub region iii also had a lower correlation coefficient between scpdsi and sri in spring than in summer and autumn figs 5 and 6 zhou et al 2021a and yao et al 2018b found that sm and pre in spring were at a lower level than in summer and autumn in the north china plain fig 12b sm of plain areas is more difficult to move and recharge than mountainous areas because sm can be shifted as a result of the slope in mountainous areas shrestha et al 2020 therefore sm and pre seasonal differences might lead to hydrological drought in summer and autumn that is more sensitive than spring to agricultural drought sub regions iv and v showed a similar correlation coefficient level between scpdsi and sri in different seasons fig 5 the sm level is high and the differences are small in different seasons in sub regions iv and v zhou et al 2021a mountainous regions fig 12b are also favorable for sm to move and recharge shrestha et al 2020 therefore sub regions iv and v might be sensitive to agricultural drought based on the above analysis we identified the key driving factors on hydrological and agricultural drought in different climate regions understanding these driving factors can help policymakers to develop a coping strategy for drought mishra and singh 2010 agricultural drought is closely related to crop growth wu et al 2020 and sm is the major factor controlling agricultural drought fig 1 b shows that cropland in china is mainly distributed in the north china plain the sichuan basin yangtze plain and the northeast plain and fig 11 c shows that sub regions ii iii iv v and vi had a high proportion of cropland of these fig 11 b also shows that sub region iii had the highest irrigation degree however fig 11 a shows that pre and pet had a similar level of importance to sm in sub region iii the soil pet can be reduced by the use of mulched plastic film in cropland gong et al 2017 irrigation was applied in sub region iii fig 11b therefore this method could be employed in the growing season when the degree of irrigation could be greatly increased fig 11b in sub region iii based on fig 11 a and b sub region ii and vi could consider increasing irrigation and using mulching plastic film in cropland to reduce the effect of pet on sm 4 3 limitations although valuable results were found in this study there are a few points that require further attention the scpdsi spei and runoff datasets have been applied in many studies and have been verified by measured data ghiggi et al 2019 van der schrier et al 2013 vicente serrano et al 2010b however empirical data could not be recorded in this study because of restrictions such as national policy and a lack of historical data and thus simulation data were employed wongchuig et al 2019 therefore the results presented herein based on simulation data have value but supplementary measurement data are required in further analysis in addition because the effects of drought management efforts such as water resource management shi et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 and agricultural crop technology ding et al 2020 have changed with the development of science and technology it was difficult to account for these measures and their influence was thus excluded from direct analysis finally we did not separate the impact of hydrological and meteorological drought on agriculture it is possible that the influence of hydrological drought on agriculture included indirect effects of meteorological drought and thus we may have overestimated the influence of hydrological drought alone 5 conclusions in this study we investigated the propagation of drought for various seasons and for multiple time scales from meteorology agriculture and hydrology correlation analysis attribution analysis and raster data in addition to simulated datasets were applied to assess the factors driving drought and the drought propagation the main conclusions were as follows 1 there was a strong propagation relationship between meteorological and agricultural drought the propagation relationship was similar among different seasons western china showed a stronger propagation relationship from meteorological to agricultural drought than eastern china mpcc was mainly concentrated in summer june to aug 2 agricultural drought had a strong propagation relationship with hydrological drought in eastern china agricultural to hydrological drought showed the strongest propagation in summer and autumn june to oct sub regions iv and v showed a strong propagation relationship in different seasons however sub regions i ii iii and vi of spring showed a weaker propagation relationship from agricultural to hydrological drought than other seasons 3 in general propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought was strong and similar among the different climate regions at the annual scale however propagation from agricultural to hydrological drought had the strongest relationship in northeastern china and north china at the annual scale the propagation relationship from agricultural to hydrological drought was weaker in southern and western china larger meteorological drought events might lead to serious agricultural events in 1990 2014 in sub regions v vii and viii 4 the main driving factors of hydrological drought were pre in sub regions iv and v sm and pre in sub regions ii and iii and sm and pet in sub region i vi and vii sm was the key driving factor of agricultural drought in sub regions i vii declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

9978,applying the fixed effects regression technique to the highly spatially disaggregated district level data from 1966 67 to 2011 12 this paper has assessed the impact of heat stress on wheat production in india and concurrently evaluated the role of irrigation towards offsetting its harmful impact it has brought out three key highlights one heat stress negatively impacts crop yield and the impact has increased over time two irrigation besides its contribution towards improving crop yield also moderates the harmful impact of heat stress but over time its effectiveness has declined three the measure of heat stress built on multiple aspects of excess temperature i e intensity persistence and frequency explains variation in crop yield better than does a single aspect of it given the increasing scarcity of irrigation water and rising temperature these findings suggest the need for exploring technological and policy options for improving irrigation water use efficiency and breeding of crops for heat tolerance and low water footprints keywords heat stress yield loss adaptation irrigation india 1 introduction the frequent occurrence of extreme climatic events such as droughts floods and heatwaves is one of the main causes of low agricultural productivity food and nutritional insecurity and persistent poverty in developing countries that heavily depend on agriculture and lack access to financial resources and technologies for risk management dercon 1996 dell et al 2012 gourdji et al 2013 challinor et al 2014 trnka et al 2014 amare et al 2018 zampieri et al 2017 have identified the heat wave as the second largest source of yield risk after droughts more so in the arid and semi arid regions the frequency of heat waves is predicted to increase in the future climate scenarios ipcc 2012 world bank 2013 panda et al 2017 the agricultural and socioeconomic consequences of which will be more severe in the absence of adoption of risk management strategies nevertheless the literature on climate risk management also provides for several technological and agronomic options such as planting of stress tolerant crop varieties adjustments in tillage sowing planting and other intercultural operations modifications in input applications and adoption of soil fertility and water management practices to avert damages due to extreme climatic events inter alia irrigation besides its primary role of increasing crop yield is also recognized as an important means of adapting to extreme climatic events like droughts and heat waves kurukulasuriya et al 2006 bonfils and lobell 2007 mendelsohn and seo 2007 easterling et al 2007 van der velde et al 2009 kurukulasuriya et al 2011 iglesias and garrote 2015 birthal et al 2015 tack et al 2017 vanschoenwinkel and van passel 2018 taraz 2018 zaveri and lobell 2019 most studies except lobell et al 2012 and massetti and mendelsohn 2015 have analyzed the impact of excess temperature during the entire crop growing period ignoring its timing and persistence this approach is likely to underestimate the impact of excess temperature as the sensitivity of crops to excess temperature varies by their physiological growth stages in general crops exhibit a greater sensitivity to excess temperature during the anthesis and grain filling stages i e about three months before the harvest gourdji et al 2013 lobell et al 2012 zampieri et al 2017 yet our current understanding of the crops responses to excess temperature or heat waves at different physiological growth stages is limited deryng et al 2014 tack et al 2017 from an extensive review of literature deryng et al 2014 have concluded that the global climate impact assessments have failed to address adequately the effects of climate extremes on crops especially the negative effects of heat waves taraz 2018 has also reported a lack of rigorous analysis of the relationship between crop yields and heat waves this paper assesses the impact of heat stress on wheat yield in india at its anthesis and grain filling stages and evaluates the role of irrigation in mitigating the harmful impact of heat stress in india wheat is the second largest staple food after rice in production as well as consumption in the past five decades driven by technological change and supported by investment in irrigation india s wheat production increased from about 17 million tons in 1967 68 to over 102 million tons in 2018 19 goi 2020 during this period the irrigated area under the crop more than doubled from 43 to 94 goi 2020 the expansion of irrigation however resulted from the over exploitation of groundwater concurrently the crop also came under pressure of abiotic stresses including an excessive rise in temperature at its anthesis and grain filling stages gupta et al 2010 inter alia these factors could have adversely affected the crop s performance this is reflected in the deceleration of its yield growth from 60 kg per hectare during 1985 86 to 2000 01 to 26 kg per hectare during 2000 01 to 2014 15 we use a panel dataset on 311 districts at their 1970 base spanning over 45 years beginning 1966 67 to comprehend how the impacts of heat stress and the benefits of irrigation against heat stress have evolved tracking trajectories of the negative impact of heat stress simultaneous with the effectiveness of different adaptation measures is essential to provide evidence based feedback to the policymakers to appropriately target the efforts and investments towards improving crops resilience to heat stress our study differs from several other studies most studies have embraced a single aspect of excess temperature mainly its intensity ignoring its timing and persistence in defining and measuring the heat wave our measure of the heat wave is built on multiple aspects of excess temperature and its non stationary location specific thresholds further most crops exhibit a greater sensitivity to heat stress at their anthesis and grain filling stages the index of heat stress in this paper is specific to the physiological stages of the crop and not for the entire crop growing period our econometric results highlight that i heat stress negatively impacts crop yield and the impact has increased over time and ii irrigation besides its contribution to higher yield also partially offsets the harmful impact of heat stress but its effectiveness has declined these findings suggest the need for exploring technological and policy interventions for improving irrigation water use efficiency and breeding of crops for heat tolerance and low water footprints the rest of the study is structured as follows the next section briefly discusses the concepts and issues in measuring the heat wave or heat stress data sources are provided in section 3 and section 4 outlines the econometric approach used to assess the benefits of irrigation against heat stress key results are presented in section 5 and are discussed in section 6 concluding remarks are made in the last section 2 concept and measurement of heat wave or heat stress the heat wave is a condition when the temperature rises beyond a threshold and persists consecutively for a few days the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2012 provides a generic definition of a heat wave as a period of abnormally high temperature capable of causing discomfort building on it lipiec et al 2013 have defined heat wave from an agricultural perspective as the rise in temperature beyond a threshold continuously for a period sufficient to cause damage to plant growth and development a more comprehensive definition of the heat wave was proposed by the world meteorological organization wmo that runs as the persistence of the daily maximum temperature above the average maximum temperature by 5 c at least for five consecutive days see rafferty 2018 the expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi 1 1 the expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi is jointly sponsored by the commission for climatology ccl of the world meteorological organization s climate research programme wcrp and the joint wmo ioc technical commission for oceanography and marine meteorology jcomm brings more objectivity and defines heat wave as a period of excess temperature if the daytime maximum temperature exceeds its 90th percentile for six consecutive days see for details perkins and alexander 2013 although objective in their definitions these measures of heat wave are not equally applicable at all locations alexander et al 2006 as the probability of persistence of excess temperature at least for five or six consecutive days is extremely small chaudhury et al 2000 panda et al 2014 perkins and alexander 2013 perkins and alexander 2013 therefore considered the persistence of excess temperature beyond a threshold consecutively for three or more days as more appropriate for defining it as the heat wave for the indian subcontinent srivastava et al 2009 have considered heat wave as a period of daily maximum temperature at a location exceeding the normal temperature at least by 3 c for a minimum of three consecutive days crops differ in their requirement of heat and the requirement varies by their physiological growth stages and across locations thus there is no universal temperature threshold for a crop beyond which the rise in temperature is detrimental to its growth and development nevertheless several studies have relied on fixed temperature thresholds e g rosenzweig et al 2001 gourdji et al 2013 hawkins et al 2013 lobell et al 2012 for french maize hawkins et al 2013 considered 32 c as the threshold and for wheat lobell et al 2012 and gourdji et al 2013 assumed a threshold of 34 c at its anthesis and grain filling stages from an extensive review of experimental evidence barlow et al 2015 suggested a threshold of 33 c for wheat at these physiological growth stages zaveri and lobell 2019 contended that there is limited guidance in the literature regarding the temperature thresholds for different crops and for wheat in india they assumed a threshold of 30 c during its growing period fixed temperature thresholds are ambiguous as these cannot capture the spatial and temporal variation in climatic conditions perkins and alexander 2013 massetti and mendelsohn 2015 zampieri et al 2017 zampieri et al 2017 constructed indices of heat waves independent of the pre determined thresholds and prior knowledge of statistical distributions of temperature they measured heat wave against different thresholds of daily maximum temperature i e 25th 75th and 90th percentiles for a window of two weeks for a given period there are three key aspects of excess temperature viz intensity persistence and frequency an index of heat wave can be constructed using either of these or a combination of these 2 2 see perkins and alexander 2013 for details the literature suggests that the indices constructed using more than one aspect of excess temperature are preferred over the ones built on a single aspect of it and the relative indices derived from location specific flexible temperature thresholds perform better than the absolute threshold indices developed using the fixed temperature thresholds fischer and schär 2010 perkins and alexander 2013 in this paper we define a heat wave if the daily maximum temperature at a location i exceeds its 90th percentile on a given day based on a 15 day window and the window is centered on the day in question and ii persists at least for three consecutive days mathematically it can be measured as hi maxt d i p 90 d i t where hi is the index of the heat wave maxt d i is the daily maximum temperature and p90d i t is the 90th percentile temperature the subscript d represents the day i the district and t the time trend the threshold of 90th percentile is considered an adequate representation of the population of measurable events as the higher thresholds may generate a small number of heat wave events and the lower thresholds too many heat wave events perkins and alexander 2013 zampieri et al 2017 for the same reason the persistence of excess temperature beyond a threshold at least for three consecutive days is thought an appropriate period for defining and measuring the heat wave our measure of the heat wave is comprehensive it takes into account the intensity persistence and frequency of excess temperature beyond a threshold and the threshold is non stationary varying across space and time accordingly we identify heat wave events and define the heat stress as cumulative of the heat wave events 3 data sources this paper uses district level data on crop production and weather variables from 1966 67 to 2011 12 the data on crop production have been taken from http vdsa icrisat ac in vdsa database htm the database available with the international crops research institute for the semi arid tropics icrisat patancheru india it contains information on several aspects of agriculture for 311 un apportioned districts at their 1970 boundaries the data on weather variables have been sourced from the indian meteorological department imd ministry of earth sciences government of india the imd provides 1 1 gridded data on daily temperature and rainfall from this dataset we have generated district level estimates of temperature and rainfall by assigning each weather station to a district whose centroid is nearest to it and then calculating the mean of the observations on each variable recorded at all the weather stations assigned to the district 4 estimation strategy fixed effects regression is a commonly used econometric technique in the impact evaluation literature and it has also been employed to evaluate the impact of climate change on agriculture e g schlenker and roberts 2009 yu and babcock 2010 birthal et al 2015 tack et al 2017 zaveri and lobell 2019 following this technique we write the relationship of wheat yield with heat stress and irrigation as 1 y it dct i i 1 n ϕ i dct i t β 1 hi it β 2 hi it hi it β 3 hi it t β 4 hi it hi it t β 5 ir it β 6 hi it ir it β 7 hi it hi it ir it β 8 hi it ir it t β 9 hi it hi it ir it t β 10 rn it ϵ it where the subscripts i and t denote the district and the time respectively y is the wheat yield hi is the measure of heat stress ir is the proportion of wheat cropped area irrigated and rn is the growing season rainfall dct represents the district fixed effects and t the time trend the interaction term dct t controls for the spatial and temporal variation in yield ϕ i and β s are the parameters to be estimated and ϵ it is the error term independently distributed with zero mean and finite variance the relationship between yield and temperature can be non linear schlenker and roberts 2009 lobell et al 2011 hence we include the squared term of heat stress hi hi in eq 1 further to know how the impacts of heat stress have evolved the hi and hi hi are interacted with t likewise hi and hi hi are interacted with ir and t to know the changes in the effectiveness of irrigation as an adaptation against heat stress eq 1 has three components i dct i i 1 n ϕ i dct i t ii β 1 hi it β 2 hi it hi it β 3 hi it t β 4 hi it hi it t β 5 ir it β 6 hi it ir it β 7 hi it hi it ir it β 8 hi it ir it t β 9 hi it hi it ir it t β 10 rn it and iii ϵ it the first component represents the deterministic trend with district specific mean wheat yield and it captures the effect of technical progress the second component explains variation in trend yield due to heat stress and irrigation and the third component captures the effect of random factors other than temperature and rainfall the regression coefficient on hi in eq 1 does not have a direct interpretation due to the confounding effect of its interactions with other variables we therefore estimate the marginal effect of heat stress on crop yield by taking a partial derivative of y with respect to hi 2 y loss y it hi it β 1 2 β 2 hi it β 3 t 2 β 4 hi it t β 6 ir it 2 β 7 hi it ir it β 8 ir it t 2 β 9 hi it ir it t if y it hi it 0 then heat stress is detrimental to the crop eq 2 can be manipulated to know the changes in the impact of heat stress on crop yield and also in the effectiveness of irrigation against heat stress accordingly we formulate the following null hypotheses i ho the impact of heat stress on crop yield has remained unchanged over time this hypothesis is tested by taking a partial derivative of eq 2 with respect to t 3 y loss t y loss t β 3 2 β 4 hi it β 8 ir it 2 β 9 hi it ir it if y loss t 0 then the impact of heat stress on crop yield has increased ii ho irrigation is not an effective means of reducing the harmful effect of heat stress on crop yield to test this we take a partial derivative of eq 2 with respect to ir 4 y loss i r y loss ir β 6 2 β 7 hi it β 8 t 2 β 9 hi it t if y loss ir 0 then the irrigation reduces the negative impact of heat stress iii ho the effectiveness of irrigation in reducing heat stress has not changed over time a partial derivative of eq 3 with respect to ir or of eq 4 with respect to t provides for a change in the effectiveness of irrigation against heat stress 5 y loss t ir y loss ir t β 8 2 β 9 hi it if y loss t ir o r y loss ir t 0 then the effectiveness of irrigation against heat stress has diminished 5 results wheat is a cool season crop in india it is sown during mid october to mid december and harvested during mid march to mid april the crop is more sensitive to excess temperature at its anthesis and grain filling stages i e about three months before its harvest gourdji et al 2013 lobell et al 2012 zampieri et al 2017 following the procedure outlined in section 2 we have constructed a measure of heat stress from february to april heat stress during these stages of crop growth is termed as terminal heat stress gupta et al 2010 5 1 temporal and spatial variation in heat stress to examine the trend in heat stress i e cumulative heat wave events we compare the hi for 1966 1980 1981 1995 and 1996 2011 table 1 the heat stress declined during 1981 1995 but increased in the subsequent period of the total heat wave events approximately 45 occurred during 1996 2011 21 during 1981 1995 and 36 during 1966 1980 further a comparison of the monthly hi shows april the most heat stressed month and february the least the heat stress however appears to have become intense in february i e during the anthesis stage on the whole these findings indicate an increase in heat stress and the indian farmers are exposed to 1 28 heat waves events from february to april to know whether the observed trends in heat stress are statistically significant we have estimated a probit equation regressing hi i e hi 1 if an event occurred and zero otherwise on t the regression coefficient on t is positive and highly significant for all the months alone or together table 2 the positive trend appears to be stronger during february this means an increase in the heat stress during the anthesis and grain filling stages of the crop to identify hotspots of heat stress the districts with a value of hi less than 50 of the median hi have been considered less prone to heat stress and those with hi exceeding 100 of the median hi as highly heat stressed fig 1a maps hotspots of heat stress much of the country appears to be heat stressed from february to april but it is the northwestern states that are more vulnerable to heat stress the mean heat wave events for these states during this period are found to be 1 86 significantly higher as compared to the national average of 1 28 wheat is a prominent crop in the north western states of uttar pradesh punjab haryana rajasthan and madhya pradesh together these states account for over three fourths of the area and 80 of the production of wheat fig 1b maps the spatial distribution of wheat cropped area as its median share in a district s total cropped area relative to its median share at the national level superimposing fig 1b on fig 1a prompts us to infer that the districts that specialize in wheat are also more exposed to heat stress the subsequent analysis in this paper is based on the data from wheat growing districts only 5 2 impact of heat stress on crop yield and benefits of irrigation a few model specification tests were undertaken to validate the choice of the fixed effects regression technique the test statistic are presented in table 3 the f test for joint significance of the district fixed effects is highly significant which suggests a preference for the fixed effects regression over the pooled regression the hausman test rejects the random effects in favor of the fixed effects regression further the f test favors district specific time trends over a common time trend it is possible that ϵ it in eq 1 is heteroskedastic and may affect standard errors of the regression coefficients the modified wald test χ2 value shows the presence of heteroscedastic errors and therefore to account for heteroscedasticity and serial correlation eq 1 is estimated with district clustered standard errors 3 3 our dataset is the panel dataset and we expect that dependent and independent variables are correlated over time this means that simple analytical standard errors may bias the significance of regression coefficients the district clustered standard errors are robust to within district correlation and heteroscedasticity the estimates from eq 1 could be spurious in case the time series of yield and heat stress is stationary or characterized by a random walk to check for the stationarity we conducted panel unit root tests i e im pesaran shin and fisher tests and their results are given in table a1 in appendix these tests reject the null hypothesis that the panels contain unit roots or the time series is stationary eq 1 is estimated as linear and log linear functions in both cases the regression coefficients on explanatory variables except rainfall are similar in their direction table 4 the log linear specification however provides more robust results the regression coefficient on hi and hi hi is statistically significant but opposite in direction negative on hi and positive on hi hi this means that heat stress negatively impacts crop yield and the impact is non linear further the positive and significant coefficient on hi t shows that the crop has become more vulnerable to heat stress the coefficient on irrigation is positive and significant which reinforces its essentiality in improving crop yield but does irrigation also reduce the sensitivity of the crop to heat stress the regression coefficient is strongly positive on hi ir and strongly negative on hi ir t this means that irrigation provides a cushion to the crop against heat stress but its effectiveness has diminished over time the regression coefficients presented in table 4 do not have an explicit interpretation because of the confounding effects of interactions of explanatory variables thus to know the average impact of heat stress and irrigation on crop yield we estimate the marginal effects table 5 the marginal effect of heat stress is negative and highly significant a single heat wave event at the anthesis and grain filling stages of wheat could reduce its yield by over 1 51 at an average of 1 86 heat wave events during this period the yield loss is estimated at 2 81 the marginal effect of irrigation is positive and significant if the distribution of heat stress does not change then a change in crop s tolerance to heat directly translates into the change in yield risk an increase decrease in crop s tolerance to heat results in a decrease increase in yield risk on this rationale we tested the hypotheses outlined in the previous section and the test results are given in table 6 the coefficient on y loss t is negative and highly significant rejecting the null hypothesis of no change in the impact of heat stress on crop yield in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the negative impact of heat stress has increased over time on the other hand the positive and significant coefficient on y loss ir implies that irrigation partially offsets the harmful effect of heat stress nonetheless the negative coefficient on y loss t ir suggests that the effectiveness of irrigation against heat stress has slowed down there is a possibility that the negative impact of heat stress might have increased due to an increase in the heat wave events to explore this we estimate the marginal effect of heat stress keeping the irrigation level 76 and the number of heat wave events 1 86 constant at their means the results presented in table 7 demonstrate an increase in the negative impact of heat stress further to re confirm the benefits of irrigation against heat stress we estimate a relationship between crop yield and heat stress at the mean level of irrigation 76 against a counterfactual of no irrigation fig 2 the response curve in both cases is negatively sloped but the one at the mean level of irrigation is on a higher plateau and less steep we go a step further and estimate the marginal effect of irrigation assuming no change in heat stress table 8 as expected an increase in irrigation level moderates the harmful effects of heat stress the yield loss at 90 irrigation level decreases to 0 91 from 1 21 under rainfed conditions these findings undoubtedly make it evident that irrigation besides its usual role in enhancing crop yield also reduces the negative impact of heat stress 5 3 robustness check how robust are our results to authenticate these from our measure of the heat wave we relax the condition of the persistence of the excess temperature for three or more consecutive days in favor of the excess temperature for the day in question and then re estimate eq 1 with the new measure the results are given in table a2 in appendix notably the direction and significance level of most explanatory variables remain the same as before and therefore our results appear to be robust to the measure of heat stress table 9 presents marginal effects associated with the new measure of heat stress irrigation level and time trend the marginal effects of irrigation and time trend are almost similar to those obtained before however the marginal effect of heat stress is much smaller now ostensibly the new measure neglects the persistence of excess temperature this confirms the observation in the empirical literature that the measure of heat stress heat wave constructed on more than one aspect of excess temperature is more efficient at explaining the variation in yield than does the measure built on a single aspect of it 6 discussion how do our estimates compare with those reported in the recent literature first let s look into the estimates of the impact of excess temperature or heat waves chung et al 2014 found a 20 reduction in maize yield in the us due to the 2012 heat wave massetti and mendelsohn 2015 estimated a reduction of 3 5 in maize yield 2 1 in soybean yield in the us due to a single heat wave event a few studies from india too have reported similar evidence gupta et al 2010 in their assessment of the loss in wheat yield due to a sudden rise in temperature during its grain filling stage in punjab in 2010 found 1 3 21 5 less yield over its previous level in several of the districts chakraborty et al 2019 also evaluated the impact of the 2010 heat wave on wheat in the northern states and found it to reduce yield by 3 5 4 9 under experimental conditions kaur and behl 2010 have estimated a 5 6 reduction in wheat yield due to a 5 c increase in temperature during its anthesis and grain filling stages lobell et al 2012 relying on the satellite data on daily temperature and growth of wheat crop have shown that a 2 c rise in temperature beyond the threshold of 34 c during the anthesis and grain filling stages could reduce its yield by 10 14 zaveri and lobell 2019 utilizing a long series of district level data estimated a reduction in wheat yield by about 5 when the growing period temperature crossed the threshold of 30 c next we look into the pieces of evidence on the effectiveness of irrigation in managing the adverse impact of climate change several studies have demonstrated that irrigation acts as a buffer against droughts and also excess temperatures from a meta analysis easterling et al 2007 have shown that irrigation or any other measure is beneficial for the crops against excess temperature for wheat the benefits were estimated at 16 bonfils and lobell 2007 have shown significant benefits from irrigation against droughts in the us but on a diminishing trend similar evidence has been reported by birthal et al 2015 for rice in india zaveri and lobell 2019 have found irrigation to reduce the sensitivity of wheat yield to excess temperature by about 20 nonetheless our study makes a few important contributions to the limited literature on the impacts of heat waves on agriculture and their management the key innovation is that the measure of heat stress in our study is comprehensive and objective it is built upon multiple aspects of excess temperature i e intensity persistence and frequency with location specific non stationary thresholds it better captures the impact of heat stress than does a measure built on a single aspect of excess temperature the study further highlights an accentuation in the negative impact of heat stress and a decline in the effectiveness of irrigation against it these findings are critical to evolving the strategies for mitigating the harmful impacts of heat stress 7 conclusions and implications using a panel of district level data from india this paper has assessed the impact of heat stress on the yield of wheat crop and also evaluated simultaneously the role of irrigation as an adaptation against heat stress there are two important highlights of this paper one heat stress negatively impacts crop yield and the impact has increased over time two irrigation besides its yield enhancing role also partially offsets the negative impact of heat stress but its effectiveness has declined over time given the predictions of rising temperature and growing water scarcity there is a very high probability of the negative impact of heat stress being stronger in the future a few important implications of these findings that merit attention relates to the management of irrigation and research on crop breeding and these are as follows presently almost entire wheat cropped area in india is irrigated but mostly utilizing the groundwater that has already been over exploited in several regions especially in the northwestern semi arid states of punjab haryana western uttar pradesh uttarakhand and rajasthan where rainfall is scarce and the groundwater table is low thus further adaptation gains from irrigation against heat stress must come from water management in terms of its harvesting and conservation and the adoption of pressurized irrigation systems i e drip and sprinkler systems and irrigation scheduling devices e g tensiometer that help save water and improve its use efficiency crop breeding research has a critical role in improving crops resilience to climate change lybbert and bell 2010 the stress tolerant traits embedded in seed act as insurance and unlike irrigation based risk management strategies the seed is not expensive to use is easy to multiply and provides long term solutions when irrigation water is scarce this suggests the need to reorient the agricultural research agenda more on the breeding of crops for heat tolerance finally there is considerable scope for wheat to beat the heat through the adoption of agronomic practices such as residue mulching zero tillage and balanced application of fertilizers especially potash that helps improve the resilience of crop against heat stress gupta et al 2010 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

9978,applying the fixed effects regression technique to the highly spatially disaggregated district level data from 1966 67 to 2011 12 this paper has assessed the impact of heat stress on wheat production in india and concurrently evaluated the role of irrigation towards offsetting its harmful impact it has brought out three key highlights one heat stress negatively impacts crop yield and the impact has increased over time two irrigation besides its contribution towards improving crop yield also moderates the harmful impact of heat stress but over time its effectiveness has declined three the measure of heat stress built on multiple aspects of excess temperature i e intensity persistence and frequency explains variation in crop yield better than does a single aspect of it given the increasing scarcity of irrigation water and rising temperature these findings suggest the need for exploring technological and policy options for improving irrigation water use efficiency and breeding of crops for heat tolerance and low water footprints keywords heat stress yield loss adaptation irrigation india 1 introduction the frequent occurrence of extreme climatic events such as droughts floods and heatwaves is one of the main causes of low agricultural productivity food and nutritional insecurity and persistent poverty in developing countries that heavily depend on agriculture and lack access to financial resources and technologies for risk management dercon 1996 dell et al 2012 gourdji et al 2013 challinor et al 2014 trnka et al 2014 amare et al 2018 zampieri et al 2017 have identified the heat wave as the second largest source of yield risk after droughts more so in the arid and semi arid regions the frequency of heat waves is predicted to increase in the future climate scenarios ipcc 2012 world bank 2013 panda et al 2017 the agricultural and socioeconomic consequences of which will be more severe in the absence of adoption of risk management strategies nevertheless the literature on climate risk management also provides for several technological and agronomic options such as planting of stress tolerant crop varieties adjustments in tillage sowing planting and other intercultural operations modifications in input applications and adoption of soil fertility and water management practices to avert damages due to extreme climatic events inter alia irrigation besides its primary role of increasing crop yield is also recognized as an important means of adapting to extreme climatic events like droughts and heat waves kurukulasuriya et al 2006 bonfils and lobell 2007 mendelsohn and seo 2007 easterling et al 2007 van der velde et al 2009 kurukulasuriya et al 2011 iglesias and garrote 2015 birthal et al 2015 tack et al 2017 vanschoenwinkel and van passel 2018 taraz 2018 zaveri and lobell 2019 most studies except lobell et al 2012 and massetti and mendelsohn 2015 have analyzed the impact of excess temperature during the entire crop growing period ignoring its timing and persistence this approach is likely to underestimate the impact of excess temperature as the sensitivity of crops to excess temperature varies by their physiological growth stages in general crops exhibit a greater sensitivity to excess temperature during the anthesis and grain filling stages i e about three months before the harvest gourdji et al 2013 lobell et al 2012 zampieri et al 2017 yet our current understanding of the crops responses to excess temperature or heat waves at different physiological growth stages is limited deryng et al 2014 tack et al 2017 from an extensive review of literature deryng et al 2014 have concluded that the global climate impact assessments have failed to address adequately the effects of climate extremes on crops especially the negative effects of heat waves taraz 2018 has also reported a lack of rigorous analysis of the relationship between crop yields and heat waves this paper assesses the impact of heat stress on wheat yield in india at its anthesis and grain filling stages and evaluates the role of irrigation in mitigating the harmful impact of heat stress in india wheat is the second largest staple food after rice in production as well as consumption in the past five decades driven by technological change and supported by investment in irrigation india s wheat production increased from about 17 million tons in 1967 68 to over 102 million tons in 2018 19 goi 2020 during this period the irrigated area under the crop more than doubled from 43 to 94 goi 2020 the expansion of irrigation however resulted from the over exploitation of groundwater concurrently the crop also came under pressure of abiotic stresses including an excessive rise in temperature at its anthesis and grain filling stages gupta et al 2010 inter alia these factors could have adversely affected the crop s performance this is reflected in the deceleration of its yield growth from 60 kg per hectare during 1985 86 to 2000 01 to 26 kg per hectare during 2000 01 to 2014 15 we use a panel dataset on 311 districts at their 1970 base spanning over 45 years beginning 1966 67 to comprehend how the impacts of heat stress and the benefits of irrigation against heat stress have evolved tracking trajectories of the negative impact of heat stress simultaneous with the effectiveness of different adaptation measures is essential to provide evidence based feedback to the policymakers to appropriately target the efforts and investments towards improving crops resilience to heat stress our study differs from several other studies most studies have embraced a single aspect of excess temperature mainly its intensity ignoring its timing and persistence in defining and measuring the heat wave our measure of the heat wave is built on multiple aspects of excess temperature and its non stationary location specific thresholds further most crops exhibit a greater sensitivity to heat stress at their anthesis and grain filling stages the index of heat stress in this paper is specific to the physiological stages of the crop and not for the entire crop growing period our econometric results highlight that i heat stress negatively impacts crop yield and the impact has increased over time and ii irrigation besides its contribution to higher yield also partially offsets the harmful impact of heat stress but its effectiveness has declined these findings suggest the need for exploring technological and policy interventions for improving irrigation water use efficiency and breeding of crops for heat tolerance and low water footprints the rest of the study is structured as follows the next section briefly discusses the concepts and issues in measuring the heat wave or heat stress data sources are provided in section 3 and section 4 outlines the econometric approach used to assess the benefits of irrigation against heat stress key results are presented in section 5 and are discussed in section 6 concluding remarks are made in the last section 2 concept and measurement of heat wave or heat stress the heat wave is a condition when the temperature rises beyond a threshold and persists consecutively for a few days the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2012 provides a generic definition of a heat wave as a period of abnormally high temperature capable of causing discomfort building on it lipiec et al 2013 have defined heat wave from an agricultural perspective as the rise in temperature beyond a threshold continuously for a period sufficient to cause damage to plant growth and development a more comprehensive definition of the heat wave was proposed by the world meteorological organization wmo that runs as the persistence of the daily maximum temperature above the average maximum temperature by 5 c at least for five consecutive days see rafferty 2018 the expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi 1 1 the expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi is jointly sponsored by the commission for climatology ccl of the world meteorological organization s climate research programme wcrp and the joint wmo ioc technical commission for oceanography and marine meteorology jcomm brings more objectivity and defines heat wave as a period of excess temperature if the daytime maximum temperature exceeds its 90th percentile for six consecutive days see for details perkins and alexander 2013 although objective in their definitions these measures of heat wave are not equally applicable at all locations alexander et al 2006 as the probability of persistence of excess temperature at least for five or six consecutive days is extremely small chaudhury et al 2000 panda et al 2014 perkins and alexander 2013 perkins and alexander 2013 therefore considered the persistence of excess temperature beyond a threshold consecutively for three or more days as more appropriate for defining it as the heat wave for the indian subcontinent srivastava et al 2009 have considered heat wave as a period of daily maximum temperature at a location exceeding the normal temperature at least by 3 c for a minimum of three consecutive days crops differ in their requirement of heat and the requirement varies by their physiological growth stages and across locations thus there is no universal temperature threshold for a crop beyond which the rise in temperature is detrimental to its growth and development nevertheless several studies have relied on fixed temperature thresholds e g rosenzweig et al 2001 gourdji et al 2013 hawkins et al 2013 lobell et al 2012 for french maize hawkins et al 2013 considered 32 c as the threshold and for wheat lobell et al 2012 and gourdji et al 2013 assumed a threshold of 34 c at its anthesis and grain filling stages from an extensive review of experimental evidence barlow et al 2015 suggested a threshold of 33 c for wheat at these physiological growth stages zaveri and lobell 2019 contended that there is limited guidance in the literature regarding the temperature thresholds for different crops and for wheat in india they assumed a threshold of 30 c during its growing period fixed temperature thresholds are ambiguous as these cannot capture the spatial and temporal variation in climatic conditions perkins and alexander 2013 massetti and mendelsohn 2015 zampieri et al 2017 zampieri et al 2017 constructed indices of heat waves independent of the pre determined thresholds and prior knowledge of statistical distributions of temperature they measured heat wave against different thresholds of daily maximum temperature i e 25th 75th and 90th percentiles for a window of two weeks for a given period there are three key aspects of excess temperature viz intensity persistence and frequency an index of heat wave can be constructed using either of these or a combination of these 2 2 see perkins and alexander 2013 for details the literature suggests that the indices constructed using more than one aspect of excess temperature are preferred over the ones built on a single aspect of it and the relative indices derived from location specific flexible temperature thresholds perform better than the absolute threshold indices developed using the fixed temperature thresholds fischer and schär 2010 perkins and alexander 2013 in this paper we define a heat wave if the daily maximum temperature at a location i exceeds its 90th percentile on a given day based on a 15 day window and the window is centered on the day in question and ii persists at least for three consecutive days mathematically it can be measured as hi maxt d i p 90 d i t where hi is the index of the heat wave maxt d i is the daily maximum temperature and p90d i t is the 90th percentile temperature the subscript d represents the day i the district and t the time trend the threshold of 90th percentile is considered an adequate representation of the population of measurable events as the higher thresholds may generate a small number of heat wave events and the lower thresholds too many heat wave events perkins and alexander 2013 zampieri et al 2017 for the same reason the persistence of excess temperature beyond a threshold at least for three consecutive days is thought an appropriate period for defining and measuring the heat wave our measure of the heat wave is comprehensive it takes into account the intensity persistence and frequency of excess temperature beyond a threshold and the threshold is non stationary varying across space and time accordingly we identify heat wave events and define the heat stress as cumulative of the heat wave events 3 data sources this paper uses district level data on crop production and weather variables from 1966 67 to 2011 12 the data on crop production have been taken from http vdsa icrisat ac in vdsa database htm the database available with the international crops research institute for the semi arid tropics icrisat patancheru india it contains information on several aspects of agriculture for 311 un apportioned districts at their 1970 boundaries the data on weather variables have been sourced from the indian meteorological department imd ministry of earth sciences government of india the imd provides 1 1 gridded data on daily temperature and rainfall from this dataset we have generated district level estimates of temperature and rainfall by assigning each weather station to a district whose centroid is nearest to it and then calculating the mean of the observations on each variable recorded at all the weather stations assigned to the district 4 estimation strategy fixed effects regression is a commonly used econometric technique in the impact evaluation literature and it has also been employed to evaluate the impact of climate change on agriculture e g schlenker and roberts 2009 yu and babcock 2010 birthal et al 2015 tack et al 2017 zaveri and lobell 2019 following this technique we write the relationship of wheat yield with heat stress and irrigation as 1 y it dct i i 1 n ϕ i dct i t β 1 hi it β 2 hi it hi it β 3 hi it t β 4 hi it hi it t β 5 ir it β 6 hi it ir it β 7 hi it hi it ir it β 8 hi it ir it t β 9 hi it hi it ir it t β 10 rn it ϵ it where the subscripts i and t denote the district and the time respectively y is the wheat yield hi is the measure of heat stress ir is the proportion of wheat cropped area irrigated and rn is the growing season rainfall dct represents the district fixed effects and t the time trend the interaction term dct t controls for the spatial and temporal variation in yield ϕ i and β s are the parameters to be estimated and ϵ it is the error term independently distributed with zero mean and finite variance the relationship between yield and temperature can be non linear schlenker and roberts 2009 lobell et al 2011 hence we include the squared term of heat stress hi hi in eq 1 further to know how the impacts of heat stress have evolved the hi and hi hi are interacted with t likewise hi and hi hi are interacted with ir and t to know the changes in the effectiveness of irrigation as an adaptation against heat stress eq 1 has three components i dct i i 1 n ϕ i dct i t ii β 1 hi it β 2 hi it hi it β 3 hi it t β 4 hi it hi it t β 5 ir it β 6 hi it ir it β 7 hi it hi it ir it β 8 hi it ir it t β 9 hi it hi it ir it t β 10 rn it and iii ϵ it the first component represents the deterministic trend with district specific mean wheat yield and it captures the effect of technical progress the second component explains variation in trend yield due to heat stress and irrigation and the third component captures the effect of random factors other than temperature and rainfall the regression coefficient on hi in eq 1 does not have a direct interpretation due to the confounding effect of its interactions with other variables we therefore estimate the marginal effect of heat stress on crop yield by taking a partial derivative of y with respect to hi 2 y loss y it hi it β 1 2 β 2 hi it β 3 t 2 β 4 hi it t β 6 ir it 2 β 7 hi it ir it β 8 ir it t 2 β 9 hi it ir it t if y it hi it 0 then heat stress is detrimental to the crop eq 2 can be manipulated to know the changes in the impact of heat stress on crop yield and also in the effectiveness of irrigation against heat stress accordingly we formulate the following null hypotheses i ho the impact of heat stress on crop yield has remained unchanged over time this hypothesis is tested by taking a partial derivative of eq 2 with respect to t 3 y loss t y loss t β 3 2 β 4 hi it β 8 ir it 2 β 9 hi it ir it if y loss t 0 then the impact of heat stress on crop yield has increased ii ho irrigation is not an effective

loss ir 0 then the irrigation reduces the negative impact of heat stress iii ho the effectiveness of irrigation in reducing heat stress has not changed over time a partial derivative of eq 3 with respect to ir or of eq 4 with respect to t provides for a change in the effectiveness of irrigation against heat stress 5 y loss t ir y loss ir t β 8 2 β 9 hi it if y loss t ir o r y loss ir t 0 then the effectiveness of irrigation against heat stress has diminished 5 results wheat is a cool season crop in india it is sown during mid october to mid december and harvested during mid march to mid april the crop is more sensitive to excess temperature at its anthesis and grain filling stages i e about three months before its harvest gourdji et al 2013 lobell et al 2012 zampieri et al 2017 following the procedure outlined in section 2 we have constructed a measure of heat stress from february to april heat stress during these stages of crop growth is termed as terminal heat stress gupta et al 2010 5 1 temporal and spatial variation in heat stress to examine the trend in heat stress i e cumulative heat wave events we compare the hi for 1966 1980 1981 1995 and 1996 2011 table 1 the heat stress declined during 1981 1995 but increased in the subsequent period of the total heat wave events approximately 45 occurred during 1996 2011 21 during 1981 1995 and 36 during 1966 1980 further a comparison of the monthly hi shows april the most heat stressed month and february the least the heat stress however appears to have become intense in february i e during the anthesis stage on the whole these findings indicate an increase in heat stress and the indian farmers are exposed to 1 28 heat waves events from february to april to know whether the observed trends in heat stress are statistically significant we have estimated a probit equation regressing hi i e hi 1 if an event occurred and zero otherwise on t the regression coefficient on t is positive and highly significant for all the months alone or together table 2 the positive trend appears to be stronger during february this means an increase in the heat stress during the anthesis and grain filling stages of the crop to identify hotspots of heat stress the districts with a value of hi less than 50 of the median hi have been considered less prone to heat stress and those with hi exceeding 100 of the median hi as highly heat stressed fig 1a maps hotspots of heat stress much of the country appears to be heat stressed from february to april but it is the northwestern states that are more vulnerable to heat stress the mean heat wave events for these states during this period are found to be 1 86 significantly higher as compared to the national average of 1 28 wheat is a prominent crop in the north western states of uttar pradesh punjab haryana rajasthan and madhya pradesh together these states account for over three fourths of the area and 80 of the production of wheat fig 1b maps the spatial distribution of wheat cropped area as its median share in a district s total cropped area relative to its median share at the national level superimposing fig 1b on fig 1a prompts us to infer that the districts that specialize in wheat are also more exposed to heat stress the subsequent analysis in this paper is based on the data from wheat growing districts only 5 2 impact of heat stress on crop yield and benefits of irrigation a few model specification tests were undertaken to validate the choice of the fixed effects regression technique the test statistic are presented in table 3 the f test for joint significance of the district fixed effects is highly significant which suggests a preference for the fixed effects regression over the pooled regression the hausman test rejects the random effects in favor of the fixed effects regression further the f test favors district specific time trends over a common time trend it is possible that ϵ it in eq 1 is heteroskedastic and may affect standard errors of the regression coefficients the modified wald test χ2 value shows the presence of heteroscedastic errors and therefore to account for heteroscedasticity and serial correlation eq 1 is estimated with district clustered standard errors 3 3 our dataset is the panel dataset and we expect that dependent and independent variables are correlated over time this means that simple analytical standard errors may bias the significance of regression coefficients the district clustered standard errors are robust to within district correlation and heteroscedasticity the estimates from eq 1 could be spurious in case the time series of yield and heat stress is stationary or characterized by a random walk to check for the stationarity we conducted panel unit root tests i e im pesaran shin and fisher tests and their results are given in table a1 in appendix these tests reject the null hypothesis that the panels contain unit roots or the time series is stationary eq 1 is estimated as linear and log linear functions in both cases the regression coefficients on explanatory variables except rainfall are similar in their direction table 4 the log linear specification however provides more robust results the regression coefficient on hi and hi hi is statistically significant but opposite in direction negative on hi and positive on hi hi this means that heat stress negatively impacts crop yield and the impact is non linear further the positive and significant coefficient on hi t shows that the crop has become more vulnerable to heat stress the coefficient on irrigation is positive and significant which reinforces its essentiality in improving crop yield but does irrigation also reduce the sensitivity of the crop to heat stress the regression coefficient is strongly positive on hi ir and strongly negative on hi ir t this means that irrigation provides a cushion to the crop against heat stress but its effectiveness has diminished over time the regression coefficients presented in table 4 do not have an explicit interpretation because of the confounding effects of interactions of explanatory variables thus to know the average impact of heat stress and irrigation on crop yield we estimate the marginal effects table 5 the marginal effect of heat stress is negative and highly significant a single heat wave event at the anthesis and grain filling stages of wheat could reduce its yield by over 1 51 at an average of 1 86 heat wave events during this period the yield loss is estimated at 2 81 the marginal effect of irrigation is positive and significant if the distribution of heat stress does not change then a change in crop s tolerance to heat directly translates into the change in yield risk an increase decrease in crop s tolerance to heat results in a decrease increase in yield risk on this rationale we tested the hypotheses outlined in the previous section and the test results are given in table 6 the coefficient on y loss t is negative and highly significant rejecting the null hypothesis of no change in the impact of heat stress on crop yield in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the negative impact of heat stress has increased over time on the other hand the positive and significant coefficient on y loss ir implies that irrigation partially offsets the harmful effect of heat stress nonetheless the negative coefficient on y loss t ir suggests that the effectiveness of irrigation against heat stress has slowed down there is a possibility that the negative impact of heat stress might have increased due to an increase in the heat wave events to explore this we estimate the marginal effect of heat stress keeping the irrigation level 76 and the number of heat wave events 1 86 constant at their means the results presented in table 7 demonstrate an increase in the negative impact of heat stress further to re confirm the benefits of irrigation against heat stress we estimate a relationship between crop yield and heat stress at the mean level of irrigation 76 against a counterfactual of no irrigation fig 2 the response curve in both cases is negatively sloped but the one at the mean level of irrigation is on a higher plateau and less steep we go a step further and estimate the marginal effect of irrigation assuming no change in heat stress table 8 as expected an increase in irrigation level moderates the harmful effects of heat stress the yield loss at 90 irrigation level decreases to 0 91 from 1 21 under rainfed conditions these findings undoubtedly make it evident that irrigation besides its usual role in enhancing crop yield also reduces the negative impact of heat stress 5 3 robustness check how robust are our results to authenticate these from our measure of the heat wave we relax the condition of the persistence of the excess temperature for three or more consecutive days in favor of the excess temperature for the day in question and then re estimate eq 1 with the new measure the results are given in table a2 in appendix notably the direction and significance level of most explanatory variables remain the same as before and therefore our results appear to be robust to the measure of heat stress table 9 presents marginal effects associated with the new measure of heat stress irrigation level and time trend the marginal effects of irrigation and time trend are almost similar to those obtained before however the marginal effect of heat stress is much smaller now ostensibly the new measure neglects the persistence of excess temperature this confirms the observation in the empirical literature that the measure of heat stress heat wave constructed on more than one aspect of excess temperature is more efficient at explaining the variation in yield than does the measure built on a single aspect of it 6 discussion how do our estimates compare with those reported in the recent literature first let s look into the estimates of the impact of excess temperature or heat waves chung et al 2014 found a 20 reduction in maize yield in the us due to the 2012 heat wave massetti and mendelsohn 2015 estimated a reduction of 3 5 in maize yield 2 1 in soybean yield in the us due to a single heat wave event a few studies from india too have reported similar evidence gupta et al 2010 in their assessment of the loss in wheat yield due to a sudden rise in temperature during its grain filling stage in punjab in 2010 found 1 3 21 5 less yield over its previous level in several of the districts chakraborty et al 2019 also evaluated the impact of the 2010 heat wave on wheat in the northern states and found it to reduce yield by 3 5 4 9 under experimental conditions kaur and behl 2010 have estimated a 5 6 reduction in wheat yield due to a 5 c increase in temperature during its anthesis and grain filling stages lobell et al 2012 relying on the satellite data on daily temperature and growth of wheat crop have shown that a 2 c rise in temperature beyond the threshold of 34 c during the anthesis and grain filling stages could reduce its yield by 10 14 zaveri and lobell 2019 utilizing a long series of district level data estimated a reduction in wheat yield by about 5 when the growing period temperature crossed the threshold of 30 c next we look into the pieces of evidence on the effectiveness of irrigation in managing the adverse impact of climate change several studies have demonstrated that irrigation acts as a buffer against droughts and also excess temperatures from a meta analysis easterling et al 2007 have shown that irrigation or any other measure is beneficial for the crops against excess temperature for wheat the benefits were estimated at 16 bonfils and lobell 2007 have shown significant benefits from irrigation against droughts in the us but on a diminishing trend similar evidence has been reported by birthal et al 2015 for rice in india zaveri and lobell 2019 have found irrigation to reduce the sensitivity of wheat yield to excess temperature by about 20 nonetheless our study makes a few important contributions to the limited literature on the impacts of heat waves on agriculture and their management the key innovation is that the measure of heat stress in our study is comprehensive and objective it is built upon multiple aspects of excess temperature i e intensity persistence and frequency with location specific non stationary thresholds it better captures the impact of heat stress than does a measure built on a single aspect of excess temperature the study further highlights an accentuation in the negative impact of heat stress and a decline in the effectiveness of irrigation against it these findings are critical to evolving the strategies for mitigating the harmful impacts of heat stress 7 conclusions and implications using a panel of district level data from india this paper has assessed the impact of heat stress on the yield of wheat crop and also evaluated simultaneously the role of irrigation as an adaptation against heat stress there are two important highlights of this paper one heat stress negatively impacts crop yield and the impact has increased over time two irrigation besides its yield enhancing role also partially offsets the negative impact of heat stress but its effectiveness has declined over time given the predictions of rising temperature and growing water scarcity there is a very high probability of the negative impact of heat stress being stronger in the future a few important implications of these findings that merit attention relates to the management of irrigation and research on crop breeding and these are as follows presently almost entire wheat cropped area in india is irrigated but mostly utilizing the groundwater that has already been over exploited in several regions especially in the northwestern semi arid states of punjab haryana western uttar pradesh uttarakhand and rajasthan where rainfall is scarce and the groundwater table is low thus further adaptation gains from irrigation against heat stress must come from water management in terms of its harvesting and conservation and the adoption of pressurized irrigation systems i e drip and sprinkler systems and irrigation scheduling devices e g tensiometer that help save water and improve its use efficiency crop breeding research has a critical role in improving crops resilience to climate change lybbert and bell 2010 the stress tolerant traits embedded in seed act as insurance and unlike irrigation based risk management strategies the seed is not expensive to use is easy to multiply and provides long term solutions when irrigation water is scarce this suggests the need to reorient the agricultural research agenda more on the breeding of crops for heat tolerance finally there is considerable scope for wheat to beat the heat through the adoption of agronomic practices such as residue mulching zero tillage and balanced application of fertilizers especially potash that helps improve the resilience of crop against heat stress gupta et al 2010 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

formation of biocrusts decreases the soil moisture thus leading to the degradation of artificially planted shrubs in a semiarid condition a large number of studies have shown that biocrusts can reduce soil permeability by increasing hydrophobicity and plugging pores kidron et al 1999 fischer et al 2010 wang et al 2017 xiao et al 2019a therefore knowledge of how to increase the soil water infiltration in biocrusts in sandy ecosystems remains to be solved plant litter accumulates on the rough sandy surface soil and forms litter crusts over time under the combined action of wind and rain in natural sandy ecosystems jia et al 2018b unlike the soil physical crusts and biocrusts litter crusts have positive effects on the hydrological process the litter layer shapes a new microenvironment and modifies the original ecological functions chomel et al 2016 which is an important soil protection agent besides litter layer can effectively intercept rainfall acharya et al 2017 promote the infiltration of rainfall and prevent runoff and soil loss liu et al 2017 although studies have shown that surfactants could reduce soil water repellency by reducing the surface tension of water and the equilibrium contact angle between water and the soil surface they are mostly used in sand based turfgrass systems and sand golf greens cisar et al 2000 müller and deurer 2011 surfactants not only are insufficient in solving large scale landscape problems but also increase soil ph and inhibit the growth of seedlings during long term use hence finding a way to break the water repellency of biocrusts and to promote the effective infiltration of precipitation remains as two unsolved questions in sandy soil surfaces here we hypothesize that litter cover may break the water repellency of biocrusts by a physical mechanism and improve soil infiltrability on sandy surface soils this study was conducted in a typical sandy region with wind water erosion staggered populus simonii is usually used as the main tree species for wind sheltering and sand fixation due to its characteristics of cold tolerance drought tolerance and fast growth by measuring the difference in soil infiltration rate and soil water content with or without litter cover leaves of planted populus simonii we quantified the effects of litter cover on the initial soil infiltration rate and soil water content in sandy biocrusts this study aims to test if litter cover can break the water repellency of biocrusts and thus contribute to the ecological restoration in sandy ecosystems the results might be helpful to solve the problem of low initial soil infiltration performance of biocrusts in sandy ecosystems and have important significance to improve microhabitat 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the

wind erosion crisscross zone which belongs to the continental monsoon climate liu et al 2019 the mean annual precipitation is 437 mm and mostly occurs as high intensity rainstorms in the summer months between july and september the potential evaporation is approximately 80 higher than that of precipitation and the aridity index is 1 8 the mean annual daily temperature is 8 4 c and the coldest and warmest months are 9 7 c in january and 23 7 c in july respectively jia et al 2018a b liu et al 2019 the annual average wind speed is about 2 2 m s and wind erosion occurs frequently in spring and

planted for about 20 years long term wind erosion and water erosion have formed a typical landscape litter crust the phenomenon of plant litters and sand grains bonded together in the sandy ecosystem the specific formation process has been described in jia et al 2018b and liu et al 2019 there are typical soil physical crust biocrusts and litter crust on the soil surface in the study area the coverage of biocrusts reaches about 40 mainly dominated by lichen and moss jia et al 2018b 2 2 experimental design and soil sampling in july 2019 bare sandy land bsl physical crusts pc biocrusts bc litter covered biocrusts lbc and litter crusts lc were selected to investigate their effects on soil infiltrability the initial soil infiltration rate and soil cumulative infiltration and soil water content in the semi arid sandy system fig 1 bare sandy land is the original soil characteristics of the sandy ecosystem physical crust is a kind of soil crust formed on the surface of the soil because the soil pores are clogged by fine particles during the rainfall process bu et al 2013 biocrusts were formed by combining soil particles and organic matter with different proportions of lichens algae cyanobacteria and mosses ravi et al 2011 belnap et al 2016 and the long term coverage of biocrusts with litter is also a common feature in this area litter crusts refer to the cohesiveness of the soil surface formed by soil and litter through long term decomposition and decay of litter under the conditions of rain erosion and wind burial jia et al 2018b these types of crust existed simultaneously and distributed randomly in the study area wu et al 2020 to ensure the reliability of data and results three sites with a minimum distance of 500 m were selected in each site three quadrats 1 1 m were randomly selected to soil sampling each treatment included nine replications because the influences of crusts on soil properties are mainly focused on the surface soil wu et al 2020 nine vertical soil profiles with a depth of 10 cm in each treatment were excavated with shovels the soil samples of three soil depths 0 2 cm 2 5 cm and 5 10 cm were collected in an aluminum box with a small spoon the

15 cm in height was used to determine the infiltrability of all treatments in the adjacent position of the above sample sites zaibon et al 2017 five replicates were performed in each treatment and the mean initial infiltration rate was calculated by averaging these five values because the unrotten litter can float on the water surface it affects the measurement of rate of water surface decline during the infiltration process before the infiltration experiment we carefully removed the unrotten litter on the crusts the ring was vertically inserted into the soil the inserted depth was at least 5 cm to prevent water outflow and to avoid water leakage from the ring the soil materials with the same texture were used to support and protect the outside of the ring liu et al 2019 the water is then quickly added to the ring and a stopwatch was used to record the time it took for each 4 cm drop in the water level and a paper board 8 8 cm was placed in the ring above the crust and soil to prevent destroying the original crust structure when the water was added into the ring liu et al 2019 the initial infiltration rate was calculated by averaging the record times 2 4 statistical analyses in this study a nested design was adopted to rigorously explore the effects of different treatments on soil infiltrability and soil water content under different soil layers which improved the robustness of the results thus two way analysis of variance anova was used to analyze the effects of different types of soil crusts and soil layers under the types of soil crusts soil layers types of soil crusts on the sandy soil parameters and the quadratic sum was calculated by using model ⅰ and the significant difference was tested at the level of 0 05 by using mann whitney wilcoxon test

soil biocrusts are widespread in arid and semi arid regions covering about 12 of earth s terrestrial surface belnap et al 2016 the initial soil water infiltration process in biocrusts was inhibited under the tension and ponding conditions in dryland ecosystems xiao et al 2019a in this study litter cover markedly broke the water repellency of biocrusts causing a significant increase of the initial soil water infiltration of bc the initial infiltration rate was high in lbc 2 2 cm min and lc 2 8 cm min which were 215 and 280 higher than that of bc 1 0 cm min respectively fig 2 the infiltration rates decreased with time in lbc while it remained at a relatively low level in the bc since the beginning until the end of the experiments fig 3a furthermore lc and lbc showed the same cumulative infiltration in less time than bc fig 3b in general the initial soil infiltration rate was lower in biocrusts but higher in litter covered biocrusts and litter crusts this might confirm our hypothesis that litter cover breaks soil water repellency of biocrusts by enhancing the initial soil water infiltration and soil water content in sandy ecosystem firstly the rough surface of litter covered biocrusts can trap dust particles on the litter surface prevent fine particles from blocking soil porosity and thus improve soil water infiltration rate verrecchia et al 1995 kidron et al 2008 secondly exopolysaccharide produced by biocrusts may absorb water swell and clog pores colica et al 2014 which enhances the water repellency of biocrusts souza egipsy et al 2002 thirdly the external environment such as soil temperature soil humidity and light intensity determines the growth and metabolism of biocrusts belnap 2003 the presence of litters alters the microhabitat of biocrusts by reducing soil temperature water evaporation and light intensity on the surface of biocrusts gradually leading to the decomposition of biocrusts jia et al 2018a wu et al 2020 accordingly the decomposition of biocrusts promotes microorganism decomposition and nutrient release thus improving soil physical and chemical characteristics e g soil organic matter soil porosity nutrient content wu

significant p 0 05 the average swcs in lbc 10 2 and lc 11 7 were 2 9 and 3 3 times greater than that in bc respectively fig 4 besides swcs increased with the increase of soil depth both the types of soil crust f 236 320 df 4 p 0 001 and soil layers types of soil crust f 82 416 df 10 p 0 001 had significant effects on swc table 1 meanwhile litter cover improved the total soil porosity lc had the

table 1 in general swc increases in the litter crusts and the litter covered biocrusts this finding indicates that litter cover not only enhances the initial soil water infiltration rates of biocrusts during litter crusts formation but also increases rainfall interception thus reducing surface water loss via runoff generation van stan et al 2017 have found that litter cover intercepts 2 32 total rainfall amount litter crusts isolate the contact between soil surface and atmosphere alter the bidirectional flow of liquid water and water vapor as well as reduce light intensity dunkerley 2015 jia et al 2018a wu et al 2020 all of which are conducive to soil water retention liu et al 2019 the soil becomes water repellency when the soil water content is lower than a certain critical threshold dekker et al 2001 rueda et al 2016 rueda et al 2016 found that because early spring plants require much more water than autumn this causes faster drying of soil and improves the water repellency of the soil surface this means that dry soil may promote the development of soil water repellency through the research on the water repellency of the surface soil in the sandy land dekker et al 2001 found that the soil water content of the transition zone is about 14 23 the soil water content of biocrusts is significantly lower than the water content of the transition zone so biocrusts have a certain degree of water repellency before the infiltration experiment rueda et al 2016 also found that soil water content has a negative effect on soil water repellency therefore litter cover can increase the soil moisture content of biocrusts thereby reducing the water repellency of biocrusts meanwhile litter cover improves soil surface microenvironment and is conductive to increasing soil organic matter content total porosity and enhancing the initial soil infiltration rate and soil water contents in sandy ecosystem liu et al 2019 wu et al 2020 in general litter cover breaks the water repellency of biocrusts and greatly increases soil infiltrability and soil water storage capacity which is helpful for the water exchange and the ecological restoration in sandy ecosystem 4 conclusions this study proved that litter covered biocrusts significantly improved the soil infiltrability and contributed to the replenishment of soil water contents in the topsoil layers 0 10 cm depth by rainfall the average initial soil infiltration rates of litter crusts and litter covered biocrusts were 280 and 215 higher than that of biocrusts respectively similarly the soil water content the highest in litter crusts followed by litter covered biocrusts and biocrusts respectively our findings revealed that litter cover and litter crusts increased total soil porosity broke soil water repellency and increased the initial soil infiltration rate which is helpful for the water exchange and the ecological restoration in sandy ecosystem this study suggests that litter cover helps to improve the soil water content in sandy soils where biocrusts exist and has great application significances for the ecological restoration in sandy ecosystems declaration of competing interest the
