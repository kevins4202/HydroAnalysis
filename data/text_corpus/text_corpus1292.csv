warnings managing weather related risks and insurance and designing hydraulic structures katz et al 2002 this focused review of the recent literature on precipitation frequency analysis based on remotely sensed datasets aims first to depict the state of the art second to identify the crucial gaps in knowledge and methodology and third to propose research directions toward making those advances that promise immediate impact water resources design requires knowledge on the extreme precipitation that falls within a given area e g a basin and time interval characteristic of each basin the importance of both spatial variability and duration complicates the investigation of extreme precipitation as precipitation is traditionally measured at selected locations little is known about its variability in space in fact only precipitation extremes corresponding to different durations are usually analyzed to derive analytical relationships linking the precipitation intensity at a given duration to its probability of exceedance at a specific location the so called intensity duration frequency curves such relationships generally consist of extreme value distributions fitting the tail of the precipitation intensity distribution chosen either as the annual maxima annual maxima series or ams or the values exceeding a high threshold peaks over threshold or pot extreme value theory fischer and tippett 1928 gnedenko 1943 provides the statistical background under some general assumptions the extremes of large samples of independent and identically distributed random variables can only converge to the generalized extreme value in the case of ams or the generalized pareto pot distributions to grant a good fit long records of homogeneous data are required when these are not available regionalization approaches can be used to pool data from multiple locations buishand 1991 precipitation extremes at different durations are strongly related to each other parametric

used to describe these relationships reducing the number of parameters and enabling interpolation based regionalization nhat et al 2008 the interpolation is however nontrivial as interparameter relationships need to be considered the spatial variability of precipitation extremes is then considered defining area reduction factors arfs to convert the point scale to the areal scale of hydrological interest svensson and jones 2010 or including the precipitation correlation structure in the analysis sivapalan and bl√∂schl 1998 because of the sparseness and point nature of rain gauges worldwide kidd et al 2017 the resulting design values can be highly uncertain in addition it is almost sure that the maximal precipitation intensity during an event will not be captured by the rain gauge networks potentially leading to increased uncertainties in the derived quantiles ground based weather radars estimate precipitation at the regional scale with resolutions of 1 2 km 5 10 min whereas satellite based precipitation products currently reach around 4 km half hourly resolutions with quasi global coverage michaelides et al 2009 these capabilities give remotely sensed datasets rsds the potential to overcome the sampling limitations of gauges collier et al 1989 their records are however recent spanning around 10 30 years and tend to have estimation errors so their use for frequency analysis is not straightforward villarini and krajewski 2010 kidd and levizzani 2011 pioneering studies sought to derive arfs relying on the expectation that estimation and fitting uncertainties would diminish when consistent data sources were used for both point and areal scales frederick et al 1977 stewart 1989 bacchi and ranzi 1996 durrans et al 2002 allen and de gaetano 2005 lombardo et al 2006 olivera et al 2008 overeem et al 2010 the direct use of rsds for precipitation frequency analysis began only in the last decade overeem et al 2009 endreny and imbeah 2009 but the number of studies has been rapidly increasing in the wake of proliferating data records improving estimation methods and methodological advances this focused review collects the state of the art on precipitation frequency analysis based on remotely sensed datasets particular attention is given to the studies which proposed innovative approaches to exploit the available information innovative statistical methods to treat the short remote sensing data records or innovative contributions to body of knowledge concerning the climatology of extremes 2 state of the art precipitation frequency analyses based on rsds have four main objectives a to derive high quantiles for design applications b to enable extreme precipitation monitoring and early warning c to derive subdaily precipitation quantiles through temporal downscaling of daily multi daily gauge observations and d to obtain insights into the climatology of extreme precipitation in general the dataset native spatial resolution is kept unchanged while data are aggregated in time to gather information on subdaily durations in the case of radar 15 24 h and longer durations mostly daily for satellite data subdaily analyses from satellite data are also reported 2 1 derivation of high quantiles for design applications despite the length of the records 30 or so years at most but often only around 10 20 years information on high quantiles with return periods of 100 or even 1 000 years is sought overeem et al 2009 wright et al 2013 gado et al 2017 for hydrological design in ungauged regions with such a mismatch between available data records and quantiles of interest large uncertainties are expected in the extreme value analyses papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 pot should be preferred over ams since a larger data sample can be exploited and the parameter estimation uncertainty reduced when dealing with distributed data however the problem of threshold selection becomes challenging because of the need to operate automatically at each grid point while maintaining spatial consistency langousis et al 2016a b most studies so far have relied on ams endreny and imbeah 2009 pombo and de oliveira 2015 faridzad et al 2018 ombadi et al 2018 sometimes drawing upon regionalization to reduce the uncertainty only rarely is the pot approach undertaken goudenhoofdt et al 2017 demirdjian et al 2018 validation of the obtained quantiles against collocated gauges shows large uncertainties explained by the short data records which can be reduced using regionalization methods overeem et al 2009 eldardiry et al 2015 goudenhoofdt et al 2017 demirdjian et al 2018 important systematic biases are reported with both underestimation overeem et al 2009 eldardiry et al 2015 pombo and de oliveira 2015 and overestimation marra and morin 2015 with respect to the reference gauge derived quantiles the underestimation is likely caused by conditional bias in extreme precipitation estimates both in radar berne and krajewski 2013 and satellite kidd and levizzani 2011 products while overestimation is likely caused by inflated variance in the presence of large random errors marra and morin 2015 and by uncertain quantification of the tail of the distribution in presence of short records papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 2 2 enabling of extreme precipitation monitoring and early warning frequency information from rsds can be exploited to calculate extreme quantiles for real time monitoring and early warning over ungauged or poorly gauged areas borga et al 2014 extreme quantiles derived from rsds are used to define thresholds and when the monitoring early warning system is fed using information from the same dataset systematic biases are expected to be largely reduced zhou et al 2015 real time operational applications are generally based on relatively low quantiles up to 25 years return period so the inaccuracy related to the short records is expected to be considerably reduced the application of radar based tools in gauged areas shows good potential for complementing operational nowcasting systems panziera et al 2016 and the implementation of satellite based systems to monitor ungauged areas is deemed promising zhou et al 2015 particularly when the uncertainties related to extreme value analysis are diminished demirdjian et al 2018 2 3 derivation of subdaily precipitation quantiles through temporal downscaling of precipitation extremes temporal statistics of the precipitation indirect measurements can be used to downscale daily or monthly observations to short scale extremes relationships between short scale and aggregated statistics can be derived from satellite products awadallah et al 2011 awadallah and awadallah 2013 and combined with ground observations to obtain local statistics another possibility is to combine the relative distribution of precipitation directly from the radar with observed high precipitation amounts available for daily time aggregations bardossy and pegram 2017 the derivation of areal precipitation statistics is also possible 2 4 obtaining of insights into the climatology of extreme precipitation improved knowledge on the spatial distribution of precipitation frequency can shed light on the factors driving and modulating extreme precipitation analyses using rsds can identify spatial gradients with unprecedented resolution demirdjian et al 2018 direct comparisons of frequency analyses based on radar and satellite products aggregated to common spatiotemporal resolution have shown good correlation in the estimated quantiles mutually confirming the spatial patterns reported by completely different observation geometries and retrieval methods marra et al 2017 and pointing for example to distinct differences between extremes in close by arid and mediterranean regions marra and morin 2015 marra et al 2017 3 methodological gaps two main issues reportedly decrease the quantitative accuracy of frequency analyses based on rsds the quantitative inaccuracy of extreme precipitation estimates and the inadequacy of the adopted statistical methods in addition our review underlines a third issue a lack of proper reference data and validation methods 3 1 quantitative inaccuracy of extreme precipitation estimates weather radar and satellite based estimates due to the indirect precipitation retrievals are affected by a variety of sources of error in particular when extremes are considered villarini and krajewski 2010 aghakouchak et al 2011 nastos et al 2013 miao et al 2015 prakash et al 2015 eldardiry et al 2017 these problems generally manifest as underestimation of extreme precipitation leading to systematic underestimation of the high quantiles see for example eldardiry et al 2015 or large estimation uncertainties random errors increasing the likelihood of overestimating the ams pot and thus the extrapolated quantiles haberlandt and berndt 2016 marra et al 2018 fig 1 shows the estimated uncertainties caused by estimation errors use of short records and mismatch between the areal and point scales in hourly precipitation quantiles in mediterranean climate artefacts caused by retrieval algorithms or measurement errors can mask the climatic signals or cause misinterpretation of climatological analyses based on rsds figs 2 and 3 for instance small water bodies such as the lakes portions of the red sea and even the nile delta fig 2a or the big lakes region fig 3 appear as areas with increased quantiles whereas the coastal gradient observed in the eastern mediterranean shoreline by passive microwave sensors fig 2a is confirmed as a climatic signal by radar estimates fig 2b in addition possible changes in time of hardware and or data elaboration chain may introduce time dependent errors whose impact is not well understood the conditional bias in rsds can be decreased using standard adjustment procedures overeem et al 2009 faridzad et al 2018 or probability matching methods gado et al 2017 goudenhoofdt et al 2017 benchmarked on gauge measurements the impact of random errors can be reduced by pooling data from homogeneous regions demirdjian et al 2018 or near by pixels goudenhoofdt et al 2017 and adopting classic regionalization schemes 3 2 inadequacy of the adopted statistical methods the short record length represents a crucial drawback for rsd based analyses first large uncertainties are caused by the use of few data points to estimate the parameters of extreme value distributions with a tendency toward overestimation of their tails sornette 2003 eldardiry et al 2015 marra et al 2018 second the sample of extreme climatology is incomplete potentially biasing the estimation of high quantiles marani and zanetti 2015 regionalization methods overeem et al 2009 endreny and imbeah 2009 overeem et al 2010 eldardiry et al 2015 panziera et al 2016 gado et al 2017 or stochastic storm transposition wright et al 2013 wright et al 2017 can be beneficial in reducing the issues related to parameter estimation fig 4 but require hypotheses on the spatial homogeneity of extreme precipitation that are sometimes difficult to support for instance when the study involves ungauged areas or regions characterized by strong climatic gradients marra and morin 2015 viable ways to overcome this problem are to use data driven regionalization techniques paixao et al 2015 demirdjian et al 2018 or to exploit the gridded structure of rsds defining pixel centered regions goudenhoofdt et al 2017 the pot approach is used to improve the parameter estimation at the price of requiring an automatic threshold selection method fukutome et al 2015 solari et al 2017 it should however be noted that other studies have shown no appreciable improvement with respect to ams schl√∂gl and laaha 2017 marra et al 2018 in the case of rsd based analyses the problem of climatic nonstationarity is expected to be negligible due to the short time spanned by the rsds serinaldi and kilsby 2015 possible trends cannot be captured using such short records and the obtained quantiles are representative of the current conditions nonstationarities could however arise from the use of varying data elaboration procedures in the creation of the rsd over time potentially affecting the estimation of the extreme value distribution parameters willems 2000 3 3 lack of proper reference data and validation methods as no direct measurement of high quantiles is available validation relies upon extrapolation from data recognized as reliable rain gauges provide the natural data source and rsd derived quantiles are benchmarked against gauge derived quantiles obtained using standard extreme value methods see for example overeem et al 2009 eldardiry et al 2015 gado et al 2017 demirdjian et al 2018 mcgraw et al 2019 this approach disregards the scale mismatch between rsds and gauges by six to nine orders of magnitude which is expected to translate into differences between the corresponding quantiles tang et al 2018 additionally rsds generally provide temporal snapshots of the rainfall fields contrary to the traditional point measurements these describe the state at a given instant and do not provide temporal integrals villarini et al 2008 this may lead to different distributional properties which should be taken into account a proper quantification of these effects is difficult due to the dependence on spatial and temporal scales geographical region and quantile of interest when using short data records the random component of these mismatches is large enough that both over and underestimation are to be expected even under ideal measurement conditions for both rsds and gauges peleg et al 2018 fig 1 systematic errors and temporal mismatch between rsd and gauge extremes also emerge from the use of different temporal resolutions to calculate the precipitation pertaining to the duration of interest marra and morin 2015 from the temporal sampling characterizing rsds villarini and krajewski 2010 or from temporal gaps in the data libertino et al 2016 4 future research directions based on the knowledge gaps summarized above we highlight future research directions that to our view promise immediate improvement in our ability to exploit the information provided by rsds a separation and quantification of the sources of uncertainty b development of statistical methods more suitable for rsds c improvement of validation methods in addition to these the d explicit use of the areal scale and the e derivation of climatological insights represent natural directions to fully take advantage of the characteristics of rsds 4 1 separation and quantification of the sources of uncertainty the impact of short record length quantitative estimation accuracy spatial temporal estimation scales and temporal sampling on the accuracy of frequency analyses derived from rsds is currently being assessed as a whole a proper separation and quantification of their relative contribution an example of which is reported in fig 1 is still lacking improved knowledge of this would allow research efforts to take the most relevant directions depending on the rsds of interest spatial temporal scales record length typical sources of estimation error and the objective design monitoring climatology 4 2 development of statistical methods more suitable for remotely sensed datasets automatic data driven regionalization methods hastie et al 2009 demirdjian et al 2018 would help improve rsd based analyses and provide additional knowledge on the climatology of extremes worldwide the gridded geometry of rsds potentially allows the formalization of local regionalization frameworks as drafted by goudenhoofdt et al 2017 that can increase the accuracy of high quantile estimates the interpretation of the obtained results would however require adequate understanding and discussion panziera et al 2016 the use of stochastic storm transposition wright et al 2013 wright et al 2014 wright et al 2017 also promises great potential for areas characterized by reasonable climatological homogeneity fig 4 approaches based on multiscaling theory for estimation of precipitation extremes should also be further explored with rsds langousis and veneziano 2007 van de vyver 2018 in particular the recently proposed metastatistical extreme value mev framework marani and ignaccolo 2015 is deemed highly beneficial for reducing the issues related to parameter estimation and climate sampling zorzetto et al 2016 zorzetto and marani 2019 as shown in fig 3 and for its robustness to the estimation errors typical of rsds marra et al 2018 the mev methodology based on ordinary events rather than on small samples from the tail of the distributions allows to easily implement innovative methodologies for exploiting spatial data e g bardossy and pegram 2018 accounting for extremes arising from multiple underlying processes marra et al 2019 and exploring the climatology of extremes exploiting knowledge on the ordinary events distributions these features promise important impacts on the overall quality of rsd derived quantiles on the potential of rsd for the analysis of extreme precipitation climatology and on the methodological possibilities for evaluating rsd based analyses 4 3 improvement of validation methods after a decade of research rsds are still based on methods developed and tuned for gauge data that is for the point scale gauge data are often assimilated into rsd based analyses either indirectly in the adjustment of rsds or directly in quantile quantile calibration of rsd extremes possible alternative approaches include the explicit rescaling of rsd derived quantiles to the point scale using arfs given the scale mismatch however these procedures may introduce new sources of error the uncertainty related to the comparison of areal and point scale extreme precipitation peleg et al 2018 fig 1 calls for the development of innovative ways to validate rsd based analyses possible solutions include the use of downscaling methods based on the correlation structure of the precipitation fields to reconstruct the point scale information booij 2002 foufoula georgiou et al 2014 zorzetto and marani 2019 or the use of dense gauge networks to provide improved information at the areal scale of interest 4 4 explicit use of the areal scale methods enabling simultaneous consideration of the areal and temporal dimensions of rsds orem and pelletier 2016 traxl et al 2016 gao et al 2017a would improve our understanding of the linkage between extreme precipitation and its effect on the hydrological units of interest with the potential to push forward our knowledge of the interactions and relationships between precipitation and flood frequency wright et al 2014 dis et al 2016 gao et al 2017b this requires the objective identification of the hydro meteorological spatial and temporal scales relevant for the hydrological response of the catchment of interest which are potentially function of the precipitation climatology of the area e g rinat et al 2018 inclusion of spatial temporal precipitation variability could add additional information at the price however of increased model complexity 4 5 derivation of climatological insights comparison of analyses derived from different rsds marra et al 2017 can help us isolate climatic signals from artifacts fig 2 effectively improving our knowledge of the spatial structure of extreme precipitation over previously ungauged regions both land and oceans demirdjian et al 2018 this information can be used to capture intergauge gradients and draw improved maps of high quantiles for complex climatology regions as well as to explore different covariates potentially influencing precipitation extremes such as topography urban areas and coast land interaction 5 closing statement this paper gave a focused overview of the recent research on precipitation frequency analyses based on remotely sensed precipitation datasets such datasets derive areal scale information with high spatiotemporal resolution at the regional or quasi global scale overcoming the spatial sampling limitations of rain gauges four main objectives are pursued using remotely sensed datasets derivation of high quantiles for design

methods overeem et al 2009 endreny and imbeah 2009 overeem et al 2010 eldardiry et al 2015 panziera et al 2016 gado et al 2017 or stochastic storm transposition wright et al 2013 wright et al 2017 can be beneficial in reducing the issues related to parameter estimation fig 4 but require hypotheses on the spatial homogeneity of extreme precipitation that are sometimes difficult to support for instance when the study involves ungauged areas or regions characterized by strong climatic gradients marra and morin 2015 viable ways to overcome this problem are to use data driven regionalization techniques paixao et al 2015 demirdjian et al 2018 or to exploit the gridded structure of rsds defining pixel centered regions goudenhoofdt et al 2017 the pot approach is used to improve the parameter estimation at the price of requiring an automatic threshold selection method fukutome et al 2015 solari et al 2017 it should however be noted that other studies have shown no appreciable improvement with respect to ams schl√∂gl and laaha 2017 marra et al 2018 in the case of rsd based analyses the problem of climatic nonstationarity is expected to be negligible due to the short time spanned by the rsds serinaldi and kilsby 2015 possible trends cannot be captured using such short records and the obtained quantiles are representative of the current conditions nonstationarities could however arise from the use of varying data elaboration procedures in the creation of the rsd over time potentially affecting the estimation of the extreme value distribution parameters willems 2000 3 3 lack of proper reference data and validation methods as no direct measurement of high quantiles is available validation relies upon extrapolation from data recognized as reliable rain gauges provide the natural data source and rsd derived quantiles are benchmarked against gauge derived quantiles obtained using standard extreme value methods see for example overeem et al 2009 eldardiry et al 2015 gado et al 2017 demirdjian et al 2018 mcgraw et al 2019 this approach disregards the scale mismatch between rsds and gauges by six to nine orders of magnitude which is expected to translate into differences between the corresponding quantiles tang et al 2018 additionally rsds generally provide temporal snapshots of the rainfall fields contrary to the traditional point measurements these describe the state at a given instant and do not provide temporal integrals villarini et al 2008 this may lead to different distributional properties which should be taken into account a proper quantification of these effects is difficult due to the dependence on spatial and temporal scales geographical region and quantile of interest when using short data records the random component of these mismatches is large enough that both over and underestimation are to be expected even under ideal measurement conditions for both rsds and gauges peleg et al 2018 fig 1 systematic errors and temporal mismatch between rsd and gauge extremes also emerge from the use of different temporal resolutions to calculate the precipitation pertaining to the duration of interest marra and morin 2015 from the temporal sampling characterizing rsds villarini and krajewski 2010 or from temporal gaps in the data libertino et al 2016 4 future research directions based on the knowledge gaps summarized above we highlight future research directions that to our view promise immediate improvement in our ability to exploit the information provided by rsds a separation and quantification of the sources of uncertainty b development of statistical methods more suitable for rsds c improvement of validation methods in addition to these the d explicit use of the areal scale and the e derivation of climatological insights represent natural directions to fully take advantage of the characteristics of rsds 4 1 separation and quantification of the sources of uncertainty the impact of short record length quantitative estimation accuracy spatial temporal estimation scales and temporal sampling on the accuracy of frequency analyses derived from rsds is currently being assessed as a whole a proper separation and quantification of their relative contribution an example of which is reported in fig 1 is still lacking improved knowledge of this would allow research efforts to take the most relevant directions depending on the rsds of interest spatial temporal scales record length typical sources of estimation error and the objective design monitoring climatology 4 2 development of statistical methods more suitable for remotely sensed datasets automatic data driven regionalization methods hastie et al 2009 demirdjian et al 2018 would help improve rsd based analyses and provide additional knowledge on the climatology of extremes worldwide the gridded geometry of rsds potentially allows the formalization of local regionalization frameworks as drafted by goudenhoofdt et al 2017 that can increase the accuracy of high quantile estimates the interpretation of the obtained results would however require adequate understanding and discussion panziera et al 2016 the use of stochastic storm transposition wright et al 2013 wright et al 2014 wright et al 2017 also promises great potential for areas characterized by reasonable climatological homogeneity fig 4 approaches based on multiscaling theory for estimation of precipitation extremes should also be further explored with rsds langousis and veneziano 2007 van de vyver 2018 in particular the recently proposed metastatistical extreme value mev framework marani and ignaccolo 2015 is deemed highly beneficial for reducing the issues related to parameter estimation and climate sampling zorzetto et al 2016 zorzetto and marani 2019 as shown in fig 3 and for its robustness to the estimation errors typical of rsds marra et al 2018 the mev methodology based on ordinary events rather than on small samples from the tail of the distributions allows to easily implement innovative methodologies for exploiting spatial data e g bardossy and pegram 2018 accounting for extremes arising from multiple underlying processes marra et al 2019 and exploring the climatology of extremes exploiting knowledge on the ordinary events distributions these features promise important impacts on the overall quality of rsd derived quantiles on the potential of rsd for the analysis of extreme precipitation climatology and on the methodological possibilities for evaluating rsd based analyses 4 3 improvement of validation methods after a decade of research rsds are still based on methods developed and tuned for gauge data that is for the point scale gauge data are often assimilated into rsd based analyses either indirectly in the adjustment of rsds or directly in quantile quantile calibration of rsd extremes possible alternative approaches include the explicit rescaling of rsd derived quantiles to the point scale using arfs given the scale mismatch however these procedures may introduce new sources of error the uncertainty related to the comparison of areal and point scale extreme precipitation peleg et al 2018 fig 1 calls for the development of innovative ways to validate rsd based analyses possible solutions include the use of downscaling methods based on the correlation structure of the precipitation fields to reconstruct the point scale information booij 2002 foufoula georgiou et al 2014 zorzetto and marani 2019 or the use of dense gauge networks to provide improved information at the areal scale of interest 4 4 explicit use of the areal scale methods enabling simultaneous consideration of the areal and temporal dimensions of rsds orem and pelletier 2016 traxl et al 2016 gao et al 2017a would improve our understanding of the linkage between extreme precipitation and its effect on the hydrological units of interest with the potential to push forward our knowledge of the interactions and relationships between precipitation and flood frequency wright et al 2014 dis et al 2016 gao et al 2017b this requires the objective identification of the hydro meteorological spatial and temporal scales relevant for the hydrological response of the catchment of interest which are potentially function of the precipitation climatology of the area e g rinat et al 2018 inclusion of spatial temporal precipitation variability could add additional information at the price however of increased model complexity 4 5 derivation of climatological insights comparison of analyses derived from different rsds marra et al 2017 can help us isolate climatic signals from artifacts fig 2 effectively improving our knowledge of the spatial structure of extreme precipitation over previously ungauged regions both land and oceans demirdjian et al 2018 this information can be used to capture intergauge gradients and draw improved maps of high quantiles for complex climatology regions as well as to explore different covariates potentially influencing precipitation extremes such as topography urban areas and coast land interaction 5 closing statement this paper gave a focused overview of the recent research on precipitation frequency analyses based on remotely sensed precipitation datasets such datasets derive areal scale information with high spatiotemporal resolution at the regional or quasi global scale overcoming the spatial sampling limitations of rain gauges four main objectives are pursued using remotely sensed datasets derivation of high quantiles for design applications monitoring and early warning of extreme precipitation temporal downscaling of extreme precipitation from gauge data and characterization of the climatology of extreme precipitation three main issues affect the quantitative accuracy of frequency analyses based on remotely sensed datasets quantitative inaccuracy of extreme precipitation estimates inadequacy of the adopted statistical methods caused by the availability of short data records and lack of proper reference data and validation methods future research efforts should aim to separate and quantify the sources of uncertainty

6461,knowledge of vegetative responses to drought across hydroclimatic zones is crucial for understanding ecohydrologic cycles based on monthly self calibrated palmer drought severity index pdsi standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei at different time scales 1 48 month scales and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi this study examined the relationship between natural vegetation dynamics and drought in the growing season during 1982 2012 at 293 sites over china pearson correlations between ndvi and drought indices pdsi and spei were employed to quantify the association between vegetation and drought the results show that the pearson correlations between pdsi and ndvi in growing season cnp ranged from 0 47 to 0 84 and the maximum correlation between spei and ndvi in growing season maxspei ranged from 0 31 to 0 86 within which the negative correlations were mainly observed in the areas dominated by forest in south china moreover the cnp was highly and nonlinearly related to the aridity index maxspei showed a similar trend the relationship between cnp and indicated that water stress was not the limiting factor for natural vegetation in humid regions 0 98 even during droughts the drought vulnerability of natural vegetation increased with increasing up to a point 4 68 and then decreased with increasing when 4 68 in extreme arid regions the natural vegetation exhibited less sensitivity to drought these tendencies could be seen worldwide the varied physiological properties of plants and the response of photosynthesis to energy processes probably explain some discernible variation keywords vegetation variations drought assessment hydroclimatic zones drought impacts water availability 1 introduction understanding the responses of vegetation dynamics to drought is critical for ecological restoration and assessing the likely environmental impacts of future climate change ji and peters 2003 mueller et al 2005 piao et al 2010 saleska et al 2007 yang et al 2016a with a gradually warming climate which might result in high risk of intense floods and droughts over certain areas briffa et al 2009 cai et al 2009 greve et al 2017 roderick et al 2015 yang et al 2019 the interaction between vegetation and climate is therefore important to consider based on field experiments and remote sensing techniques ciais et al 2005 ji and peters 2003 samanta et al 2010 yang et al 2014a zhang et al 2012 zhao and running 2010 negative impacts of drought on vegetation have frequently been reported kwon et al 2008 potter et al 2011 zhao and running 2010 for instance the 2003 drought caused a 30 reduction in gross primary productivity gpp 500 tg c year 1 across europe ciais et al 2005 the 2010 drought reduced gpp by 65 tg c year 1 in southwestern china zhang et al 2012 the 2005 amazon drought had a total biomass carbon impact of 1200 1600 tg phillips et al 2009 and the crop yield deficit over the u s central great plains after the extreme drought in the summer of 2012 represented an estimated by the end of july 2012 loss of 12 billion hoerling et al 2014 also positive correlations between vegetation indices e g the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi net primary production npp and tree ring and drought indices e g the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 standard precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 were frequently reported ji and peters 2003 vicente serrano et al 2013 xu et al 2012 however the response of vegetation dynamics to drought is a complex process influenced by many ecophysiological and environmental factors ciais et al 2005 vicente serrano et al 2013 different species differ in water uptake ability and water deficit adaptation strategies which determine the levels of resistance and resilience of vegetation to drought chaves et al 2003 liu et al 2011 for example deep rooting plants are generally less vulnerable to water deficit hanson and weltzin 2000 during a drought the air temperature and radiation due to less cloudy and rainy days may also increase promoting canopy photosynthesis for some plants peng et al 2011 piao et al 2014 suni et al 2003 because of the differences in water uptake ability and the likely increased temperature and radiation levels the rate of canopy photosynthesis during a drought may decline or maintain the same or higher levels than during a wet season restrepo coupe et al 2013 for example the mediterranean evergreen forests especially the high mountain pinus uncinata forests did not show an overall ndvi loss in the 2003 drought lloret et al 2007 and in the amazon basin the percentage of the intact forests that showed greening 11 and browning or no change 23 during the 2005 severe drought were similar to those in the non drought year 2003 and 2004 samanta et al 2010 these findings indicate that the response of vegetation dynamics to drought may differ considerably in magnitude as a result of differences in vegetation type drought intensity drought duration and hydrogeological conditions liu et al 2011 lloret et al 2007 yang et al 2016a zhang et al 2012 furthermore the common definition of a drought whether meteorological agricultural or hydrological is a dry spell relative to local normal conditions dai 2011b applying this definition droughts of the same severity e g a self calibrated pdsi value of 4 0 in different hydroclimatic zones may not result in the same severity of water shortage or soil moisture content especially in humid regions where precipitation is generally abundant a drought may not always result in soil moisture levels that are low enough to affect vegetation growth thus the local hydroclimatic conditions e g aridity and annual precipitation would be key factors affecting the vegetative response to drought vicente serrano et al 2013 the main objectives of this study were to 1 examine the responses of natural vegetation to drought during the growing season and 2 investigate the effects of local climate on these responses we found that drought not always exert negative impacts on vegetation most importantly the local climatology aridity have notable impacts on the response of vegetation to drought 2 data and methodology 2 1 data sources daily meteorological data including precipitation temperature relative humidity wind speed air pressure sunshine duration from 839 stations were collected from the china meteorological data service network 1961 2013 vegetation greening was reflected by using the ndvi from the gimms ndvi3g data set 1982 2012 anyamba et al 2014 pinzon and tucker 2014 which has been shown to be the best product for tracking temporal vegetative change beck et al 2011 piao et al 2014 zhu et al 2013 the esacci land cover dataset at a resolution of 300 m 1992 2015 was used to classify the land cover the ceres ebaf surface fluxes dataset edition 2 8 1 1 grid 2000 2014 was employed to calibrate the surface albedo in calculating potential evaporation the available soil water content awc from igbp dis was collected for self calibrated sc pdsi calculations global soil data task group 2000 the spei at 1 48 month time scales across the globe was calculated based on the cru ts 3 25 climate dataset 0 5 0 5 and the global pdsi was obtained from the cru self calibrated pdsi dataset 1901 2016 0 5 0 5 osborn et al 2017 van der schrier et al 2013 these datasets are summarized in table 1 2 2 study region the daily meteorological data were initially collected at 839 stations across china however because of high population density levels most of the land represented had been reclaimed as agricultural land which is highly affected by human activity e g irrigation and cultivation in order to eliminate the anthropogenic impact a subset of 293 meteorological stations was finally selected fig 1 based on the esacci land cover data set stations were chosen that had a circular area 1962 5 km2 diameter 50 km that was dominated by natural vegetation or low human impacting vegetation such as forest and grassland the percentage of agricultural land in the circular area surrounding each station was less than 20 of these stations 36 2 and 39 6 were dominated by forest and grass respectively and 24 2 were dominated by other vegetation e g shrub land and sparse vegetation fig 1 at these selected stations the mean annual precipitation p ranged from 29 9 mm year 1 turpan in northwestern china to 2183 mm year 1 jiangcheng in southwestern china fig 1 and the aridity index ranged from 0 4 humid to 53 7 extreme arid 2 3 drought indices and data preparation the self calibrated pdsi denoted as pdsi palmer 1965 wells et al 2004 and the spei vicente serrano et al 2010 were used to measure drought parameters banimahd and khalili 2013 dai 2011a liu et al 2017b sheffield et al 2012 wang et al 2015 the pdsi is one of the most widely used drought indices and has demonstrated efficiency in drought detecting and quantification over the globe however the pdsi has a main shortcoming of fixed temporal scale between 9 and 12 months and can t account for the multiscalar nature of drought vicente serrano et al 2010 owing to the differences in vegetation types hydrogeology and climate the response of vegetation behaviors to drought may depend on the drought time scale vicente serrano et al 2013 therefore the multiscalar drought index spei which is sensitive to global warming e g increasing temperature was employed to investigate the response of vegetation to droughts at different time scales here the monthly pdsi at each station was calculated using the procedure designed by jacobi et al 2013 based on awc monthly precipitation and potential evaporation the spei was calculated at varying time scales 1 48 months based on monthly precipitation and potential evaporation according to vicente serrano et al 2010 thus a total of 49 time series of drought indices comprising 1 series of pdsi and 48 series of spei was obtained from each station in particular the potential evaporation here was calculated based on the widely used open water penman method pm ow penman 1948 for which the solar radiation was estimated using the angstrom equation allen et al 1998 and the surface albedo was calibrated using the ceres ebaf surface fluxes data set liu et al 2017a 2016 please note that the pm ow used here have not considered the effect of co2 enrichment in the atmosphere and would overestimate the evaporative demand yang et al 2019 in the interested period 1980s 2010s the co2 concentration increased from 340 ppm to 390 ppm mauna loa monastersky 2013 applying the results in yang et al 2019 the surface resistance rs might increase 2 5 s m 1 in this period the mean value of rs increased from 55 s m 1 when co2 concentration is 300 ppm in the 1861 1960 to 80 s m 1 when co2 concentration is 807 ppm in the 2071 2100 in the pm ow the aerodynamics resistance is calculated as shuttleworth 1993 1 r a 4 72 l n z m z 0 2 1 0 536 u 2 where r a is the aerodynamics resistance z m and z 0 are the height at which meteorological variables are measured and the aerodynamic roughness of the surface and were set to be 2 0 m and 0 00137 m respectively and u 2 is the wind speed measured at 2 0 m data show that the mean monthly wind speed over china ranges from 0 6 m s 1 to 8 1 m s 1 1982 2012 according to eq 1 the r a is 40 s m 1 when u 2 is 10 m s 1 and 195 s m 1 when u 2 is 0 5 m s 1 therefore the change in surface resistance 2 5 s m 1 resulting from increased co2 concentration could lead to a very small change in the potential evaporation during the interested period the growing season gs was defined as the period with greenness level 50 of the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of ndvi piao et al 2014 at each station the vegetation was represented using the arithmetically averaged ndvi gimms ndvi3g from the 50 km circular area 1962 5 km2 surrounding the station the mean ndvi of the gs denoted as ndvigs mean self calibrated pdsi of the gs denoted as pdsigs and mean spei of the gs denoted as speigs were calculated by arithmetically averaging the monthly data from the gs months 1982 2012 2 4 methods trends in the ndvigs pdsigs and speigs were first examined using the modified prewhitening mann kendall trend test mk tfpw kendall 1975 mann 1945 yue and wang 2002 the magnitudes of the trends were estimated as follows burn and elnur 2002 yang et al 2014b 2 Œ∏ m e d i a n x j x i j i 1 i j k where Œ∏ is the magnitude of the trend x i and x j are the ith and jth observations respectively and k is the length of the series a pearson correlation was conducted among the ndvigs and pdsigs and the 48 series of speigs and a threshold of Œ± 0 05 was considered significant the correlation was used to measure the association between drought and vegetation activities piao et al 2014 vicente serrano et al 2013 similar to vicente serrano et al 2013 the time scale of spei at which the maximum correlation between speigs and ndvigs was found was considered to be the vegetation sensitive drought scale the relationships between the correlations aridity index and the simple annual water balance precipitation minus potential evaporation p p e t vicente serrano et al 2013 were investigated using linear or nonlinear regression methods finally for validating the results globally the same procedures were conducted at a global scale using the cru ts 3 25 climate data gimms ndvi3g and scpdsi based global data sets 3 results 3 1 interannual variability of ndvigs and droughts and their relationship the ndvigs generally exhibited upward trends at most of the stations 77 1 fig 2 a of which 29 7 were significant Œ± 0 05 decreasing ndvigs of which 39 8 were significant Œ± 0 05 were sparsely distributed across the tibetan plateau and the western part of northeastern china the mean trend of ndvigs across all stations was 6 1 10 4 year 1 unlike the ndvigs the scpdsigs mainly decreased across the major part of eastern china and increased in northwestern china and the southeastern littoral fig 2b across the stations 51 5 had increasing pdsigs of which 17 8 were significant Œ± 0 05 and 48 5 had decreasing pdsigs of which 21 0 were significant Œ± 0 05 fig 2b the trends in speigs were similar to those of pdsigs data not presented the pearson correlation between ndvigs and pdsigs cnp ranged from 0 47 to 0 84 with a mean of 0 17 of which 32 1 were significant fig 2c negative cnp values 30 3 were generally seen in eastern china especially in southeastern china most of the negative cnp values were significant Œ± 0 05 fig 2c in contrast positive cnp values were mainly distributed in northern and western china fig 2c especially in northern and northwestern china most positive cnp values were significant Œ± 0 05 fig 2c similarly the maximum correlation between ndvigs and speigs maxspei at varying time scales ranged from 0 31 to 0 86 with a mean of 0 32 of which 45 1 were significant fig 2d in particular 9 2 of the 293 stations had negative maxspei values the distribution of maxspei was similar to that of cnp except for some stations in eastern tibet and central china fig 2c and d the maxspei time scales were generally longer in eastern china 25 months and shorter in northern and northwestern china 10 months fig 2e on the other hand the correlation has close relationship to the vegetation types fig 3 shows clearly that the negative correlations cnp and maxspei were generally observed at the stations dominated by forest the grass and sparse vegetation dominated sites were generally characterized by positive cnp and maxspei fig 3 overall the mean cnp and maxspei for the three main vegetation types which are forest grass and sparse vegetation were 0 07 0 20 0 34 0 23 0 61 0 19 cnp and 0 12 0 15 0 48 0 20 0 67 0 15 respectively fig 3 fig 4 shows two examples of ndvigs and pdsigs at the tahe negative cnp and maxspei located in northeastern china dominated by forest and tuoli positive cnp and maxspei located in northwestern china dominated by grassland stations the ndvigs at tahe station fluctuated slightly regardless of whether or not droughts occurred fig 4a notably in 1987 when a severe drought occurred the ndvigs values were in fact slightly higher than those in 1986 and 1988 fig 4a at the tuoli station the ndvigs fluctuated closely with the pdsigs fig 4d 3 2 relationship between climatology and the responses of vegetation dynamics to drought with increasing aridity index the cnp increased from negative to positive up to a maximum value and then declined gradually and tended to be stable when 25 fig 5 a the maxspei showed the similar tendencies fig 5a the relationship between cnp and the aridity index could be explained by the curve c n p 0 39 0 44 e 0 21 0 85 r 2 0 61 this curve intersects the line c n p 0 the green dashed line in fig 5a at 0 98 the red dot and reaches its highest point at 4 68 the pink dot in fig 5a meanwhile the cnp and maxspei was also negatively correlated with p p e t with an r 2 of 0 43 Œ± 0 05 the regression line c n p 3 10 4 p p e t 0 08 intersected the c n p 0 at p p e t 267 7 mm year 1 fig 5b 3 3 the responses of vegetation dynamics to drought over the globe at a global scale the cnp ranged from 0 67 to 0 79 with a mean of 0 03 of which 22 7 were significantly positive values fig 6 a negative cnp values 44 59 were generally observed in humid regions especially in the amazon river basin fig 6a where they were usually significant Œ± 0 05 positive cnp values were mainly distributed in semiarid and arid regions the maxspei ranged from 0 52 to 0 77 with a mean of 0 11 of which 12 58 were negative and 46 9 were significantly positive fig 6b the spatial distribution of maxspei was similar to that of cnp fig 6a and b similar to the results in fig 5a the cnp and maxspei worldwide values increased from negative to positive up to a maximum and then declined gradually and tended to be stable when increased to about 75 fig 7 at a global scale the relationship between cnp and could be explained by the curve c n p 0 030 0 96 e 0 046 1 03 r 2 0 37 and the relationship between cnp and p p e t could be explained by c n p 4 7 10 5 p p e t 0 026 r 2 0 27 fig 7 4 discussion over the past few decades pdsigs mean pdsi in growing season values have decreased across a major part of eastern china and largely increased in northwestern and southeastern china fig 2b indicating that eastern china northwestern china was generally drying wetting in gs growing season in the period of 1982 2012 this is in agreement with the results in previous studies long et al 2014 wang et al 2011 zhai et al 2010 zou et al 2005 which reported the similar drying wetting tendencies over china for example based on soil moisture wang et al 2011 concluded that drying occurred over the northeast to north central china and wetting over most of the west including xinjiang northwestern china tibetan plateau and small part over yunnan however unlike the drier wetter tendencies vegetation during the gs reflected by the ndvigs mean ndvi in growing season has increased overall greening across china fig 2a fang et al 2004 peng et al 2011 piao et al 2003 although devegetation has occurred occasionally fig 2a the differences in the temporal and spatial variations in pdsigs and speigs mean spei in growing season and ndvigs demonstrate the complex relationships between vegetation and drought the results show that both the cnp pearson correlation between ndvigs and pdsigs and maxspei maximum correlation between ndvigs and speigs ranged from negative to positive fig 2c and d in general positive cnp and maxspei values arose in non humid regions fig 2c indicating that vegetation growth was sensitive to drought in these regions and vice versa the positive correlations are in good agreement with the results in previous findings gu et al 2007 vicente serrano et al 2013 and our general opinion is that drought has had a severe impact on natural and social systems from the past to present allen and breshears 1998 dai 2011b zhao and running 2010 however the negative cnp and maxspei values fig 2c and d are in contrast with previous studies ji and peters 2003 vicente serrano et al 2013 there could be several reasons for this phenomenon first differences in vegetation types could have an effect because of their different drought adaptation strategies breda et al 2006 deep rooting mature trees may be less susceptible to water limitation caused by severe or prolonged drought compared with plants with a shallow rooting depth hanson and weltzin 2000 yang et al 2016b negative correlations were generally found at stations dominated by forests fig 3 second a drought occurring during the gs not only results in relatively limited water availability but also in relatively high temperature and even solar radiation levels due to less cloudy and rainy days adler et al 2008 koster et al 2009 which are highly related to vegetative growth photosynthesis peng et al 2011 piao et al 2014 suni et al 2003 the negative correlations figs 2d and 4 indicated that the forests in humid china can extract sufficient water through their deep roots yang et al 2016b even when drought occurs and the relatively higher temperature and solar radiation e g due to less cloudy and rainy days promotes their canopy photosynthesis it should also be noted that the drought indices used in this study are defined as the relative water deficit compared with normal levels therefore a low value e g negative spei and pdsi does not always means that the soil moisture content is particularly low especially in humid regions for example in a region with a long term mean annual precipitation of 2000 mm year 1 a year with 1500 mm year 1 precipitation can be defined as a dry year however this 1500 mm year 1 of precipitation may provide enough water for evapotranspiration xu et al 2013 therefore a hydroclimate related threshold may exist above or below which the responses of vegetation to drought would be positive or negative as pointed out by guan et al 2015 the definition of drought and drought indices presumes that the response of natural vegetation to drought is related to the local hydroclimatic conditions the results show that the cnp and maxspei were highly related to the simple water balance p p e t vicente serrano et al 2013 and in particular the aridity index fig 5 the curve c n p 0 39 0 44 e 0 21 0 85 r 2 0 61 indicated that the cnp was generally positive negative when 0 98 0 98 fig 5a therefore 0 98 can be considered the threshold for determining whether droughts have positive or negative impacts on natural vegetation the value of 0 98 is very similar to that 1 0 determined by zhou et al 2015 who concluded that land cover changes might lead to greater hydrological responses in water limited regions with values of 1 0 this indicates that in humid regions 0 98 solar radiation and not water stress is the limiting factor for vegetative growth and vice versa also the complex relationships between ndvi and drought indices in this study indirectly demonstrated the results in karnieli et al 2010 which concluded that the correlation between land surface temperature and ndvi was negative positive when water energy was the limiting factor for vegetation growth however negative impacts of drought on vegetation do not always increase with increasing when 0 98 fig 5a yang et al 2015 when 4 68 the positive cnp and maxspei decreased gradually with increasing indicating that vegetative activity was less sensitive to drought in extreme arid regions similarly results in yang et al 2016a implied that biological controlled ecosystems i e semi arid sub humid ecosystems might be more vulnerable to drought than physical i e evaporation controlled ecosystems i e arid ecosystems possible explanations for this are that 1 the natural vegetation in these extreme arid regions such as euphrates poplar sacsaoul and alhagi sparsifolia shap are exposed to severe water stress all year round and have a strong ability to extract and reserve water and hence possesses a generally greater tolerance to drought yang et al 2016a and 2 precipitation is not the main water source for the vegetation e g underground water or snowmelt from mountain glaciers may provide more available water most importantly this phenomenon can be seen across the globe figs 6 and 7 small differences do exist but mainly as a result of differences in analytical method for the global scale analysis the vegetation had not been classified and the pixels that were dominated by agriculture were not deleted recently researchers try to employ the remotely sensed vegetation information to describe drought evolution and characteristics across the globe aghakouchak et al 2015 mu et al 2013 however our results showed that the responses of vegetation to drought differed in different hydroclimatic zones hence detecting drought using remote sensed vegetation based indices should take varied thresholds and standards in different hydroclimatic zones rather than a constant relationship for all regions otherwise it may potentially introduce more systematic errors and increase the uncertainties of drought assessment it should be noted that there are some uncertainties limitations within this study first the results are based on correlations between mean ndvi and drought indices pdsi and spei in the gs the correlation method can provide statistical results but can t take detailed information into consideration the averaged indices ndvi pdsi and spei also missed details of changes in vegetation and drought severity during a drought although there is no doubt that an extreme drought would have negative impacts on vegetation even in a very humid region e g 0 2 with negative cnp and maxspei second extreme drought is uncommon during the gs in china because there is a hot rainy season although some summer droughts do occur third the drought indices pdsi and spei and the vegetation indices ndvi have their own limitations liu et al 2017a zhang et al 2015 for example the ndvi would be saturated in area with dense vegetation e g the forest in southeastern china however we found similar results based on the modis evi enhanced vegetation index https modis gsfc nasa gov data dataprod mod13 php data not showed here forth this study has not taken the effects of enrichment of atmospheric co2 in consideration the increasing concentration of atmospheric co2 would increase the canopy resistance and exerts impacts on water use efficiency de kauwe et al 2013 roderick et al 2015 yang et al 2019 these would result in uncertainties to the results though the changes in atmospheric co2 in the interested period was relatively small nevertheless although these limitations in methodology and drought indices should highlight any uncertainties this study has demonstrated that drought will not always have a negative effect on vegetation and has revealed that the local hydroclimate is a key factor influencing the response to drought furthermore there may be a local hydroclimate related threshold precipitation amount or drought severity that determines the vegetative response to drought which warrants further study 5 conclusion this study assessed the covariation between drought and vegetation during the growing season gs across china based on monthly pdsi spei at multiple time scales and ndvi gimms ndvi3g values from 293 stations that were dominated by natural vegetation the response of the vegetation to drought was measured using pearson correlations between ndvi and the drought indices the results show that eastern northwestern china was generally becoming drier wetter while the ndvi had increased overall during the past few decades the cnp correlation between ndvi and pdsi in growing season ranged from 0 47 to 0 84 and the maxspei maximum correlation between ndvi and spei in growing season ranged from 0 31 to 0 86 positive negative cnp and maxspei were distributed mainly in non humid humid regions the relationship between cnp similarly the maxspei and aridity index could be explained by the equation c n p 0 39 0 44 e 0 21 0 85 r 2 0 61 this equation suggests that the correlations are positive negative when 0 98 0 98 and increase from negative to positive when 4 68 and then decrease gradually when 4 68 this indicates that in humid regions 0 98 water stress may not be the limiting factor for natural vegetation and in semiarid and arid regions 4 68 the sensitivity of vegetation to drought increases with increasing while in extreme arid regions 4 68 the vegetation exhibits less vulnerability to drought when increases moreover this phenomenon can be seen at a global scale possible explanations for this include the varied physiological structure of different vegetation types and the positive responses of photosynthesis to energy in droughts the results illustrate the linkage between local hydroclimatic conditions and the response of vegetation to drought which is helpful for quantifying the interaction between vegetation and climate

6461,knowledge of vegetative responses to drought across hydroclimatic zones is crucial for understanding ecohydrologic cycles based on monthly self calibrated palmer drought severity index pdsi standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei at different time scales 1 48 month scales and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi this study examined the relationship between natural vegetation dynamics and drought in the growing season during 1982 2012 at 293 sites over china pearson correlations between ndvi and drought indices pdsi and spei were employed to quantify the association between vegetation and drought the results show that the pearson correlations between pdsi and ndvi in growing season cnp ranged from 0 47 to 0 84 and the maximum correlation between spei and ndvi in growing season maxspei ranged from 0 31 to 0 86 within which the negative correlations were mainly observed in the areas dominated by forest in south china moreover the cnp was highly and nonlinearly related to the aridity index maxspei showed a similar trend the relationship between cnp and indicated that water stress was not the limiting factor for natural vegetation in humid regions 0 98 even during droughts the drought vulnerability of natural vegetation increased with increasing up to a point 4 68 and then decreased with increasing when 4 68 in extreme arid regions the natural vegetation exhibited less sensitivity to drought these tendencies could be seen worldwide the varied physiological properties of plants and the response of photosynthesis to energy processes probably explain some discernible variation keywords vegetation variations drought assessment hydroclimatic zones drought impacts water availability 1 introduction understanding the responses of vegetation dynamics to drought is critical for ecological restoration and assessing the likely environmental impacts of future climate change ji and peters 2003 mueller et al 2005 piao et al 2010 saleska et al 2007 yang et al 2016a with a gradually warming climate which might result in high risk of intense floods and droughts over certain areas briffa et al 2009 cai et al 2009 greve et al 2017 roderick et al 2015 yang et al 2019 the interaction between vegetation and climate is therefore important to consider based on field experiments and remote sensing techniques ciais et al 2005 ji and peters 2003 samanta et al 2010 yang et al 2014a zhang et al 2012 zhao and running 2010 negative impacts of drought on vegetation have frequently been reported kwon et al 2008 potter et al 2011 zhao and running 2010 for instance the 2003 drought caused a 30 reduction in gross primary productivity gpp 500 tg c year 1 across europe ciais et al 2005 the 2010 drought reduced gpp by 65 tg c year 1 in southwestern china zhang et al 2012 the 2005 amazon drought had a total biomass carbon impact of 1200 1600 tg phillips et al 2009 and the crop yield deficit over the u s central great plains after the extreme drought in the summer of 2012 represented an estimated by the end of july 2012 loss of 12 billion hoerling et al 2014 also positive correlations between vegetation indices e g the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi net primary production npp and tree ring and drought indices e g the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 standard precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 were frequently reported ji and peters 2003 vicente serrano et al 2013 xu et al 2012 however the response of vegetation dynamics to drought is a complex process influenced by many ecophysiological and environmental factors ciais et al 2005 vicente serrano et al 2013 different species differ in water uptake ability and water deficit adaptation strategies which determine the levels of resistance and resilience of vegetation to drought chaves et al 2003 liu et al 2011 for example deep rooting plants are generally less vulnerable to water deficit hanson and weltzin 2000 during a drought the air temperature and radiation due to less cloudy and rainy days may also increase promoting canopy photosynthesis for some plants peng et al 2011 piao et al 2014 suni et al 2003 because of the differences in water uptake ability and the likely increased temperature and radiation levels the rate of canopy photosynthesis during a drought may decline or maintain the same or higher levels than during a wet season restrepo coupe et al 2013 for example the mediterranean evergreen forests especially the high mountain pinus uncinata forests did not show an overall ndvi loss in the 2003 drought lloret et al 2007 and in the amazon basin the percentage of the intact forests that showed greening 11 and browning or no change 23 during the 2005 severe drought were similar to those in the non drought year 2003 and 2004 samanta et al 2010 these findings indicate that the response of vegetation dynamics to drought may differ considerably in magnitude as a result of differences in vegetation type drought intensity drought duration and hydrogeological conditions liu et al 2011 lloret et al 2007 yang et al 2016a zhang et al 2012 furthermore the common definition of a drought whether meteorological agricultural or hydrological is a dry spell relative to local normal conditions dai 2011b applying this definition droughts of the same severity e g a self calibrated pdsi value of 4 0 in different hydroclimatic zones may not result in the same severity of water shortage or soil moisture content especially in humid regions where precipitation is generally abundant a drought may not always result in soil moisture levels that are low enough to affect vegetation growth thus the local hydroclimatic conditions e g aridity and annual precipitation would be key factors affecting the vegetative response to drought vicente serrano et al 2013 the main objectives of this study were to 1 examine the responses of natural vegetation to drought during the growing season and 2 investigate the effects of local climate on these responses we found that drought not always exert negative impacts on vegetation most importantly the local climatology aridity have notable impacts on the response of vegetation to drought 2 data and methodology 2 1 data sources daily meteorological data including precipitation temperature relative humidity wind speed air pressure sunshine duration from 839 stations were collected from the china meteorological data service network 1961 2013 vegetation greening was reflected by using the ndvi from the gimms ndvi3g data set 1982 2012 anyamba et al 2014 pinzon and tucker 2014 which has been shown to be the best product for tracking temporal vegetative change beck et al 2011 piao et al 2014 zhu et al 2013 the esacci land cover dataset at a resolution of 300 m 1992 2015 was used to classify the land cover the ceres ebaf surface fluxes dataset edition 2 8 1 1 grid 2000 2014 was employed to calibrate the surface albedo in calculating potential evaporation the available soil water content awc from igbp dis was collected for self calibrated sc pdsi calculations global soil data task group 2000 the spei at 1 48 month time scales across the globe was calculated based on the cru ts 3 25 climate dataset 0 5 0 5 and the global pdsi was obtained from the cru self calibrated pdsi dataset 1901 2016 0 5 0 5 osborn et al 2017 van der schrier et al 2013 these datasets are summarized in table 1 2 2 study region the daily meteorological data were initially collected at 839 stations across china however because of high population density levels most of the land represented had been reclaimed as agricultural land which is highly affected by human activity e g irrigation and cultivation in order to eliminate the anthropogenic impact a subset of 293 meteorological stations was finally selected fig 1 based on the esacci land cover data set stations were chosen that had a circular area 1962 5 km2 diameter 50 km that was dominated by natural vegetation or low human impacting vegetation such as forest and grassland the percentage of agricultural land in the circular area surrounding each station was less than 20 of these stations 36 2 and 39 6 were dominated by forest and grass respectively and 24 2 were dominated by other vegetation e g shrub land and sparse vegetation fig 1 at these selected stations the mean annual precipitation p ranged from 29 9 mm year 1 turpan in northwestern china to 2183 mm year 1 jiangcheng in southwestern china fig 1 and the aridity index ranged from 0 4 humid to 53 7 extreme arid 2 3 drought indices and data preparation the self calibrated pdsi denoted as pdsi palmer 1965 wells et al 2004 and the spei vicente serrano et al 2010 were used to measure drought parameters banimahd and khalili 2013 dai 2011a liu et al 2017b sheffield et al 2012 wang et al 2015 the pdsi is one of the most widely used drought indices and has demonstrated efficiency in drought detecting and quantification over the globe however the pdsi has a main shortcoming of fixed temporal scale between 9 and 12 months and can t account for the multiscalar nature of drought vicente serrano et al 2010 owing to the differences in vegetation types hydrogeology and climate the response of vegetation behaviors to drought may depend on the drought time scale vicente serrano et al 2013 therefore the multiscalar drought index spei which is sensitive to global warming e g increasing temperature was employed to investigate the response of vegetation to droughts at different time scales here the monthly pdsi at each station was calculated using the procedure designed by jacobi et al 2013 based on awc monthly precipitation and potential evaporation the spei was calculated at varying time scales 1 48 months based on monthly precipitation and potential evaporation according to vicente serrano et al 2010 thus a total of 49 time series of drought indices comprising 1 series of pdsi and 48 series of spei was obtained from each station in particular the potential evaporation here was calculated based on the widely used open water penman method pm ow penman 1948 for which the solar radiation was estimated using the angstrom equation allen et al 1998 and the surface albedo was calibrated using the ceres ebaf surface fluxes data set liu et al 2017a 2016 please note that the pm ow used here have not considered the effect of co2 enrichment in the atmosphere and would overestimate the evaporative demand yang et al 2019 in the interested period 1980s 2010s the co2 concentration increased from 340 ppm to 390 ppm mauna loa monastersky 2013 applying the results in yang et al 2019 the surface resistance rs might increase 2 5 s m 1 in this period the mean value of rs increased from 55 s m 1 when co2 concentration is 300 ppm in the 1861 1960 to 80 s m 1 when co2 concentration is 807 ppm in the 2071 2100 in the pm ow the aerodynamics resistance is calculated as shuttleworth 1993 1 r a 4 72 l n z m z 0 2 1 0 536 u 2 where r a is the aerodynamics resistance z m and z 0 are the height at which meteorological variables are measured and the aerodynamic roughness of the surface and were set to be 2 0 m and 0 00137 m respectively and u 2 is the wind speed measured at 2 0 m data show that the mean monthly wind speed over china ranges from 0 6 m s 1 to 8 1 m s 1 1982 2012 according to eq 1 the r a is 40 s m 1 when u 2 is 10 m s 1 and 195 s m 1 when u 2 is 0 5 m s 1 therefore the change in surface resistance 2 5 s m 1 resulting from increased co2 concentration could lead to a very small change in the potential evaporation during the interested period the growing season gs was defined as the period with greenness level 50 of the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of ndvi piao et al 2014 at each station the vegetation was represented using the arithmetically averaged ndvi gimms ndvi3g from the 50 km circular area 1962 5 km2 surrounding the station the mean ndvi of the gs denoted as ndvigs mean self calibrated pdsi of the gs denoted as pdsigs and mean spei of the gs denoted as speigs were calculated by arithmetically averaging the monthly data from the gs months 1982 2012 2 4 methods trends in the ndvigs pdsigs and speigs were first examined using the modified prewhitening mann kendall trend test mk tfpw kendall 1975 mann 1945 yue and wang 2002 the magnitudes of the trends were estimated as follows burn and elnur 2002 yang et al 2014b 2 Œ∏ m e d i a n x j x i j i 1 i j k where Œ∏ is the magnitude of the trend x i and x j are the ith and jth observations respectively and k is the length of the series a pearson correlation was conducted among the ndvigs and pdsigs and the 48 series of speigs and a threshold of Œ± 0 05 was considered significant the correlation was used to measure the association between drought and vegetation activities piao et al 2014 vicente serrano et al 2013 similar to vicente serrano et al 2013 the time scale of spei at which the maximum correlation between speigs and ndvigs was found was considered to be the vegetation sensitive drought scale the relationships between the correlations aridity index and the simple annual water balance precipitation minus potential evaporation p p e t vicente serrano et al 2013 were investigated using linear or nonlinear regression methods finally for validating the results globally the same procedures were conducted at a global scale using the cru ts 3 25 climate data gimms ndvi3g and scpdsi based global data sets 3 results 3 1 interannual variability of ndvigs and droughts and their relationship the ndvigs generally exhibited upward trends at most of the stations 77 1 fig 2 a of which 29 7 were significant Œ± 0 05 decreasing ndvigs of which 39 8 were significant Œ± 0 05 were sparsely distributed across the tibetan plateau and the western part of northeastern china the mean trend of ndvigs across all stations was 6 1 10 4 year 1 unlike the ndvigs the scpdsigs mainly decreased across the major part of eastern china and increased in northwestern china and the southeastern littoral fig 2b across the stations 51 5 had increasing pdsigs of which 17 8 were significant Œ± 0 05 and 48 5 had decreasing pdsigs of which 21 0 were significant Œ± 0 05 fig 2b the trends in speigs were similar to those of pdsigs data not presented the pearson correlation between ndvigs and pdsigs cnp ranged from 0 47 to 0 84 with a mean of 0 17 of which 32 1 were significant fig 2c negative cnp values 30 3 were generally seen in eastern china especially in southeastern china most of the negative cnp values were significant Œ± 0 05 fig 2c in contrast positive cnp values were mainly distributed in northern and western china fig 2c especially in northern and northwestern china most positive cnp values were significant Œ± 0 05 fig 2c similarly the maximum correlation between ndvigs and speigs maxspei at varying time scales ranged from 0 31 to 0 86 with a mean of 0 32 of which 45 1 were significant fig 2d in particular 9 2 of the 293 stations had negative maxspei values the distribution of maxspei was similar to that of cnp except for some stations in eastern tibet and central china fig 2c and d the maxspei time scales were generally longer in eastern china 25 months and shorter in northern and northwestern china 10 months fig 2e on the other hand the correlation has close relationship to the vegetation types fig 3 shows clearly that the negative correlations cnp and maxspei were generally observed at the stations dominated by forest the grass and sparse vegetation dominated sites were generally characterized by positive cnp and maxspei fig 3 overall the mean cnp and maxspei for the three main vegetation types which are forest grass and sparse vegetation were 0 07 0 20 0 34 0 23 0 61 0 19 cnp and 0 12 0 15 0 48 0 20 0 67 0 15 respectively fig 3 fig 4 shows two examples of ndvigs and pdsigs at the tahe negative cnp and maxspei located in northeastern china dominated by forest and tuoli positive cnp and maxspei located in northwestern china dominated by grassland stations the ndvigs at tahe station fluctuated slightly regardless of whether or not droughts occurred fig 4a notably in 1987 when a severe drought occurred the ndvigs values were in fact slightly higher than those in 1986 and 1988 fig 4a at the tuoli station the ndvigs fluctuated closely with the pdsigs fig 4d 3 2 relationship between climatology and the responses of vegetation dynamics to drought with increasing aridity index the cnp increased from negative to positive up to a maximum value and then declined gradually and tended to be stable when 25 fig 5 a the maxspei showed the similar tendencies fig 5a the relationship between cnp and the aridity index could be explained by the curve c n p 0 39 0 44 e 0 21 0 85 r 2 0 61 this curve intersects the line c n p 0 the green dashed line in fig 5a at 0 98 the red dot and reaches its highest point at 4 68 the pink dot in fig 5a meanwhile the cnp and maxspei was also negatively correlated with p p e t with an r 2 of 0 43 Œ± 0 05 the regression line c n p 3 10 4 p p e t 0 08 intersected the c n p 0 at p p e t 267 7 mm year 1 fig 5b 3 3 the responses of vegetation dynamics to drought over the globe at a global scale the cnp ranged from 0 67 to 0 79 with a mean of 0 03 of which 22 7 were significantly positive values fig 6 a negative cnp values 44 59 were generally observed in humid regions especially in the amazon river basin fig 6a where they were usually significant Œ± 0 05 positive cnp values were mainly distributed in semiarid and arid regions the maxspei ranged from 0 52 to 0 77 with a mean of 0 11 of which 12 58 were negative and 46 9 were significantly positive fig 6b the spatial distribution of maxspei was similar to that of cnp fig 6a and b similar to the results in fig 5a the cnp and maxspei worldwide values increased from negative to positive up to a maximum and then declined gradually and tended to be stable when increased to about 75 fig 7 at a global scale the relationship between cnp and could be explained by the curve c n p 0 030 0 96 e 0 046 1 03 r 2 0 37 and the relationship between cnp and p p e t could be explained by c n p 4 7 10 5 p p e t 0 026 r 2 0 27 fig 7 4 discussion over the past few decades pdsigs mean pdsi in growing season values have decreased across a major part of eastern china and largely increased in northwestern and southeastern china fig 2b indicating that eastern china northwestern china was generally drying wetting in gs growing season in the period of 1982 2012 this is in agreement with the results in previous studies long et al 2014 wang et al 2011 zhai et al 2010 zou et al 2005 which reported the similar drying wetting tendencies over china for example based on soil moisture wang et al 2011 concluded that drying occurred over the northeast to north central china and wetting over most of the west including xinjiang northwestern china tibetan plateau and small part over yunnan however unlike the drier wetter tendencies vegetation during the gs reflected by the ndvigs mean ndvi in growing season has increased overall greening across china fig 2a fang et al 2004 peng et al 2011 piao et al 2003 although devegetation has occurred occasionally fig 2a the differences in the temporal and spatial variations in pdsigs and speigs mean spei in growing season and ndvigs demonstrate the complex relationships between vegetation and drought the results show that both the cnp pearson correlation between ndvigs and pdsigs and maxspei maximum correlation between ndvigs and speigs ranged from negative to positive fig 2c and d in general positive cnp and maxspei values arose in non humid regions fig 2c indicating that vegetation growth was sensitive to drought in these regions and vice versa the positive correlations are in good agreement with the results in previous findings gu et al 2007 vicente serrano et al 2013 and our general opinion is that drought has had a severe impact on natural and social systems from the past to present allen and breshears 1998 dai 2011b zhao and running 2010 however the negative cnp and maxspei values fig 2c and d are in contrast with previous studies ji and peters 2003 vicente serrano et al 2013 there could be several reasons for this phenomenon first differences in vegetation types could have an effect because of their different drought adaptation strategies breda et al 2006 deep rooting mature trees may be less susceptible to water limitation caused by severe or prolonged drought compared with plants with a shallow rooting depth hanson and weltzin 2000 yang et al 2016b negative correlations were generally found at stations dominated by forests fig 3 second a drought occurring during the gs not only results in relatively limited water availability but also in relatively high temperature and even solar radiation levels due to less cloudy and rainy days adler et al 2008 koster et al 2009 which are highly related to vegetative growth photosynthesis peng et al 2011 piao et al 2014 suni et al 2003 the negative correlations figs 2d and 4 indicated that the forests in humid china can extract sufficient water through their deep roots yang et al 2016b even when drought occurs and the relatively higher temperature and solar radiation e g due to less cloudy and rainy days promotes their canopy photosynthesis it should also be noted that the drought indices used in this study are defined as the relative water deficit compared with normal levels therefore a low value e g negative spei and pdsi does not always means that the soil moisture content is particularly low especially in humid regions for example in a region with a long term mean annual precipitation of 2000 mm year 1 a year with 1500 mm year 1 precipitation can be defined as a dry year however this 1500 mm year 1 of precipitation may provide enough water for evapotranspiration xu et al 2013 therefore a hydroclimate related threshold may exist above or below which the responses of vegetation to drought would be positive or negative as pointed out by guan et al 2015 the definition of drought and drought indices presumes that the response of natural vegetation to drought is related to the local hydroclimatic conditions the results show that the cnp and maxspei were highly related to the simple water balance p p e t vicente serrano et al 2013 and in particular the aridity index fig 5 the curve c n p 0 39 0 44 e 0 21 0 85 r 2 0 61 indicated that the cnp was generally positive negative when 0 98 0 98 fig 5a therefore 0 98 can be considered the threshold for determining whether droughts have positive or negative impacts on natural vegetation the value of 0 98 is very similar to that 1 0 determined by zhou et al 2015 who concluded that land cover changes might lead to greater hydrological responses in water limited regions with values of 1 0 this indicates that in humid regions 0 98 solar radiation and not water stress is the limiting factor for vegetative growth and vice versa also the complex relationships between ndvi and drought indices in this study indirectly demonstrated the results in karnieli et al 2010 which concluded that the correlation between land surface temperature and ndvi was negative positive when water energy was the limiting factor for vegetation growth however negative impacts of drought on vegetation do not always increase with increasing when 0 98 fig 5a yang et al 2015 when 4 68 the positive cnp and maxspei decreased gradually with increasing indicating that vegetative activity was less sensitive to drought in extreme arid regions similarly results in yang et al 2016a implied that biological controlled ecosystems i e semi arid sub humid ecosystems might be more vulnerable to drought than physical i e evaporation controlled ecosystems i e arid ecosystems possible explanations for this are that 1 the natural vegetation in these extreme arid regions such as euphrates poplar sacsaoul and alhagi sparsifolia shap are exposed to severe water stress all year round and have a strong ability to extract and reserve water and hence possesses a generally greater tolerance to drought yang et al 2016a and 2 precipitation is not the main water source for the vegetation e g underground water or snowmelt from mountain glaciers may provide more available water most importantly this phenomenon can be seen across the globe figs 6 and 7 small differences do exist but mainly as a result of differences in analytical method for the global scale analysis the vegetation had not been classified and the pixels that were dominated by agriculture were not deleted recently researchers try to employ the remotely sensed vegetation information to describe drought evolution and characteristics across the globe aghakouchak et al 2015 mu et al 2013 however our results showed that the responses of vegetation to drought differed in different hydroclimatic zones hence detecting drought using remote sensed vegetation based indices should take varied thresholds and standards in different hydroclimatic zones rather than a constant relationship for all regions otherwise it may potentially introduce more systematic errors and increase the uncertainties of drought assessment it should be noted that there are some uncertainties limitations within this study first the results are based on correlations between mean ndvi and drought indices pdsi and spei in the gs the correlation method can provide statistical results but can t take detailed information into consideration the averaged indices ndvi pdsi and spei also missed details of changes in vegetation and drought severity during a drought although there is no doubt that an extreme drought would have negative impacts on vegetation even in a very humid region e g 0 2 with negative cnp and maxspei second extreme drought is uncommon during the gs in china because there is a hot rainy season although some summer droughts do occur third the drought indices pdsi and spei and the vegetation indices ndvi have their own limitations liu et al 2017a zhang et al 2015 for example the ndvi would be saturated in area with dense vegetation e g the forest in southeastern china however we found similar results based on the modis evi enhanced vegetation index https modis gsfc nasa gov data dataprod mod13 php data not showed here forth this study has not taken the effects of enrichment of atmospheric co2 in consideration the increasing concentration of atmospheric co2 would increase the canopy resistance and exerts impacts on water use efficiency de kauwe et al 2013 roderick et al 2015 yang et al 2019 these would result in uncertainties to the results though the changes in atmospheric co2 in the interested period was relatively small nevertheless although these limitations in methodology and drought indices should highlight any uncertainties this study has demonstrated that drought will not always have a negative effect on vegetation and has revealed that the local hydroclimate is a key factor influencing the response to drought furthermore there may be a local hydroclimate related threshold precipitation amount or drought severity that determines the vegetative response to drought which warrants further study 5 conclusion this study assessed the covariation between drought and vegetation during the growing season gs across china based on monthly pdsi spei at multiple time scales and ndvi gimms ndvi3g values from 293 stations that were dominated by natural vegetation the response of the vegetation to drought was measured using pearson correlations between ndvi and the drought indices the results show that eastern northwestern china was generally becoming drier wetter while the ndvi had increased overall during the past few decades the cnp correlation between ndvi and pdsi in growing season ranged from 0 47 to 0 84 and the maxspei maximum correlation between ndvi and spei in growing season ranged from 0 31 to 0 86 positive negative cnp and maxspei were distributed mainly in non humid humid regions the relationship between cnp similarly the maxspei and aridity index could be explained by the equation c n p 0 39 0 44 e 0 21 0 85 r 2 0 61 this equation suggests that the correlations are positive negative when 0 98 0 98 and increase from negative to positive when 4 68 and then decrease gradually when 4 68 this indicates that in humid regions 0 98 water stress may not be the limiting factor for natural vegetation and in semiarid and arid regions 4 68 the sensitivity of vegetation to drought increases with increasing while in extreme arid regions 4 68 the vegetation exhibits less vulnerability to drought when increases moreover this phenomenon can be seen at a global scale possible explanations for this include the varied physiological structure of different vegetation types and the positive responses of photosynthesis to energy in droughts the results illustrate the linkage between local hydroclimatic conditions and the response of vegetation to drought which is helpful for quantifying the interaction between vegetation and climate

6462,the east central north china plain ncp is a globally representative area that presents a sharp contradiction between deep groundwater exploitation and grain production evaluating the effects of limited irrigation on crop water productivity wp and deep groundwater exploitation reduction in this area is important for developing sustainable agricultural practices in this study the 11 limited irrigation scenarios were simulated and analyzed using the distributed soil water atmosphere plant world food study swap wofost model that was established calibrated and validated in a companion paper the recommended irrigation timing for maximizing the yield or wp of winter wheat was selected the irrigation scheme for minimizing evapotranspiration constrained by 14 winter wheat yield reduction thresholds was optimized separately and further the effects of the optimized irrigation scheme on saving water and reducing deep groundwater exploitation were evaluated the results showed that the recommended irrigation timing was predominantly in the pre sowing booting to anthesis and early grain filling stages for three irrigations the pre sowing and booting to anthesis stages for two irrigations and the booting to anthesis stage for one irrigation adopting the optimized irrigation scheme with the threshold of 60 could achieve the goal of reducing deep groundwater exploitation by 6 05 108 m3 but reduced winter wheat yield by approximately 50 the contribution index of reducing exploitation cire was defined to identify the contribution of implementing the optimized irrigation scheme to reducing current deep groundwater exploitation at the related water resource subregional level the cire values showed that this contribution was relatively higher in the related tuhai and majia rivers plain thmjhp the related plain of the zhangwei river basin zwhp and the related plain of the ziya river basin zyhp following the framework of simulation optimization evaluation the three results at the manageable county level namely the optimized irrigation scheme under the constraint of 14 thresholds the crop yield variation compared with the current irrigation schedule and the cire

north china plain ncp is a major grain producing region in china liu and wei 1989 liu et al 2001 zhang et al 2013 that produces on average approximately 53 of the nation s wheat triticum aestivum l and 31 of the nation s maize zea mays l national bureau of statistics of the people s republic of china 1990 2012 grain production on this plain is primarily bound by water resource scarcity liu and wei 1989 fang and chen 2008 liu et al 2011 the ncp is one of the worldwide areas experiencing the most severe groundwater depletion because of high intensity exploitation for irrigation giordano 2009 liu et al 2011 cao et al 2013 dalin et al 2017 rodell et al 2018 different from the piedmont plain of the ncp where irrigation water is mostly pumped from a shallow aquifer in the east central ncp i e heilonggang region agricultural irrigation in recent decades has mainly depended on deep groundwater due to the lack of surface water and the wide distribution of brackish or saline shallow groundwater foster et al 2004 shi et al 2011 huang et al 2015 consequently the capability of deep groundwater to maintain sustainable agricultural development in this region has been seriously challenged and a series of environmental and geological problems e g a fairly continuous decline in the deep groundwater level deep groundwater depression cones land subsidence and groundwater quality deterioration continue to grow chen 1999 zhang and li 2005 zhang et al 2009b zheng et al 2010 shi et al 2011 in response to the increasingly severe deep groundwater security crisis the chinese government has successively released a range of policies over the past four years on reducing deep groundwater exploitation in this region the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2015 the central people s government of the people s republic of china 2015 2017 precipitation during the growing season of winter wheat which is the major crop in this region cannot meet the water requirement and a water deficit of approximately 300 mm is observed collaborative group for water demand contour map of major crop in china 1993 zhang et al 2004 therefore deep groundwater irrigation plays an important role in meeting water demands for the growth and development of this crop liu et al 2001 qiu 2010 zhang et al 2004 under these circumstances tradeoffs need to be made between reducing deep groundwater abstraction and maintaining winter wheat production in this representative region this study is important not only for meeting current agricultural water management demands but also for providing a reference for similar areas worldwide where deep groundwater is exploited for irrigation this study has international significance and is a hot spot of interdisciplinary hydrology to mitigate the contradiction between water scarcity and winter wheat production in the study area a number of field experiments have been conducted to analyze the responses of growth development yield water consumption and water use efficiency to different irrigation frequency and timing schedules for winter wheat at experimental stations in this area and adjacent areas zhang et al 1999 2009a 2011 2013 xue et al 2010 wu and wang 2010 xu et al 2016 2018 cao et al 2016 however these field experiments rarely focus on the impacts of limited irrigation for winter wheat on the yield and water productivity wp of the succeeding summer maize additionally the generalization of these site and year specific experimental results to the entire region seems somewhat unfeasible due to the spatial variations in different agro hydrological conditions e g meteorology soils crops and irrigation furthermore carrying out field experiments with multiple limited irrigation schemes simultaneously is impractical at a regional scale therefore the distributed agro hydrological model may prove to be a unique and operational tool to assess the effects of various limited irrigation schemes on crop yields wps and water balance components at a regional scale the soil water atmosphere plant swap model and its embedded detailed crop module which is derived from the world food study wofost model are designed to simulate soil water movement solute transport and heat transfer in the vadose in close interaction with crop growth boogaard et al 1998 kroes et al 2009 the distributed swap wofost model combined with geographic information system gis technology has been used to evaluate the influences of irrigation strategies e g current irrigation or different water management scenarios on crop yield evapotranspiration and wp at a regional level and further propose reasonable suggestions for better water resource management in the study area singh et al 2006a b van dam et al 2006 noory et al 2011 xue and ren 2017 in a companion paper the established distributed swap wofost model in the study area was calibrated and validated in detail using abundant observed experimental data statistical data remote sensing data and data presented in the relevant literature this prior work has laid a solid foundation for analyses of various limited irrigation scenarios in this paper few studies have focused on analyzing the temporal and spatial variations in the yield wp and water balance of crops under various limited irrigation scenarios by a distributed agro hydrological model and further evaluating the effect of the optimized irrigation scheme on reducing deep groundwater exploitation in the heilonggang region based on the tradeoffs between water and food therefore the objectives of this study are to 1 analyze the variations in the yield wp and seasonal water balance components of winter wheat and summer maize under 11 designed limited irrigation scenarios 2 select the recommended irrigation timing for winter wheat with maximum yield or maximum wp under different irrigation frequencies 3 optimize the irrigation scheme for winter wheat with minimum evapotranspiration under the constraint of 14 yield reduction thresholds 4 assess the impacts of the optimized irrigation scheme on the yield irrigation quota evapotranspiration and wp of winter wheat at the county level and 5 evaluate the effect of the optimized irrigation scheme on reducing deep groundwater exploitation at the regional water resource subregional and county levels 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the heilonggang region is the main area in hebei province with limited deep groundwater exploitation to mitigate the spiraling trend in deep groundwater depletion fig 1 a this region which covers an area of approximately 40 000 km2 is composed of 53 counties belonging to six cities fig 1b the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system is the most predominant planting pattern in this region wang 2011 the heilonggang climate is monsoonal semi arid and semi humid the average precipitation levels during the growing seasons of winter wheat from mid october to early june next year and summer maize from mid june to early october from 1993 to 2012 were 119 0 mm and 379 5 mm respectively which accounted for approximately 23 9 and 76 1 of the annual average precipitation respectively according to the results of precipitation exceedance probability pep analysis which was calculated using the precipitation data from 1975 to 2012 the number of winter wheat seasons during the simulation period 1993 2012 with a pep less than or equal to 25 wet year larger than 25 and less than 75 normal year larger than or equal to 75 and less than 95 dry year and larger than or equal to 95 drier year was 3 12 4 and 1 respectively fig 2 a additionally the number of summer maize seasons with wet normal dry and drier years was 4 11 3 and 2 respectively fig 2b the water requirement amounts of winter wheat and summer maize were estimated to be approximately 476 0 mm and 338 9 mm respectively in this region collaborative group for water demand contour map of major crop in china 1993 consequently the water deficits of the two crops especially winter wheat are heavily dependent on irrigation wang 2011 loam and sandy loam are the main soil textures of the topsoil 0 30 cm representing more than 80 of all topsoil in the region and clay loam sandy loam and loam dominate the subsoil 30 200 cm representing more than 90 of all subsoil shi et al 2004 2010 the average available water capacity awc of the 0 200 cm soil in the study area is approximately 240 7 mm with a range from 222 mm to 249 mm shi et al 2004 2010 the total water consumption in the study area was 57 08 108 m3 in 1999 with 7 9 consumed by industrial use 81 7 consumed by agricultural use and 10 4 consumed by domestic use national groundwater resource assessment project office 2004 water consumption in the study area relies not only on surface water which meets 14 6 of the water consumption demand but also on groundwater which meets 85 4 of the demand national groundwater resource assessment project office 2004 2 2 settings of the limited irrigation scenario for winter wheat the study area was divided into three irrigation zones i e zones i ii and iii in the companion paper based on spatial differences in the current irrigation conditions thus limited irrigation scenarios were set separately for each zone in zone i under the current irrigation schedule irrigations were applied at four key growth stages i e pre sowing raising to jointing booting to anthesis and early grain filling of winter wheat in most years wang 2004 jia and guo 2009 hence the irrigation frequencies under limited irrigation were successively set to three two one and zero irrigation before sowing plays an important role in saving water and achieving a high yield for winter wheat in the study area wang 2004 li et al 2005 thus when the irrigation frequency was three or two pre sowing irrigation was guaranteed and the water deficit was applied in the other one or two stages resulting in scenarios 1 6 table 1 the application of one irrigation scheme in each of the four key stages was defined as scenarios 7 10 and scenario 11 had no irrigation table 1 in addition the irrigation amount under the limited irrigation scenarios was consistent with the current irrigation schedule when the winter wheat was irrigated under scenarios 1 10 the irrigation schedule for summer maize was identical to the current situation and summer maize was not irrigated when the winter wheat was rain fed under scenario 11 in zone ii three irrigations were applied at the pre sowing raising to jointing and booting to anthesis stages in most years under the current irrigation schedule thus scenarios 4 11 can be called the limited irrigation scenarios in zone iii one irrigation was applied at the raising to jointing stage in normal dry and drier years under the current irrigation schedule hence only scenario 11 can be called the limited irrigation scenario in zones ii and iii deficit irrigation was implemented due to poor irrigation conditions wang 2011 some measures made it possible to improve current irrigation management in these two zones the people s government of hebei province 2008 zhang et al 2009b therefore simulations of the 11 limited irrigation scenarios table 1 were performed in zones ii and iii for the convenience of a unified simulation and calculation however the impacts of the limited irrigation scenarios on the yield and wp of winter wheat and summer maize were assessed separately in the three zones 2 3 selection of recommended irrigation timing the irrigation frequency of the 11 limited irrigation scenarios for winter wheat ranged from zero to three there were scenarios with the same irrigation frequency but different irrigation timing this study aimed to a provide quantitative analysis of tradeoffs between deep groundwater conservation and winter wheat yield meanwhile wp provides a useful framework for analyzing crop production increases or water savings in irrigated agriculture van dam et al 2006 and is defined as the ratio of crop yield to seasonal water use referred to the evapotranspiration in this study singh et al 2006a b for a specific irrigation frequency the scenario with the maximum yield or maximum wp of winter wheat was selected the irrigation timing of the selected scenario was defined as the recommended irrigation timing the steps for obtaining the spatial distribution and dynamics of the scenario with the maximum yield or maximum wp of winter wheat when the irrigation frequency was three were as follows 1 on each of the 2809 simulation units the scenario was selected from scenarios 1 2 and 3 to maximize the average winter wheat yield during the simulation period 1993 2012 thus producing the spatial distribution of the scenario with the maximum yield 2 the scenario in which the winter wheat yield was maximum was selected from scenarios 1 2 and 3 in each simulation unit in each year from 1993 to 2012 and then the proportions of the distribution areas in the total area of scenarios 1 2 and 3 for each year were calculated which resulted in the dynamics of the scenario with the maximum yield and 3 repeat the above two steps with the winter wheat wp to obtain the spatial distribution and dynamics of the scenario with the maximum wp these three steps were performed for scenarios 4 5 and 6 when the irrigation frequency was two and for scenarios 7 8 9 and 10 when the irrigation frequency was one 2 4 establishment of the single objective integer linear programming model protection of deep groundwater from further deterioration has been the priority in the study area while winter wheat production has a key role in ensuring grain security a combination of the simulation results using the distributed swap wofost model and the classic integer linear programming ilp model provided a method of optimizing the irrigation scheme for winter wheat the optimization aimed to save water with an acceptable yield reduction in detail for each simulation unit the objective function of the ilp model was to find the minimum average evapotranspiration of winter wheat during the simulation period min z under the constraint of a specific winter wheat yield reduction the ilp model was solved for the 2809 simulation units which resulted in the distribution of the optimized irrigation scheme the 0 1 linear programming approach a special form of the ilp was applied in this study details about the ilp model are as follows 1 objective function min z i 0 11 p i x i 2 constraints s t i 0 11 y i x i b i 0 1 11 x i 0 or 1 i 0 1 11 where pi is the average evapotranspiration of winter wheat during the simulation period in response to the irrigation scheme of i mm xi is the decision variable which can only be zero or one where a value of one indicates that the irrigation scheme of i was selected and a value of zero indicates the opposite i represents the irrigation scheme where a value of zero indicates the current irrigation schedule and values of one to 11 indicate the limited irrigation scenarios of i yi is the average winter wheat yield reduction during the simulation period compared with the current irrigation schedule in response to the irrigation scheme of i and b is the constraint threshold of the winter wheat yield reduction after analyzing the winter wheat yield under the 11 scenarios 14 winter wheat yield reductions i e 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 and 70 were applied successively as the constraint threshold in the ilp model to ensure that the optimized irrigation scheme included the irrigation frequencies of three two one and zero this method not only fully exploited the simulation results for optimization but also provided more choices for decision makers for each threshold ilp was performed on the 2809 simulation units in sequence vba language programming was used to solve in batch the ilp 39 326 times 2809 simulation units under 14 thresholds 2 5 evaluating the effects of the optimized irrigation scheme on saving water and reducing deep groundwater exploitation first compared with the current irrigation schedule the reductions in the irrigation quota and evapotranspiration of winter wheat under the optimized irrigation scheme at the simulation unit level were calculated second these reductions were aggregated from the 2809 simulation units to the 53 counties using the area weighted average finally these reductions were converted from millimeters to cubic meters by multiplying the average winter wheat planting area in 1994 2012 in each county general office of people s government of hebei province and hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1995 2013 the water consumption for agricultural irrigation is mainly satisfied by groundwater especially deep groundwater and complemented by surface water in the study area national groundwater resource assessment project office 2004 zhang and li 2005 wang 2011 an estimation of the reduction in the amount of deep groundwater exploitation under the optimized irrigation scheme is needed to determine what proportion of agricultural irrigation water consumption was supplied by deep groundwater in each county on average during the simulation period this proportion p in each county was estimated as follows 1 the agricultural water consumption amount in 1999 was calculated by adding up the amounts of surface water and groundwater used in agriculture national groundwater resource assessment project office 2004 2 the amount of agricultural water consumption supplied by deep groundwater in 1999 was estimated using the investigation data national groundwater resource assessment project office 2004 a shallow groundwater salinity map zhang and fei 2009 and relevant studies chen 1999 zhang and li 2005 zhang et al 2009b 3 the proportion of agricultural water consumption supplied by deep groundwater in 1999 p1 was estimated 4 the value of p1 was assumed to be the proportion of agricultural irrigation water consumption supplied by deep groundwater in 1999 p2 because more than 94 of agricultural water consumption was for agricultural irrigation water resources department of hebei province 2005 2012 and 5 the value of p2 was approximated as the value of p because deep groundwater abstraction was relatively stable from 2000 to 2012 in the study area water resources department of hebei province 2000 2012 national groundwater resource assessment project office 2004 zhang and li 2005 zhang et al 2009b the reduction in the amount of deep groundwater exploitation under the optimized irrigation scheme was estimated using the value of p at the county level and was further upscaled to the water resource subregional level using the area weighted average an index namely the contribution index of reducing exploitation cire was defined to evaluate the contribution of the optimized winter wheat irrigation scheme to reducing deep groundwater exploitation at the specific levels and it is described as follows 3 cire rde de where rde is the reduction in the amount of deep groundwater exploitation under the optimized irrigation scheme compared with the current irrigation schedule 108 m3 and de is the amount of exploited deep groundwater 108 m3 the de values at the county level were investigated for 1999 and derived from the national groundwater resource assessment project office 2004 additionally the de values at the water resource subregional level were investigated for 2005 and they were from ren et al 2007 the detailed overall flow chart of this study is shown in fig 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 limited irrigation scenarios 3 1 1 crop yield when the irrigation frequency of winter wheat was three mean of scenarios 1 2 and 3 two mean of scenarios 4 5 and 6 one mean of scenarios 7 8 9 and 10 and zero scenario 11 the average winter wheat yield during the simulation period in zone i was 3785 4 kg hm 2 2396 7 kg hm 2 1505 9 kg hm 2 and 674 8 kg hm 2 respectively table 2 and the corresponding yields were 4239 1 kg hm 2 2776 5 kg hm 2 1947 0 kg hm 2 and 1084 3 kg hm 2 in zone ii respectively and 4185 9 kg hm 2 2840 7 kg hm 2 2086 1 kg hm 2 and 1242 6 kg hm 2 in zone iii respectively table 2 these results showed that the average winter wheat yield decreased with decreasing irrigation frequency in the three zones notably the maximum difference in the average winter wheat yield among the scenarios with the same irrigation frequency reached 1413 8 kg hm 2 between scenarios 4 and 5 1913 7 kg hm 2 between scenarios 4 and 6 and 1758 5 kg hm 2 between scenarios 4 and 6 in zones i ii and iii respectively due to different irrigation timing table 2 with an unchanged irrigation schedule for summer maize under scenarios 1 10 the average summer maize yield during the simulation period in the three zones table 2 showed that the delay in the irrigation timing of winter wheat after the regreening stage with a specific irrigation frequency led to a higher summer maize yield this result could be explained by the fact that summer maize was irrigated one or two times only when the peps were no less than 75 under the generalized current irrigation schedule that is the summer maize was rain fed in most years therefore postponing the irrigation of winter wheat resulted in a higher soil water content during the summer maize vegetative stage which could help increase the leaf area index lai and thus increase yield the maximum differences in the average summer maize yield in zones i ii and iii were 994 4 kg hm 2 between scenarios 1 and 3 988 8 kg hm 2 between scenarios 1 and 3 and 1092 0 kg hm 2 between scenarios 1 and 3 respectively table 2 these results indicate that the appropriate irrigation timing of winter wheat under limited irrigation was critical to ensuring the yield of the two crops under different limited irrigation scenarios especially scenario 11 the average winter wheat yield was relatively high in 1995 1997 1998 2004 and 2008 and low in 1993 2000 2002 and 2006 fig 4 a 1 thus showing that the winter wheat yield was related to seasonal precipitation fig 2a the precipitation during the summer maize growing season fig 2b had a significant impact on yield fig s1a 1 mainly because the water requirements of summer maize could be met by the precipitation in most years the reductions in the average yields of winter wheat and summer maize in each county under the 11 limited irrigation scenarios compared with the current irrigation schedule are shown in figs 4a 2 and s1a 2 respectively 3 1 2 wp the average wp values of winter wheat were 1 03 kg m 3 0 78 kg m 3 0 60 kg m 3 and 0 34 kg m 3 in zone i when the irrigation frequencies of winter wheat were three two one and zero respectively table 2 the average wp values were 1 03 kg m 3 0 80 kg m 3 0 69 kg m 3 and 0 48 kg m 3 in zone ii and were 0 97 kg m 3 0 77 kg m 3 0 69 kg m 3 and 0 51 kg m 3 in zone iii when the irrigation frequencies were three two one and zero respectively table 2 these results showed that the wp of winter wheat also decreased with decreasing irrigation frequency notably the wp of winter wheat was also significantly influenced by irrigation timing the maximum differences in the average wp values of winter wheat were 0 48 kg m 3 between scenarios 4 and 5 0 60 kg m 3 between scenarios 4 and 6 and 0 54 kg m 3 between scenarios 4 and 6 among the scenarios with the same irrigation frequency but different irrigation timing in zones i ii and iii respectively table 2 there was also a difference in the wp of summer maize due to differences in the irrigation timing of winter wheat and the maximal differences were 0 19 kg m 3 between scenarios 1 and 3 or between scenarios 8 and 10 in zone i 0 20 kg m 3 between scenarios 1 and 3 in zone ii and 0 22 kg m 3 between scenarios 8 and 10 in zone iii table 2 the interannual variabilities in the average wp of both winter wheat fig 4b 1 and summer maize fig s1b 1 were influenced by the seasonal precipitation fig 2 the reductions in the average wps of winter wheat and summer maize in each county under the 11 limited irrigation scenarios compared with the current irrigation schedule are shown in fig 4b 2 and fig s1b 2 respectively as a result the irrigation frequency of winter wheat had significant impacts on the yield and wp of winter wheat and the succeeding summer maize additionally the irrigation timing of winter wheat obviously affected the yield and wp of the two crops therefore the irrigation timing should be selected to maximize yield and wp 3 1 3 water balance components in a companion paper the study area was roughly divided into two zones with different bottom boundary conditions the bottom boundary conditions were free drainage of the 2 m soil profile in zone a and zero flux of the 15 m soil profile in zone b therefore the water balance components were analyzed separately in the two zones for the current irrigation three irrigation mean of scenarios 1 2 and 3 two irrigation mean of scenarios 4 5 and 6 one irrigation mean of scenarios 7 8 9 and 10 and rain fed scenarios 11 schemes the average irrigation quotas of winter wheat were 286 4 mm 225 0 mm 150 0 mm 75 0 mm and 0 mm in zone a respectively fig 5 a and 181 6 mm 225 0 mm 150 0 mm 75 0 mm and 0 mm in zone b respectively fig 5b and the average interception amounts under these five irrigation schemes were 7 6 mm 6 9 mm 6 1 mm 4 3 mm and 3 2 mm in zone a respectively which accounted for 1 4 2 2 of the outflow the sum of the interception transpiration evaporation and bottom flux fig 5a and 8 5 mm 8 9 mm 7 9 mm 5 7 mm and 4 3 mm in zone b respectively which accounted for 1 6 2 6 of the outflow the sum of the interception transpiration and evaporation fig 5b these results showed that interception represented a very small proportion of the outflow and the reduction in the irrigation quota led to a slight decrease in interception because the increasing water stress resulting from irrigation quota reduction accelerated the process of leaf senescence kroes et al 2009 and further decreased the average lai meanwhile interception decreased with decreasing lai kroes et al 2009 and it was affected not only by the irrigation quota but also by the irrigation timing for the current irrigation three irrigation two irrigation one irrigation and rain fed schemes the average transpiration amounts during the winter wheat growing season were 320 6 mm 273 8 mm 219 0 mm 161 4 mm and 109 4 mm in zone a respectively and 307 8 mm 333 8 mm 272 6 mm 209 8 mm and 153 0 mm in zone b respectively the average proportion of transpiration to the outflow decreased from 73 5 to 61 3 in zone a fig 5a and from 79 6 to 71 3 in zone b fig 5b indicating that transpiration was the most dominant consumption sector both transpiration and the proportion of transpiration to the outflow decreased as a result of the decreased irrigation quota because stomatal regulation prevents dehydration and death water stress may reduce transpiration wu 2008 under the same scenario the average transpiration in zone b was higher than that in zone a which was mainly due to the capillary rise of shallow groundwater to alleviate water stress in zone b under the scenarios with the same irrigation quota earlier irrigation timing from the raising to maturity stage of winter wheat resulted in more transpiration the average winter wheat evaporation amounts under the five irrigation schemes current irrigation three irrigation two irrigation one irrigation and rain fed were 91 9 mm 87 8 mm 81 4 mm 70 7 mm and 60 5 mm in zone a respectively and 76 3 mm 80 5 mm 75 3 mm 66 7 mm and 57 2 mm in zone b respectively the proportion of evaporation to the outflow increased from 21 1 to 33 9 in zone a fig 5a and from 18 2 to 26 7 in zone b fig 5b the reduction in irrigation frequency could decrease the soil water content further decreasing both the hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradient and thereby decreasing the evaporation rate hillel 1971 however with a reduction in the irrigation quota the proportion of evaporation to the outflow increased because the decrement of evaporation was less than that of outflow the bottom flux was analyzed in only zone a because this flux equaled zero in zone b the average bottom flux leakage values were 16 0 mm 14 8 mm 13 3 mm 8 0 mm and 5 3 mm under the current irrigation three irrigation two irrigation one irrigation and rain fed schemes respectively the results showed that the decreased irrigation quota led to a slight reduction in leakage the bottom flux accounted for less than 5 of the outflow fig 5a indicating that there was a poor potential to improve soil water use efficiency by reducing leakage which could be explained by the fact that precipitation and irrigation were largely consumed by transpiration and evaporation the average amounts of soil water storage change under these five irrigation schemes current irrigation three irrigation two irrigation one irrigation and rain fed were 33 7 mm 42 3 mm 53 7 mm 53 4 mm and 62 4 mm in zone a respectively fig 5a and 91 7 mm 78 9 mm 86 5 mm 87 9 mm and 95 2 mm in zone b respectively fig 5b these results showed that the change in soil water storage during the winter wheat growing season was caused by consumption and the need for water for growth could be compensated by an increase in soil water use despite the decrease in irrigation quota the average irrigation quota of summer maize under scenarios 1 10 was 23 7 mm in zone a and 7 3 mm in zone b the summer maize was rain fed scenario 11 in zones a and b however differences were observed in the soil water balance components during the summer maize growing season in zones a and b just because of differences in the irrigation frequencies and timings of winter wheat scenarios 1 10 specifically the average interception transpiration evaporation bottom flux and soil water storage change ranges of summer maize in zone a were 10 8 13 7 mm 226 0 265 3 mm 69 1 75 9 mm 8 2 16 2 mm and 16 6 59 0 mm respectively fig s2a and the average interception transpiration evaporation and soil water storage change ranges of summer maize in zone b were 12 1 15 3 mm 237 0 277 5 mm 71 4 78 9 mm and 36 5 72 7 mm respectively fig s2b under the scenarios with the same winter wheat irrigation frequency with the delay in the irrigation timing for winter wheat after the regreening stage the proportions of interception transpiration and bottom flux to the outflow increased during the summer maize growing season while the proportion of evaporation to the outflow and the increment of soil water storage decreased because the summer maize was rain fed in most years and irrigated one or two times in dry or drier years delaying the irrigation timing of winter wheat resulted in a relatively high soil water content during the summer maize growing season especially in the vegetative stage and might alleviate water stress and increase transpiration soil water consumption and lai thereby increasing interception and decreasing evaporation 3 2 recommended irrigation timing for winter wheat 3 2 1 three irrigations when the irrigation frequency was three scenarios 1 2 and 3 the dominant scenario which resulted in the maximum average winter wheat yield during the simulation period was scenario 3 although scenario 1 resulted in the maximum yield in a few parts of the north and south of the study area fig 6 a 1 left the right side panel in fig 6a 1 shows the dynamics of the scenario with the maximum winter wheat yield the proportion of the study area with the maximum yield was greater than 50 in 1998 1999 2002 2006 and 2009 under scenario 1 and greater than 40 in only 2005 under scenario 2 and dominant values were observed in the other studied years under scenario 3 the average proportions of the study area with the maximum yield under scenarios 1 2 and 3 from 1993 to 2012 were 32 7 and 61 respectively the dominant scenario resulting in the maximum average wp of winter wheat during the simulation period was also scenario 3 fig 6b 1 left the spatial distribution fig 6b 1 left and dynamics fig 6b 1 right of the scenario producing the maximum wp were similar to those for the maximum yield the average proportions of the study area with the maximum wp under scenarios 1 2 and 3 were 18 5 and 77 respectively thus for the three irrigations the scenario with the maximum yield or maximum wp of winter wheat tended to be scenario 3 irrigations applied at the pre sowing booting to anthesis and early grain filling stages followed by scenario 1 irrigations applied at the pre sowing raising to jointing and booting to anthesis stages and scenario 2 irrigations applied at the pre sowing raising to jointing and early grain filling stages the recommended irrigation timing led to the highest relative transpiration value reflects the degrees of water stress in the reproductive growth stage of winter wheat and then maximized the yield or wp because the well timed irrigation combined with precipitation led to more suitable soil water content to meet the water requirement of winter wheat growth field experimental results in the study area showed that relatively high yields and high wps of winter wheat were obtained via the application of two irrigations at the jointing and anthesis stages li et al 2005 zhang et al 2009a 2011 at the jointing and heading stages wu and wang 2010 or at the jointing and early grain filling stages cao et al 2016 in combination with sufficient soil water content at the pre sowing stage these site specific results indicated that the recommended irrigation timing is reasonable notably the irrigation date at a specific stage is determined by the water requirements and real time soil water contents in field management meanwhile additional detailed information about the irrigation dates under each limited irrigation scenario in each year of the simulation period was not available hence the irrigation date at a specific stage remained unchanged under each scenario which might result in the difference in our recommended irrigation timing from that in the studies cited above this difference suggests that the irrigation date at a specific stage should be properly delayed with decreasing irrigation frequency to maximize the yield and wp of winter wheat 3 2 2 two irrigations when the irrigation frequency was two scenarios 4 5 and 6 the scenario with the maximum average winter wheat yield during the simulation period was mainly scenario 5 although scenario 6 yielded the maximum values in parts of cangzhou and xingtai cities fig 6a 2 left the proportion of the study area with the maximum winter wheat yield was greater than 50 in only 2002 under scenario 4 and greater than 50 in 1993 1997 2003 and 2010 under scenario 6 and dominant values were observed in the other years under scenario 5 fig 6a 2 right regarding the spatial distribution fig 6b 2 left and dynamics fig 6b 2 right of the scenario with the maximum wp the results were similar to those for the maximum yield the average proportions of the study area with the maximum yield under scenarios 4 5 and 6 were 7 67 and 26 respectively the corresponding proportions of the study area with the maximum wp under the three scenarios were 4 65 and 31 thus scenario 5 irrigations applied at the pre sowing and booting to anthesis stages was the most widely distributed scenario with the maximum yield or maximum wp when the winter wheat was irrigated two times followed by scenario 6 irrigations applied at the pre sowing and early grain filling stages and scenario 4 irrigations applied at the pre sowing and raising to jointing stages the booting stage of wheat is most sensitive to water stress followed by the anthesis stage jia and guo 2009 the sensitivity of winter wheat growth stages to water deficits can be ordered from the most to least sensitive in the following sequence heading to grain filling jointing to heading grain filling to maturity regreening to jointing sowing to freezing and freezing to regreening collaborative group for water demand contour map of major crop in china 1993 the winter wheat was more sensitive to water stress at the booting to heading and heading to grain filling stages in the ncp zhang et al 1999 in summary the booting to anthesis stage that is sensitive to water stress represents the crucial irrigation time point which is essentially in agreement with our result the experimental results li et al 2005 xue et al 2010 xu et al 2016 showed that the maximum yield and maximum wp were obtained when the winter wheat was irrigated at the pre sowing and jointing or heading stages these previous studies have demonstrated the rationality of our recommended irrigation timing to some extent and the difference between these and our studies might be attributed to the use of a uniform irrigation date setting in the simulation 3 2 3 one irrigation when the irrigation frequency was one scenarios 7 8 9 and 10 scenario 9 predominantly produced the maximum average winter wheat yield during the simulation period although scenario 10 produced the maximum yield in part of cangzhou city fig 6a 3 left the proportion of the study area with the maximum yield was greater than 40 in 1998 1999 2002 and 2003 under scenario 8 greater than 50 in only 1997 and 2010 under scenario 10 and greater than 40 in the other years under scenario 9 fig 6a 3 right the average proportions of the study area with the maximum yield under scenarios 7 8 9 and 10 were 7 22 54 and 17 respectively moreover the average proportions of the study area with the maximum wp under scenarios 7 8 9 and 10 were 5 19 53 and 23 respectively fig 6b 3 right the most recommended irrigation timing was the booting to anthesis stage scenario 9 to maximize yield and wp followed by the early grain filling stage scenario 10 the raising to jointing stage scenario 8 and the pre sowing stage scenario 7 when the winter wheat was irrigated once the highest sensitivity to water stress occurred in the booting and anthesis stages jia and guo 2009 which could account for the irrigation timing recommendation 3 3 optimized irrigation schemes fig 7 shows the optimized irrigation schemes for winter wheat with minimum evapotranspiration under the constraint of 14 yield reduction thresholds the dominant irrigation schemes after optimization were current irrigation fig 7a c scenario 3 fig 7d h scenario 5 fig 7i scenario 6 fig 7j l and scenario 10 fig 7m n when the thresholds were 5 15 20 40 45 50 60 and 65 70 respectively furthermore the impacts of the optimized irrigation scheme on the wp yield irrigation quota and evapotranspiration of winter wheat were evaluated from the perspective of agricultural water management the wp fig 8 a and variations in the yield irrigation quota and evapotranspiration fig 8b of winter wheat under the optimized irrigation scheme were aggregated from the simulation unit level to the county level compared with the current irrigation schedule the average yield irrigation quota and evapotranspiration of winter wheat under the optimized irrigation scheme in the study area decreased with increasing winter wheat yield reduction threshold fig 8b when the threshold ranged from 5 to 35 the average variation in winter wheat yield under the optimized irrigation scheme decreased from 2 05 to 20 58 compared with the current irrigation schedule fig 8b the yield variation in each county is shown in fig 9 a g accordingly the average wp under the optimized irrigation scheme ranged from 1 14 to 1 19 kg m 3 with an increase of less than 5 0 compared with the wp under the current irrigation schedule fig 8a because the yield reduction was less than the evapotranspiration reduction moreover the optimized irrigation scheme achieved 2 25 29 80 and 2 49 20 59 reductions in the irrigation quota and evapotranspiration respectively fig 8b in summary the optimized irrigation scheme under these thresholds could achieve water saving and stable water use efficiency goals simultaneously when the threshold ranged from 40 to 70 the average wp under the optimized irrigation scheme had a reduction of less than 30 fig 8a and a loss in yield of 29 36 61 08 fig 8b compared with the current irrigation schedule the yield variation in each county is shown in fig 9h n because of poor current irrigation conditions limited irrigation has been implemented in practice in zones ii and iii thus it had less room to reduce the winter wheat yield further under the optimized irrigation schemes so the yield reduction in these two zones was less than that in zone i fig 9h n accordingly the reductions in the irrigation quota and evapotranspiration changed from 39 04 to 73 52 and from 24 27 to 44 55 respectively fig 8b zhang et al 2016 pointed out that new cultivars improved soil fertility and management practices would increase grain production without much increase in water use xu et al 2016 suggested that the yield loss caused by limited irrigation might be offset by the development of new agricultural technologies or cultivars without considering the compensation effect of cultivars soil fertility improvement and management practices on yield the yield loss under the optimized irrigation scheme might be unacceptable 3 4 effects on water saving and deep groundwater exploitation reduction with an increase in the threshold of winter wheat yield reduction from 5 to 70 the reduction in the average irrigation quota for winter wheat under the corresponding optimized irrigation scheme increased from approximately 0 74 108 m3 to 22 94 108 m3 compared with the current irrigation schedule fig 10 a accordingly the reduction in the average evapotranspiration increased from approximately 1 13 108 m3 to 21 19 108 m3 fig 10a the maximum reductions in the irrigation quota and evapotranspiration value were approximately equivalent to 50 and 45 of the current agricultural irrigation water consumption respectively fig 10a which indicated that implementing the optimized irrigation scheme could help reduce agricultural irrigation water consumption in the study area for the whole region compared with the current irrigation schedule the reduction in the amount of deep groundwater exploitation under the optimized irrigation scheme increased from approximately 0 10 108 m3 to 7 15 108 m3 as the threshold increased from 5 to 70 fig 10b the maximum value of 7 15 108 m3 represented approximately 34 of the estimated deep groundwater exploitation amount 21 29 108 m3 national groundwater resource assessment project office 2004 agriculture department of hebei province et al 2014 the agriculture department of hebei province et al 2014 aims to reduce the groundwater exploitation for agriculture by 7 60 108 m3 with deep groundwater accounting for approximately 6 05 108 m3 of this amount when the reduction threshold was 60 the reduction in the deep groundwater exploitation for winter wheat irrigation was approximately 6 10 108 m3 under the optimized irrigation scheme which achieved the target value of 6 05 108 m3 but reduced the yield by approximately 50 in addition the agriculture department of hebei province and hebei provincial department of finance 2016 set a goal of 5 31 108 m3 for deep groundwater savings adopting the optimized irrigation scheme with the threshold of 55 could accomplish that goal with a loss in yield of 46 just by reducing the irrigation quota the water resource subregion is the basic unit for water resource assessment ren et al 2007 and the effect of the optimized irrigation scheme on reducing deep groundwater exploitation was further evaluated at this level the study area is related to seven water resource subregions the plain downstream of the beisi river basin bshp the diandong plain of the daqing river basin ddp the dianxi plain of the daqing river basin dxp the heilonggang yundong plain hlgp the tuhai and majia rivers plain thmjhp the plain of the zhangwei river basin zwhp and the plain of the ziya river basin zyhp which occupied approximately 3 0 21 1 5 7 54 6 1 0 3 7 and 10 9 of the study area respectively the reductions in deep groundwater exploitation under the optimized irrigation scheme in these subregions are shown in fig 11 and the maximum values were 0 047 108 1 554 108 0 207 108 3 634 108 0 060 108 0 264 108 and 1 381 108 m3 in bshp ddp dxp hlgp thmjhp zwhp and zyhp respectively for the convenience of quantitative evaluation the cire index was defined as the ratio of the reduction in deep groundwater exploitation under the optimized irrigation scheme to the amount of exploited deep groundwater a higher value of cire indicates a greater contribution to the reduction in deep groundwater exploitation via the implementation of the optimized irrigation scheme for winter wheat the cire value was less than 0 30 in bshp and ddp under all the optimized irrigation schemes fig 11 because the use of deep groundwater for industry and living purposes is more prevalent than the use of deep groundwater for irrigation in these two subregions zhang and li 2005 the maximum cire was estimated to be within 0 40 0 50 in dxp and hlgp fig 11 indicating that approximately half of the deep groundwater exploitation could be reduced by adopting the optimization scheme with the threshold of 70 in the two subregions a high contribution to deep groundwater exploitation reduction was achieved in zwhp and zyhp with a maximum value of cire within the range from 0 50 to 0 60 and a higher contribution to this reduction was also achieved in thmjhp with a maximum cire of 0 82 fig 11 in general the cire value in each county increased with increasing winter wheat yield reduction thresholds the spatial variability of cire was slight with ranges of 0 0 4 when the threshold was no greater than 30 but it gradually increased when the threshold was greater than 30 fig 12 the counties with high cire values were mainly distributed in the middle and south of the study area fig 12 this distribution indicated that optimized irrigation schemes had the power to reduce deep groundwater exploitation in these counties which mainly occurred via the relatively high reduction in the irrigation quota under the optimized irrigation scheme or the high proportion of agricultural irrigation water consumption supplied by deep groundwater in these counties for the counties with lower cire deep groundwater overexploitation could be further alleviated by reducing the planting area of winter wheat e g fallow and planting structure adjustment or using alternative water sources for industrial and domestic consumption the optimized irrigation schemes under the constraint of 14 winter wheat yield reduction thresholds in each simulation unit are shown in fig 7a n the variations of winter wheat yield under these optimized irrigation schemes in each county compared with the current irrigation schedule are shown in fig 9a n and the cire values under these optimized irrigation schemes in each county are shown in fig 12a n these three figures provide alternative and quantitative results about the tradeoffs between groundwater exploitation and crop production for decision makers at the manageable county scale these results may specifically answer the following series of questions how can limited irrigation be implemented for winter wheat adapted to local conditions to what extent can such limited irrigation influence winter wheat yield to what extent can such limited irrigation contribute to reducing deep groundwater exploitation obviously following the framework of simulation optimization evaluation quantitative answers to these above questions would have to be obtained to meet the demands of current agricultural water management and decision making 4 conclusions in this study simulations and analyses of 11 limited irrigation scenarios for winter wheat were conducted using the distributed swap wofost model which was calibrated and validated in detail in the companion paper then the distributions and dynamics of the recommended irrigation timing under different irrigation frequencies were obtained to maximize the yield or wp of winter wheat furthermore the irrigation scheme for winter wheat with minimum evapotranspiration was separately optimized under the constraint of 14 yield reduction thresholds finally the influences of the optimized irrigation scheme on the irrigation quota evapotranspiration yield and wp of winter wheat were assessed meanwhile the effects on water savings and deep groundwater exploitation reduction were evaluated the main conclusions are as follows 1 regarding the specific irrigation frequency the recommended irrigation timing could generally maximize yield and wp simultaneously and irrigation applications were mainly recommended at the pre sowing booting to anthesis and early grain filling stages for three irrigations at the pre sowing and booting to anthesis stages for two irrigations and at the booting to anthesis stage for one irrigation 2 when the winter wheat yield variations ranged from approximately 2 to approximately 21 the average wp of winter wheat under the optimized irrigation scheme ranged from 1 14 kg m 3 to 1 19 kg m 3 thus saving water and stabilizing wp compared with the current irrigation schedule 3 with an increase in winter wheat yield reduction from 4 to 61 the reduction in the amount of deep groundwater exploitation under the optimized irrigation scheme increased from approximately 1 40 108 m3 to 7 15 108 m3 compared with the current irrigation schedule the optimized irrigation scheme with the threshold of 60 reduced deep groundwater exploitation by 6 10 108 m3 thus achieving the goal of a 6 05 108 m3 reduction but resulting in a loss of 50 in yield at this time the optimized irrigation scheme for winter wheat was mainly two irrigation applications at the pre sowing and early grain filling stages in the north and south of the study area and one irrigation application at the booting to anthesis stage or the early grain filling stage in the central study area 4 in the seven involved water resource subregions the highest reduction in the amount of deep groundwater exploitation under the optimized irrigation scheme was in hlgp compared with the current irrigation schedule the cire values showed that the contributions of implementing the optimized irrigation scheme to reducing the current deep groundwater exploitation were relatively higher in thmjhp zyhp and zwhp than the other related water resource subregions furthermore following the framework of simulation optimization evaluation three results at the county level namely the distribution of the optimized irrigation scheme under the constraints of 14 thresholds the variation in the winter wheat yield under the optimized irrigation scheme compared with the current irrigation schedule and the cire values were reported these results provide a quantitative reference about the tradeoffs between groundwater and winter wheat production at a manageable scale to achieve the target of reducing deep groundwater exploitation by adopting a limited irrigation scheme according to local conditions this

6462,the east central north china plain ncp is a globally representative area that presents a sharp contradiction between deep groundwater exploitation and grain production evaluating the effects of limited irrigation on crop water productivity wp and deep groundwater exploitation reduction in this area is important for developing sustainable agricultural practices in this study the 11 limited irrigation scenarios were simulated and analyzed using the distributed soil water atmosphere plant world food study swap wofost model that was established calibrated and validated in a companion paper the recommended irrigation timing for maximizing the yield or wp of winter wheat was selected the irrigation scheme for minimizing evapotranspiration constrained by 14 winter wheat yield reduction thresholds was optimized separately and further the effects of the optimized irrigation scheme on saving water and reducing deep groundwater exploitation were evaluated the results showed that the recommended irrigation timing was predominantly in the pre sowing booting to anthesis and early grain filling stages for three irrigations the pre sowing and booting to anthesis stages for two irrigations and the booting to anthesis stage for one irrigation adopting the optimized irrigation scheme with the threshold of 60 could achieve the goal of reducing deep groundwater exploitation by 6 05 108 m3 but reduced winter wheat yield by approximately 50 the contribution index of reducing exploitation cire was defined to identify the contribution of implementing the optimized irrigation scheme to reducing current deep groundwater exploitation at the related water resource subregional level the cire values showed that this contribution was relatively higher in the related tuhai and majia rivers plain thmjhp the related plain of the zhangwei river basin zwhp and the related plain of the ziya river basin zyhp following the framework of simulation optimization evaluation the three results at the manageable county level namely the optimized irrigation scheme under the constraint of 14 thresholds the crop yield variation compared with the current irrigation schedule and the cire

north china plain ncp is a major grain producing region in china liu and wei 1989 liu et al 2001 zhang et al 2013 that produces on average approximately 53 of the nation s wheat triticum aestivum l

heilonggang region agricultural irrigation in recent decades has mainly depended on deep groundwater due to the lack of surface water and the wide distribution of brackish or saline shallow groundwater foster et al 2004 shi et al 2011 huang et al 2015 consequently the capability of deep groundwater to maintain sustainable agricultural development in this region has been seriously challenged and a series of environmental and geological problems e g a fairly continuous decline in the deep groundwater level deep groundwater depression cones land subsidence and groundwater quality deterioration continue to grow chen 1999 zhang and li 2005 zhang et al 2009b zheng et al 2010 shi et al 2011 in response to the increasingly severe deep groundwater security crisis the chinese government has successively released a range of policies over the past four years on reducing deep groundwater exploitation in this region the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2015 the central people s government of the people s republic of china 2015 2017 precipitation during the growing season of winter wheat which is the major crop in this region cannot meet the water requirement and a water deficit of approximately 300 mm is observed collaborative group for water demand contour map of major crop in china 1993 zhang et al 2004 therefore deep groundwater irrigation plays an important role in meeting water demands for the growth and development of this crop liu et al 2001 qiu 2010 zhang et al 2004 under these circumstances tradeoffs need to be made between reducing deep groundwater abstraction and maintaining winter wheat production in this representative region this study is important not only for meeting current agricultural water management demands but also for providing a reference for similar areas worldwide where deep groundwater is exploited for irrigation this study has international significance and is a hot spot of interdisciplinary hydrology to mitigate the contradiction between water scarcity and winter wheat production in the study area a number of field experiments have been conducted to analyze the responses of growth development yield water consumption and water use efficiency to different irrigation frequency and timing schedules for winter wheat at experimental stations in this area and adjacent areas zhang et al 1999 2009a 2011 2013 xue et al 2010 wu and wang 2010 xu et al 2016 2018 cao et al 2016 however these field experiments rarely focus on the impacts of limited irrigation for winter wheat on the yield and water productivity wp of the succeeding summer maize additionally the generalization of these site and year specific experimental results to the entire region seems somewhat unfeasible due to the spatial variations in different agro hydrological conditions e g meteorology soils crops and irrigation furthermore carrying out field experiments with multiple limited irrigation schemes simultaneously is impractical at a regional scale therefore the distributed agro hydrological model may prove to be a unique and operational tool to assess the effects of various limited irrigation schemes on crop yields wps and water balance components at a regional scale the soil water atmosphere plant swap model and its embedded detailed crop module which is derived from

2006a b van dam et al 2006 noory et al 2011 xue and ren 2017 in a companion paper the established distributed swap wofost model in the study area was calibrated and validated in detail using abundant observed experimental data statistical data remote sensing data and data presented in the relevant literature this prior work has laid a solid foundation for analyses of various limited irrigation scenarios in this paper few studies have focused on analyzing the temporal and spatial variations in the yield wp and water balance of crops under various limited irrigation scenarios by a distributed agro hydrological model and further evaluating the effect of the optimized irrigation scheme on reducing deep groundwater exploitation in the heilonggang region based on the tradeoffs between water and food therefore the objectives of this study are to 1 analyze the variations in the yield wp and seasonal water balance components of winter wheat and summer maize under 11 designed limited irrigation scenarios 2 select the recommended irrigation timing for winter wheat with maximum yield or maximum wp under different irrigation frequencies 3 optimize the irrigation scheme for winter wheat with minimum evapotranspiration under the constraint of 14 yield reduction thresholds 4 assess the impacts of the optimized irrigation scheme on the yield irrigation quota evapotranspiration and

levels 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the heilonggang region is the main area in hebei province with limited deep groundwater exploitation to mitigate the spiraling trend in deep groundwater depletion fig 1 a this region which covers an area of approximately 40 000 km2 is composed of 53 counties belonging to six cities fig 1b the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system is the most predominant planting pattern in this region wang 2011 the heilonggang climate is monsoonal semi arid and semi humid the average precipitation levels during the growing seasons of winter wheat from mid october to early june next year and summer maize from mid june to early october from 1993 to 2012 were 119 0 mm and 379 5 mm respectively which accounted for approximately 23 9 and 76 1 of the annual average precipitation respectively according to the results of precipitation exceedance probability pep analysis which was calculated using the precipitation data from 1975 to 2012 the number of winter wheat seasons during the simulation period 1993 2012 with a pep less than or equal to 25 wet year larger than 25 and less than 75 normal year larger than or equal to 75 and less than 95 dry year and larger than or equal to 95 drier year was 3 12 4 and 1 respectively fig 2 a additionally the number of summer maize seasons with wet normal dry and drier years was 4 11 3 and 2 respectively fig 2b the water requirement amounts of winter wheat and summer maize were estimated to be approximately 476 0 mm and 338 9 mm respectively in this region collaborative group for water demand contour map of major crop in china 1993 consequently the water deficits of the two crops especially winter wheat are heavily dependent on irrigation wang 2011 loam and sandy loam are the main soil textures of the topsoil 0 30 cm representing more than 80 of all topsoil in the region and clay loam sandy loam and loam dominate the subsoil 30 200 cm representing more than 90 of all subsoil shi et al 2004 2010 the average available water capacity awc of the 0 200 cm soil in the study area is approximately 240 7 mm with a range from 222 mm to 249 mm shi et al 2004 2010 the total water consumption in the study area was 57 08 108 m3 in 1999 with 7 9 consumed by industrial use 81 7 consumed by agricultural use and 10 4 consumed by domestic use national groundwater resource assessment project office 2004 water consumption in the study area relies not only on surface water which meets 14 6 of the water consumption demand but also on groundwater which meets 85 4 of the demand national groundwater resource assessment project office 2004 2 2 settings of the limited irrigation scenario for winter wheat the study area was divided into three irrigation zones i e zones i ii and iii in the companion paper based on spatial differences in the current irrigation conditions thus limited irrigation scenarios were set separately for each zone in zone i under the current irrigation schedule irrigations were applied at four key growth stages i e pre sowing raising to jointing booting to anthesis and early grain filling of winter wheat in most years wang 2004 jia and guo 2009 hence the irrigation frequencies under limited irrigation were successively set to three two one and zero irrigation before sowing plays an important role in saving water and achieving a high yield for winter wheat in the study area wang 2004 li et al 2005 thus when the irrigation frequency was three or two pre sowing irrigation was guaranteed and the water deficit was applied in the other one or two stages resulting in scenarios 1 6 table 1 the application of one irrigation scheme in each of the four key stages was defined as scenarios 7 10 and scenario 11 had no irrigation table 1 in addition the irrigation amount under the limited irrigation scenarios was consistent with the current irrigation schedule when the winter wheat was irrigated under scenarios 1 10 the irrigation schedule for summer maize was identical to the current situation and summer maize was not irrigated when the winter wheat was rain fed under scenario 11 in zone ii three irrigations were applied at the pre sowing raising to jointing and booting to anthesis stages in most years under the current irrigation schedule thus scenarios 4 11 can be called the limited irrigation scenarios in zone iii one irrigation was applied at the raising to jointing stage in normal dry and drier years under the current irrigation schedule hence only scenario 11 can be called the limited irrigation scenario in zones ii and iii deficit irrigation was implemented due to poor irrigation conditions wang 2011 some measures made it possible to improve current irrigation management in these two zones the people s government of hebei province 2008 zhang et al 2009b therefore simulations of the 11 limited irrigation scenarios table 1 were performed in zones ii and iii for the convenience of a unified simulation and calculation however the impacts of the limited irrigation scenarios on the yield and wp of winter wheat and summer maize were assessed separately in the three zones 2 3 selection of recommended irrigation timing the irrigation frequency of the 11 limited irrigation scenarios for winter wheat ranged from zero to three there were scenarios with the same irrigation frequency but different irrigation timing this study aimed to a provide quantitative analysis of tradeoffs between deep groundwater conservation and winter wheat yield meanwhile wp provides a useful framework for analyzing crop production increases or water savings in irrigated agriculture van dam et al 2006 and is defined as the ratio of crop yield to seasonal water use referred to the evapotranspiration in this study singh et al 2006a b for a specific irrigation frequency the scenario with the maximum yield or maximum wp of winter wheat was selected the irrigation timing of the selected scenario was defined as the recommended irrigation timing the steps for obtaining the spatial distribution and dynamics of the scenario with the maximum yield or maximum wp of winter wheat when the irrigation frequency was three were as follows 1 on each of the 2809 simulation units the scenario was selected from scenarios 1 2 and 3 to maximize the average winter wheat yield during the simulation period 1993 2012 thus producing the spatial distribution of the scenario with the maximum yield 2 the scenario in which the winter wheat yield was maximum was selected from scenarios 1 2 and 3 in each simulation unit in each year from 1993 to 2012 and then the proportions of the distribution areas in the total area of scenarios 1 2 and 3 for each year were calculated which resulted in the dynamics of the scenario with the maximum yield and 3 repeat the above two steps with the winter wheat wp to obtain the spatial distribution and dynamics of the scenario with the maximum wp these three steps were performed for scenarios 4 5 and 6 when the irrigation frequency was two and for scenarios 7 8 9 and 10 when the irrigation frequency was one 2 4 establishment of the single objective integer linear programming model protection of deep groundwater from further deterioration has been the priority in the study area while winter wheat production has a key role in ensuring grain security a combination of the simulation results using the distributed swap wofost model and the classic integer linear programming ilp model provided a method of optimizing the irrigation scheme for winter wheat the optimization aimed to save water with an acceptable yield reduction in detail for each simulation unit the objective function of the ilp model was to find the minimum average evapotranspiration of winter wheat during the simulation period min z under the constraint of a specific winter wheat yield reduction the ilp model was solved for the 2809 simulation units which resulted in the distribution of the optimized irrigation scheme the 0 1 linear programming approach a special form of the ilp was applied in this study details about the ilp model are as follows 1 objective function min z i 0 11 p i x i 2 constraints s t i 0 11 y i x i b i 0 1 11 x i 0 or 1 i 0 1 11 where pi is the average evapotranspiration of winter wheat during the simulation period in response to the irrigation scheme of i mm xi is the decision variable which can only be zero or one where a value of one indicates that the irrigation scheme of i was selected and a value of zero indicates the opposite i represents the irrigation scheme where a value of zero indicates the current irrigation schedule and values of one to 11 indicate the limited irrigation scenarios of i yi is the average winter wheat yield reduction during the simulation period compared with the current irrigation schedule in response to the irrigation scheme of i and b is the constraint threshold of the winter wheat yield reduction after analyzing the winter wheat yield under the 11 scenarios 14 winter wheat yield reductions i e 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 and 70 were applied successively as the constraint threshold in the ilp model to ensure that the optimized irrigation scheme included the irrigation frequencies of three two one and zero this method not only fully exploited the simulation results for optimization but also provided more choices for decision makers for each threshold ilp was performed on the 2809 simulation units in sequence vba language programming was used to solve in batch the ilp 39 326 times 2809 simulation units under 14 thresholds 2 5 evaluating the effects of the optimized irrigation scheme on saving water and reducing deep groundwater exploitation first compared with the current irrigation schedule the reductions in the irrigation quota and evapotranspiration of winter wheat under the optimized irrigation scheme at the simulation unit level were calculated second these reductions were aggregated from the 2809 simulation units to the 53 counties using the area weighted average finally these reductions were converted from millimeters to cubic meters by multiplying the average winter wheat planting area in 1994 2012 in each county general office of people s government of hebei province and hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1995 2013 the water consumption for agricultural irrigation is mainly satisfied by groundwater especially deep groundwater and complemented by surface water in the study area national groundwater resource assessment project office 2004 zhang and li 2005 wang 2011 an estimation of the reduction in the amount of deep groundwater exploitation under the optimized irrigation scheme is needed to determine what proportion of agricultural irrigation water consumption was supplied by deep groundwater in each county on average during the simulation period this proportion p in each county was estimated as follows 1 the agricultural water consumption amount in 1999 was calculated by adding up the amounts of surface water and groundwater used in agriculture national groundwater resource assessment project office 2004 2 the amount of agricultural water consumption supplied by deep groundwater in 1999 was estimated using the investigation data national groundwater resource assessment project office 2004 a shallow groundwater salinity map zhang and fei 2009 and relevant studies chen 1999 zhang and li 2005 zhang et al 2009b 3 the proportion of agricultural water consumption supplied by deep groundwater in 1999 p1 was estimated 4 the value of p1 was assumed to be the proportion of agricultural irrigation water consumption supplied by deep groundwater in 1999 p2 because more than 94 of agricultural water consumption was for agricultural irrigation water resources department of hebei province 2005 2012 and 5 the value of p2 was approximated as the value of p because deep groundwater abstraction was relatively stable from 2000 to 2012 in the study area water resources department of hebei province 2000 2012 national groundwater resource assessment project office 2004 zhang and li 2005 zhang et al 2009b the reduction in the amount of deep groundwater exploitation under the optimized irrigation scheme was estimated using the value of p at the county level and was further upscaled to the water resource subregional level using the area weighted average an index namely the contribution index of reducing exploitation cire was defined to evaluate the contribution of the optimized winter wheat irrigation scheme to reducing deep groundwater exploitation at the specific levels and it is described as follows 3 cire rde de where rde is the reduction in the amount of deep groundwater exploitation under the optimized irrigation scheme compared with the current irrigation schedule 108 m3 and de is the amount of exploited deep groundwater 108 m3 the de values at the county level were investigated for 1999 and derived from the national groundwater resource assessment project office 2004 additionally the de values at the water resource subregional level were investigated for 2005 and they were from ren et al 2007 the detailed overall flow chart of this study is shown in fig 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 limited irrigation scenarios 3 1 1 crop yield when the irrigation frequency of winter wheat was three mean of scenarios 1 2 and 3 two mean of scenarios 4 5 and 6 one mean of scenarios 7 8 9 and 10 and zero scenario 11 the average winter wheat yield during the simulation period in zone i was 3785 4 kg hm 2 2396 7 kg hm 2 1505 9 kg hm 2 and 674 8 kg hm 2 respectively table 2 and the corresponding yields were 4239 1 kg hm 2 2776 5 kg hm 2 1947 0 kg hm 2 and 1084 3 kg hm 2 in zone ii respectively and 4185 9 kg hm 2 2840 7 kg hm 2 2086 1 kg hm 2 and 1242 6 kg hm 2 in zone iii respectively table 2 these results showed that the average winter wheat yield decreased with decreasing irrigation frequency in the three zones notably the maximum difference in the average winter wheat yield among the scenarios with the same irrigation frequency reached 1413 8 kg hm 2 between scenarios 4 and 5 1913 7 kg hm 2 between scenarios 4 and 6 and 1758 5 kg hm 2 between scenarios 4 and 6 in zones i ii and iii respectively due to different irrigation timing table 2 with an unchanged irrigation schedule for summer maize under scenarios 1 10 the average summer maize yield during the simulation period in the three zones table 2 showed that the delay in the irrigation timing of winter wheat after the regreening stage with a specific irrigation frequency led to a higher summer maize yield this result could be explained by the fact that summer maize was irrigated one or two times only when the peps were no less than 75 under the generalized current irrigation schedule that is the summer maize was rain fed in most years therefore postponing the irrigation of winter wheat resulted in a higher soil water content during the summer maize vegetative stage which could help increase the leaf area index lai and thus increase yield the maximum differences in the average summer maize yield in zones i ii and iii were 994 4 kg hm 2 between scenarios 1 and 3 988 8 kg hm 2 between scenarios 1 and 3 and 1092 0 kg hm 2 between scenarios 1 and 3 respectively table 2 these results indicate that the appropriate irrigation timing of winter wheat under limited irrigation was critical to ensuring the yield of the two crops under different limited irrigation scenarios especially scenario 11 the average winter wheat yield was relatively high in 1995 1997 1998 2004 and 2008 and low in 1993 2000 2002 and 2006 fig 4 a 1 thus showing that the winter wheat yield was related to seasonal precipitation fig 2a the precipitation during the summer maize growing season fig 2b had a significant impact on yield fig s1a 1 mainly because the water requirements of summer maize could be met by the precipitation in most years the reductions in the average yields of winter wheat and summer maize in each county under the 11 limited irrigation scenarios compared with the current irrigation schedule are shown in figs 4a 2 and s1a 2 respectively 3 1 2 wp the average wp values of winter wheat were 1 03 kg m 3 0 78 kg m 3 0 60 kg m 3 and 0 34 kg m 3 in zone i when the irrigation frequencies of winter wheat were three two one and zero respectively table 2 the average wp values were 1 03 kg m 3 0 80 kg m 3 0 69 kg m 3 and 0 48 kg m 3 in zone ii and were 0 97 kg m 3 0 77 kg m 3 0 69 kg m 3 and 0 51 kg m 3 in zone iii when the irrigation frequencies were three two one and zero respectively table 2 these results showed that the wp of winter wheat also decreased with decreasing irrigation frequency notably the wp of winter wheat was also significantly influenced by irrigation timing the maximum differences in the average wp values of winter wheat were 0 48 kg m 3 between scenarios 4 and 5 0 60 kg m 3 between scenarios 4 and 6 and 0 54 kg m 3 between scenarios 4 and 6 among the scenarios with the same irrigation frequency but different irrigation timing in zones i ii and iii respectively table 2 there was also a difference in the wp of summer maize due to differences in the irrigation timing of winter wheat and the maximal differences were 0 19 kg m 3 between scenarios 1 and 3 or between scenarios 8 and 10 in zone i 0 20 kg m 3 between scenarios 1 and 3 in zone ii and 0 22 kg m 3 between scenarios 8 and 10 in zone iii table 2 the interannual variabilities in the average wp of both winter wheat fig 4b 1 and summer maize fig s1b 1 were influenced by the seasonal precipitation fig 2 the reductions in the average wps of winter wheat and summer maize in each county under the 11 limited irrigation scenarios compared with the current irrigation schedule are shown in fig 4b 2 and fig s1b 2 respectively as a result the irrigation frequency of winter wheat had significant impacts on the yield and wp of winter wheat and the succeeding summer maize additionally the irrigation timing of winter wheat obviously affected the yield and wp of the two crops therefore the irrigation timing should be selected to maximize yield and wp 3 1 3 water balance components in a companion paper the study area was roughly divided into two zones with different bottom boundary conditions the bottom boundary conditions were free drainage of the 2 m soil profile in zone a and zero flux of the 15 m soil profile in zone b therefore the water balance components were analyzed separately in the two zones for the current irrigation three irrigation mean of scenarios 1 2 and 3 two irrigation mean of scenarios 4 5 and 6 one irrigation mean of scenarios 7 8 9 and 10 and rain fed scenarios 11 schemes the average irrigation quotas of winter wheat were 286 4 mm 225 0 mm 150 0 mm 75 0 mm and 0 mm in zone a respectively fig 5 a and 181 6 mm 225 0 mm 150 0 mm 75 0 mm and 0 mm in zone b respectively fig 5b and the average interception amounts under these five irrigation schemes were 7 6 mm 6 9 mm 6 1 mm 4 3 mm and 3 2 mm in zone a respectively which accounted for 1 4 2 2 of the outflow the sum of the interception transpiration evaporation and bottom flux fig 5a and 8 5 mm 8 9 mm 7 9 mm 5 7 mm and 4 3 mm in zone b respectively which accounted for 1 6 2 6 of the outflow the sum of the interception transpiration and evaporation fig 5b these results showed that interception represented a very small proportion of the outflow and the reduction in the irrigation quota led to a slight decrease in interception because the increasing water stress resulting from irrigation quota reduction accelerated the process of leaf senescence kroes et al 2009 and further decreased the average lai meanwhile interception decreased with decreasing lai kroes et al 2009 and it was affected not only by the irrigation quota but also by the irrigation timing for the current irrigation three irrigation two irrigation one irrigation and rain fed schemes the average transpiration amounts during the winter wheat growing season were 320 6 mm 273 8 mm 219 0 mm 161 4 mm and 109 4 mm in zone a respectively and 307 8 mm 333 8 mm 272 6 mm 209 8 mm and 153 0 mm in zone b respectively the average proportion of transpiration to the outflow decreased from 73 5 to 61 3 in zone a fig 5a and from 79 6 to 71 3 in zone b fig 5b indicating that transpiration was the most dominant consumption sector both transpiration and the proportion of transpiration to the outflow decreased as a result of the decreased irrigation quota because stomatal regulation prevents dehydration and death water stress may reduce transpiration wu 2008 under the same scenario the average transpiration in zone b was higher than that in zone a which was mainly due to the capillary rise of shallow groundwater to alleviate water stress in zone b under the scenarios with the same irrigation quota earlier irrigation timing from the raising to maturity stage of winter wheat resulted in more transpiration the average winter wheat evaporation amounts under the five irrigation schemes current irrigation three irrigation two irrigation one irrigation and rain fed were 91 9 mm 87 8 mm 81 4 mm 70 7 mm and 60 5 mm in zone a respectively and 76 3 mm 80 5 mm 75 3 mm 66 7 mm and 57 2 mm in zone b respectively the proportion of evaporation to the outflow increased from 21 1 to 33 9 in zone a fig 5a and from 18 2 to 26 7 in zone b fig 5b the reduction in irrigation frequency could decrease the soil water content further decreasing both the hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradient and thereby decreasing the evaporation rate hillel 1971 however with a reduction in the irrigation quota the proportion of evaporation to the outflow increased because the decrement of evaporation was less than that of outflow the bottom flux was analyzed in only zone a because this flux equaled zero in zone b the average bottom flux leakage values were 16 0 mm 14 8 mm 13 3 mm 8 0 mm and 5 3 mm under the current irrigation three irrigation two irrigation one irrigation and rain fed schemes respectively the results showed that the decreased irrigation quota led to a slight reduction in leakage the bottom flux accounted for less than 5 of the outflow fig 5a indicating that there was a poor potential to improve soil water use efficiency by reducing leakage which could be explained by the fact that precipitation and irrigation were largely consumed by transpiration and evaporation the average amounts of soil water storage change under these five irrigation schemes current irrigation three irrigation two irrigation one irrigation and rain fed were 33 7 mm 42 3 mm 53 7 mm 53 4 mm and 62 4 mm in zone a respectively fig 5a and 91 7 mm 78 9 mm 86 5 mm 87 9 mm and 95 2 mm in zone b respectively fig 5b these results showed that the change in soil water storage during the winter wheat growing season was caused by consumption and the need for water for growth could be compensated by an increase in soil water use despite the decrease in irrigation quota the average irrigation quota of summer maize under scenarios 1 10 was 23 7 mm in zone a and 7 3 mm in zone b the summer maize was rain fed scenario 11 in zones a and b however differences were observed in the soil water balance components during the summer maize growing season in zones a and b just because of differences in the irrigation frequencies and timings of winter wheat scenarios 1 10 specifically the average interception transpiration evaporation bottom flux and soil water storage change ranges of summer maize in zone a were 10 8 13 7 mm 226 0 265 3 mm 69 1 75 9 mm 8 2 16 2 mm and 16 6 59 0 mm respectively fig s2a and the average interception transpiration evaporation and soil water storage change ranges of summer maize in zone b were 12 1 15 3 mm 237 0 277 5 mm 71 4 78 9 mm and 36 5 72 7 mm respectively fig s2b under the scenarios with the same winter wheat irrigation frequency with the delay in the irrigation timing for winter wheat after the regreening stage the proportions of interception transpiration and bottom flux to the outflow increased during the summer maize growing season while the proportion of evaporation to the outflow and the increment of soil water storage decreased because the summer maize was rain fed in most years and irrigated one or two times in dry or drier years delaying the irrigation timing of winter wheat resulted in a relatively high soil water content during the summer maize growing season especially in the vegetative stage and might alleviate water stress and increase transpiration soil water consumption and lai thereby increasing interception and decreasing evaporation 3 2 recommended irrigation timing for winter wheat 3 2 1 three irrigations when the irrigation frequency was three scenarios 1 2 and 3 the dominant scenario which resulted in the maximum average winter wheat yield during the simulation period was scenario 3 although scenario 1 resulted in the maximum yield in a few parts of the north and south of the study area fig 6 a 1 left the right side panel in fig 6a 1 shows the dynamics of the scenario with the maximum winter wheat yield the proportion of the study area with the maximum yield was greater than 50 in 1998 1999 2002 2006 and 2009 under scenario 1 and greater than 40 in only 2005 under scenario 2 and dominant values were observed in the other studied years under scenario 3 the average proportions of the study area with the maximum yield under scenarios 1 2 and 3 from 1993 to 2012 were 32 7 and 61 respectively the dominant scenario resulting in the maximum average wp of winter wheat during the simulation period was also scenario 3 fig 6b 1 left the spatial distribution fig 6b 1 left and dynamics fig 6b 1 right of the scenario producing the maximum wp were similar to those for the maximum yield the average proportions of the study area with the maximum wp under scenarios 1 2 and 3 were 18 5 and 77 respectively thus for the three irrigations the scenario with the maximum yield or maximum wp of winter wheat tended to be scenario 3 irrigations applied at the pre sowing booting to anthesis and early grain filling stages followed by scenario 1 irrigations applied at the pre sowing raising to jointing and booting to anthesis stages and scenario 2 irrigations applied at the pre sowing raising to jointing and early grain filling stages the recommended irrigation timing led to the highest relative transpiration value reflects the degrees of water stress in the reproductive growth stage of winter wheat and then maximized the yield or wp because the well timed irrigation combined with precipitation led to more suitable soil water content to meet the water requirement of winter wheat growth field experimental results in the study area showed that relatively high yields and high wps of winter wheat were obtained via the application of two irrigations at the jointing and anthesis stages li et al 2005 zhang et al 2009a 2011 at the jointing and heading stages wu and wang 2010 or at the jointing and early grain filling stages cao et al 2016 in combination with sufficient soil water content at the pre sowing stage these site specific results indicated that the recommended irrigation timing is reasonable notably the irrigation date at a specific stage is determined by the water requirements and real time soil water contents in field management meanwhile additional detailed information about the irrigation dates under each limited irrigation scenario in each year of the simulation period was not available hence the irrigation date at a specific stage remained unchanged under each scenario which might result in the difference in our recommended irrigation timing from that in the studies cited above this difference suggests that the irrigation date at a specific stage should be properly delayed with decreasing irrigation frequency to maximize the yield and wp of winter wheat 3 2 2 two irrigations when the irrigation frequency was two scenarios 4 5 and 6 the scenario with the maximum average winter wheat yield during the simulation period was mainly scenario 5 although scenario 6 yielded the maximum values in parts of cangzhou and xingtai cities fig 6a 2 left the proportion of the study area with the maximum winter wheat yield was greater than 50 in only 2002 under scenario 4 and greater than 50 in 1993 1997 2003 and 2010 under scenario 6 and dominant values were observed in the other years under scenario 5 fig 6a 2 right regarding the spatial distribution fig 6b 2 left and dynamics fig 6b 2 right of the scenario with the maximum wp the results were similar to those for the maximum yield the average proportions of the study area with the maximum yield under scenarios 4 5 and 6 were 7 67 and 26 respectively the corresponding proportions of the study area with the maximum wp under the three scenarios were 4 65 and 31 thus scenario 5 irrigations applied at the pre sowing and booting to anthesis stages was the most widely distributed scenario with the maximum yield or maximum wp when the winter wheat was irrigated two times followed by scenario 6 irrigations applied at the pre sowing and early grain filling stages and scenario 4 irrigations applied at the pre sowing and raising to jointing stages the booting stage of wheat is most sensitive to water stress followed by the anthesis stage jia and guo 2009 the sensitivity of winter wheat growth stages to water deficits can be ordered from the most to least sensitive in the following sequence heading to grain filling jointing to heading grain filling to maturity regreening to jointing sowing to freezing and freezing to regreening collaborative group for water demand contour map of major crop in china 1993 the winter wheat was more sensitive to water stress at the booting to heading and heading to grain filling stages in the ncp zhang et al 1999 in summary the booting to anthesis stage that is sensitive to water stress represents the crucial irrigation time point which is essentially in agreement with our result the experimental results li et al 2005 xue et al 2010 xu et al 2016 showed that the maximum yield and maximum wp were obtained when the winter wheat was irrigated at the pre sowing and jointing or heading stages these previous studies have demonstrated the rationality of our recommended irrigation timing to some extent and the difference between these and our studies might be attributed to the use of a uniform irrigation date setting in the simulation 3 2 3 one irrigation when the irrigation frequency was one scenarios 7 8 9 and 10 scenario 9 predominantly produced the maximum average winter wheat yield during the simulation period although scenario 10 produced the maximum yield in part of cangzhou city fig 6a 3 left the proportion of the study area with the maximum yield was greater than 40 in 1998 1999 2002 and 2003 under scenario 8 greater than 50 in only 1997 and 2010 under scenario 10 and greater than 40 in the other years under scenario 9 fig 6a 3 right the average proportions of the study area with the maximum yield under scenarios 7 8 9 and 10 were 7 22 54 and 17 respectively moreover the average proportions of the study area with the maximum wp under scenarios 7 8 9 and 10 were 5 19 53 and 23 respectively fig 6b 3 right the most recommended irrigation timing was the booting to anthesis stage scenario 9 to maximize yield and wp followed by the early grain filling stage scenario 10 the raising to jointing stage scenario 8 and the pre sowing stage scenario 7 when the winter wheat was irrigated once the highest sensitivity to water stress occurred in the booting and anthesis stages jia and guo 2009 which could account for the irrigation timing recommendation 3 3 optimized irrigation schemes fig 7 shows the optimized irrigation schemes for winter wheat with minimum evapotranspiration under the constraint of 14 yield reduction thresholds the dominant irrigation schemes after optimization were current irrigation fig 7a c scenario 3 fig 7d h scenario 5 fig 7i scenario 6 fig 7j l and scenario 10 fig 7m n when the thresholds were 5 15 20 40 45 50 60 and 65 70 respectively furthermore the impacts of the optimized irrigation scheme on the wp yield irrigation quota and evapotranspiration of winter wheat were evaluated from the perspective of agricultural water management the wp fig 8 a and variations in the yield irrigation quota and evapotranspiration fig 8b of winter wheat under the optimized irrigation scheme were aggregated from the simulation unit level to the county level compared with the current irrigation schedule the average yield irrigation quota and evapotranspiration of winter wheat under the optimized irrigation scheme in the study area decreased with increasing winter wheat yield reduction threshold fig 8b when the threshold ranged from 5 to 35 the average variation in winter wheat yield under the optimized irrigation scheme decreased from 2 05 to 20 58 compared with the current irrigation schedule fig 8b the yield variation in each county is shown in fig 9 a g accordingly the average wp under the optimized irrigation scheme ranged from 1 14 to 1 19 kg m 3 with an increase of less than 5 0 compared with the wp under the current irrigation schedule fig 8a because the yield reduction was less than the evapotranspiration reduction moreover the optimized irrigation scheme achieved 2 25 29 80 and 2 49 20 59 reductions in the irrigation quota and evapotranspiration respectively fig 8b in summary the optimized irrigation scheme under these thresholds could achieve water saving and stable water use efficiency goals simultaneously when the threshold ranged from 40 to 70 the average wp under the optimized irrigation scheme had a reduction of less than 30 fig 8a and a loss in yield of 29 36 61 08 fig 8b compared with the current irrigation schedule the yield variation in each county is shown in fig 9h n because of poor current irrigation conditions limited irrigation has been implemented in practice in zones ii and iii thus it had less room to reduce the winter wheat yield further under the optimized irrigation schemes so the yield reduction in these two zones was less than that in zone i fig 9h n accordingly the reductions in the irrigation quota and evapotranspiration changed from 39 04 to 73 52 and from 24 27 to 44 55 respectively fig 8b zhang et al 2016 pointed out that new cultivars improved soil fertility and management practices would increase grain production without much increase in water use xu et al 2016 suggested that the yield loss caused by limited irrigation might be offset by the development of new agricultural technologies or cultivars without considering the compensation effect of cultivars soil fertility improvement and management practices on yield the yield loss under the optimized irrigation scheme might be unacceptable 3 4 effects on water saving and deep groundwater exploitation reduction with an increase in the threshold of winter wheat yield reduction from 5 to 70 the reduction in the average irrigation quota for winter wheat under the corresponding optimized irrigation scheme increased from approximately 0 74 108 m3 to 22 94 108 m3 compared with the current irrigation schedule fig 10 a accordingly the reduction in the average evapotranspiration increased from approximately 1 13 108 m3 to 21 19 108 m3 fig 10a the maximum reductions in the irrigation quota and evapotranspiration value were approximately equivalent to 50 and 45 of the current agricultural irrigation water consumption respectively fig 10a which indicated that implementing the optimized irrigation scheme could help reduce agricultural irrigation water consumption in the study area for the whole region compared with the current irrigation schedule the reduction in the amount of deep groundwater exploitation under the optimized irrigation scheme increased from approximately 0 10 108 m3 to 7 15 108 m3 as the threshold increased from 5 to 70 fig 10b the maximum value of 7 15 108 m3 represented approximately 34 of the estimated deep groundwater exploitation amount 21 29 108 m3 national groundwater resource assessment project office 2004 agriculture department of hebei province et al 2014 the agriculture department of hebei province et al 2014 aims to reduce the groundwater exploitation for agriculture by 7 60 108 m3 with deep groundwater accounting for approximately 6 05 108 m3 of this amount when the reduction threshold was 60 the reduction in the deep groundwater exploitation for winter wheat irrigation was approximately 6 10 108 m3 under the optimized irrigation scheme which achieved the target value of 6 05 108 m3 but reduced the yield by approximately 50 in addition the agriculture department of hebei province and hebei provincial department of finance 2016 set a goal of 5 31 108 m3 for deep groundwater savings adopting the optimized irrigation scheme with the threshold of 55 could accomplish that goal with a loss in yield of 46 just by reducing the irrigation quota the water resource subregion is the basic unit for water resource assessment ren et al 2007 and the effect of the optimized irrigation scheme on reducing deep groundwater exploitation was further evaluated at this level the study area is related to seven water resource subregions the plain downstream of the beisi river basin bshp the diandong plain of the daqing river basin ddp the dianxi plain of the daqing river basin dxp the heilonggang yundong plain hlgp the tuhai and majia rivers plain thmjhp the plain of the zhangwei river basin zwhp and the plain of the ziya river basin zyhp which occupied approximately 3 0 21 1 5 7 54 6 1 0 3 7 and 10 9 of the study area respectively the reductions in deep groundwater exploitation under the optimized irrigation scheme in these subregions are shown in fig 11 and the maximum values were 0 047 108 1 554 108 0 207 108 3 634 108 0 060 108 0 264 108 and 1 381 108 m3 in bshp ddp dxp hlgp thmjhp zwhp and zyhp respectively for the convenience of quantitative evaluation the cire index was defined as the ratio of the reduction in deep groundwater exploitation under the optimized irrigation scheme to the amount of exploited deep groundwater a higher value of cire indicates a greater contribution to the reduction in deep groundwater exploitation via the implementation of the optimized irrigation scheme for winter wheat the cire value was less than 0 30 in bshp and ddp under all the optimized irrigation schemes fig 11 because the use of deep groundwater for industry and living purposes is more prevalent than the use of deep groundwater for irrigation in these two subregions zhang and li 2005 the maximum cire was estimated to be within 0 40 0 50 in dxp and hlgp fig 11 indicating that approximately half of the deep groundwater exploitation could be reduced by adopting the optimization scheme with the threshold of 70 in the two subregions a high contribution to deep groundwater exploitation reduction was achieved in zwhp and zyhp with a maximum value of cire within the range from 0 50 to 0 60 and a higher contribution to this reduction was also achieved in thmjhp with a maximum cire of 0 82 fig 11 in general the cire value in each county increased with increasing winter wheat yield reduction thresholds the spatial variability of cire was slight with ranges of 0 0 4 when the threshold was no greater than 30 but it gradually increased when the threshold was greater than 30 fig 12 the counties with high cire values were mainly distributed in the middle and south of the study area fig 12 this distribution indicated that optimized irrigation schemes had the power to reduce deep groundwater exploitation in these counties which mainly occurred via the relatively high reduction in the irrigation quota under the optimized irrigation scheme or the high proportion of agricultural irrigation water consumption supplied by deep groundwater in these counties for the counties with lower cire deep groundwater overexploitation could be further alleviated by reducing the planting area of winter wheat e g fallow and planting structure adjustment or using alternative water sources for industrial and domestic consumption the optimized irrigation schemes under the constraint of 14 winter wheat yield reduction thresholds in each simulation unit are shown in fig 7a n the variations of winter wheat yield under these optimized irrigation schemes in each county compared with the current irrigation schedule are shown in fig 9a n and the cire values under these optimized irrigation schemes in each county are shown in fig 12a n these three figures provide alternative and quantitative results about the tradeoffs between groundwater exploitation and crop production for decision makers at the manageable county scale these results may specifically answer the following series of questions how can limited irrigation be implemented for winter wheat adapted to local conditions to what extent can such limited irrigation influence winter wheat yield to what extent can such limited irrigation contribute to reducing deep groundwater exploitation obviously following the framework of simulation optimization evaluation quantitative answers to these above questions would have to be obtained to meet the demands of current agricultural water management and decision making 4 conclusions in this study simulations and analyses of 11 limited irrigation scenarios for winter wheat were conducted using the distributed swap wofost model which was calibrated and validated in detail in the companion paper then the distributions and dynamics of the recommended irrigation timing under different irrigation frequencies were obtained to maximize the yield or wp of winter wheat furthermore the irrigation scheme for winter wheat with minimum evapotranspiration was separately optimized under the constraint of 14 yield reduction thresholds finally the influences of the optimized irrigation scheme on the irrigation quota evapotranspiration yield and wp of winter wheat were assessed meanwhile the effects on water savings and deep groundwater exploitation reduction were evaluated the main conclusions are as follows 1 regarding the specific irrigation frequency the recommended irrigation timing could generally maximize yield and wp simultaneously and irrigation applications were mainly recommended at the pre sowing booting to anthesis and early grain filling stages for three irrigations at the pre sowing and booting to anthesis stages for two irrigations and at the booting to anthesis stage for one irrigation 2 when the winter wheat yield variations ranged from approximately 2 to approximately 21 the average wp of winter wheat under the optimized irrigation scheme ranged from 1 14 kg m 3 to 1 19 kg m 3 thus saving water and stabilizing wp compared with the current irrigation schedule 3 with an increase in winter wheat yield reduction from 4 to 61 the reduction in the amount of deep groundwater exploitation under the optimized irrigation scheme increased from approximately 1 40 108 m3 to 7 15 108 m3 compared with the current irrigation schedule the optimized irrigation scheme with the threshold of 60 reduced deep groundwater exploitation by 6 10 108 m3 thus achieving the goal of a 6 05 108 m3 reduction but resulting in a loss of 50 in yield at this time the optimized irrigation scheme for winter wheat was mainly two irrigation applications at the pre sowing and early grain filling stages in the north and south of the study area and one irrigation application at the booting to anthesis stage or the early grain filling stage in the central study area 4 in the seven involved water resource subregions the highest reduction in the amount of deep groundwater exploitation under the optimized irrigation scheme was in hlgp compared with the current irrigation schedule the cire values showed that the contributions of implementing the optimized irrigation scheme to reducing the current deep groundwater exploitation were relatively higher in thmjhp zyhp and zwhp than the other related water resource subregions furthermore following the framework of simulation optimization evaluation three results at the county level namely the distribution of the optimized irrigation scheme under the constraints of 14 thresholds the variation in the winter wheat yield under the optimized irrigation scheme compared with the current irrigation schedule and the cire values were reported these results provide a quantitative reference about the tradeoffs between groundwater and winter wheat production at a manageable scale to achieve the target of reducing deep groundwater exploitation by adopting a limited irrigation scheme according to local conditions this framework provides to some extent a reference for other similar areas with unsustainable deep groundwater exploitation for agricultural irrigation conflict of interest none declared acknowledgements

6463,a fully saturated lens of steady fresh groundwater floating in a homogeneous and isotropic desert sandy aquifer is analytically studied based on a hydrological model by kunin and interface

investigated in bermuda germany holland paraguay and other countries the interface crops out into a well defined surface water body sea river lake or drainage ditch into which a light fresh groundwater discharges terrestrial freshwater lenses tfls in arid or semi arid climates are not in a direct and permanent contact with surface water see fig 2a and d in laattoe et al 2017 fresh floating groundwater lenses hereafter abbreviated as ffgls are a special type of tfls ffgls are subtended by an interface and capped by a phreatic surface recharged from the vadose zone post rain infiltration or ephemeral ponding of topographic depressions filled after occasional runoff is balanced by evaporation from the phreatic surface if it is shallow enough for example hampton 1963 for lenses in oregon estimated evaporation from the phreatic surface of lenses in coastal dunes as 7 in year and pointed out in parts of the area where the water table is shallow and the vegetation is dense the evapotranspiration doubtless is much greater conversely in the barren dune areas and at places where the water table is relatively deep the evapotranspiration probably is considerably less than 7 in per year emikh 1962 analytically studied channel fed tfls in central asia see the corresponding sketch in fig 2b of laattoe et al 2017 for which evaporation was assumed the only factor discharging groundwater from the lens ffgls have been detected and studied in australia kuwait nambia oman uae see e g al weshah and yihdego 2016 cend√≥n et al 2010 kwarteng et al 2000 laattoe et al

groundwater motion inside is much less investigated laattoe et al 2017 in this paper we use the studies of kunin 1959 1 dr vladimir kunin 1906 1976 the corresponding member of the academy of sciences of ussr one of the founders of the institute of deserts city of ashkhabad turkmen academy of sciences of the turkmen soviet socialist republic published extensively on hydrology of deserts see e g kunin 1968 1 in the karakum desert of turkmenistan a large scale water supply from ffgls in central aisa started in the 1960s with the arrive of the soviet oil gas industry to the deserts of this region that required much more fresh water than the local traditional animal husbandry bairamova 2013 reports that pumping from one of the largest tfls in turkmenistan commenced in 1963 with 56 well galleries drilled in 1963 1969 49 of them are being exploited around 40 years a common interface delineating tfls is a 1 g l isoconcentric surface bairamova 2013 emphasizes that the genesis of tfls including ffgls in turkmenistan is still not well understood pumping from tfls of these deserts was compounded with managed aquifer recharge mar through engineered infiltration ponds placed just above the lenses see the photos of the sansyz mar project retrieved from kunin 1959 supplementary file 1 these excavations harnessed the natural occasional runoff and converted it into an intensive infiltration spot analogous to ones shown in fig 2 of stuyfzand and van der schans 2018 for similar lenses in holland without such simply engineered rainwater collectors the desert runoff is either lost to draining channels or gets diffused as a low intensity infiltration to those parts of the desert where the sand moisture redistributes to evaporation i e stable ffgls can not be formed kunin 1959 and schevchenko 1965 depending on topography and desert soil cover distinguished three types of desert tfls viz small sub dune ffgls fig 1 a small ffgls under topographic depressions called takyrs fig 1b and megalenses natural hydraulic gradients of several unconfined aquifers salinity of chloride type saline groundwater is 20 40 g l common in turkmenistan kunin 1959 rogovskaya et al 1986 are adverse to retaining ffgls even if infiltration is sufficient and spatially focused unlike under hydrological conditions of holland ffgls in turkmenistan can not be replenished by diversion of surface fresh water from perennial streams because they do not exist in the desert if a bedrock in fig 1 is not deep enough see also danin 2012 fig 78 and the pristine unconfined saline groundwater is not thick enough then a lens is not ffgl in fig 1b the corresponding lens is demarcated by the contour e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 e 1 a horizontal segment of the bedrock e 4 e 1 subtends this lens it can be stable even without evaporation from the phreatic surface e 2 e 3 provided fresh groundwater seeps through a slightly permeable line e 4 e 1 as in kacimov and obnosov 2015 a deep borehole drilled across ffgl would show the following zonation vadose zone fresh water table fresh groundwater zone interface between fresh and saline water saline groundwater deep bedrock the topographic depressions natural ones or engineered excavations of an appropriate locale sizes and placed above right phreatic saline phreatic surfaces convert a runoff of sufficiently strong rain into ffgls which can be diligently abstracted kunin and leszhinsky 1960 as a prerequisite of existence of ffgl rogovskaya et al 1979 pointed out that too small thicknesses of the vadose zone above the lens lead to dissipation of the ground water by plant uptake with some substantial salt accumulation and an aeration zone of thickness less than 3 m in conjunction with lack of plant cover results in highly saline water due to physical evaporation intelligent mar operations in replenishing the exploited ffgls of turkmenistan in addition to natural recharge incorporated skimming of fresh water by vertical wells collated with a simultaneous pumping of a subjacent saline water of ffgls this pioneering dual pumping controlled the fresh saline water interface such mitigation of upcoming of saline water in ffgls and ensuring their resilience commenced in 1963 prior to many similar projects in the usa or holland see e g singh and stammers 1989 zuurbier et al 2014 the very existence of a stable ffgl is conditioned by the following factors there should be saline brine background water table on which the lenses emerge as hydrogeological buoys that is illustrated in fig 1a f of laattoe et al 2017 the natural gradient of this subjacent background saline groundwater should be small i e away from the lens the water table should be almost flat because otherwise ffgl slips downgradient kunin 1959 and or gets dispersed by the subjacent saline groundwater the thickness of the vadose zone above the phreatic surface of the lens should be appropriate otherwise infiltration and evaporation do not make a favourable source sink hydrodynamic couple similar to one in kacimov et al 2018 juxtaposition of recharge to the water table and losses from it maintains a continuous motion of fresh water within the lens transpiration intensity by natural hydromorphic plants if any on the ground surface above the lens should be bounded both from above and below no transpiration may result in high water table and its salinization too intensive interception of groundwater by the roots may eventually deplete the lens and consequently exterminates the plants natural recharge and mar to and pumping from ffgls for drinking both by humans and livestock are going on in modern turkmenistan babaev 1999 a post kunin review of hydrology hydrogeology climate topography geomorphology soil cover and water consumption in deserts of turkmenistan is reported by babaev 1999 bairamova 2013 fleskens et al 2007 hydrogeology 1972 kolodin 1981 typical concentrations of total dissolved solids tds of fresh and saline groundwater in ffgls are about 1 g l and 20 60 g l respectively kunin 1959 modeled a thin transition zone by a ghijben herzberg interface the field data on the vertical profile of tds in the sansyz ffgl is shown in supplementary file 2 retrieved from kunin 1959 this cross section illustrates that close to point c in our fig 1a the thickness of the transition zone between isoconcentric contours 1 g l and 10 g l is about 1 2 m the maximal thickness of the lens is about 12 m towards point a in our fig 1a the kunin interface is blurred i e the distance between isolines of 1 g l and 10 g l becomes large the thickness of small ffgls can be several tens of centimeters only these mini lenses are tapped by dug wells and fresh water is occasionally and carefully consumed by local nomads the bed of takyrs gets gradually clogged due to mechanical colmatation see the photos of a dry takyr retrieved from kunin 1959 supplementary file 3 in a vertical cross section of ffgl fig 1a the dune is symmetric with respect to a vertical axis oy of cartesian xoy or cylindrical roy coordinate systems a horizontal axis is ox or or respectively this axis coincides with the background level of saline groundwater if no infiltration and no fresh water present the saline water table is a plane the curve b s m s c s in fig 1a is the ground surface contour due to symmetry below only the right half of the dune is considered ffgl is bounded from above by a phreatic surface bmc and from below by an interface ac the separatrix boc in fig 1a is a vertical segment the following questions intrigued arid zone hydrologists in turkmenistan why does a stable ffgl in fig 1a exist and why is it digon shaped why the curve bma is a subdued replica of b s c s the topography of the dune and ac is an amplified ghijben herzbergian replica of bma in other words can one extend the criterion of haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 their eq 8 of topography recharge controlled phreatic surface flows to bma in fig 1a which has a focused infiltration strip disk under a dune or ponded takyr bed unlike the situations of common deep or shallow unconfined aquifers in haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 and their assumption of a constant accretion on the water table ffgls in our fig 1 have a large variation of its fresh water thickness fs ff flow in our fig 1 is a conjugation of flows in figs 1 and 8 of van der veer 1977 i e a source sink boundary condition along a phreatic surface recharge under the crest of the dune and evaporation on the flanks makes the situation different form one in haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 the groundwater systems modeled by haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 and toth 2009 are common for humid climates where evaporation from the phreatic surface is not a major factor in our case the evaporation rate e from segment am of the phreatic surface in fig 1a is high and may depend on d the depth of the phreatic surface under an average terrain surface in this paper we propose a plausible explanation of the existence of ffgls a stable lens is a result of a spatial alteration with the x or r coordinate in fig 1a of the boundary condition along the water table namely infiltration occurs from the crest zone b s m s of a fixed width and evapotranspiration takes place from the plinth valley zone m s c s the width of which is a part of solution we emphasize that similarly to emikh 1962 the lens in fig 1a is much wider than the hill and zone of infiltration from above bsms this is different from oceanic lenses the shape of which is determined by the topographic hill shape in desert tfls the width of the lens is controlled by evapotranspiration which dominates in a relatively flat zone mscs of fig 1a the near surface sand at the crest of tall desert dunes is coarser and more permeable than that at the slopes and interdunal depressions the crests are commonly not covered by biocrust vegetation or fine sediment while the lower slopes and interdunal valleys are e g chamizo et al 2016 kidron and yair 2008 fig 17 2 pye and tsoar 2008 fig 7 28 9 6 yair et al 2008 figs 2 2 24 the infiltration rate on the crest is higher than along the dune slopes and in the valley see e g lopez et al 2015 tao et al 2001 provided the sand is not hydrophobic annual evaluations of n in loose sands give values which are several times higher than in vegetated silt clay clogged and biocrusted sands see e g gael and smirnova 1999 in humid climates however the dune crests can be covered by moss see e g voortman 2018 and the water repellent sand makes the infiltration distribution to subjacent fresh groundwater lenses more complex less recharge comes through a zone on the dune crest as compared with the slopes and valley see e g houben et al 2014a in satellite images or aerial views the green cover depicted in fig 1a makes a distinct spatial pattern of ecotones monitored also by botanists on the ground see e g dedkov 2011 for example the black saksaol trees on the slopes and interdunal areas of the repeteka national park in turkmenistan strongly depend on the subsurface hydrology as these plants grow transpiration increases and climatic conditions i e recharge through the curve bm and distributed losses to the vadose zone along mc in fig 1a remain stable the lens starts to shrink because of a more intensive subsurface water uptake by saksaol roots that results in degradation of the trees that biome lens dynamics is in comport with what toth 2009 reported in his section 4 4 2 3 devegetation also impacts the hydraulic and capillary properties of the vadose zone see e g wang et al 2015 it is noteworthy that dunes in our fig 1a are sufficiently tall for less bulging desert landforms viz small size sand piles the hillocks the so called nebkhas plants grow on the crest of the hillocks see e g danin 2012 figs 16 21 51 62 khalaf et al 1995 on an annual and decadal time scale the segment bm of the phreatic surface in fig 1a is grossly a zone of recharge of ffgl of lateral extension l m or r m 2 d and axisymmetric cases respectively the segment mc of horizontal sizes l c or r c is a zone of a distributed exfiltration evapotranspiration from the lens correspondingly the recharge discharge distribution along the phreatic surface in fig 1a is exactly the same as in strack 1978 who considered an unconfined aquifer without a subjacent interface and bedrock deep at infinity van der veer 1977 studied a semi infinite wedge of a fresh water commingled with a static sea water intrusion tongue we combine the analytic components of strack s and van der veer s flow models the curve bma caps ffgl in fig 1a and ac reflects its confining and floatational features we note that transient variable density flows in the takyr mar fed ffgls of turkmenistan have been numerically modeled by feflow kuznetsov et al 2006 yakirevich et al 2005 dynamics of fresh groundwater in fig 1a is similar to what has been studied in the toth 2009 regional flow model in which a rigid bedrock commonly serves as a confining boundary of fresh groundwater flows see e g his figs 2 1 2 2 3 1 3 2 3 6 3 14 3 22 4 1 4 16 5 26 5 34 5 38 5 51 5 67 the toth type topology of streamlines shown in fig 1a is corroborated by yair 2008 the long term effect of subsurface lateral water flow is supported by data on changes in electrical conductivity and amount of fine grained material at the base of the dune slopes wedges of increased salinity and content of fine grained particles parallel to the sloping surfaces were detected at the slope bases fig 18 11 yair experimentally proved that near point b s recharge zone in our fig 1a soil water inside the dune is an order of magnitude less saline than near the dune pedestal evaporation zone obviously for artificially recharged ffgl depicted in fig 1b see also kunin and lezshinsky 1960 the schematization of fig 1a is adopted to a takyr topography viz a zone of engineeringly controlled l m or r m specified by the size of a infiltration basin natural or constructed the basin can be linear circular or of a more complex shaped yakirevich et al 2005 kuznetsov et al 2006 in fig 1b instead of an elevated highly permeable dune crest above ffgl of fig 1a a low permeable and depressed colmatation layer feeds the lens one of the motives in studying ffgl in fig 1 stems from the necessity to prepare for a possible water shortage and corresponding planning for the extraction of water resources in the deserts as porter 2015 pointed out the whole world is not flat i e in our application to topography in fig 1a ffgls stored under undulating sandy ground surface may become a vital reservoir for the desert settlements when regular aquifers are depleted or contaminated 2 conceptual model we assume a steady state darcian capillarity free one phase fully saturated 2 d flow in ffgl formed in a sand of hydraulic conductivity k a light pore water of density œÅ f floats on a static dense saline water of density œÅ s with an interface ac dispersion is ignored ffgl in fig 1a is recharged by infiltration of intensity n x 0 which arrives at a segment bm of a given length l m of the phreatic surface from a zone b s m s of the dune crest similarly to the case of infinite strip islands chesnaux and allen 2008 vacher 1988 the evaporation of intensity e x 0 unlike the island lenses takes place from ma the ordinate of point a is apriori unknown fresh groundwater evaporates from ffgl and from a horizontal segment af of a static saline water table on the ground surface the corresponding curve m s c s extends to the point c s the middle of the interdunal valley the ray c s fi in fig 1a separates the modeled dune from its neighbor on the right measurements or even assessments of e are more problematic than of n see e g hampton 1963 we consider a solitary lens i e we assume that n is small enough and e is high enough such that l c is narrow enough i e the lenses under two neighbouring dunes do not interfere if n e 0 then the water table of the ambient static saline groundwater coincides with the axis ox the streamlines in fig 1a bounded by a separatrix boc illustrate the toth type flow of fresh groundwater within the lens with a hinge point m point on the phreatic surface where infiltration changes to exfiltration the position of the phreatic surface of

rather depends on the depth of this surface counted from the local ground surface for simplicity we ignore the relief of the topography above the evapotranspiring arc of ffgl and assume that m s c s in fig 1a is a horizontal line dashed dotted located at an effective depth d e above the undisturbed saline water table then the evapotranspiration intensity depends on d ff x pk 77 provided field

the constants e 1 and e 2 are directly expressed via e 0 Œ≤ and de the boundary conditions in bvp 6 are the same as in bvp 3 the first linear equation in 6 integrates into the same elliptical arc as the first eqn 4 branch mc the second ode in 6 is nonlinear with respect to strack s potential but it integrates in elliptic functions for the sake of brevity we skip over computations of gf and gs obtained as solutions of bvp 6 3 2 axisymmetric lenses if the dune surface b s c s fig 1a resembles a cupola barchan dunes see e g bishop 2013 and infiltration originates from a disk shaped spot of rainfall at the crest of this cupola co axial with the cupola then flow in ffgl is axisymmetric the saturated water storage is equal to the volume v f of the corresponding body of revolution kunin reported axisymmetric shapes of mar fed ffgls see the field data on the sansyz lens from kunin 1959 supplementary file 4 the df model for axisymmetric flows reduces to the following nonlinear ode 7 1

phreatic horizon fig 3b shows vf e 0 for Œ≥ 0 03 and n 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 curves 1 3 here similarly to fig 2b we see that the saturated storage of ffgl is most sensitive to the intensity of evaporation at small e0 4 two dimensional flow in a linear dune now we consider 2 d flow in in a vertical plane of ffgl under a linear dune similarly to groundwater systems modeled by pk 77 strack 1978 and van der veer 1977 a rigorously stated mathematical problem involves three free boundaries viz a branch of the phreatic surface with accretion a branch with evaporation and interface then the corresponding domain in the hodograph plane is a curvilinear quadrangle for such polygons an analytical solution by the pk 77 method becomes prohibitively complicated 2 we recall that pk 77 effectively solved simpler 2 d problems with either constant recharge or constant evaporation intensity along the whole water table see her figs 223 and 225 with a curvilinear triangle in the hodogrpah plane see also maas 2007 strack 1978 solved the problem with a variable infiltration evaporation but in an unconfined aquifer without a subjacent bedrock 2 in this section we circumvent conformal mappings of a curvilinear polygon in the hodograph plane see pk 77 her fig 224 and 227 by approximating the free boundaries by straight segments the interface ca can be approximated reasonably by a straight line in the df model the interface under infiltrated phreatic surface usually has a high degree of curvature close to point a see the elliptical phreatic surfaces and interfaces found in pk77 and van der veer 1977 in terms of 2 d potential and df models for an island lens similarly the df model predicts an elliptic phreatic surface in fig 3 of haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 in case of uniform infiltration and equal levels of water in the reservoirs however in case of a uniform evaporation the phreatic surface in fig 3 of haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 at small evaporation rates becomes a hyperbola at high evaporation the hyperbola splits into two straight lines bounding two hydraulically disconnected saturated wedges see e g kacimov et al 2003 youngs 1974 similarly for the case of

the supplementary file 2 illustrate that both phreatic surface and interface flatten towards point a in our fig 1a therefore the slope of bmc is zero at point b relatively high at point m and small again at point a this is also illustrated by the behavior of curves 1 3 in fig 3 our straight line bma and ghijben herzberg ca are hence a reasonable approximation of a real phreatic surface and interface which have inflection points from field observations records of the water table of numerous ffgls kunin 1959 one can easily get the loci of points b and c in the physical plane i e b and l in fig 1a next we assume that the ghijben herzberg relation holds at point a i e ya b Œ≥ we also approximate the curved phreatic surface and interface solid lines in fig 4 a by straight segments bc and ba dashed lines i e we get a triangle bac gz which is a tothian unit basin of this problem as the right half of ffgl we solve a 2 d problem in gz 4 1 toth s model with a fixed straight phreatic surface and interface as free surface as usually we introduce a complex physical coordinate z x i y velocity potential œï k h f of the moving fresh water where h f x y is the hydraulic head in the fresh water counted from point c the complex potential w œï i œà where œà is a stream function point c in fig 4a is selected as fiducial and the complex potential domain gw corresponding to gz is shown in fig 4b the curve bmc of the digone gw is not known the specific discharge vector is v œï the pressure head and pressure in fresh water are p f x y œï k y and p f œÅ f g p f correspondingly the pressure head and pressure in saline water are p s y y and p s œÅ s g p s correspondingly thus the bvp is 11 œÜ k s y 0 along b c œà 0 along a c œÜ 0 along a b we recall that in the 1960 s toth 2009 solved a similar bvp in a rectangle by the method of separation of variables in the laplace equation kacimov 1996 and al shukaili et al 2019 solved a mixed bvp in a trapezium and pentagon correspondingly unlike the df approximation of section 2 the widths of the infiltration and exfiltration segments in fig 4a are not specified but are found as a part of solution i e the locus of point m is determined moreover by assuming isobaric condition along a given line bc in our case the toth model automatically requires determination of the intensities of inflow through bm and exfiltration through mc which were also input parameters of the df model we use the schwarz christoffel formula and map conformally the triangle gz onto the half plane gŒ∂ in fig 4c with the correspondence of

analytical solutions allow to carry out the analysis of vulnerability of recharge evaporation controlled ffgls to variation of the basic input parameters intensities of the distributed sink source along phreatic surfaces similarly to what has been done for other tfls laattoe et al 2017 and for lenses in oceanic islands and coastal dunes morgan and werner 2014 stuyfzand and van der schans 2018 exploitation of desert ffgls especially ones only naturally recharged requires smart skimming of the fresh water because overabstraction causes a rapid brackization kunin 1959 a potential can be used for modeling of horizontal or vertical wells tapping ffgls hocking and forbes 2004 as in morgan and werner 2014 stuyfzand and van der schans 2018 our analytical models assume steady flows although a real focused post rain infiltration to bm in fig 1a comes in short pulses the real dunes are not homogeneous and isotropic media as we assumed but are structured lancaster 1995 that complicates the infiltration evaporation paths of pore water and determination of the interface phreatic surface inside the dune bodies al shukaili et al 2019 bagnold 2012 berndtsson and chert 1994 berndtsson et al 1996 dose et al 2014 mccord et al 1991 mccord and stephens 1987 pye and tsoar 2008 chapter 7 also dispersion blurs the interface of ffgl further laboratory e g sandbox and numerical modeling as well as field piezometry measurements of tds and matrix potential in desert ffgls should be done similarly to analogous swi problems see e g houben et al 2018 6 concluding remarks kunin s ffgls are unique hydrological entities which emerge in desert climates with a spatially focused natural recharge to a part of the water table from a dune crest or with a mar infiltration from a surface pond an intensive evaporation from the tail not recharged part of the water table supports an ffgl scale water motion in sand in order to float these lenses require a substrate of saline groundwater an unconfined aquifer of a sufficient depth and small natural hydraulic gradient in these conditions ffgl is subtended by a trough shaped interface between a moving fresh water inside the lens and static saline water this interface has the same confining role as the bedrock in the toth 2009 regional flow but unlike the fixed lower boundary of the toth unit basin determined by geological stratification the interface supporting ffgl is a free boundary i e not fixed but depending on hydraulic conductivity of the sand recharge and evaporation intensities the width of the infiltration spot and densities of fresh and saline groundwater ffgl resembles a fresh water mar bubble completely submerged into saline groundwater kacimov et al 2018 analytical solutions to bvps for steady state regimes described by odes df model for strack s potential give the shapes of the water table and interface including the locus of the crest and total width of ffgl remarkably an evaporating segment of the ffgl and therefore the df interface are straight lines provided the recharge evaporation intensities are constant as was the case in the van der veer 1977 solution to an swi problem for 2 d flows in ffgl holomorphic characteristic functions are used with the help of toth s approximation of the upper boundary of the flow domain as a fixed isobar in gravity driven groundwater flows half of the flow

the toth model of subsection 4 1 by assuming that the interface ac is not a straight segment but a free boundary the upper boundary of the lens bmc as in subsection 4 1 is still not a free boundary but a given straight tilted isobaric segment of a slope s and elevation b above the background saline water table even with this simplification to get an analytical solution we engage the machinery of

investigated in bermuda germany holland paraguay and other countries the interface crops out into a well defined surface water body sea river lake or drainage ditch into which a light fresh groundwater discharges terrestrial freshwater lenses tfls in arid or semi arid climates are not in a direct and permanent contact with surface water see fig 2a and d in laattoe et al 2017 fresh floating groundwater lenses hereafter abbreviated as ffgls are a special type of tfls ffgls are subtended by an interface and capped by a phreatic surface recharged from the vadose zone post rain infiltration or ephemeral ponding of topographic depressions filled after occasional runoff is balanced by evaporation from the phreatic surface if it is shallow enough for example hampton 1963 for lenses in oregon estimated evaporation from the phreatic surface of lenses in coastal dunes as 7 in year and pointed out in parts of the area where the water table is shallow and the vegetation is dense the evapotranspiration doubtless is much greater conversely in the barren dune areas and at places where the water table is relatively deep the evapotranspiration probably is considerably less than 7 in per year emikh 1962 analytically studied channel fed tfls in central asia see the corresponding sketch in fig 2b of laattoe et al 2017 for which evaporation was assumed the only factor discharging groundwater from the lens ffgls have been detected and studied in australia kuwait nambia oman uae see e g al weshah and yihdego 2016 cend√≥n et al 2010 kwarteng et al 2000 laattoe et al

groundwater motion inside is much less investigated laattoe et al 2017 in this paper we use the studies of kunin 1959 1 dr vladimir kunin 1906 1976 the corresponding member of the academy of sciences of ussr one of the founders of the institute of deserts city of ashkhabad turkmen academy of sciences of the turkmen soviet socialist republic published extensively on hydrology of deserts see e g kunin 1968 1 in the karakum desert of turkmenistan a large scale water supply from ffgls in central aisa started in the 1960s with the arrive of the soviet oil gas industry to the deserts of this region that required much more fresh water than the local traditional animal husbandry bairamova 2013 reports that pumping from one of the largest tfls in turkmenistan commenced in 1963 with 56 well galleries drilled in 1963 1969 49 of them are being exploited around 40 years a common interface delineating tfls is a 1 g l isoconcentric surface bairamova 2013 emphasizes that the genesis of tfls including ffgls in turkmenistan is still not well understood pumping from tfls of these deserts was compounded with managed aquifer recharge mar through engineered infiltration ponds placed just above the lenses see the photos of the sansyz mar project retrieved from kunin 1959 supplementary file 1 these excavations harnessed the natural occasional runoff and converted it into an intensive infiltration spot analogous to ones shown in fig 2 of stuyfzand and van der schans 2018 for similar lenses in holland without such simply engineered rainwater collectors the desert runoff is either lost to draining channels or gets diffused as a low intensity infiltration to those parts of the desert where the sand moisture redistributes to evaporation i e stable ffgls can not be formed kunin 1959 and schevchenko 1965 depending on topography and desert soil cover distinguished three types of desert tfls viz small sub dune ffgls fig 1 a small ffgls under topographic depressions called takyrs fig 1b and megalenses natural hydraulic gradients of several unconfined aquifers salinity of chloride type saline groundwater is 20 40 g l common in turkmenistan kunin 1959 rogovskaya et al 1986 are adverse to retaining ffgls even if infiltration is sufficient and spatially focused unlike under hydrological conditions of holland ffgls in turkmenistan can not be replenished by diversion of surface fresh water from perennial streams because they do not exist in the desert if a bedrock in fig 1 is not deep enough see also danin 2012 fig 78 and the pristine unconfined saline groundwater is not thick enough then a lens is not ffgl in fig 1b the corresponding lens is demarcated by the contour e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 e 1 a horizontal segment of the bedrock e 4 e 1 subtends this lens it can be stable even without evaporation from the phreatic surface e 2 e 3 provided fresh groundwater seeps through a slightly permeable line e 4 e 1 as in kacimov and obnosov 2015 a deep borehole drilled across ffgl would show the following zonation vadose zone fresh water table fresh groundwater zone interface between fresh and saline water saline groundwater deep bedrock the topographic depressions natural ones or engineered excavations of an appropriate locale sizes and placed above right phreatic saline phreatic surfaces convert a runoff of sufficiently strong rain into ffgls which can be diligently abstracted kunin and leszhinsky 1960 as a prerequisite of existence of ffgl rogovskaya et al 1979 pointed out that too small thicknesses of the vadose zone above the lens lead to dissipation of the ground water by plant uptake with some substantial salt accumulation and an aeration zone of thickness less than 3 m in conjunction with lack of plant cover results in highly saline water due to physical evaporation intelligent mar operations in replenishing the exploited ffgls of turkmenistan in addition to natural recharge incorporated skimming of fresh water by vertical wells collated with a simultaneous pumping of a subjacent saline water of ffgls this pioneering dual pumping controlled the fresh saline water interface such mitigation of upcoming of saline water in ffgls and ensuring their resilience commenced in 1963 prior to many similar projects in the usa or holland see e g singh and stammers 1989 zuurbier et al 2014 the very existence of a stable ffgl is conditioned by the following factors there should be saline brine background water table on which the lenses emerge as hydrogeological buoys that is illustrated in fig 1a f of laattoe et al 2017 the natural gradient of this subjacent background saline groundwater should be small i e away from the lens the water table should be almost flat because otherwise ffgl slips downgradient kunin 1959 and or gets dispersed by the subjacent saline groundwater the thickness of the vadose zone above the phreatic surface of the lens should be appropriate otherwise infiltration and evaporation do not make a favourable source sink hydrodynamic couple similar to one in kacimov et al 2018 juxtaposition of recharge to the water table and losses from it maintains a continuous motion of fresh water within the lens transpiration intensity by natural hydromorphic plants if any on the ground surface above the lens should be bounded both from above and below no transpiration may result in high water table and its salinization too intensive interception of groundwater by the roots may eventually deplete the lens and consequently exterminates the plants natural recharge and mar to and pumping from ffgls for drinking both by humans and livestock are going on in modern turkmenistan babaev 1999 a post kunin review of hydrology hydrogeology climate topography geomorphology soil cover and water consumption in deserts of turkmenistan is reported by babaev 1999 bairamova 2013 fleskens et al 2007 hydrogeology 1972 kolodin 1981 typical concentrations of total dissolved solids tds of fresh and saline groundwater in ffgls are about 1 g l and 20 60 g l respectively kunin 1959 modeled a thin transition zone by a ghijben herzberg interface the field data on the vertical profile of tds in the sansyz ffgl is shown in supplementary file 2 retrieved from kunin 1959 this cross section illustrates that close to point c in our fig 1a the thickness of the transition zone between isoconcentric contours 1 g l and 10 g l is about 1 2 m the maximal thickness of the lens is about 12 m towards point a in our fig 1a the kunin interface is blurred i e the distance between isolines of 1 g l and 10 g l becomes large the thickness of small ffgls can be several tens of centimeters only these mini lenses are tapped by dug wells and fresh water is occasionally and carefully consumed by local nomads the bed of takyrs gets gradually clogged due to mechanical colmatation see the photos of a dry takyr retrieved from kunin 1959 supplementary file 3 in a vertical cross section of ffgl fig 1a the dune is symmetric with respect to a vertical axis oy of cartesian xoy or cylindrical roy coordinate systems a horizontal axis is ox or or respectively this axis coincides with the background level of saline groundwater if no infiltration and no fresh water present the saline water table is a plane the curve b s m s c s in fig 1a is the ground surface contour due to symmetry below only the right half of the dune is considered ffgl is bounded from above by a phreatic surface bmc and from below by an interface ac the separatrix boc in fig 1a is a vertical segment the following questions intrigued arid zone hydrologists in turkmenistan why does a stable ffgl in fig 1a exist and why is it digon shaped why the curve bma is a subdued replica of b s c s the topography of the dune and ac is an amplified ghijben herzbergian replica of bma in other words can one extend the criterion of haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 their eq 8 of topography recharge controlled phreatic surface flows to bma in fig 1a which has a focused infiltration strip disk under a dune or ponded takyr bed unlike the situations of common deep or shallow unconfined aquifers in haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 and their assumption of a constant accretion on the water table ffgls in our fig 1 have a large variation of its fresh water thickness fs ff flow in our fig 1 is a conjugation of flows in figs 1 and 8 of van der veer 1977 i e a source sink boundary condition along a phreatic surface recharge under the crest of the dune and evaporation on the flanks makes the situation different form one in haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 the groundwater systems modeled by haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 and toth 2009 are common for humid climates where evaporation from the phreatic surface is not a major factor in our case the evaporation rate e from segment am of the phreatic surface in fig 1a is high and may depend on d the depth of the phreatic surface under an average terrain surface in this paper we propose a plausible explanation of the existence of ffgls a stable lens is a result of a spatial alteration with the x or r coordinate in fig 1a of the boundary condition along the water table namely infiltration occurs from the crest zone b s m s of a fixed width and evapotranspiration takes place from the plinth valley zone m s c s the width of which is a part of solution we emphasize that similarly to emikh 1962 the lens in fig 1a is much wider than the hill and zone of infiltration from above bsms this is different from oceanic lenses the shape of which is determined by the topographic hill shape in desert tfls the width of the lens is controlled by evapotranspiration which dominates in a relatively flat zone mscs of fig 1a the near surface sand at the crest of tall desert dunes is coarser and more permeable than that at the slopes and interdunal depressions the crests are commonly not covered by biocrust vegetation or fine sediment while the lower slopes and interdunal valleys are e g chamizo et al 2016 kidron and yair 2008 fig 17 2 pye and tsoar 2008 fig 7 28 9 6 yair et al 2008 figs 2 2 24 the infiltration rate on the crest is higher than along the dune slopes and in the valley see e g lopez et al 2015 tao et al 2001 provided the sand is not hydrophobic annual evaluations of n in loose sands give values which are several times higher than in vegetated silt clay clogged and biocrusted sands see e g gael and smirnova 1999 in humid climates however the dune crests can be covered by moss see e g voortman 2018 and the water repellent sand makes the infiltration distribution to subjacent fresh groundwater lenses more complex less recharge comes through a zone on the dune crest as compared with the slopes and valley see e g houben et al 2014a in satellite images or aerial views the green cover depicted in fig 1a makes a distinct spatial pattern of ecotones monitored also by botanists on the ground see e g dedkov 2011 for example the black saksaol trees on the slopes and interdunal areas of the repeteka national park in turkmenistan strongly depend on the subsurface hydrology as these plants grow transpiration increases and climatic conditions i e recharge through the curve bm and distributed losses to the vadose zone along mc in fig 1a remain stable the lens starts to shrink because of a more intensive subsurface water uptake by saksaol roots that results in degradation of the trees that biome lens dynamics is in comport with what toth 2009 reported in his section 4 4 2 3 devegetation also impacts the hydraulic and capillary properties of the vadose zone see e g wang et al 2015 it is noteworthy that dunes in our fig 1a are sufficiently tall for less bulging desert landforms viz small size sand piles the hillocks the so called nebkhas plants grow on the crest of the hillocks see e g danin 2012 figs 16 21 51 62 khalaf et al 1995 on an annual and decadal time scale the segment bm of the phreatic surface in fig 1a is grossly a zone of recharge of ffgl of lateral extension l m or r m 2 d and axisymmetric cases respectively the segment mc of horizontal sizes l c or r c is a zone of a distributed exfiltration evapotranspiration from the lens correspondingly the recharge discharge distribution along the phreatic surface in fig 1a is exactly the same as in strack 1978 who considered an unconfined aquifer without a subjacent interface and bedrock deep at infinity van der veer 1977 studied a semi infinite wedge of a fresh water commingled with a static sea water intrusion tongue we combine the analytic components of strack s and van der veer s flow models the curve bma caps ffgl in fig 1a and ac reflects its confining and floatational features we note that transient variable density flows in the takyr mar fed ffgls of turkmenistan have been numerically modeled by feflow kuznetsov et al 2006 yakirevich et al 2005 dynamics of fresh groundwater in fig 1a is similar to what has been studied in the toth 2009 regional flow model in which a rigid bedrock commonly serves as a confining boundary of fresh groundwater flows see e g his figs 2 1 2 2 3 1 3 2 3 6 3 14 3 22 4 1 4 16 5 26 5 34 5 38 5 51 5 67 the toth type topology of streamlines shown in fig 1a is corroborated by yair 2008 the long term effect of subsurface lateral water flow is supported by data on changes in electrical conductivity and amount of fine grained material at the base of the dune slopes wedges of increased salinity and content of fine grained particles parallel to the sloping surfaces were detected at the slope bases fig 18 11 yair experimentally proved that near point b s recharge zone in our fig 1a soil water inside the dune is an order of magnitude less saline than near the dune pedestal evaporation zone obviously for artificially recharged ffgl depicted in fig 1b see also kunin and lezshinsky 1960 the schematization of fig 1a is adopted to a takyr topography viz a zone of engineeringly controlled l m or r m specified by the size of a infiltration basin natural or constructed the basin can be linear circular or of a more complex shaped yakirevich et al 2005 kuznetsov et al 2006 in fig 1b instead of an elevated highly permeable dune crest above ffgl of fig 1a a low permeable and depressed colmatation layer feeds the lens one of the motives in studying ffgl in fig 1 stems from the necessity to prepare for a possible water shortage and corresponding planning for the extraction of water resources in the deserts as porter 2015 pointed out the whole world is not flat i e in our application to topography in fig 1a ffgls stored under undulating sandy ground surface may become a vital reservoir for the desert settlements when regular aquifers are depleted or contaminated 2 conceptual model we assume a steady state darcian capillarity free one phase fully saturated 2 d flow in ffgl formed in a sand of hydraulic conductivity k a light pore water of density œÅ f floats on a static dense saline water of density œÅ s with an interface ac dispersion is ignored ffgl in fig 1a is recharged by infiltration of intensity n x 0 which arrives at a segment bm of a given length l m of the phreatic surface from a zone b s m s of the dune crest similarly to the case of infinite strip islands chesnaux and allen 2008 vacher 1988 the evaporation of intensity e x 0 unlike the island lenses takes place from ma the ordinate of point a is apriori unknown fresh groundwater evaporates from ffgl and from a horizontal segment af of a static saline water table on the ground surface the corresponding curve m s c s extends to the point c s the middle of the interdunal valley the ray c s fi in fig 1a separates the modeled dune from its neighbor on the right measurements or even assessments of e are more problematic than of n see e g hampton 1963 we consider a solitary lens i e we assume that n is small enough and e is high enough such that l c is narrow enough i e the lenses under two neighbouring dunes do not interfere if n e 0 then the water table of the ambient static saline groundwater coincides with the axis ox the streamlines in fig 1a bounded by a separatrix boc

rather depends on the depth of this surface counted from the local ground surface for simplicity we ignore the relief of the topography above the evapotranspiring arc of ffgl and assume that m s c s in fig 1a is a horizontal line dashed dotted located at an effective depth d e above the undisturbed saline water table then the evapotranspiration intensity depends on d ff x pk 77 provided field

the constants e 1 and e 2 are directly expressed via e 0 Œ≤ and de the boundary conditions in bvp 6 are the same as in bvp 3 the first linear equation in 6 integrates into the same elliptical arc as the first eqn 4 branch mc the second ode in 6 is nonlinear with respect to strack s potential but it integrates in elliptic functions for the sake of brevity we skip over computations of gf and gs obtained as solutions of bvp 6 3 2 axisymmetric lenses if the dune surface b s c s fig 1a resembles a cupola barchan dunes see e g bishop 2013 and infiltration originates from a disk shaped spot of rainfall at the crest of this cupola co axial with the cupola then flow in ffgl is axisymmetric the saturated water storage is equal to the volume v f of the corresponding body of revolution kunin reported axisymmetric shapes of mar fed ffgls see the field data on the sansyz lens from kunin 1959 supplementary file 4 the df model for axisymmetric flows reduces to the following nonlinear ode 7 1

05 0 2 curves 1 3 correspondingly apparently the evaporating branch of the phreatic surface is almost straight especially close to the point r rc where the fresh water zone tapers to the saline phreatic horizon fig 3b shows vf e 0 for Œ≥ 0 03 and n 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 curves 1 3 here similarly to fig 2b we see that the saturated storage of ffgl is most sensitive to the intensity of evaporation at small e0 4 two dimensional flow in a linear dune now we consider 2 d flow in in a vertical plane of ffgl under a linear dune similarly to groundwater systems modeled by pk 77 strack 1978 and van der veer 1977 a rigorously stated mathematical problem involves three free boundaries viz a branch of the phreatic surface with accretion a branch with evaporation and interface then the corresponding domain in the hodograph plane is a curvilinear quadrangle for such polygons an analytical solution by the pk 77 method becomes prohibitively complicated 2 we recall that pk 77 effectively solved simpler 2 d problems with either constant recharge or constant evaporation intensity along the whole water table see her figs 223 and 225 with a curvilinear triangle in the hodogrpah plane see also maas 2007 strack 1978 solved the problem with a variable infiltration evaporation but in an unconfined aquifer without a subjacent bedrock 2 in this section we circumvent conformal mappings of a curvilinear polygon in the hodograph plane see pk 77 her fig 224 and 227 by approximating the free boundaries by straight segments the interface ca can be approximated reasonably by a straight line in the df model the interface under infiltrated phreatic surface usually has a high degree of curvature close to point a see the elliptical phreatic surfaces and interfaces found in pk77 and van der veer 1977 in terms of 2 d potential and df models for an island lens similarly the df model predicts an elliptic phreatic surface in fig 3 of haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 in case of uniform infiltration and equal levels of water in the reservoirs however in case of a uniform evaporation the phreatic surface in fig 3 of haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 at small evaporation rates becomes a hyperbola at high evaporation the hyperbola splits into two straight lines bounding two hydraulically disconnected saturated wedges see e g kacimov et al 2003 youngs 1974 similarly for the case of an interface rather than a horizontal bedrock of haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 at point a of our fig 1a a wedge depicted in fig 8 of van der veer 1978 emerges kunin s 1959 field observation see the supplementary file 2 illustrate that both phreatic surface and interface flatten towards point a in our fig 1a therefore the slope of bmc is zero at point b relatively high at point m and small again at point a this is also illustrated by the behavior of curves 1 3 in fig 3 our straight line bma and ghijben herzberg ca are hence a reasonable approximation of a real phreatic surface and interface which have inflection points from field observations records of the water table of numerous ffgls kunin 1959 one can easily get the loci of points b and c in the physical plane i e b and l in fig 1a next we assume that the ghijben herzberg relation holds at point a i e ya b Œ≥ we also approximate the curved phreatic surface and interface solid lines in fig 4 a by straight segments bc and ba dashed lines i e we get a triangle bac gz which is a tothian unit basin of this problem as the right half of ffgl we solve a 2 d problem in gz 4 1 toth s model with a fixed straight phreatic surface and interface as free surface as usually we introduce a complex physical coordinate z x i y velocity potential œï k h f of the moving fresh water where h f x y is the hydraulic head in the fresh water counted from point c the complex potential w œï i œà where œà is a stream function point c in fig 4a is selected as fiducial and the complex potential domain gw corresponding to gz is shown in fig 4b the curve bmc of the digone gw is not known the specific discharge vector is v œï the pressure head and pressure in fresh water are p f x y œï k y and p f œÅ f g p f correspondingly the pressure head and pressure in saline water are p s y y and p s œÅ s g p s correspondingly thus the bvp is 11 œÜ k s y 0 along b c œà 0 along a c œÜ 0 along a b we recall that in the 1960 s toth 2009 solved a similar bvp in a rectangle by the method of separation of variables in the laplace equation kacimov 1996 and al shukaili et al 2019 solved a mixed bvp in a trapezium and pentagon correspondingly unlike the df approximation of section 2 the widths of the infiltration and exfiltration segments in fig 4a are not specified but are found as a part of solution i e the locus of point m is determined moreover by assuming isobaric condition along a given line bc in our case the toth model automatically requires determination of the intensities of inflow through bm and exfiltration through mc which were also input parameters of the df model we use the schwarz christoffel formula and map conformally the triangle gz onto the half plane gŒ∂ in fig 4c with the correspondence of

w Œæ Œæ 1 Œæ 0 at Œæ 0 1 the function w œÇ œÇ 1 œÇ vanishes at infinity and has integrable singularities at the points œÇ 0 and œÇ 1 therefore see henrici 1993 the last dirichlet problem is uniquely

Œæ m we introduce dimensionless quantities x y m l c l m x y m l c l m b œï œà q œï œà q k b for computations of the integrals in eq 16 we used the nintegrate function of wolfram s 1991 mathematica with the option principalvalue true for singular integrals the flow rate q was computed by applying the mathematica built in function findmaximum to eq 16 fig 5 plots the distribution œà y along bc for lc 1 4 3 30 curves 1 3 at Œ≥ 0 03 these curves show that with steepening of the phreatic surface the maximum of œà attained at the hinge point m shifts towards point b we also varied continuously lc and found the maximum of the function q lc at Œ≥ 0 03 this maxi max is attained at l c 4 3 and is q max 0 36 the elevation of point m is y m 0 48 this simple optimization can be used for apriori estimations of q viz for a measured peak b of the water table we can immediately write the bound q qmax whatever is the ffgl width 2l c this width unlike the height b of the groundwater mound commonly located somewhere in the middle of the mar pond is not easy to precisely measure see the vertical profile of the sansyz ffgl kunin 1959 supplementary file 2 5 suggestions for future work our analytical solutions allow to carry out the analysis of vulnerability of recharge evaporation controlled ffgls to variation of the basic input parameters intensities of the distributed sink source along phreatic surfaces similarly to what has been done for other tfls laattoe et al 2017 and for lenses in oceanic islands and coastal dunes morgan and werner 2014 stuyfzand and van der schans 2018 exploitation of desert ffgls especially ones only naturally recharged requires smart skimming of the fresh water because overabstraction causes a rapid brackization kunin 1959 a potential can be used for modeling of horizontal or vertical wells tapping ffgls hocking and forbes 2004 as in morgan and werner 2014 stuyfzand and van der schans 2018 our analytical models assume steady flows although a real focused post rain infiltration to bm in fig 1a comes in short pulses the real dunes are not homogeneous and isotropic media as we assumed but are structured lancaster 1995 that complicates the infiltration evaporation paths of pore water and determination of the interface phreatic surface inside the dune bodies al shukaili et al 2019 bagnold 2012 berndtsson and chert 1994 berndtsson et al 1996 dose et al 2014 mccord et al 1991 mccord and stephens 1987 pye and tsoar 2008 chapter 7 also dispersion blurs the interface of ffgl further laboratory e g sandbox and numerical modeling as well as field piezometry measurements of tds and matrix potential in desert ffgls should be done similarly to analogous swi problems see e g houben et al 2018 6 concluding remarks kunin s ffgls are unique hydrological entities which emerge in desert climates with a spatially focused natural recharge to a part of the water table from a dune crest or with a mar infiltration from a surface pond an intensive evaporation from the tail not recharged part of the water table supports an ffgl scale water motion in sand in order to float these lenses require a substrate of saline groundwater an unconfined aquifer of a sufficient depth and small natural hydraulic gradient in these conditions ffgl is subtended by a trough shaped interface between a moving fresh water inside the lens and static saline water this interface has the same confining role as the bedrock in the toth 2009 regional flow but unlike the fixed lower boundary of the toth unit basin determined by geological stratification the interface supporting ffgl is a free boundary i e not fixed but depending on hydraulic conductivity of the sand recharge and evaporation intensities the width of the infiltration spot and densities of fresh and saline groundwater ffgl resembles a fresh water mar bubble completely submerged into saline groundwater kacimov et al 2018 analytical solutions to bvps for steady state regimes described by odes df model for strack s potential give the shapes of the water table and interface including the locus of the crest and total width of ffgl remarkably an evaporating segment of the ffgl and therefore the df interface are straight lines provided the recharge evaporation intensities are constant as was the case in the van der veer 1977 solution to an swi problem for 2 d flows in ffgl holomorphic characteristic functions are used with the help of toth s approximation of the upper boundary of the flow domain as a fixed isobar in gravity driven groundwater flows half of the flow domain is considered as a tothian unit basin this triangle or curvilinear triangle is made of an isobar and streamline declaration of interest none acknowledgments this work was supported by sultan

12 1 helpful comments by o d l strack and an anonymous referee are appreciated appendix toth s model with a fixed straight phreatic surface and interface as a free surface in this appendix we extend the toth model of subsection 4 1 by assuming that the interface ac is not a straight segment but a free boundary the upper boundary of the lens bmc as in subsection 4 1 is still not a free boundary but a given straight tilted isobaric segment of a slope s and elevation b above the background saline water table even with this simplification to get an analytical solution we engage the machinery of

6464,production of defensible modelling tools for aquifer vulnerability mapping under the conditions of sparse data remains topical using the drastic framework drastic is the acronym for seven data layers using a prescribed scoring system in terms of rates to account for local variations and weights to account for the relative importance of data layers also the term framework signifies the consensual nature of choosing the data layers without any theoretical or empirical basis artificial intelligence ai or similar techniques are used to reduce inherent subjectivities through a strategy of unsupervised learning from data by formulating multiple frameworks mf and supervised learning from multiple models mms without searching for any superior model notably a framework lacks the procedure for iterative training and testing as usual in modelling procedures in this strategy models are organised in two hierarchical levels level 1 comprises the construction of mfs two frameworks and or mms two models level 2 comprises a model or an algorithm to reuse the outputs from level 1 through formulating four strategies including a mixture of mfs mms in which support vector machine svm is chosen by the paper to run models at level 2 the supervision process uses target values as a function of observed nitrate n values the strategy is applied to the aquifer in the malekan region where the past extensive agricultural practices have been transformed into intensive use of fertilisers without protecting water quality in the aquifers results show that aimm mf lead to significant

introduction an investigation is presented in this paper on mapping aquifer vulnerability index vi with a focus on combining multiple frameworks mf and multiple models mm through various strategies where frameworks refer to unsupervised learning for mapping outputs and models to their supervised learning vulnerability mapping in the form of indices is widely practiced for aquifer management since the availability of basic techniques e g drastic aller et al 1987 sintacs civita 1994 god foster 1987 and avi stempvoort et al 1993 these frameworks put consensually together a number of data layers and that of drastic is used widely for aquifers vulnerable to manmade pollutions it is a grid based approach and examples of its applications include merchant 1994 melloul and collin 1998 cameron and peloso 2001 al adamat et al 2003 baalousha 2006 jamrah et al 2007 sener et al 2009 massone et al 2010 javadi et al 2010 the pollutant loads may arise from various sources including fertilisers halliday and wolfe 1991 petroleum hydrocarbons wang et al 2007 pesticides ahmed 2009 and as well as salinisation stigter et al 2006 motevalli et al 2018 the paper is focused on mapping vulnerability due to nitrate pollutions a pivotal issue in the topical research on vi mapping using drastic is to treat their inherent subjectivities which arises due to using expert opinion in prescribing weights and rates for the seven general purpose drastic data layers these are defined in due course and are given by aller et al 1987 but their rationales comprise i rates are assigned to account for local variations ii weights prescribe the relative importance of each data layer in the overall value of vulnerability and iii joint contributions of these data layers are consensually treated as an intrinsic aquifer vulnerability to anthropogenic pollutants the authors refer to the drastic rationale as a framework for consensually selecting the data layers but not as a model or a method for not being able to use training and testing procedures and investigate subjectivity by a program of research the authors have reviewed elsewhere the various techniques on reducing subjectivity inherent in the rationale of drastic see sadeghfam et al 2016 nadiri et al 2017a b c nadiri et al 2018a b c as well as by others see jafari et al 2016 neshat and pradhan 2017 jang et al 2017 a review of research by others is not repeated here but some of the authors works summarised in table 1 include applying artificial intelligence ai and machine learning techniques to reduce inherent subjectivities arguing that the mapped specific vulnerability indices can be affected by complex aquifer layouts different modelling techniques and formulating various modelling strategies the investigations by the author s uses ai techniques managed in hierarchies at least at two levels at level 1 mfs or mms of the drastic framework are formulated through their appropriate best practice procedure at level 2 a further model or algorithm is employed to combine mfs or mms through a simple strategy in which inputs to level 2 are taken from outputs of mfs and or mms at level 1 arguably the scope for research on this innovatory model combination strategy is wide ai and machine learning techniques have now become tools of practical applications and therefore their reviews are precluded in the paper but an overview is that these were largely transformed into modelling tools in late 1980s and early 1990s ai techniques are largely inspired by the deep working of the species e g genetic algorithm ga genetic expression programs gep fuzzy logic fl a widely known machine learning technique is support vector machine svm which has inbuilt techniques to learn the values of inherent parameters from the available data without human interventions these techniques are used in the paper and specified in due course but there is a vast array of techniques and variations not covered in the paper for more details references may be made to rajashekaran and vijayalksmi 2004 and nadiri et al 2015 notably one such technique relates to dynamic systems treated by a range of techniques including catastrophe theory although this is not used directly here the paper uses its hybrid with fl as embedded in the multicriteria decision making theory introduced by cheng et al 1996 the various strategies reported by the authors table 1 provide a proof of concept for the innovatory model combination rationale the strategies reflected in table 1 use i frameworks which refer to unsupervised vi mapping techniques in which the term framework underlines a lack of theory or empiricism in the formulation and normally without testing the prediction results and ii models which refer to supervised vi mapping techniques processed through training and testing phases evidently one gap in these strategies is the absence of any investigation on the performance of combining mfs with mms which is tested in this paper the paper formulates i mfs at level 1 by using basic drastic framework bdf with prescribed values of rates and weights and fuzzy catastrophe framework bdf fcf which learns the weights by using the bdf rates ii mms at level 1 by using genetic algorithm bdf ga which learns weights from data but uses rates as in bdf through training but not testing and genetic expression program bdf gep which learns weights from data but uses rates as in bdf through both training and testing phases the key novelty of the paper is the formulation of four strategies from the above mfs and or mms as follows strategy 1 uses the algorithm of simple averaging of the four mapping techniques bdf bdf fcf bdf ga and bdf gep and serves as the basis for benchmarking strategy 2 uses svm at level 2 to combine bdf bdf fcf strategy 3 uses svm to combine bdf ga and bdf gep and strategy 4 uses svm to combine bdf bdf fcf bdf ga and bdf gep the paper uses malekan aquifer to test the performances of the above four strategies from combined mfs and mms attention is drawn to the clarification of a number of terms used consistently in the paper intrinsic groundwater vulnerability refers to the application of the drastic framework or of mfs without the benefit of any observed values whereas specific vulnerability refers to the benefits of learning from measurements of contaminant such as nitrate serving as a proxy for the concept of vulnerability serving as target values in mms and in combinations of mfs and mms the term framework used consistently by the authors refers to i consensually putting together a number of data layers without any theoretical or empirical justification ii the opportunity for learning the values of inherent rates and or weights in mfs is limited to unsupervised techniques and therefore the best practice procedure of training and testing is not feasible and iii outcomes of mfs are intrinsic vulnerability indices in contrast the benefits of mms include i observed values are used as a proxy for specific vulnerability and therefore target values are formulated by some sort of conditioning the values of observed contaminants ii best practice procedure of modelling practices are employed through training and testing and iii the outcomes of the learning from the values of the weights lead to mapping specific vulnerability indices 2 study area the malekan widely known as melik kendi plain is located in the east azerbaijan province southeast of lake urmia northwestern iran fig 1 the plain is approx 450 km2 and is a sub basin to the jighati basin as part of one of the 12 aquifers surrounding lake urmia the malekan region is limited from the north to maragheh bonab plain and to miandoab plain from south and southwest the average annual precipitation and mean annual temperature are respectively 273 mm and 21 7 c malekan weather station 1987 2017 in general average monthly relative humidity at the malekan synoptic station ranges from 51 june to 73 february malekan weather station 1987 2017 according to the malekan weather station data and based on the emberger method emberger 1952 the region is located in a cold and dry climate the malekan basin drains the basin of murduchay murdu river over a catchment of 750 km2 and flows into jigatichay simineh rud a major river contributing to the lake urmia closed basin as one of its 12 sub basins the study area only covers the plain 450 km2 over an aquifer as the actual study area the plain is formed by murduchay as well as by its major tributary leylanchay leylan river rising from western border of sahand ranges and also drain the lesser mountains ranges between the malekan plain and maragheh bonab plain murduchay with the annual discharge of 132 mm3 flows in a southerly direction through the city of malekan melik kendi recent expansions on agriculture industry and population are without any significant planning system as typical of the country by and large thus the quality and quantity of groundwater resources are often undermined and this poses risks to human health the malekan basin is made up of multiple geological formations including the lalun and ruteh formations of the permian age located in the east and south of the region respectively as shown in fig 2 i the eastern and northeastern parts of the region comprise the shemshak formation ii the northern and northeastern parts of the region is situated in the lar formation of triassic and jurassic periods shahrabi 1972 and iii southern and southeastern portions comprise evaporates including limestone marl gypsum of the cretaceous periods and iv the study area is located to the west of the older formations largely overlain by quaternary alluvial deposits fig 2b c also presents cross sections indicating possible structure in the aquifer residents of malekan plain approx 138 000 population suffer from pollution due to vast agricultural moderate industrial mining and animal husbandry activities recent agricultural practices have exposed groundwater quality to contamination due to the use of fertilisers and pesticides the nitrate n concentration values in groundwater in the study area exceed the world health organisations who 2009 allowable limits by as much as 18 folds thus groundwater vulnerability mapping can serve as a management tool in the future although credible planning practices are yet to emerge the encroachments emerged over the years since 1990s due to poor planning practices lacking appropriate levels of connections between planners and agricultural practitioners extensive farms and grape vineyards in the study area have resorted to intensive uses of fertilisers impacts are several but include those on water quantity and quality as outlined below the aquifer in the plain is unconfined which is a product of old and recent alluvial terraces alluvial fans and fluvial sediments the drilling well logs and geophysical data are indicative of fine grained materials at the western part of the plain which are permeable based on 26 pumping tests carried out in the plain by the east azerbaijan regional water authority earwa the transmissivity of the malekan plain aquifer varies between 4 and 650 m2 d the average value of aquifer storage coefficient is approx 3 2 the absolute hydraulic gradient at the entries of the plain is 0 006 and that is 0 001 at its exit the volume of the aquifer water is declining as during 2016 17 it discharged 5 mm3 more than it recharged due to supply agricultural demands eawa 2018 groundwater levels vary from 1279 m to 1328 m above the mean sea level groundwater flow directions are roughly in the directions towards the west and southwest of the plain groundwater in the aquifer is withdrawn through 4900 water wells 6 springs and 4 qanats there is a provision of 27 observation wells in the plain for monitoring groundwater levels their locations are distributed over the entire region as shown in fig 2 a sparse record of groundwater levels by earwa goes to 1970 hydrogeological properties of the aquifer layer and its thickness were estimated through 102 number of geoelectrical soundings and 16 profiles earwo 2018 it used 16 geoelectrical section in the ne sw and nw se direction see fig 2a b reproducing two of them the maximum thickness of the alluvia is reportedly located in the central and urban area of malekan which reaches approx 70 m and decreases towards the margins of the aquifer past hydrochemical studies reveal the dominance of bicarbonate in groundwater in the study area due to the ion exchange process in the miocene formations the water salinity increases in the west and northwest direction the average ph and electric conductivity in the malekan aquifer are 7 33 and 2740 ¬µ mho cm respectively the aquifer is vulnerable to the decline of groundwater level in the last 25 years due to the introduction of withdrawal wells and to modern agricultural practice with a further risk of pollution from uncontrolled industries the specific resistance of geological materials are noted to being decreasing due to fine grained deposits and the increase in total dissolved solids within groundwater from the east to west of the aquifer in recent years intensive uses of fertilisers and manure in farming and existing of grape farms are impacting groundwater quality groundwater quality is believed to have been good in the past but deteriorated fast through the introduction of intensive agricultural practices since circa 1990 the paper uses the 27 samples taken in 2015 as analysed in hydrochemical lab of the university of tabriz based on standard methods apha 1998 the measured nitrate n concentration is in ranges 2 8 to 189 mg l which is approx 18 folds in excess of permissible levels see sec 4 2 3 strategies for modelling aquifer vulnerability the paper builds on an aquifer vulnerability mapping practice in which modelling activities are carried out through strategies at two levels but preparing the data and making various decisions may be considered to form level 0 this sections presents the methodology for levels 0 1 and 2 3 1 level 0 framework structure and target values 3 1 1 underlying drastic concept the drastic framework employs seven different input data layers representing intrinsic potentials of the hydrogeologic and geomorphologic properties of aquifer systems to anthropogenic pollutions which comprise depth to water table d net recharge r aquifer media a soil media s topography t impact of the vadose zone i and hydraulic conductivity c the drastic vulnerability index vi is calculated as the sum of the products of prescribed ratings r accounting for local variations of each data layer and weights w assigned to each of the seven data layers to show the relative significance of each data layer this was originally given by aller et al 1987 but there is no theory behind the selected data layers their rates and weights as well as there is no methodology for empirical measurements for vi and hence the methodology is consensual it is expressed as 1 drastic i n d e x d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w where dr rr ar sr tr ir and cr are ratings and dw rw aw sw tw iw and cw are the weights of drastic data layers each data layer is subdivided into an appropriate number of classes to assign rates in the range of 1 to 10 the prescribed weights range from 1 to 5 the general procedure for applying the drastic framework is that a study area is divided into a number of grid areas each is referred to as a pixel the composition of each of the seven data layers at each pixel are processed by collating the appropriate data information maps at the preliminary stage towards forming datasets as outlined in section 4 1 3 1 1 1 target values one set of data necessary for running supervised drastic models is having observed data but as stated in section 3 1 1 there are no method to measure vi values thus nitrate n values are used as proxies for vi measurements to serve as the basis for deriving target values for supervised models to map vi values however nitrate n values are normally discrete values available at selected observation well and therefore the following procedure is used to generate target nitrate n values for the whole study area nadiri et al 2018a i examine the record and discard the seemingly anomalous values ii condition the discrete values at each and all of selected withdrawal well as given below iii using kriging interpolation method these values are distributed to each and all of the pixels the conditioned vi values are expressed as 2 c v i vi max no 3 n m a x no 3 n i where index i counts the number of observation well no3 n max is the maximum nitrate concentration vi max is the maximum vulnerability calculated from drastic framework and cvi is the conditioned or normalised vi notably eq 2 is used by the authors e g see nadiri et al 2017a 3 2 forming multiple frameworks mfs at level 1 the paper forms two frameworks which use unsupervised approaches to learn weight values these methodologies are outlined below 3 2 1 basic drastic framework bdf the rates are originally given by aller et al 1987 and cover a comprehensive range of physical conditions that may be encountered in practice although their values can be identified by optimisation techniques for each site e g nadiri et al 2017c b the original values are often treated as fair and retained without optimising their values bdf formulated in the paper uses the rate and weight values as originally given by aller et al 1987 the paper investigates subjectivity in the values of the weight of the drastic data layers but bdf just uses the original values the higher calculated vi values are indicative of regions vulnerable to groundwater pollution potential notably the minimum possible vi is 23 and its maximum possible value is 230 whilst the individual values do not mean much the full range is often divided into three to five bands and the paper divides the range into the following five bands band 1 23 64 band 2 64 106 band 3 106 147 band 4 147 189 and band 5 189 230 notably there is no empirical or theoretical approach for banding and therefore labelling the bands as very low low medium high and very high creates the risk for misinterpretation bdf was implemented in a gis platform 3 2 1 1 fuzzy catastrophe framework fcf the paper uses the fuzzy catastrophe framework fcf described by sadeghfam et al 2016 and nadiri et al 2018b d which is adopted from the multicriteria decision making theory introduced by cheng et al 1996 fcf is an unsupervised learning technique and the paper presents its further application in which assigning rates uses those for bdf but weights are learned from site specific data through an unsupervised procedure by combining membership function in fuzzy logic with catastrophe theory as outlined below fuzzy logic given by zadeh 1965 uses key concepts of fuzzy sets membership functions and fuzzy inference engines catastrophe theory given by thom 1972 uses key concepts of a set of independent parameters known as control parameters and a function of dependent variables known as state variables both techniques are well developed and now serve as sophisticated modelling techniques the actual assigning of the weight values in fcf uses the number of classes in the rate values of each data layer as explained below the rate at each pixel of the seven data layers are normalised to produce dimensionless values in the range of 0 to 1 and hence the learned value of the rate values is also normalised the normalisation process involves two cases i for the five drastic data layers of r a s i c data layer values are directly proportional to vi in which case normalisation is expressed as 3a x i n x i x min x max x min ii for the two d and t data layer vi varies inversely proportional to actual values of data layers in which case normalisation is expressed as 3b x i n x max x i x max x min where i counts pixels xmax is maximum value of the data layer xmin is minimum and xi n normalises the value at the i th pixels learning weights the weight for each data layer is treated as a fuzzy variable as opposed to crisp variables and random variables using fl concepts fuzzy variables are vague quantities expressed as a matter of degree and represented in fuzzy sets by a partial membership function in the range of 0 1 with ambiguous boundaries and gradual transitions to account for inherent uncertainties for more details see grande et al 2010 functional expressions for membership function are one of the remaining weaknesses in deriving fuzzy inference engines and this is normally through a trial and error procedure but this problem is resolved by the multicriteria decision theory based on catastrophe theory the decision theory considers the number of classes in each data layer as a more objective way for selecting the type of catastrophe functions thus for a data layer with one class the fold catastrophe is selected to serve as its membership function where fold catastrophes have one state parameters as shown in table 2 the other selections are a cusp catastrophe with 2 control variables is selected for data layers with 2 classes a swallowtail catastrophe with 3 control variables is selected for data layers with 3 classes a butterfly catastrophe with 4 control variables is selected for data layers with 4 classes a wigwam catastrophe with 5 control variables is selected for data layers with 5 classes fcf weight values are calculated for each data layers through the following steps i identify the number of classes in each data layer at a particular pixel and this sets the number of control parameters to select the type of catastrophe function ii calculate the mean value for each control parameter normalise the calculated mean values and define fuzzy catastrophe membership function and iii calculate priorities which expresses how control parameters classification of drastic parameters are dependent on state variables drastic parameters notably the drastic formulation does not require the complementary principle according to which each parameter indicates its own importance without affecting other parameters in decision making processes fcf was implemented in the matlab platform 3 3 forming multiple model mms at level 1 the values of the weights for each and all of the data layers are also modelled by two supervised modelling techniques and they are specified in this section 3 3 1 use genetic algorithm ga to optimise weights the paper uses genetic algorithm ga as a supervising technique to identify the values of the weights it is a bio inspired optimisation algorithm introduced by john holland holland 1975 with wide applications and is considered to generate high quality solutions to optimisation and search problems by emulating such genetic operators as mutation crossover and selection mitchell 1996 its search process use four evolutionary processes i initialisation ii selection iii crossover iv mutation davis 1991 initialisation comprise generate a population of chromosomes as a starting point select a fitness function objective function in terms of decision variable and constraints the initial population evolves as follows i the population in each iteration forms a generation with an assessment of the fitness of each individual in the population ii the genome of each individual evolves and forms a new generation through a modification recombined and mutated randomly iii the new generation of candidate solutions is used in the next iteration of the algorithm and iv the process is terminated at the maximum number of generations or when the modelled fitness level reaches a designated value the outputs of bdf ga are the weight values for each data layer the objective function to identify the weights wj of data layer in bdf ga by maximising the correlation coefficient eq 4 between vi and no3 n concentration using constrain 1 wj 5 j 1 2 7 4 o b j e c t i v e f u n c t i o n i 1 n v i v n i n i 1 n v i v 2 i 1 n n i n 2 where vi is vulnerability index v is mean vulnerability index n is the number of data points ni is the no3 n concentration and n mean of no3 n values the weights associated with the seven drastic data layers are treated as decision variables and the values of the weights are identified by minimising the objective function expressed by 4 using ga notably the procedure is a supervised learning in which the results for this model employ the training phase alone without the testing phase in this way this model serves as bridge between mfs and mms the software used in this study is the genexpro tools 4 0 software 3 3 2 use gene expression programming gep to optimise weights the weights are also identified by gep a bio inspired optimisation approach introduced by koza 1992 it is now a well tested technique and used by the paper to supervise the identification of the weights in which the search for solutions uses the parse tree structure built from a terminal set and a function set the function set is a set of basic operators log sin ln and the terminal set is the actual components of the functions and their parameters both sets collectively emulate the role of chromosomes in biological systems users define different types of functions for tree structure in gep through the following procedure i select the fitness function ii choose the terminal set and the function set for creating the chromosomes iii select the chromosomal architecture iv select the linking function and v select the genetic operators the model produces automatically a regression equation for prediction of unknown variables the software used in this study is the genexpro tools 4 0 software 3 4 formulating strategies at level 2 four strategies are formulated at level 2 and these comprise strategy 1 simple averaging sa of bdf bdf fcf bdf ga and bdf gep value at each and all of the pixels strategy 2 using support vector machines svm to combine the vi values by bdf and bdf fcf at each and all of the pixels strategy 3 using svm to combine the vi values by bdf ga and bdf gep at each and all of the pixels strategy 4 using svm to combine vi values from bdf bdf fcf bdf ga and bdf gep the outputs of mfs and mms are normalised to construct four strategies to overcome effects of different ranges in mapping outputs this section specifies svm and outlines the above strategies in more details 3 4 1 simple averaging sa simple averaging sa of vi values at each pixel is used to formulate strategy 1 and this serves as the basis for benchmarking the remaining strategies sa may be considered as an algorithm expressed for each pixel as follows 4a vi sa vi bdf vi fcf vi ga vi gep 4 o r vi sa w 1 vi bdf w 2 vi fcf w 3 vi ga w 4 vi gep 4c w h e r e w 1 w 2 w 3 w 4 0 25 3 4 1 1 support vector machine svm support vector machine svm is used at level 2 to combine vi values from mfs and or mms at level 1 svm is a supervised statistical learning technique vapnik 1998 which is a kernel based learning approach and uses a linear high dimensional hypothesis space called feature space for implicit kernel functions for mapping onto which the data are mapped svm is applied widely and its estimator predictor problems are similar to neural networks with similar weights and bias in this study the inputs to svm for strategies 1 to 3 comprise outputs from mfs and or mms at level 1 and the target values are outcomes of interpolating the cvi values as per eq 2 at each and all pixel values the estimator mode of svm identifies the values of the parameters inherent in svm under supervision by using the least squares technique with respect to the target values in this research svm ls is used as modified by suykens 2000 the kernel function in this study is expressed by the radial basis function rbf as 10 k x i x j e x p x i x j 2 œÉ 2 where œÉ is the parameter of kernel function used the least squares technique to identify Œ≥ and œÉ 3 4 1 2 strategy 1 use simple averaging to combine mms and mfs strategy 1 is formulated by combining the vi values from bdf bdf fcf bdf ga and bdf gep by simple averaging of vi values at each and all pixels expressed by eqs 4a or 4b 4c nadiri et al 2019 discuss strategies formulated by sa and reflect on existing literature showing that the rmse of the combined results are guaranteed mathematically to be lower than the mean of rmse of the individual set of results thus even the simple algorithm of averaging provides improved results and hence it is used as a benchmark which is discussed further in section 5 3 4 1 3 strategy 2 use support vector machine to combine mfs bdf and fcf strategy 2 is formed by combining mfs bdf and bdf fcf by using svm the implementation of svm in this strategy comprises i two input data as outputs of bdf and bdf fcf at the pixels selected for training and ii target values which use interpolated cvi values as per eq 2 at the pixels selected for training 3 4 1 4 strategy 3 use support vector machine to combine mms strategy 3 is formed by combining mms bdf ga and bdf gep by using svm the implementation of svm in this strategy comprises i two input data as outputs of bdf ga and bdf gep at the pixels selected for training and ii target values which use interpolated cvi values as per eq 2 at the pixels selected for training 3 4 1 5 strategy 4 use support vector machine to combine mms and mfs strategy 4 is formed by combining mfs bdf and bdf fcf and mms bdf ga and bdf gep by using svm the implementation of svm in this strategy comprises i four input data as outputs of bdf bdf fcf bdf ga and bdf gep at the pixels selected for training and ii target values which use interpolated cvi values as per eq 2 at the pixels selected for training 4 data management the manual and time consuming process of preparing datasets from raw data has been detailed elsewhere see nadiri et al 2017a 2018b the best practice procedure is outlined below with a focus on various decisions made for the preparation of the dataset 4 1 decision making bases for the model in this study the aquifer area is divided into 43 818 pixels and each pixel is associated with a set of 7 fields processed as thematic gis layers each of the 7 data fields or data layers is classified as per drastic standards aller et al 1987 an additional thematic layer was prepared related to the distribution of no3 n values which uses measured values within observation wells the preparation of these data layers are outlined below using the best available information table 3 4 2 training and testing data both bdf and bdf fcf are frameworks so their outputs are not supervised this is in contrast to bdf ga and bdf gep which use target values for the supervision in the optimisation process ga uses all the data to optimise for the weight value of the data layers and this is a transition between the frameworks and models whereas gep uses the dataset i e input and target data and randomly divides the data into training and testing phases in the proportion of 80 and 20 respectively target values are conditioned vi by the n o 3 n eq 2 4 3 performance criteria to evaluate frameworks correlation index ci nadiri et al 2017a and pearson correlation coefficient r are used to measure performance metric between vi and values and nitrate concentration additionally determination coefficient r 2 and root mean squar error rmse are used for evaluating mms by comparing vi values and cvi values for measuring performances over grids a more appropriate technique is the use of receiver operating characteristic roc together with area under the curve auc see agterberg and bonham carter 2005 which is applicable for both mfs and mms ci values are scale independent and are applied to pixels at observation wells ows where modelled vi values and measured nitrate n values are divided into five bands the values are calculated through the following steps i calculate the difference in number of bands for nitrate values and vulnerability bands which correspond to 0 1 2 3 and 4 ii assign weights of 5 4 3 2 and 1 respectively for each of the band differences iii multiply the count with their weights and sum the values notably the minimum ci value is 27 and its maximum value is 135 and the higher the value the better is the performance the r value or coefficient of correlation is a scale independent criterion and is calculated by covariance of two set of samples divide to product of their standard deviations it is a criterion commonly used to calculate statistical correlation between two variable and its values vary between 1 and 1 where 1 indicates a perfect inverse correlation between two variables and 1 indicates a perfect direct correlation between them the r 2 is product of r and located in range of 1 to 0 where it indicates maximum and minimum correlation between tow variables respectively the rmse value is a scale independent criterion and is in range of zero to where a value of 0 indicates a perfect model fit the auc and roc first introduced in electrical engineering is a metric of models with better fits the roc curve plots the true positive rate tpr at the y axis against the false positive rate fpr at the x axis in various threshold settings notably tpr is known as specificity recall or probability of detection in model and fpr as the fall out or probability of false alarm and calculated as 1 specificity the area under the curve in roc curves also serves as a performance metric and ranges between 0 5 and 1 where 0 5 is indicates zero correlation but a perfect match is when auc 1 5 result 5 1 results at level 0 individual data layers the study area was divided into square grid cells pixels with 50 m resolutions each pixel is a 2500 m2 in area and hence the total pixel numbers is 43818 each drastic layer can vary within each and all of the pixels fig 4 where their variations are captured by rating values processed as per best practice procedures outlined in section 4 the information within each data layer derives from i general purpose data as their initial productions are often for completely different reasons and ii site specific data such as pumpage the results are presented in fig 4 5 2 level 1 vi mapping by each of mfs 5 2 1 mapping by basic drastic framework the procedure for processing bdf is given in fig 3 and the processed raw data in terms of assigning their appropriate rates are presented in fig 4 the values presented in the figure are further processed by assigning the weight values of each data layer at each and all of the pixels and hence the calculated vi values are mapped in fig 5 a which overlays the values of 27 nitrate n datapoints at ows in the form of graduated circles over the modelled vulnerability indices table 6 shows performance metrics for bdf which shows the results to be fit for purpose 5 2 2 mapping by fuzzy catastrophe framework fcf processing fcf is rather an involved task as the values of the weights are learned from site specific data as laid out in table 6 the key is to select the catastrophe type and this is based on the number of classes associated with each data layer data layers of d r t and c are classified using us epa s drastic framework by aller et al 1987 however for the a s and i data layers the classification is based on their intrinsic characteristics table 4 shows the calculation procedure for each data layer and explains the steps the learned weight values are also given in the table including those for bdf for comparison purposes notably the learned weight values are unsupervised 5 3 level 1 vi mapping by each of mms 5 3 1 genetic algorithm vi values of the study area are mapped using the supervised ga modelling technique as per procedure given in fig 3 the methodology specified in sec 3 3 1 and the best practice procedure for data management outlined in section 4 the weights of each data layer are optimised as per the bdf ga model is trained to learn directly the values of the weights from the site data as well as from the target values acting as proxy of measured vulnerability but without testing the training the model performances the default ga parameters are given in table 5 the performance metrics at specific abstraction wells are given in table 6 which indicate a significant improvement compared with bdf and bdf fcf results notably the results cover all the datapoints without testing the fitted model the modelled values of weights are then assigned which are in the range of 1 to 7 and these are presented in table 4 for comparison purpose the vi map is given in fig 5c and this visually confirms the performance metrics in table 6 and according to both the results are fit for purpose 5 3 2 mapping by gep vi values of the study area are mapped using the supervised gep modelling technique as per procedure given in fig 3 the methodology specified in sec 3 3 1 and the best practice procedure for data management outlined in sec 4 the bdf gep model is trained to learn directly the values of the weights from the site data as well as from the target values acting as proxy of measured vulnerability the parameters and operators of the gep model are presented in table 5 which also show the four operators f1 f2 f3 and f4 investigated and their associated rmse values the table shows that f2 produces the lowest rmse value and therefore it is selected which is also relatively simpler than f3 and f4 5 vi d s r d s 5 12 a c a 6 29 i 6 12 s d as the derived equation for vi values is given in eq 5 in which weight values are implicit the vi results are mapped in fig 5d and the performance metrics of bdf gep are given in table 6 the figure and the table show that the results are fit for purpose and bdf gep has a significant improvement compared with bdf and bdf fcf results 5 4 level 2 mapping by combing mfs and or mms 5 4 1 vulnerability index vi mapping by strategy 1 strategy 1 is formulated to serve as a benchmark for the three other model combination strategies its implementation procedure is given in fig 3 the methodology is specified in sec 3 3 3 and involves no additional procedure for data management or training as discussed by nadiri et al 2019 there is a mathematical basis for model combination even by simple averaging to offer some improvement see nadiri et al 2019 this is evident from the performance metrics given in table 6 for ci or rmses according to which these values of the results by simple averaging are 115 and 4 72 which are better than the mean of the ci and rmse of the set of mf and mm results at level 1 which are 113 and 4 75 i e 115strategy 1 113mean of mfs mms and 4 72strategy 1 4 75mean of mfs mms the vi map by strategy 1 is given in fig 5e and discussed in in section 5 5 5 4 2 vi mapping by strategy 2 strategy 2 is formulated to combine the framework results at level 1 bdf and bdf fcf using the supervised svm ls for mapping vi values of the study area the outputs from bdf and bdf fcf in fig 5a b are used as input datasets and cvi values are used as target values the implementation procedure for strategy 2 is given in fig 3 the methodology is specified in section 3 3 4 the model runs require training to identify the values of the two parameters œÉ and Œ≥ by the least squares error method performance metrics for strategy 2 are given in table 6 and its vi map is given in fig 5f the improvements by the strategy are discussed later in sec 5 5 5 4 3 vi mapping by strategy 3 strategy 3 is formulated to combine the mms at level 1 bdf ga and bdf gep using the supervised svm ls for mapping vi values of the study area the outputs from bdf ga and bdf gep in fig 5c d are used as input dataset and cvi values are used as target values the implementation procedure for strategy 3 is given in fig 3 the methodology is specified in sec 3 3 5 the model runs require training to identify the values of the two parameters œÉ and Œ≥ by the least squares error method which are given in table 6 the performance metrics for strategy 3 are given in table 6 and the vi map is given in fig 5f the results are discussed in section 5 5 5 4 4 vi mapping by strategy 4 strategy 4 is formulated to combine the mfs and mms at level 1 bdf bdf fcf bdf ga and bdf gep using the supervised svm ls for mapping vi values of the study area the outputs from the results at level 1 in fig 5a d are used as input dataset and cvi values are used as target values the implementation procedure for strategy 3 is given in fig 3 the methodology is specified in sec 3 3 6 the model runs require training to identify the values of the two parameters œÉ and Œ≥ by the least squares error method which are given in table 6 performance metrics for strategy 4 are given in table 6 and the vi map is given in fig 5h the results are discussed below 5 5 inter comparison study of the results at level 1 and level 2 a sets of values presented in table 4 for the weights of the 7 data layers comprise i the bdf values given by aller et all 1987 which serve as base values ii the bdf fcf values learned from the data by the unsupervised fcf procedure iii the explicit bdf ga values learned by supervised optimisation techniques and iv implicit bdf gep equation learned by supervised optimisation techniques given by eq 5 whilst a direct comparison is not possible with bdf its range is from 1 to 5 but the fcf and ga have a range from 1 to 7 and for gep there is no limit bdf fcf has similarities with bdf but sharp contrasts as well e g the t data layer performances of bdf ga and bdf gep cannot be compared directly as there are several methodological difference between them but their results in terms of performance metrics are close to each other given a chance to existing practices the tendency would be to compare the 5 sets of performance metrics presented in table 6 for identifying a superior technique the authors have no such intention as the best identified in one study is not necessarily the best in other studies or when using a different modelling strategy the aim here is to maximise the information extraction consider the improvements by bdf fcf over bdf in terms of ci values 105 and 110 respectively and r values 0 69 and 0 71 respectively and these are seemingly reflected in auc 0 942 and 0 944 a visual comparison indicates the map by bdf and bdf fcf are close to each but bdf fcf is somewhat closer to observed nitrate n values and therefore even unsupervised learning is helpful table 6 also shows a key finding that by increasing level of supervision see column 1 there is a detectable level of improvements in each of the performance metrics see columns 3 8 the roc auc performance metrics shown in fig 6 a c provide a rather deeper view of convergences and divergences in the results the more closer the performance curves to the 45 line the larger is noise in the model fittings in contrast the more curvy the auc line becomes the greater is correlation within the mapping outputs to the extent that more triangular results signify less noise and greater correlation bradley 1997 to this extent auc values show senstivity to other performance metrics and at the same time they provide a greater feel for the distribution of convergences and divergences the metrics displayed in fig 6 show graphically the positive role of unsupervised learning and supervised learning on improving model performances by producing sharper corners a similar comparison may be carried out between each and all of the 8 sets of results they all point toward one overall finding that the greater the level of learning the greater is the match between the trained results and observed nitrate n values or their correlations and to this end strategy 4 emulates the the observed values more closely than any other set of the vi mapping there is also a visual evidence for this by just comparing the distributed patterns in fig 5h with fig 4h also the results in table 6 indicate that the results of supervised learning emulate the observed values more closely than those of unsupervised results compare fig 5g f e d and fig 5b a with fig 4h and by the same token the unsupervised results more closely than bdf with prescribed rating and weighting arguably one expects that the truth of these findings are quite general although not investigated in this study one expects that different strategies at level 2 may lead to different patterns of emulating the observed values for producing more defencible results it would be a good practice policy to try a few level 2 modelling strategies e g select the model at level 2 by a different ai technique such as ann fuzzy logic 6 discussion the investigation presented in the paper is an outcome of a research program undertaken by the authors over the years to both study the ongoing environmental problems and develop the state of the art techniques for study areas with sparse data under sparse data the defensibility of the results can be undermined but the investigation presented here reveals that defensible results are still possible by i using unsupervised supervised learning techniques fijani et al 2013 nadiri et al 2017a b c and ii learning from the convergence and divergences of different sets of results through two levels of multiple models frameworks neshat and pradhan 2015 baghapour et al 2016 jafari and nikoo 2017 nadiri et al 2018a the distribution of nitrate n in the study area is obtained by distributing 27 number of observed values and therefore they are subject to uncertainty but these are the only information available this signifies that as and when new measured values become available the decisions based on the previous studies have to be revised such revisions would be normally the tasks for planning authorities but in the case of all provinces in iran such authorities if functioning would follow top down policies with not much role for decision making by participation the procedure developed in the paper would be suitable for any type of evidence based planning systems the nitrate n mapping in fig 4h reflects specific vulnerability areas defined as a direct impact of contamination from anthropogenic origins stemming from recent changes in land use due to uncontrolled agricultural practices up to recent years and not before 1990s agricultural practices were largely based on traditional practices which were often sustainable practices if there were any adverse impacts they were often of local consequences recent changes in agricultural practices were invariably included the use of modern fertilisers at an intensive scale which were associated with contaminating groundwater resources vi mapping is one way to bring to light the adverse impacts of these poor agricultural practices and it is hoped that these finding would soon translate into actions plans to reduce contamination and to mitigate the impacts a cursory view of the proportion of areas within each band in fig 5 see its legends leads to an important insight into the scale of contamination problems in the study area average modelled values using the 8 sets of results of the proportion of the areas within bands 1 to 5 are 30 21 25 15 and 9 bands 1 and 2 sweep just half of the study area but the remaining half of the study area is swept by bands 3 4 and 5 which are located largely within the centre of the study area and band 5 expands as much as its 10 near urban areas such as malekan and the banks of watercourses encroachments onto the aquifer are therefore evident within bands 3 4 and 5 this evidently reflects on poor planning practices at level 1 bdf shows the mapping of intrinsic vi and the three bdf fcf bdf ga and bdf gep show those of specific vi similarly the strategies at level 2 use the same targets as at level 1 and hence they also produce specific vi improvements associated with strategy 2 and strategy 3 are attributed to using supervised learning for combining mfs or mms at level 1 respectively the subsequent improvements are similar to those reported by fijani et al 2013 and nadiri et al 2017a and 2018a at level 2 band 1 and band 3 seem to be more susceptible to variations the variability in the proportion of each band associated with each set of results is also interesting the results in the legend of fig 5 indicates that the techniques without some sort of supervision are biased towards lower bands but supervision brings the results more towards measured and distributed nitrate n displayed in fig 4h therefore using more sophisticated techniques such as strategy 4 pays back in producing more defensible results the benefits of such improved results on planning control is obvious vulnerability mapping for the study area is an academic initiative and it reveals poor planning practices as industrial agricultural activities encroach onto urban areas surrounding the city centre of malekan melik kendi and its south which impact on contaminating the aquifer studies of this nature may be used to encourage a blame culture and often target agricultural users at the expense of treating the root of the problem the fact is that the planning system in iran is not based on scientifically driven plans and strategies and existing system of decision making and planning system is yet to adopt to the principles of sustainable development risk based decision making and decision making by participation the room for improvements is vast and various academic studies by the authors and others reveal the need for sustainable basin management plans and strategies 7 conclusion this paper investigates the role of different modelling strategies in learning the weighting values in drastic based aquifer vulnerability index vi mapping under sparse data vulnerability mapping provides a proactive insight into aquifers at risk of contamination and can be tools for planning practices and therefore they have to be defensible this study is focussed on a study area already exposed to contamination due to poor planning activities and aims to develop defensible tools for possible future planning practices which can be used in any study area particularly with sparse data the paper investigates the extraction of information through using artificial intelligence to run multiple models and or multiple frameworks aimm mf the strategy employed is at two levels as follows at level 1 two frameworks are constructed and comprise bdf basic drastic framework with prescribed rating and weighting values embedded in drastic and bdf fcf fuzzy catastrophe framework for unsupervised learning of the weighting values by using the decision theory based on the hybrid of fuzzy theory and catastrophe theory also at level 1 two models are constructed and comprise bdf ga genetic algorithm in which the supervised ga learns the weighting values from the site specific data but without testing and bdf gep genetic expression programming in which gep is used to learn the same weighting values but with testing at level 2 four strategies are formulated to combine the frameworks and models at level 1 for producing alternative models of predicting vulnerability values for the study area these comprise strategy 1 is a simple averaging to serve for benchmarking strategy 2 uses support vector machine svm for combining bdf and bdf fcf strategy 3 uses svm for combining bdf ga and bdf gep strategy 4 uses svm for combining bdf bdf fcf bdf ga and bdf gep the mfs and mms as well as the modelling strategies have a deliberate level of improved learning capabilities and these are detected in the performance metrics the results show that the frameworks models at level 1 indeed capture a level of rising improvements in the performance metrics for the study area the observed improvement continues with the strategies formulated at level 2 the emerging conclusion is that the level of supervision and the level of model combination have significant bearing on making defensible the outputs of vulnerability mapping even when site specific data are sparse whilst the strategy of modelling at two levels is generic and applicable to any study area or to any other framework such as sintacs gods or avi maximising the extracted

6464,production of defensible modelling tools for aquifer vulnerability mapping under the conditions of sparse data remains topical using the drastic framework drastic is the acronym for seven data layers using a prescribed scoring system in terms of rates to account for local variations and weights to account for the relative importance of data layers also the term framework signifies the consensual nature of choosing the data layers without any theoretical or empirical basis artificial intelligence ai or similar techniques are used to reduce inherent subjectivities through a strategy of unsupervised learning from data by formulating multiple frameworks mf and supervised learning from multiple models mms without searching for any superior model notably a framework lacks the procedure for iterative training and testing as usual in modelling procedures in this strategy models are organised in two hierarchical levels level 1 comprises the construction of mfs two frameworks and or mms two models level 2 comprises a model or an algorithm to reuse the outputs from level 1 through formulating four strategies including a mixture of mfs mms in which support vector machine svm is chosen by the paper to run models at level 2 the supervision process uses target values as a function of observed nitrate n values the strategy is applied to the aquifer in the malekan region where the past extensive agricultural practices have been transformed into intensive use of fertilisers without protecting water quality in the aquifers results show that aimm mf lead to significant

introduction an investigation is presented in this paper on mapping aquifer vulnerability index vi with a focus on combining multiple frameworks mf and multiple models mm through various strategies where frameworks refer to unsupervised learning for mapping outputs and models to their supervised learning vulnerability mapping in the form of indices is widely practiced for aquifer management since the availability of basic techniques e g drastic aller et al 1987 sintacs civita 1994 god foster 1987 and avi stempvoort et al 1993 these frameworks put consensually together a number of data layers and that of drastic is used widely for aquifers vulnerable to manmade pollutions it is a grid based approach and examples of its applications include merchant 1994 melloul and collin 1998 cameron and peloso 2001 al adamat et al 2003 baalousha 2006 jamrah et al 2007 sener et al 2009 massone et al 2010 javadi et al 2010 the pollutant loads may arise from various sources including fertilisers halliday and wolfe 1991 petroleum hydrocarbons wang et al 2007 pesticides ahmed 2009 and as well as salinisation stigter et al 2006 motevalli et al 2018 the paper is focused on mapping vulnerability due to nitrate pollutions a pivotal issue in the topical research on vi mapping using drastic is to treat their inherent subjectivities which arises due to using expert opinion in prescribing weights and rates for the seven general purpose drastic data layers these are defined in due course and are given by aller et al 1987 but their rationales comprise i rates are assigned to account for local variations ii weights prescribe the relative importance of each data layer in the overall value of vulnerability and iii joint contributions of these data layers are consensually treated as an intrinsic aquifer vulnerability to anthropogenic pollutants the authors refer to the drastic rationale as a framework for consensually selecting the data layers but not as a model or a method for not being able to use training and testing procedures and investigate subjectivity by a program of research the authors have reviewed elsewhere the various techniques on reducing subjectivity inherent in the rationale of drastic see sadeghfam et al 2016 nadiri et al 2017a b c nadiri et al 2018a b c as well as by others see jafari et al 2016 neshat and pradhan 2017 jang et al 2017 a review of research by others is not repeated here but some of the authors works summarised in table 1 include applying artificial intelligence ai and machine learning techniques to reduce inherent subjectivities arguing that the mapped specific vulnerability indices can be affected by complex aquifer layouts different modelling techniques and formulating various modelling strategies the investigations by the author s uses ai techniques managed in hierarchies at least at two levels at level 1 mfs or mms of the drastic framework are formulated through their appropriate best practice procedure at level 2 a further model or algorithm is employed to combine mfs or mms through a simple strategy in which inputs to level 2 are taken from outputs of mfs and or mms at level 1 arguably the scope for research on this innovatory model combination strategy is wide ai and machine learning techniques have now become tools of practical applications and therefore their reviews are precluded in the paper but an overview is that these were largely transformed into modelling tools in late 1980s and early 1990s ai techniques are largely inspired by the deep working of the species e g genetic algorithm ga genetic expression programs gep fuzzy logic fl a widely known machine learning technique is support vector machine svm which has inbuilt techniques to learn the values of inherent parameters from the available data without human interventions these techniques are used in the paper and specified in due course but there is a vast array of techniques and variations not covered in the paper for more details references may be made to rajashekaran and vijayalksmi 2004 and nadiri et al 2015 notably one such technique relates to dynamic systems treated by a range of techniques including catastrophe theory although this is not used directly here the paper uses its hybrid with fl as embedded in the multicriteria decision making theory introduced by cheng et al 1996 the various strategies reported by the authors table 1 provide a proof of concept for the innovatory model combination rationale the strategies reflected in table 1 use i frameworks which refer to unsupervised vi mapping techniques in which the term framework underlines a lack of theory or empiricism in the formulation and normally without testing the prediction results and ii models which refer to supervised vi mapping techniques processed through training and testing phases evidently one gap in these strategies is the absence of any investigation on the performance of combining mfs with mms which is tested in this paper the paper formulates i mfs at level 1 by using basic drastic framework bdf with prescribed values of rates and weights and fuzzy catastrophe framework bdf fcf which learns the weights by using the bdf rates ii mms at level 1 by using genetic algorithm bdf ga which learns weights from data but uses rates as in bdf through training but not testing and genetic expression program bdf gep which learns weights from data but uses rates as in bdf through both training and testing phases the key novelty of the paper is the formulation of four strategies from the above mfs and or mms as follows strategy 1 uses the algorithm of simple averaging of the four mapping techniques bdf bdf fcf bdf ga and bdf gep and serves as the basis for benchmarking strategy 2 uses svm at level 2 to combine bdf bdf fcf strategy 3 uses svm to combine bdf ga and bdf gep and strategy 4 uses svm to combine bdf bdf fcf bdf ga and bdf gep the paper uses malekan aquifer to test the performances of the above four strategies from combined mfs and mms attention is drawn to the clarification of a number of terms used consistently in the paper intrinsic groundwater vulnerability refers to the application of the drastic framework or of mfs without the benefit of any observed values whereas specific vulnerability refers to the benefits of learning from measurements of contaminant such as nitrate serving as a proxy for the concept of vulnerability serving as target values in mms and in combinations of mfs and mms the term framework used consistently by the authors refers to i consensually putting together a number of data layers without any theoretical or empirical justification ii the opportunity for learning the values of inherent rates and or weights in mfs is limited to unsupervised techniques and therefore the best practice procedure of training and testing is not feasible and iii outcomes of mfs are intrinsic vulnerability indices in contrast the benefits of mms include i observed values are used as a proxy for specific vulnerability and therefore target values are formulated by some sort of conditioning the values of observed contaminants ii best practice procedure of modelling practices are employed through training and testing and iii the outcomes of the learning from the values of the weights lead to mapping specific vulnerability indices 2 study area the malekan widely known as melik kendi plain is located in the east azerbaijan province southeast of lake urmia northwestern iran fig 1 the plain is approx 450 km2 and is a sub basin to the jighati basin as part of one of the 12 aquifers surrounding lake urmia the malekan region is limited from the north to maragheh bonab plain and to miandoab plain from south and southwest the average annual precipitation and mean annual temperature are respectively 273 mm and 21 7 c malekan weather station 1987 2017 in general average monthly relative humidity at the malekan synoptic station ranges from 51 june to 73 february malekan weather station 1987 2017 according to the malekan weather station data and based on the emberger method emberger 1952 the region is located in a cold and dry climate the malekan basin drains the basin of murduchay murdu river over a catchment of 750 km2 and flows into jigatichay simineh rud a major river contributing to the lake urmia closed basin as one of its 12 sub basins the study area only covers the plain 450 km2 over an aquifer as the actual study area the plain is formed by murduchay as well as by its major tributary leylanchay leylan river rising from western border of sahand ranges and also drain the lesser mountains ranges between the malekan plain and maragheh bonab plain murduchay with the annual discharge of 132 mm3 flows in a southerly direction through the city of malekan melik kendi recent expansions on agriculture industry and population are without any significant planning system as typical of the country by and large thus the quality and quantity of groundwater resources are often undermined and this poses risks to human health the malekan basin is made up of multiple geological formations including the lalun and ruteh formations of the permian age located in the east and south of the region respectively as shown in fig 2 i the eastern and northeastern parts of the region comprise the shemshak formation ii the northern and northeastern parts of the region is situated in the lar formation of triassic and jurassic periods shahrabi 1972 and iii southern and southeastern portions comprise evaporates including limestone marl gypsum of the cretaceous periods and iv the study area is located to the west of the older formations largely overlain by quaternary alluvial deposits fig 2b c also presents cross sections indicating possible structure in the aquifer residents of malekan plain approx 138 000 population suffer from pollution due to vast agricultural moderate industrial mining and animal husbandry activities recent agricultural practices have exposed groundwater quality to contamination due to the use of fertilisers and pesticides the nitrate n concentration values in groundwater in the study area exceed the world health organisations who 2009 allowable limits by as much as 18 folds thus groundwater vulnerability mapping can serve as a management tool in the future although credible planning practices are yet to emerge the encroachments emerged over the years since 1990s due to poor planning practices lacking appropriate levels of connections between planners and agricultural practitioners extensive farms and grape vineyards in the study area have resorted to intensive uses of fertilisers impacts are several but include those on water quantity and quality as outlined below the aquifer in the plain is unconfined which is a product of old and recent alluvial terraces alluvial fans and fluvial sediments the drilling well logs and geophysical data are indicative of fine grained materials at the western part of the plain which are permeable based on 26 pumping tests carried out in the plain by the east azerbaijan regional water authority earwa the transmissivity of the malekan plain aquifer varies between 4 and 650 m2 d the average value of aquifer storage coefficient is approx 3 2 the absolute hydraulic gradient at the entries of the plain is 0 006 and that is 0 001 at its exit the volume of the aquifer water is declining as during 2016 17 it discharged 5 mm3 more than it recharged due to supply agricultural demands eawa 2018 groundwater levels vary from 1279 m to 1328 m above the mean sea level groundwater flow directions are roughly in the directions towards the west and southwest of the plain groundwater in the aquifer is withdrawn through 4900 water wells 6 springs and 4 qanats there is a provision of 27 observation wells in the plain for monitoring groundwater levels their locations are distributed over the entire region as shown in fig 2 a sparse record of groundwater levels by earwa goes to 1970 hydrogeological properties of the aquifer layer and its thickness were estimated through 102 number of geoelectrical soundings and 16 profiles earwo 2018 it used 16 geoelectrical section in the ne sw and nw se direction see fig 2a b reproducing two of them the maximum thickness of the alluvia is reportedly located in the central and urban area of malekan which reaches approx 70 m and decreases towards the margins of the aquifer past hydrochemical studies reveal the dominance of bicarbonate in groundwater in the study area due to the ion exchange process in the miocene formations the water salinity increases in the west and northwest direction the average ph and electric conductivity in the malekan aquifer are 7 33 and 2740 ¬µ mho cm respectively the aquifer is vulnerable to the decline of groundwater level in the last 25 years due to the introduction of withdrawal wells and to modern agricultural practice with a further risk of pollution from uncontrolled industries the specific resistance of geological materials are noted to being decreasing due to fine grained deposits and the increase in total dissolved solids within groundwater from the east to west of the aquifer in recent years intensive uses of fertilisers and manure in farming and existing of grape farms are impacting groundwater quality groundwater quality is believed to have been good in the past but deteriorated fast through the introduction of intensive agricultural practices since circa 1990 the paper uses the 27 samples taken in 2015 as analysed in hydrochemical lab of the university of tabriz based on standard methods apha 1998 the measured nitrate n concentration is in ranges 2 8 to 189 mg l which is approx 18 folds in excess of permissible levels see sec 4 2 3 strategies for modelling aquifer vulnerability the paper builds on an aquifer vulnerability mapping practice in which modelling activities are carried out through strategies at two levels but preparing the data and making various decisions may be considered to form level 0 this sections presents the methodology for levels 0 1 and 2 3 1 level 0 framework structure and target values 3 1 1 underlying drastic concept the drastic framework employs seven different input data layers representing intrinsic potentials of the hydrogeologic and geomorphologic properties of aquifer systems to anthropogenic pollutions which comprise depth to water table d net recharge r aquifer media a soil media s topography t impact of the vadose zone i and hydraulic conductivity c the drastic vulnerability index vi is calculated as the sum of the products of prescribed ratings r accounting for local variations of each data layer and weights w assigned to each of the seven data layers to show the relative significance of each data layer this was originally given by aller et al 1987 but there is no theory behind the selected data layers their rates and weights as well as there is no methodology for empirical measurements for vi and hence the methodology is consensual it is expressed as 1 drastic i n d e x d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w where dr rr ar sr tr ir and cr are ratings and dw rw aw sw tw iw and cw are the weights of drastic data layers each data layer is subdivided into an appropriate number of classes to assign rates in the range of 1 to 10 the prescribed weights range from 1 to 5 the general procedure for applying the drastic framework is that a study area is divided into a number of grid areas each is referred to as a pixel the composition of each of the seven data layers at each pixel are processed by collating the appropriate data information maps at the preliminary stage towards forming datasets as outlined in section 4 1 3 1 1 1 target values one set of data necessary for running supervised drastic models is having observed data but as stated in section 3 1 1 there are no method to measure vi values thus nitrate n values are used as proxies for vi measurements to serve as the basis for deriving target values for supervised models to map vi values however nitrate n values are normally discrete values available at selected observation well and therefore the following procedure is used to generate target nitrate n values for the whole study area nadiri et al 2018a i examine the record and discard the seemingly anomalous values ii condition the discrete values at each and all of selected withdrawal well as given below iii using kriging interpolation method these values are distributed to each and all of the pixels the conditioned vi values are expressed as 2 c v i vi max no 3 n m a x no 3 n i where index i counts the number of observation well no3 n max is the maximum nitrate concentration vi max is the maximum vulnerability calculated from drastic framework and cvi is the conditioned or normalised vi notably eq 2 is used by the authors e g see nadiri et al 2017a 3 2 forming multiple frameworks mfs at level 1 the paper forms two frameworks which use unsupervised approaches to learn weight values these methodologies are outlined below 3 2 1 basic drastic framework bdf the rates are originally given by aller et al 1987 and cover a comprehensive range of physical conditions that may be encountered in practice although their values can be identified by optimisation techniques for each site e g nadiri et al 2017c b the original values are often treated as fair and retained without optimising their values bdf formulated in the paper uses the rate and weight values as originally given by aller et al 1987 the paper investigates subjectivity in the values of the weight of the drastic data layers but bdf just uses the original values the higher calculated vi values are indicative of regions vulnerable to groundwater pollution potential notably the minimum possible vi is 23 and its maximum possible value is 230 whilst the individual values do not mean much the full range is often divided into three to five bands and the paper divides the range into the following five bands band 1 23 64 band 2 64 106 band 3 106 147 band 4 147 189 and band 5 189 230 notably there is no empirical or theoretical approach for banding and therefore labelling the bands as very low low medium high and very high creates the risk for misinterpretation bdf was implemented in a gis platform 3 2 1 1 fuzzy catastrophe framework fcf the paper uses the fuzzy catastrophe framework fcf described by sadeghfam et al 2016 and nadiri et al 2018b d which is adopted from the multicriteria decision making theory introduced by cheng et al 1996 fcf is an unsupervised learning technique and the paper presents its further application in which assigning rates uses those for bdf but weights are learned from site specific data through an unsupervised procedure by combining membership function in fuzzy logic with catastrophe theory as outlined below fuzzy logic given by zadeh 1965 uses key concepts of fuzzy sets membership functions and fuzzy inference engines catastrophe theory given by thom 1972 uses key concepts of a set of independent parameters known as control parameters and a function of dependent variables known as state variables both techniques are well developed and now serve as sophisticated modelling techniques the actual assigning of the weight values in fcf uses the number of classes in the rate values of each data layer as explained below the rate at each pixel of the seven data layers are normalised to produce dimensionless values in the range of 0 to 1 and hence the learned value of the rate values is also normalised the normalisation process involves two cases i for the five drastic data layers of r a s i c data layer values are directly proportional to vi in which case normalisation is expressed as 3a x i n x i x min x max x min ii for the two d and t data layer vi varies inversely proportional to actual values of data layers in which case normalisation is expressed as 3b x i n x max x i x max x min where i counts pixels xmax is maximum value of the data layer xmin is minimum and xi n normalises the value at the i th pixels learning weights the weight for each data layer is treated as a fuzzy variable as opposed to crisp variables and random variables using fl concepts fuzzy variables are vague quantities expressed as a matter of degree and represented in fuzzy sets by a partial membership function in the range of 0 1 with ambiguous boundaries and gradual transitions to account for inherent uncertainties for more details see grande et al 2010 functional expressions for membership function are one of the remaining weaknesses in deriving fuzzy inference engines and this is normally through a trial and error procedure but this problem is resolved by the multicriteria decision theory based on catastrophe theory the decision theory considers the number of classes in each data layer as a more objective way for selecting the type of catastrophe functions thus for a data layer with one class the fold catastrophe is selected to serve as its membership function where fold catastrophes have one state parameters as shown in table 2 the other selections are a cusp catastrophe with 2 control variables is selected for data layers with 2 classes a swallowtail catastrophe with 3 control variables is selected for data layers with 3 classes a butterfly catastrophe with 4 control variables is selected for data layers with 4 classes a wigwam catastrophe with 5 control variables is selected for data layers with 5 classes fcf weight values are calculated for each data layers through the following steps i identify the number of classes in each data layer at a particular pixel and this sets the number of control parameters to select the type of catastrophe function ii calculate the mean value for each control parameter normalise the calculated mean values and define fuzzy catastrophe membership function and iii calculate priorities which expresses how control parameters classification of drastic parameters are dependent on state variables drastic parameters notably the drastic formulation does not require the complementary principle according to which each parameter indicates its own importance without affecting other parameters in decision making processes fcf was implemented in the matlab platform 3 3 forming multiple model mms at level 1 the values of the weights for each and all of the data layers are also modelled by two supervised modelling techniques and they are specified in this section 3 3 1 use genetic algorithm ga to optimise weights the paper uses genetic algorithm ga as a supervising technique to identify the values of the weights it is a bio inspired optimisation algorithm introduced by john holland holland 1975 with wide applications and is considered to generate high quality solutions to optimisation and search problems by emulating such genetic operators as mutation crossover and selection mitchell 1996 its search process use four evolutionary processes i initialisation ii selection iii crossover iv mutation davis 1991 initialisation comprise generate a population of chromosomes as a starting point select a fitness function objective function in terms of decision variable and constraints the initial population evolves as follows i the population in each iteration forms a generation with an assessment of the fitness of each individual in the population ii the genome of each individual evolves and forms a new generation through a modification recombined and mutated randomly iii the new generation of candidate solutions is used in the next iteration of the algorithm and iv the process is terminated at the maximum number of generations or when the modelled fitness level reaches a designated value the outputs of bdf ga are the weight values for each data layer the objective function to identify the weights wj of data layer in bdf ga by maximising the correlation coefficient eq 4 between vi and no3 n concentration using constrain 1 wj 5 j 1 2 7 4 o b j e c t i v e f u n c t i o n i 1 n v i v n i n i 1 n v i v 2 i 1 n n i n 2 where vi is vulnerability index v is mean vulnerability index n is the number of data points ni is the no3 n concentration and n mean of no3 n values the weights associated with the seven drastic data layers are treated as decision variables and the values of the weights are identified by minimising the objective function expressed by 4 using ga notably the procedure is a supervised learning in which the results for this model employ the training phase alone without the testing phase in this way this model serves as bridge between mfs and mms the software used in this study is the genexpro tools 4 0 software 3 3 2 use gene expression programming gep to optimise weights the weights are also identified by gep a bio inspired optimisation approach introduced by koza 1992 it is now a well tested technique and used by the paper to supervise the identification of the weights in which the search for solutions uses the parse tree structure built from a terminal set and a function set the function set is a set of basic operators log sin ln and the terminal set is the actual components of the functions and their parameters both sets collectively emulate the role of chromosomes in biological systems users define different types of functions for tree structure in gep through the following procedure i select the fitness function ii choose the terminal set and the function set for creating the chromosomes iii select the chromosomal architecture iv select the linking function and v select the genetic operators the model produces automatically a regression equation for prediction of unknown variables the software used in this study is the genexpro tools 4 0 software 3 4 formulating strategies at level 2 four strategies are formulated at level 2 and these comprise strategy 1 simple averaging sa of bdf bdf fcf bdf ga and bdf gep value at each and all of the pixels strategy 2 using support vector machines svm to combine the vi values by bdf and bdf fcf at each and all of the pixels strategy 3 using svm to combine the vi values by bdf ga and bdf gep at each and all of the pixels strategy 4 using svm to combine vi values from bdf bdf fcf bdf ga and bdf gep the outputs of mfs and mms are normalised to construct four strategies to overcome effects of different ranges in mapping outputs this section specifies svm and outlines the above strategies in more details 3 4 1 simple averaging sa simple averaging sa of vi values at each pixel is used to formulate strategy 1 and this serves as the basis for benchmarking the remaining strategies sa may be considered as an algorithm expressed for each pixel as follows 4a vi sa vi bdf vi fcf vi ga vi gep 4 o r vi sa w 1 vi bdf w 2 vi fcf w 3 vi ga w 4 vi gep 4c w h e r e w 1 w 2 w 3 w 4 0 25 3 4 1 1 support vector machine svm support vector machine svm is used at level 2 to combine vi values from mfs and or mms at level 1 svm is a supervised statistical learning technique vapnik 1998 which is a kernel based learning approach and uses a linear high dimensional hypothesis space called feature space for implicit kernel functions for mapping onto which the data are mapped svm is applied widely and its estimator predictor problems are similar to neural networks with similar weights and bias in this study the inputs to svm for strategies 1 to 3 comprise outputs from mfs and or mms at level 1 and the target values are outcomes of interpolating the cvi values as per eq 2 at each and all pixel values the estimator mode of svm identifies the values of the parameters inherent in svm under supervision by using the least squares technique with respect to the target values in this research svm ls is used as modified by suykens 2000 the kernel function in this study is expressed by the radial basis function rbf as 10 k x i x j e x p x i x j 2 œÉ 2 where œÉ is the parameter of kernel function used the least squares technique to identify Œ≥ and œÉ 3 4 1 2 strategy 1 use simple averaging to combine mms and mfs strategy 1 is formulated by combining the vi values from bdf bdf fcf bdf ga and bdf gep by simple averaging of vi values at each and all pixels expressed by eqs 4a or 4b 4c nadiri et al 2019 discuss strategies formulated by sa and reflect on existing literature showing that the rmse of the combined results are guaranteed mathematically to be lower than the mean of rmse of the individual set of results thus even the simple algorithm of averaging provides improved results and hence it is used as a benchmark which is discussed further in section 5 3 4 1 3 strategy 2 use support vector machine to combine mfs bdf and fcf strategy 2 is formed by combining mfs bdf and bdf fcf by using svm the implementation of svm in this strategy comprises i two input data as outputs of bdf and bdf fcf at the pixels selected for training and ii target values which use interpolated cvi values as per eq 2 at the pixels selected for training 3 4 1 4 strategy 3 use support vector machine to combine mms strategy 3 is formed by combining mms bdf ga and bdf gep by using svm the implementation of svm in this strategy comprises i two input data as outputs of bdf ga and bdf gep at the pixels selected for training and ii target values which use interpolated cvi values as per eq 2 at the pixels selected for training 3 4 1 5 strategy 4 use support vector machine to combine mms and mfs strategy 4 is formed by combining mfs bdf and bdf fcf and mms bdf ga and bdf gep by using svm the implementation of svm in this strategy comprises i four input data as outputs of bdf bdf fcf bdf ga and bdf gep at the pixels selected for training and ii target values which use interpolated cvi values as per eq 2 at the pixels selected for training 4 data management the manual and time consuming process of preparing datasets from raw data has been detailed elsewhere see nadiri et al 2017a 2018b the best practice procedure is outlined below with a focus on various decisions made for the preparation of the dataset 4 1 decision making bases for the model in this study the aquifer area is divided into 43 818 pixels and each pixel is associated with a set of 7 fields processed as thematic gis layers each of the 7 data fields or data layers is classified as per drastic standards aller et al 1987 an additional thematic layer was prepared related to the distribution of no3 n values which uses measured values within observation wells the preparation of these data layers are outlined below using the best available information table 3 4 2 training and testing data both bdf and bdf fcf are frameworks so their outputs are not supervised this is in contrast to bdf ga and bdf gep which use target values for the supervision in the optimisation process ga uses all the data to optimise for the weight value of the data layers and this is a transition between the frameworks and models whereas gep uses the dataset i e input and target data and randomly divides the data into training and testing phases in the proportion of 80 and 20 respectively target values are conditioned vi by the n o 3 n eq 2 4 3 performance criteria to evaluate frameworks correlation index ci nadiri et al 2017a and pearson correlation coefficient r are used to measure performance metric between vi and values and nitrate concentration additionally determination coefficient r 2 and root mean squar error rmse are used for evaluating mms by comparing vi values and cvi values for measuring performances over grids a more appropriate technique is the use of receiver operating characteristic roc together with area under the curve auc see agterberg and bonham carter 2005 which is applicable for both mfs and mms ci values are scale independent and are applied to pixels at observation wells ows where modelled vi values and measured nitrate n values are divided into five bands the values are calculated through the following steps i calculate the difference in number of bands for nitrate values and vulnerability bands which correspond to 0 1 2 3 and 4 ii assign weights of 5 4 3 2 and 1 respectively for each of the band differences iii multiply the count with their weights and sum the values notably the minimum ci value is 27 and its maximum value is 135 and the higher the value the better is the performance the r value or coefficient of correlation is a scale independent criterion and is calculated by covariance of two set of samples divide to product of their standard deviations it is a criterion commonly used to calculate statistical correlation between two variable and its values vary between 1 and 1 where 1 indicates a perfect inverse correlation between two variables and 1 indicates a perfect direct correlation between them the r 2 is product of r and located in range of 1 to 0 where it indicates maximum and minimum correlation between tow variables respectively the rmse value is a scale independent criterion and is in range of zero to where a value of 0 indicates a perfect model fit the auc and roc first introduced in electrical engineering is a metric of models with better fits the roc curve plots the true positive rate tpr at the y axis against the false positive rate fpr at the x axis in various threshold settings notably tpr is known as specificity recall or probability of detection in model and fpr as the fall out or probability of false alarm and calculated as 1 specificity the area under the curve in roc curves also serves as a performance metric and ranges between 0 5 and 1 where 0 5 is indicates zero correlation but a perfect match is when auc 1 5 result 5 1 results at level 0 individual data layers the study area was divided into square grid cells pixels with 50 m resolutions each pixel is a 2500 m2 in area and hence the total pixel numbers is 43818 each drastic layer can vary within each and all of the pixels fig 4 where their variations are captured by rating values processed as per best practice procedures outlined in section 4 the information within each data layer derives from i general purpose data as their initial productions are often for completely different reasons and ii site specific data such as pumpage the results are presented in fig 4 5 2 level 1 vi mapping by each of mfs 5 2 1 mapping by basic drastic framework the procedure for processing bdf is given in fig 3 and the processed raw data in terms of assigning their appropriate rates are presented in fig 4 the values presented in the figure are further processed by assigning the weight values of each data layer at each and all of the pixels and hence the calculated vi values are mapped in fig 5 a which overlays the values of 27 nitrate n datapoints at ows in the form of graduated circles over the modelled vulnerability indices table 6 shows performance metrics for bdf which shows the results to be fit for purpose 5 2 2 mapping by fuzzy catastrophe framework fcf processing fcf is rather an involved task as the values of the weights are learned from site specific data as laid out in table 6 the key is to select the catastrophe type and this is based on the number of classes associated with each data layer data layers of d r t and c are classified using us epa s drastic framework by aller et al 1987 however for the a s and i data layers the classification is based on their intrinsic characteristics table 4 shows the calculation procedure for each data layer and explains the steps the learned weight values are also given in the table including those for bdf for comparison purposes notably the learned weight values are unsupervised 5 3 level 1 vi mapping by each of mms 5 3 1 genetic algorithm vi values of the study area are mapped using the supervised ga modelling technique as per procedure given in fig 3 the methodology specified in sec 3 3 1 and the best practice procedure for data management outlined in section 4 the weights of each data layer are optimised as per the bdf ga model is trained to learn directly the values of the weights from the site data as well as from the target values acting as proxy of measured vulnerability but without testing the training the model performances the default ga parameters are given in table 5 the performance metrics at specific abstraction wells are given in table 6 which indicate a significant improvement compared with bdf and bdf fcf results notably the results cover all the datapoints without testing the fitted model the modelled values of weights are then assigned which are in the range of 1 to 7 and these are presented in table 4 for comparison purpose the vi map is given in fig 5c and this visually confirms the performance metrics in table 6 and according to both the results are fit for purpose 5 3 2 mapping by gep vi values of the study area are mapped using the supervised gep modelling technique as per procedure given in fig 3 the methodology specified in sec 3 3 1 and the best practice procedure for data management outlined in sec 4 the bdf gep model is trained to learn directly the values of the weights from the site data as well as from the target values acting as proxy of measured vulnerability the parameters and operators of the gep model are presented in table 5 which also show the four operators f1 f2 f3 and f4 investigated and their associated rmse values the table shows that f2 produces the lowest rmse value and therefore it is selected which is also relatively simpler than f3 and f4 5 vi d s r d s 5 12 a c a 6 29 i 6 12 s d as the derived equation for vi values is given in eq 5 in which weight values are implicit the vi results are mapped in fig 5d and the performance metrics of bdf gep are given in table 6 the figure and the table show that the results are fit for purpose and bdf gep has a significant improvement compared with bdf and bdf fcf results 5 4 level 2 mapping by combing mfs and or mms 5 4 1 vulnerability index vi mapping by strategy 1 strategy 1 is formulated to serve as a benchmark for the three other model combination strategies its implementation procedure is given in fig 3 the methodology is specified in sec 3 3 3 and involves no additional procedure for data management or training as discussed by nadiri et al 2019 there is a mathematical basis for model combination even by simple averaging to offer some improvement see nadiri et al 2019 this is evident from the performance metrics given in table 6 for ci or rmses according to which these values of the results by simple averaging are 115 and 4 72 which are better than the mean of the ci and rmse of the set of mf and mm results at level 1 which are 113 and 4 75 i e 115strategy 1 113mean of mfs mms and 4 72strategy 1 4 75mean of mfs mms the vi map by strategy 1 is given in fig 5e and discussed in in section 5 5 5 4 2 vi mapping by strategy 2 strategy 2 is formulated to combine the framework results at level 1 bdf and bdf fcf using the supervised svm ls for mapping vi values of the study area the outputs from bdf and bdf fcf in fig 5a b are used as input datasets and cvi values are used as target values the implementation procedure for strategy 2 is given in fig 3 the methodology is specified in section 3 3 4 the model runs require training to identify the values of the two parameters œÉ and Œ≥ by the least squares error method performance metrics for strategy 2 are given in table 6 and its vi map is given in fig 5f the improvements by the strategy are discussed later in sec 5 5 5 4 3 vi mapping by strategy 3 strategy 3 is formulated to combine the mms at level 1 bdf ga and bdf gep using the supervised svm ls for mapping vi values of the study area the outputs from bdf ga and bdf gep in fig 5c d are used as input dataset and cvi values are used as target values the implementation procedure for strategy 3 is given in fig 3 the methodology is specified in sec 3 3 5 the model runs require training to identify the values of the two parameters œÉ and Œ≥ by the least squares error method which are given in table 6 the performance metrics for strategy 3 are given in table 6 and the vi map is given in fig 5f the results are discussed in section 5 5 5 4 4 vi mapping by strategy 4 strategy 4 is formulated to combine the mfs and mms at level 1 bdf bdf fcf bdf ga and bdf gep using the supervised svm ls for mapping vi values of the study area the outputs from the results at level 1 in fig 5a d are used as input dataset and cvi values are used as target values the implementation procedure for strategy 3 is given in fig 3 the methodology is specified in sec 3 3 6 the model runs require training to identify the values of the two parameters œÉ and Œ≥ by the least squares error method which are given in table 6 performance metrics for strategy 4 are given in table 6 and the vi map is given in fig 5h the results are discussed below 5 5 inter comparison study of the results at level 1 and level 2 a sets of values presented in table 4 for the weights of the 7 data layers comprise i the bdf values given by aller et all 1987 which serve as base values ii the bdf fcf values learned from the data by the unsupervised fcf procedure iii the explicit bdf ga values learned by supervised optimisation techniques and iv implicit bdf gep equation learned by supervised optimisation techniques given by eq 5 whilst a direct comparison is not possible with bdf its range is from 1 to 5 but the fcf and ga have a range from 1 to 7 and for gep there is no limit bdf fcf has similarities with bdf but sharp contrasts as well e g the t data layer performances of bdf ga and bdf gep cannot be compared directly as there are several methodological difference between them but their results in terms of performance metrics are close to each other given a chance to existing practices the tendency would be to compare the 5 sets of performance metrics presented in table 6 for identifying a superior technique the authors have no such intention as the best identified in one study is not necessarily the best in other studies or when using a different modelling strategy the aim here is to maximise the information extraction consider the improvements by bdf fcf over bdf in terms of ci values 105 and 110 respectively and r values 0 69 and 0 71 respectively and these are seemingly reflected in auc 0 942 and 0 944 a visual comparison indicates the map by bdf and bdf fcf are close to each but bdf fcf is somewhat closer to observed nitrate n values and therefore even unsupervised learning is helpful table 6 also shows a key finding that by increasing level of supervision see column 1 there is a detectable level of improvements in each of the performance metrics see columns 3 8 the roc auc performance metrics shown in fig 6 a c provide a rather deeper view of convergences and divergences in the results the more closer the performance curves to the 45 line the larger is noise in the model fittings in contrast the more curvy the auc line becomes the greater is correlation within the mapping outputs to the extent that more triangular results signify less noise and greater correlation bradley 1997 to this extent auc values show senstivity to other performance metrics and at the same time they provide a greater feel for the distribution of convergences and divergences the metrics displayed in fig 6 show graphically the positive role of unsupervised learning and supervised learning on improving model performances by producing sharper corners a similar comparison may be carried out between each and all of the 8 sets of results they all point toward one overall finding that the greater the level of learning the greater is the match between the trained results and observed nitrate n values or their correlations and to this end strategy 4 emulates the the observed values more closely than any other set of the vi mapping there is also a visual evidence for this by just comparing the distributed patterns in fig 5h with fig 4h also the results in table 6 indicate that the results of supervised learning emulate the observed values more closely than those of unsupervised results compare fig 5g f e d and fig 5b a with fig 4h and by the same token the unsupervised results more closely than bdf with prescribed rating and weighting arguably one expects that the truth of these findings are quite general although not investigated in this study one expects that different strategies at level 2 may lead to different patterns of emulating the observed values for producing more defencible results it would be a good practice policy to try a few level 2 modelling strategies e g select the model at level 2 by a different ai technique such as ann fuzzy logic 6 discussion the investigation presented in the paper is an outcome of a research program undertaken by the authors over the years to both study the ongoing environmental problems and develop the state of the art techniques for study areas with sparse data under sparse data the defensibility of the results can be undermined but the investigation presented here reveals that defensible results are still possible by i using unsupervised supervised learning techniques fijani et al 2013 nadiri et al 2017a b c and ii learning from the convergence and divergences of different sets of results through two levels of multiple models frameworks neshat and pradhan 2015 baghapour et al 2016 jafari and nikoo 2017 nadiri et al 2018a the distribution of nitrate n in the study area is obtained by distributing 27 number of observed values and therefore they are subject to uncertainty but these are the only information available this signifies that as and when new measured values become available the decisions based on the previous studies have to be revised such revisions would be normally the tasks for planning authorities but in the case of all provinces in iran such authorities if functioning would follow top down policies with not much role for decision making by participation the procedure developed in the paper would be suitable for any type of evidence based planning systems the nitrate n mapping in fig 4h reflects specific vulnerability areas defined as a direct impact of contamination from anthropogenic origins stemming from recent changes in land use due to uncontrolled agricultural practices up to recent years and not before 1990s agricultural practices were largely based on traditional practices which were often sustainable practices if there were any adverse impacts they were often of local consequences recent changes in agricultural practices were invariably included the use of modern fertilisers at an intensive scale which were associated with contaminating groundwater resources vi mapping is one way to bring to light the adverse impacts of these poor agricultural practices and it is hoped that these finding would soon translate into actions plans to reduce contamination and to mitigate the impacts a cursory view of the proportion of areas within each band in fig 5 see its legends leads to an important insight into the scale of contamination problems in the study area average modelled values using the 8 sets of results of the proportion of the areas within bands 1 to 5 are 30 21 25 15 and 9 bands 1 and 2 sweep just half of the study area but the remaining half of the study area is swept by bands 3 4 and 5 which are located largely within the centre of the study area and band 5 expands as much as its 10 near urban areas such as malekan and the banks of watercourses encroachments onto the aquifer are therefore evident within bands 3 4 and 5 this evidently reflects on poor planning practices at level 1 bdf shows the mapping of intrinsic vi and the three bdf fcf bdf ga and bdf gep show those of specific vi similarly the strategies at level 2 use the same targets as at level 1 and hence they also produce specific vi improvements associated with strategy 2 and strategy 3 are attributed to using supervised learning for combining mfs or mms at level 1 respectively the subsequent improvements are similar to those reported by fijani et al 2013 and nadiri et al 2017a and 2018a at level 2 band 1 and band 3 seem to be more susceptible to variations the variability in the proportion of each band associated with each set of results is also interesting the results in the legend of fig 5 indicates that the techniques without some sort of supervision are biased towards lower bands but supervision brings the results more towards measured and distributed nitrate n displayed in fig 4h therefore using more sophisticated techniques such as strategy 4 pays back in producing more defensible results the benefits of such improved results on planning control is obvious vulnerability mapping for the study area is an academic initiative and it reveals poor planning practices as industrial agricultural activities encroach onto urban areas surrounding the city centre of malekan melik kendi and its south which impact on contaminating the aquifer studies of this nature may be used to encourage a blame culture and often target agricultural users at the expense of treating the root of the problem the fact is that the planning system in iran is not based on scientifically driven plans and strategies and existing system of decision making and planning system is yet to adopt to the principles of sustainable development risk based decision making and decision making by participation the room for improvements is vast and various academic studies by the authors and others reveal the need for sustainable basin management plans and strategies 7 conclusion this paper investigates the role of different modelling strategies in learning the weighting values in drastic based aquifer vulnerability index vi mapping under sparse data vulnerability mapping provides a proactive insight into aquifers at risk of contamination and can be tools for planning practices and therefore they have to be defensible this study is focussed on a study area already exposed to contamination due to poor planning activities and aims to develop defensible tools for possible future planning practices which can be used in any study area particularly with sparse data the paper investigates the extraction of information through using artificial intelligence to run multiple models and or multiple frameworks aimm mf the strategy employed is at two levels as follows at level 1 two frameworks are constructed and comprise bdf basic drastic framework with prescribed rating and weighting values embedded in drastic and bdf fcf fuzzy catastrophe framework for unsupervised learning of the weighting values by using the decision theory based on the hybrid of fuzzy theory and catastrophe theory also at level 1 two models are constructed and comprise bdf ga genetic algorithm in which the supervised ga learns the weighting values from the site specific data but without testing and bdf gep genetic expression programming in which gep is used to learn the same weighting values but with testing at level 2 four strategies are formulated to combine the frameworks and models at level 1 for producing alternative models of predicting vulnerability values for the study area these comprise strategy 1 is a simple averaging to serve for benchmarking strategy 2 uses support vector machine svm for combining bdf and bdf fcf strategy 3 uses svm for combining bdf ga and bdf gep strategy 4 uses svm for combining bdf bdf fcf bdf ga and bdf gep the mfs and mms as well as the modelling strategies have a deliberate level of improved learning capabilities and these are detected in the performance metrics the results show that the frameworks models at level 1 indeed capture a level of rising improvements in the performance metrics for the study area the observed improvement continues with the strategies formulated at level 2 the emerging conclusion is that the level of supervision and the level of model combination have significant bearing on making defensible the outputs of vulnerability mapping even when site specific data are sparse whilst the strategy of modelling at two levels is generic and applicable to any study area or to any other framework such as sintacs gods or avi maximising the extracted information from the site specific data is a matter of learning declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could
