resolution based on ssm estimates from the european space agency s climate change initiative soil moisture product terrain data soil maps and local meteorological network data estimated ssm was evaluated against independent in situ ssm observations and were investigated for relationships with land cover class and vegetation phenology i e ndvi new hydrological insights for the region downscaled daily mean ssm estimates had lower error in space 27 and greater predictive performance over time compared to the raw coarse resolution remotely sensed ssm dataset when calibrated to field observed values downscaled ssm identified stronger and more widespread temporal relationships with ndvi than other estimation methods however both coarse and fine resolution datasets greatly underestimated ssm in wetland areas the findings highlight the need for enhanced in situ ssm monitoring across diverse settings to improve landscape level downscaled ssm the downscaling methodology developed in this study was able to produce daily ssm estimates providing a framework that can support future ssm modeling efforts hydroecological investigations and agricultural studies in this and

introduction soil moisture content is a critical driver of many ecosystems due to its influence on climate plant productivity soil biogeochemistry and surface water hydrology seneviratne et al 2010 mccoll et al 2017 climate induced changes in the water cycle are expected to alter soil moisture regimes and resulting feedback mechanisms across local to global scales bates et al 2008 green et al 2019 huntington 2006 soil moisture variability may limit carbon uptake by terrestrial ecosystems green et al 2019 and reductions in crop productivity due to deficient or excessive soil moisture may have major societal and economic consequences bates et al 2008 thus understanding and mapping the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture in our environment is of great interest to a broad audience in academic agricultural and economic communities soil moisture in the top few centimeters of the soil profile known as surface soil moisture ssm is of particular interest to researchers as it is relatively easier to measure than and often well correlated to moisture conditions deeper in the soil profile mccoll et al 2017 measuring in situ ssm at single points is made possible by using time domain reflectrometry probes which respond to changes in the dielectric constant of soil topp et al 1980 though very useful these probes may require calibration to soil type and present additional challenges when used to assess ssm dynamics with multiple probes across large spatial scales in heterogeneous environments consequently assessing the distribution of saturated areas across a landscape or agricultural fields is financially and logistically challenging with soil moisture probes alone advances in airborne and satellite remote sensing have provided an alternative approach for assessing spatial patterns of ssm active and passive microwave imaging is also affected by the dielectric constant of the soil surface and can be used to estimate ssm from a remote sensing perspective dubois et al 1995 wagner et al 1999 microwave imagers operating in the decimeter wavelength range are powerful tools for remote sensing of ssm measurement as they are relatively unaffected by atmospheric conditions moderately resistant to vegetation interference and day and night cycles and can determine ssm in the top 0 5 cm of the soil surface schmugge et al 2002 remote sensing is advantageous for assessing large scale spatial and temporal ssm patterns as measurements are an average of a target land surface which is dependent on the specific instrument used mohanty et al 2017 while in situ measurements can provide more accurate local ssm values with a sensor footprint of a few cm3 but lack broad spatial coverage ford and quiring 2019 global ssm products generated from satellite microwave information are now widely available and have proved valuable for assessing large regional to global scale soil moisture trends with high temporal frequency dong et al 2020 these global products have been used to examine the impacts of large scale weather and climate patterns biogeochemical cycles and terrestrial hydrology in new and insightful ways dorigo and de jeu 2016 but have limited application for addressing the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture at more localized landscape scales e g 100 m grids due to their coarse spatial resolution higher spatial resolution ssm estimates may be achieved using remote sensors such as infrared imagers and synthetic aperture radars but the resulting ssm products from these remote sensors still have reduced spatial coverage and limited temporal frequency dorigo et al 2017 thus there is a need for ssm products with both high temporal and spatial resolution but current satellite remote sensing technology cannot meet both needs alone recent research has aimed to address these spatial resolution limitations by attempting to downscale coarse resolution global soil moisture datasets using a wide variety of algorithms and statistical approaches downscaling approaches e g methods and algorithms are diverse and developing and testing various downscaling approaches is a pressing need for improving the quality and spatial detail of current and future satellite soil moisture missions liu et al 2017 liu et al 2020 peng et al 2017 some process based approaches are based on the relationship between soil moisture and other environmental data such as vegetation indexes and land surface temperature fang et al 2018 gillies et al 1997 these relationships can be represented by fitting nonlinear models using a triangle or trapezoid feature space to derive soil moisture estimates with increased granularity with the spatial support of land surface or vegetation index datasets carlson 2007 this is because localized land surface characteristics and vegetation indexes can be more easily represented with higher spatial resolution fine grained compared to global satellite soil moisture datasets beyond process based models empirical downscaling approaches treat the data mechanism regulating the ssm variability as unknown liu et al 2017 these empirical approaches can be based in probability theory or may employ machine learning approaches including regression trees deep learning methods or combined approaches such as ensemble or multiple regressors or classifiers across all downscaling approaches many studies leverage linear and nonlinear models for predicting or downscaling satellite soil moisture estimates using a variety of ancillary information available with increased granularity guevara and vargas 2019 merlin et al 2013 montzka et al 2018 piles et al 2011 ranney et al 2015 sharma et al 2021 yan and bai 2020 zappa et al 2019 arguably most common predictors for soil moisture are vegetation indexes and climate datasets although there are a large number of environmental layers potentially useful for predicting satellite soil moisture values with higher granularity and accuracy than satellite estimates while using ancillary vegetation data may improve downscaling performance it also increases the risk of confounding problems e g spurious correlations in downstream investigations into vegetation ssm relationships spatiotemporal relationships between ssm and vegetation phenology are of great importance to ecological and agricultural sciences as ssm is an important environmental variable for developing agricultural drought forecasting systems cec 2021 ford and quiring 2019 han et al 2014 as an example a researcher investigating landscape scale drought patterns may want to examine correlations between a spectral vegetation index and a downscaled ssm grid but if the downscaled ssm grid used this vegetation index as an ancillary predictor dataset the resulting investigation would be inherently biased towards the downscaling model relationship and results could be potentially influenced by spurious correlations recent research has demonstrated that a purely geomorphometric i e terrain is the only ancillary dataset employed downscaling approach is viable for continental scale application at a moderate resolution of one kilometer though the usefulness of such an approach at landscape scale resolutions 100 m has not been explored guevara and vargas 2019 while a few downscaling approaches have targeted resolutions in the 30 100 m range capable of assessing landscape scale ssm variations abowarda et al 2021 merlin et al 2013 ranney et al 2015 all have employed vegetation datasets as ancillary predictors this study presents a landscape scale ssm downscaling methodology employing a kernel based approach that relies on spatial information e g spatial structure of satellite soil moisture values topographic land surface characteristics and meteorological data rather than vegetation or land cover data the overarching goal of this study was to develop a methodology for downscaling a coarse spatial resolution global daily ssm dataset to a spatial resolution suitable for evaluating landscape scale ssm variability i e 100 m resolution that minimizes potential confounding bias in subsequent investigations of downscaled ssm with relation to local vegetation indices e g ndvi and land cover classes the specific goals of this study were to evaluate the performance of this downscaling approach compared to a coarse resolution remotely sensed product against a local ssm monitoring network explore potential relationships between ssm estimates and vegetation and land cover data and identify limitations and areas of poor downscaling performance to target in future downscaling efforts this study focuses on the state of delaware usa and its surrounding watersheds this study area is anticipated to experience a complex shift of hydrologic regimes in the coming decades with potentially higher mean annual precipitation but also higher occurrence of droughts and intense storm events that may impact agricultural activities najjar et al 2000 huntington et al 2009 the study area contains a relatively dense meteorological monitoring network that includes 21 ssm monitoring stations allowing for testing and evaluation of downscaling methodologies 2 methods 2 1 study area the area considered in this study included the state of delaware usa and portions of major watersheds usgs huc12 delineations flowing into or out of the state constituting a total land area of roughly 8130 km2 the study area was elected because it has a dense meteorological network with in situ soil moisture information see section 2 2 with about 1 station per 390 km2 contained within this study area are distinct subregions of the rugged piedmont the heavily agricultural mid atlantic coastal plain and large networks of coastal bays and wetlands fig 1 the study area lies in a transition zone between continental and subtropical climate zones experiencing a four season climate mostly based on temperature with warm humid summers and cold relatively dry winters and nearly constant precipitation throughout the year the 40 year mean average annual temperature is roughly 13 ºc reaching a minimum monthly mean of 1 8 ºc in january and maximum monthly mean of 25 ºc in july average annual precipitation is roughly 1143 mm office of the delaware state climatologist http www climate udel edu 2 2 data sources esa cci and deos network the satellite based estimates of daily soil moisture were taken from the soil moisture program of the european space agency s climate change initiative esa cci sm version 4 5 dorigo et al 2017 gruber et al 2017 2019 this dataset consists of daily global soil moisture estimates at 0 25 degree spatial resolution approximately 27 km vertical and 21 km horizontal in our study area which are generated by combining multiple satellite soil moisture records available since the late 1970 s dorigo et al 2015 dorigo et al 2017 this dataset is constantly being updated and improved chung et al 2018 soil moisture records contained in the esa cci are estimated using passive and active microwave remote sensors e g spaceborne radiometers and radar sensors able to measure the dielectric constant in the top layer of soil from 0 to roughly 5 cm depth llamas et al 2020 specifically esa cci sm was developed by combining data from c band scatterometers from european remote sensing satellite missions e g ers ½ metop and data from multi frequency radiometers such as the scanning multichannel microwave radiometer smmr special sensor microwave imager ssm i microwave imager tmi advanced microwave scanning radiometer amsr e and windsat llamas et al 2020 ground based in situ soil moisture measurements were taken from the delaware environmental observing system deos network the deos maintains a dense network of meteorological monitoring stations throughout the state of delaware extending northward into southeastern pennsylvania to cover the upper basins of the brandywine river white clay creek and red clay creek the network has been operating for over 15 years and now consists of over 60 monitoring stations recently deos has begun to add soil moisture and soil temperature monitoring capabilities across its many stations using probes capturing the upper 0 5 cm of the soil in total 21 of the deos stations had consistent ssm data for 2018 the study year of interest and these station observations were used as an independent benchmark for evaluating and calibrating both the esa datasets and downscaled ssm estimates fig 1 weather data obtained from deos included ambient air temperature soil temperature and precipitation for all variables 5 min observations were averaged to produce daily mean values except precipitation which was considered as the sum of the 5 min intervals because of gaps in the data at least 12 h of soil moisture data or 18 h for weather data must have been present for daily values to be valid one of the 21 stations located near dover delaware towards the center of the study area had a large gap in its ssm record during spring and early summer 2018 200 days but was still used for evaluation purposes in other seasons 2 3 ancillary data processing terrain attributes were extracted from a 100 m resolution dem which was generated by resampling a lidar derived 3 m resolution dem of the study area a resolution of 100 m was selected as it captured general landscape features i e hills and valleys while still allowing for relatively rapid computation lidar for the state of delaware was collected during the leaf off period of winter 2014 with a minimum return density of 2 points m 2 and hydroflattened water bodies while small portions of the northern section of the study area were taken from 1 m resolution county level elevation datasets in the states of pennsylvania and maryland a set of terrain attributes were derived from the dem using several saga gis terrain analysis modules saga gis 6 4 and are described in table 1 surface layer saturated conductivity data was sourced from the national resources conservation service s soil survey geographic database soil survey staff national resources conservation service us department of agriculture 2015 which was converted to a gridded format at 100 m resolution an additional set of six oblique or rotated geographic coordinate axes were generated and converted to gridded values to be considered as potential predictors oblique coordinates are used as spatially explicit predictors in the downscaling model as one may use latitude and longitude but unlike 2 dimensional latitude and longitude oblique coordinates are less likely to introduce orthogonal artifacts in resulting prediction grids made by nonlinear models møller et al 2020 the elevation attributes oblique coordinates and soil data were referred to as temporally static predictors because ssm is a temporally dynamic variable our downscaling methodology also incorporated daily grids of antecedent mean temperature antecedent cumulative precipitation and day length grids as predictors daily temperature and precipitation at the deos network stations were interpolated to a 100 m grid spatially aligned with the elevation grid using a regularized spline with an n value i e the number of points considered for local approximation of 10 and smoothing weight of 0 2 the resulting daily grids were stacked and processed to generate precipitation and temperature variables to establish a meteorological context of current and antecedent conditions across the study area antecedent precipitation and temperature conditions were considered as potential predictors as they have shown to be related to ssm dynamics in previous research buczko et al 2007 han et al 2014 day length grids were based on a single value estimated from the day of year and the latitude of the centroid of our study area this set of predictors were referred to as temporally dynamic predictors 2 4 model training and variable selection the downscaling method used in this study employed a kernel k nearest neighbors kknn regression algorithm for fitting esa cci ssm values to terrain attributes and temporal predictors this algorithm was chosen based on its relative speed simplicity and demonstrated performance in previous ssm downscaling efforts at larger scales guevara and vargas 2019 guevara et al 2021 the methodology of training kknn models in the variable selection process and in the final model training followed the same general approach shown in fig 1 a set of 10 kknn models were trained based on a set of 100 randomly selected dates in 2018 on each date a stack of predictor grids was built consisting of esa cci ssm estimates and grids of predictor variables temporally static predictor variables were held constant while temporally dynamic variables were specific for each date spatial points n 200 were then randomly sampled from each date s predictor stack yielding a dataset of 20 000 input points a kknn model was then fit to these points using 10 repetitions of 5 fold cross validation to select the optimal kernel function and k number of surrounding points to consider that minimized cross validated mean absolute error mae fig 1 we selected mae as the reference criteria over root mean square error as it provides a general measure of model error but is less sensitive to infrequent large magnitude errors to select which of the predictor variables will be included in the model each predictor variable was sequentially excluded from repetitions of the described kknn model training process and evaluated for its importance based on the change in model mae before and after its exclusion variables that had consistently low importance across this process were then eliminated from the predictor set yielding a set of influential predictor variables that also reduced the dimensionality of the predictor variable space a final ensemble of 10 kknn models were then trained using the final set of predictor variables using the workflow illustrated in fig 1 soil moisture predictions were then extrapolated from each model across the study area on each date using gridded data of each predictor variable final downscaled estimated daily ssm values represent the mean prediction of all ten model outputs at each 100 m grid cell 2 5 evaluation against ground network observations we evaluated ssm predictions using methods similar to those used in global scale ssm studies gruber et al 2020 daily estimated ssm was compared to daily deos network ssm observations in grid cells corresponding to station locations given the narrow and conservative range of values modeled from the esa cci soil moisture product daily predicted grids both coarse resolution and downscaled were then normalized from zero to one over the entire prediction domain these grids were then linearly rescaled based on the highest and lowest ssm values observed by the deos network on each day i e values taken from two of the 21 stations the purpose of this rescaling or calibration was to better account for spatiotemporal variability in ssm values that is lost due to the averaging effects of the large footprint esa cci product grid cells while it is possible that this calibration may introduce a small degree of confounding bias into later evaluations of downscaling model performance beyond the two stations used for daily calibration the remaining deos network stations were not used to calibrate ssm values in any way for the remainder of this manuscript the following terms will be used deosobs ssm observed by the deos network esaraw ssm values from original esa cci soil moisture grid cells esasc esaraw values that are calibrated to daily minimum and maximum ssm observed by the deos network kknnraw modeled ssm from our downscaling method kknnsc kknnraw values that are calibrated to daily minimum and maximum ssm observed by the deos network raw and calibrated values of both the esa and kknn products were evaluated spatially based on the mean absolute error mae and mean bias error mbe between predicted values and deosobs these performance metrics were evaluated across all network stations on a daily basis between predicted ssm at grid cells corresponding to deos station observations an overall coefficient of determination r2 was calculated for all predictions and corresponding observations over the whole study period to assess the predictive performance of ssm estimates temporally i e at individual network stations over time nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was calculated for each station on a seasonal and annual basis nash and sutcliffe 1970 values of nse theoretically range from negative infinity to one with values greater than zero indicating that the predictive performance of a given model for a given site is greater than simply using the mean of observed data these evaluations allowed us to assess the general performance of our downscaling method relative to the coarser esa product as well as the performance of both products after being calibrated to observed daily maximum and minimum values in the ground based network 2 6 comparison across land cover classes and vegetation indices we investigated how different ssm estimates varied across land cover classes and in relation to the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi with the intent of identifying strengths and weaknesses of the estimates in the context of observations from previous research distributions of predicted soil moisture across different land cover classes were assessed using the 2016 national land cover dataset nlcd yang et al 2018 zonal means standard deviations s d and coefficients of variation c v standard deviation expressed as a percentage of the mean of ssm were extracted for each date and each land cover class in the published nlcd 2016 grid after resampling from 30 m to 100 m resolution based on the majority class of each cell spatiotemporal relationships between ssm estimates from each of the four methods and ndvi were investigated for each ndvi retrieval in 2018 the ndvi product used was a modis terra 16 day composite ndvi generated at 250 m resolution and processed to minimize influences from clouds aerosols and view angles didan 2015 pixel wise linear regressions were used to investigate temporal relationships at each individual point across the 22 ndvi retrieval dates which were evaluated based on the regression slope p values and r2 values for all individual grid cells and within different land cover classes correlations between ndvi and ssm across space were also examined for each ndvi retrieval date and were evaluated based on the same metrics for each retrieval date 2 7 software and packages all terrain attributes and daily climate surfaces were produced in saga gis version 6 4 conrad et al 2015 all statistical analyses and modeling were performed in r

and two day antecedent mean temperature a visualization of a daily esaraw dataset and resulting downscaled kknnraw dataset is shown in fig 2 after training model testing set mae values ranged 0 019 0 020 m3 m 3 in this instance values of mae reflect how well testing set predictions matched the values of the esa grid cells used as inputs rather than in situ ssm observations model optimal k ranged from 13 to 16 and the optimal kernel across all models was triangular 3 2 evaluation of ssm estimation methods against ground network observations over the course of 2018 deosobs had an annual mean 1 s d of 0 26 0 11 m3 m 3 across individual dates mean deosobs ranged 0 09 0 38 m3 m 3 and standard deviations ranged 0 02 0 13 m3 m 3 with generally higher values in spring fall and winter and several network wide decreases in ssm during july august and september fig s1 in early january 2018 several dates with very low observed ssm let to high errors to corresponding modeled grid cell values these erroneous dates correspond to a series of cold snaps with daily ambient temperatures well below 0 ºc across the deos network potentially causing frozen soil conditions that decrease accuracy of measurements by soil moisture probes fig 3 illustrates mae and mbe from spatial evaluations i e comparisons of ssm estimates in grid cells corresponding to deos ssm monitoring station locations of the four ssm estimates relative to deosobs calculated of each date in 2018 and a summary of these values is provided in table 2 mae for kknnsc was relatively low throughout the year while both esaraw and kknnraw had large positive bias and absolute error in the summer and early fall fig 3 corresponding to periods of low ssm based on deosobs fig s1 although esasc and kknnsc had relatively lower mae and mbe than esaraw and kknnraw in the summer months both estimates had a wet bias and consistently overestimated ssm in the spring and winter months fig 3b as a result the annual means of mbe values for esaraw kknnraw and esasc were roughly double that of kknnsc at 0 031 0 030 and 0 032 compared to 0 015 m3 m 3 respectively evaluating across all daily predictions corresponding to deosobs station locations ssm estimates from esaraw kknnraw esasc and kknnsc had r2 values of 0 48 0 52 0 66 and 0 73 respectively fig s2 temporal evaluations of ssm estimates against deosobs were calculated on an annual and seasonal basis for each ssm monitoring station in the deos network when evaluated on an annual basis nse from kknnsc was greater than zero for 62 of deos network stations compared to 43 29 and 19 for esasc kknnraw and esaraw respectively with noticeably improved performance in the southern portion of the study area fig 4 kknnsc ssm estimates generally had higher nse across network stations when evaluated on a seasonal basis though esaraw and kknnraw estimate nse exceeded the calibrated estimates only in winter when performance of all estimation methods was poor fig s3 3 3 spatial and temporal variability of ssm with land cover class and ndvi estimates of daily zonal mean ssm varied significantly across major land cover classes although the relative differences among land cover classes were similar for each estimation method fig 5 variability in daily zonal mean ssm was much higher in esasc and kknnsc and lowest in kknnraw cropland barren evergreen forest and woody wetland land cover classes had consistently low daily mean ssm while pasture land developed and deciduous forest land cover classes were consistently high although emergent wetlands had generally higher ssm than woody wetlands neither wetland class was predicted to have high mean daily ssm relative to the other classes in any of the estimation methods developed land cover classes had very little separation among daily mean values daily zonal c v varied within each estimation method as well with particularly high c v values in barren land cover and particularly low values in pasture lands the four methods i e esaraw esasc kknnraw and kknnsc yielded significant differences pairwise wilcoxon test p 0 05 in daily mean ssm over the entire year for several land cover classes kknnsc estimated lower ssm than all other methods in barren lands evergreen and mixed forests croplands and both wetland land cover classes in emergent wetlands both kknn datasets had significantly lower estimated ssm than both esa products in pasture lands both esasc and kknnsc estimated higher ssm than the other products daily zonal c v values also varied across the different estimation methods and were generally higher for esasc and kknnsc over the course of 2018 significant p 0 05 pixel wise correlations between ndvi and estimated ssm were identified at 2 and 7 of grid cells using the esaraw and kknnraw methods and 77 and 91 of grid cells using the esasc and kknnsc methods respectively fig 6 top row the occurrence of these significant relationships varied across land cover class notably significant ndvi and ssm relationships were less common in barren cropland and evergreen forest grid cells 63 71 and 79 of grid cells for esasc and 66 85 and 85 of grid cells for kknnsc respectively than for pastureland deciduous forest and mixed forest grid cells 83 96 and 96 for esasc and 98 99 and 99 for kknnsc respectively slopes and r2 values of pixel wise ndvi ssm relationships showed similar variability among land cover classes for both esasc and kknnsc with both datasets identifying the highest mean pixel wise r2 values and steeply negative slopes in deciduous forests mixed forests emergent wetlands and pasture lands barren lands croplands and evergreen forest classes generally showed weaker relationships less steeply negative slopes between ndvi and ssm from esasc and kknnsc coarse resolution grid cell specific artifacts were evident in the relationships between ndvi and ssm derived from esasc data fig 6 with rectangular zones exhibiting particularly strong or weak relationships relative to other coarse cell footprints we did not identify any clear spatial correlations between ndvi and ssm on each retrieval date 4 discussion 4 1 strengths and limitations of the kknn based downscaling method this study demonstrates a geomorphometry based downscaling method that provides estimates of daily ssm at much higher spatial resolution than is available in daily remotely sensed products using ancillary terrain spatial and meteorological data from publicly available data sources the performance indicators i e mae and mbe calculated between our best performing high resolution downscaled ssm estimates kknnsc and in situ observations were comparable to those identified in continental scale comparisons of observations and coarse remotely sensed draper et al 2012 albergel et al 2012 gruber et al 2020 and downscaled guevara and vargas 2019 ssm products a novel benefit of this approach is that by not using ancillary vegetation or land cover data in the downscaling process we are able to examine spatiotemporal relationships between downscaled ssm estimates vegetation distributions and land cover maps while minimizing the risk of confounding factors and misleading interpretations e g spurious correlations it should be noted however that land cover and ndvi are not wholly independent of terrain features in the northern portion of our study region for example developed areas and pasturelands primarily occupy the relatively flat hilltops in the landscape while steep hillslopes and valley bottoms contain dense forested and scrub areas that are unsuitable for development or agriculture thus some confounding effects are inevitable in any geospatial research kedron et al 2021 our results highlight the importance of comparing and calibrating remotely sensed environmental products with field observations when assessing ssm at specific regions or localities although kknnraw showed slightly higher temporal predictive performance for deos network stations than esaraw fig 4 daily calculated mae and mbe was similar for both estimates reflecting the limited ability of the raw values to capture the pronounced seasonal decline of ssm during the warm summer months fig 3 this lack of seasonality resulted in a narrow range of ssm values across all land cover classes fig 5 and a lack of significant temporal correlations between ndvi and ssm estimates from esaraw and kknnraw fig 6 calibrating daily ssm datasets to the daily minima and maxima of doesobs helped capture these seasonal patterns and revealed widespread significant relationships between ndvi and ssm in both the coarse and downscaled datasets fig 6 both esasc and kknnsc outperformed their non calibrated counterparts in both the daily calculated performance metrics table 2 fig 3 and in their predictive performance i e nse for deos network stations over the study year fig 4 the higher nse values observed from kknnsc in the southern part of the study area may indicate a benefit of the increased resolution of the downscaled estimates as this area has a large degree of spatial heterogeneity in network station observations that may be challenging to resolve using low resolution satellite products the need for calibration is not unexpected as previous research has highlighted the need for calibration as a way to overcome the hurdle of systematic differences between large scale remotely sensed ssm products and field observations reichle et al 2004 draper et al 2012 thus the accuracy of ssm estimates in our study region appears to be highly dependent on the availability of in situ data and our calibrated ssm estimates are influenced by the environmental monitoring network design the deos network is an excellent data source but it is fundamentally designed as a meteorological network with stations located in open fields and roadsides to provide exposure to wind and solar radiation it is unlikely that this distribution captures the full spectrum of spatial heterogeneity of ssm terrain and land cover across the study region consequently this network design limits our downscaling and calibration efforts improved ssm monitoring capabilities in this region and others will facilitate the development of high resolution data products that better capture the spatiotemporal variability of ssm while the downscaling and calibration method used in this study showed promise when evaluated against in situ ssm observations there are major limitations of this method in some areas one limitation is the challenge of model interpretability that results from an approach using a randomly generated ensemble of empirical machine learning models which makes assessing variable dependence challenging we clarify that this is not necessarily a weakness of our approach but we recognize that this is a challenge for interpretation of machine learning approaches gilpin et al 2018 a more practical limitation was identified because downscaled ssm estimates in wetland land cover classes were similar to or lower than many other land cover classes across all seasons fig 5 this is a clear underestimation as wetland soils are by definition saturated or near saturation for most of the year however wetland ssm was also similarly low in both coarse resolution esa datasets fig 5 wetlands have long been known to present challenges for coarse scale remotely sensed ssm products due their small spatial extent but high ssm within a given grid cell wagner et al 1999 as a result the coarse resolution ssm products used as inputs to our downscaling model cannot reflect the very high ssm of wetland features within the landscape due to averaging effects within each grid cell within the multivariate space of our ancillary data alone the extensive coastal wetland networks within our study area likely appear similar to nearby coastal plain areas i e flat to mild slopes low elevation low relief which generally sit atop well drained sandy soils containing agricultural fields as a result the model was unable to distinguish the coastal wetlands from the neighboring dry soils thus the inputs to our geomorphological downscaling methodology i e esaraw values and ancillary terrain and spatial datasets inherently limit the ability of its outputs i e kknnsc values to represent these high ssm features accounting for this remains a major challenge to prioritize in future downscaling efforts across landscapes containing wetland areas our results demonstrated a consistent wet bias towards higher values of both esasc and kknnsc in the spring fall and winter fig 3 which may explain why calibrated estimates had lower nse at many sites in winter and fall fig s3 this bias may be explained by the relatively small scale of the study area relative to esaraw grid resolution our downscaling methodology is based on daily information derived from esaraw values where each grid cell provides a single ssm value representing all the heterogeneity within its 27 km footprint the spatial extent of our study area is defined by the spatial extent of the deos network which limits the number of esaraw grid cells from which our randomized sampling could draw on any given day and in turn limits the number of possible values that could be modeled in the kknnraw output on any given day this resulted in limited variance among higher range ssm estimates which when calibrated to deos network minima and maxima yielded wide swaths of the study area with values skewed towards the daily maximum ssm observed by the deos network this highlights the challenges of accounting for small scale spatial ssm heterogeneity particularly in separating localized high ssm features from the greater landscape 4 2 spatial and temporal relationships of ssm with land cover and ndvi we were able to examine how different estimation methods lead to differences in ssm among land cover classes as well as the variability of ssm values within each class by comparing zonal means and c v values of daily ssm estimates mean daily estimated ssm showed similar variations among land cover classes for all four estimation methods suggesting that both coarse and downscaled resolution methods were able to distinguish general differences in ssm between land cover over the course of the year across our study region fig 5 however the downscaled grids have the advantage of the ability to resolve sub grid cell variability that is lost in the coarser esa datasets in fact the combination of downscaling and calibration i e kknnsc led to the greatest degree of ssm variability throughout the study region compared to other estimation methods as ssm c v i e the zonal standard deviation expressed as a percentage of the zonal mean was consistently higher from kknnsc than other estimation methods for most land cover classes fig 5 except for wetland land cover classes all ssm estimation methods provided values that generally agreed with observed ssm in major land cover classes in this region unfortunately the deos network ssm monitoring locations were only located in cropland open spaces and reported ssm observations from many other land cover classes are scarce ssm values in the cropland class fell within ranges of surface water content reported in previous work in various types of croplands in the mid atlantic coastal plain mccann et al 2007 roygard et al 2002 which contains most croplands in the study area of the forest classes mixed and deciduous forests are concentrated in the northern piedmont region and scattered throughout the rest of the study area while evergreen forests are almost exclusively located on sandy coastal plain soils in the southern portion of the study area fig 1 estimated ranges of ssm for deciduous and mixed forests fell within ranges of in situ seasonal observations from a recent study in a typical piedmont forest in this region warner et al 2018 barren and grassland land cover classes occupy a very small fraction of the study area and though they generally correspond to beaches and dune areas we found no in situ ssm data for comparison in this region reported in situ ssm observations for the study region were also lacking for developed land cover classes for all methods estimated ssm was similar across all developed land cover intensities which may reflect a limitation of our methodology to capture the well established heterogeneity of urban ssm driven by human influenced factors like soil disturbances and the extent of impermeable surfaces wiesner et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 the ancillary datasets used in our downscaling methodology could not account for such factors limiting its ability to resolve fine scale variation of soil moisture in developed areas we highlight the importance of collecting and cataloging in situ ssm data in all heterogeneous features and varieties of land cover to support future ssm downscaling and modeling efforts echoing the sentiments of other recent research on soil moisture downscaling zappa et al 2019 estimates from esaraw appeared unsuitable for evaluating temporal relationships between ndvi and ssm across the study region based on the pixel wise linear regressions of which only 2 suggested significant correlations p 0 05 downscaling alone i e kknnraw only slightly increased the number of significant temporal relationships 7 most of which featured very steep slopes resulting from the narrow range of kknnraw ssm values throughout the year the additional calibration to daily deos network minima and maxima i e esasc and kknnsc greatly improved our ability to identify temporal relationships between ssm and ndvi 77 and 91 spatial evaluations of relationships between ndvi and kknnsc had the additional benefit over esasc of being free from artifacts introduced by the coarse resolution esa grids fig 6 which arise from the averaging of estimated ssm across all land cover and vegetation heterogeneity within each esa grid cell footprint the pixel wise temporal correlations between ndvi and kknnsc indicated that ssm and ndvi are generally negatively correlated through time across the study area fig 6 this reflects seasonal transitions of vegetation greening and corresponding increases in root zone water use resulting in decreased ssm the r squared values suggested that these relationships were particularly strong in deciduous forests mixed forests and pasture lands conversely these relationships were relatively weak in evergreen forests barren lands and croplands these weaker correlations may be a result of limited seasonal variations in evergreen forest canopy foliage a lack of foliage in barren lands and irregular seasonality of ndvi in croplands due to agricultural practices i e irrigation regimes harvest land tillage for which our downscaling approach cannot account hmimina et al 2013 moulin et al 1997 in fact 71 of grid cells lacking significant temporal correlations between ndvi and kknnsc corresponded to croplands though croplands accounted for only 41 of the study area agricultural land management may also explain the lack of clear spatial correlations between ndvi and ssm estimates across the study area for each date of ndvi retrieval as the modeled ssm cannot account for irrigation practices that may keep cropland ndvi values high throughout the growing season the spatial distribution of agricultural land management regimes for individual crop fields is unknown in this region and coordinated studies with agricultural stakeholders may help improve future ssm downscaling efforts for the benefit of the agricultural community without including such land management strategies high spatial resolution ssm downscaling methods employing primarily terrain data may have limited application for targeted field or farm specific studies though they may still be useful for assessing mesoscale ssm dynamics in agricultural areas 5 conclusions this study demonstrates the strengths and limitations of a geomorphometric kernel k nearest neighbors downscaling method for estimating high resolution distributions of ssm based on remote sensing products from the esa cci soil moisture program using meteorological data from a ground network spatial coordinates and terrain attributes as predictors our downscaled estimates were evaluated against ground network data and showed improvement over the coarse resolution product although calibration of both coarse and downscaled ssm was necessary for capturing seasonal ssm variations and identifying temporal relationships to ndvi all ssm estimates indicated a consistent wet bias and subsequent analysis of ssm estimates in relation to land cover classes found clear limitations of all estimation methods in wetland areas our methodology provided high spatiotemporal resolution ssm maps with lower error than coarse resolution datasets and showed higher predictive performance through time when evaluated against monitoring network observations this data driven downscaling methodology may be applied to other coarse spatial scale high temporal scale remotely sensed ssm datasets e g smap entekhabi et al 2010a and in other regions provided the necessary spatial and monitoring network data we highlight the need for more spatially representative ground based ssm monitoring networks that will enhance our ability to evaluate and refine downscaled ssm estimates future work should address the challenges posed by downscaling remotely sensed ssm in wetland areas and attempt to account for causes of wet bias perhaps with greater interaction between ground networks and satellite data finally we emphasize the importance of developing downscaling techniques that allow for investigations into spatiotemporal relationships between ssm and remotely sensed vegetation data which will support investigations into ecological processes drought forecasting and

8095,study region delaware usa and its surrounding watersheds study focus an ensemble using multiple kernel k nearest neighbors kknn models was trained to predict daily grids of ssm at 100 meter resolution based on ssm estimates from the european space agency s climate change initiative soil moisture product terrain data soil maps and local meteorological network data estimated ssm was evaluated against independent in situ ssm observations and were investigated for relationships with land cover class and vegetation phenology i e ndvi new hydrological insights for the region downscaled daily mean ssm estimates had lower error in space 27 and greater predictive performance over time compared to the raw coarse resolution remotely sensed ssm dataset when calibrated to field observed values downscaled ssm identified stronger and more widespread temporal relationships with ndvi than other estimation methods however both coarse and fine resolution datasets greatly underestimated ssm in wetland areas the findings highlight the need for enhanced in situ ssm monitoring across diverse settings to improve landscape level downscaled ssm the downscaling methodology developed in this study was able to produce daily ssm estimates providing a framework that can support future ssm modeling efforts hydroecological investigations and agricultural studies in this and other regions around the world when used in conjunction with ground based monitoring networks keywords soil moisture remote sensing machine learning spatiotemporal soil moisture networks 1 introduction soil moisture content is a critical driver of many ecosystems due to its influence on climate plant productivity soil biogeochemistry and surface water hydrology seneviratne et al 2010 mccoll et al 2017 climate induced changes in the water cycle are expected to alter soil moisture regimes and resulting feedback mechanisms across local to global scales bates et al 2008 green et al 2019 huntington 2006 soil moisture variability may limit carbon uptake by terrestrial ecosystems green et al 2019 and reductions in crop productivity due to deficient or excessive soil moisture may have major societal and economic consequences bates et al 2008 thus understanding and mapping the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture in our environment is of great interest to a broad audience in academic agricultural and economic communities soil moisture in the top few centimeters of the soil profile known as surface soil moisture ssm is of particular interest to researchers as it is relatively easier to measure than and often well correlated to moisture conditions deeper in the soil profile mccoll et al 2017 measuring in situ ssm at single points is made possible by using time domain reflectrometry probes which respond to changes in the dielectric constant of soil topp et al 1980 though very useful these probes may require calibration to soil type and present additional challenges when used to assess ssm dynamics with multiple probes across large spatial scales in heterogeneous environments consequently assessing the distribution of saturated areas across a landscape or agricultural fields is financially and logistically challenging with soil moisture probes alone advances in airborne and satellite remote sensing have provided an alternative approach for assessing spatial patterns of ssm active and passive microwave imaging is also affected by the dielectric constant of the soil surface and can be used to estimate ssm from a remote sensing perspective dubois et al 1995 wagner et al 1999 microwave imagers operating in the decimeter wavelength range are powerful tools for remote sensing of ssm measurement as they are relatively unaffected by atmospheric conditions moderately resistant to vegetation interference and day and night cycles and can determine ssm in the top 0 5 cm of the soil surface schmugge et al 2002 remote sensing is advantageous for assessing large scale spatial and temporal ssm patterns as measurements are an average of a target land surface which is dependent on the specific instrument used mohanty et al 2017 while in situ measurements can provide more accurate local ssm values with a sensor footprint of a few cm3 but lack broad spatial coverage ford and quiring 2019 global ssm products generated from satellite microwave information are now widely available and have proved valuable for assessing large regional to global scale soil moisture trends with high temporal frequency dong et al 2020 these global products have been used to examine the impacts of large scale weather and climate patterns biogeochemical cycles and terrestrial hydrology in new and insightful ways dorigo and de jeu 2016 but have limited application for addressing the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture at more localized landscape scales e g 100 m grids due to their coarse spatial resolution higher spatial resolution ssm estimates may be achieved using remote sensors such as infrared imagers and synthetic aperture radars but the resulting ssm products from these remote sensors still have reduced spatial coverage and limited temporal frequency dorigo et al 2017 thus there is a need for ssm products with both high temporal and spatial resolution but current satellite remote sensing technology cannot meet both needs alone recent research has aimed to address these spatial resolution limitations by attempting to downscale coarse resolution global soil moisture datasets using a wide variety of algorithms and statistical approaches downscaling approaches e g methods and algorithms are diverse and developing and testing various downscaling approaches is a pressing need for improving the quality and spatial detail of current and future satellite soil moisture missions liu et al 2017 liu et al 2020 peng et al 2017 some process based approaches are based on the relationship between soil moisture and other environmental data such as vegetation indexes and land surface temperature fang et al 2018 gillies et al 1997 these relationships can be represented by fitting nonlinear models using a triangle or trapezoid feature space to derive soil moisture estimates with increased granularity with the spatial support of land surface or vegetation index datasets carlson 2007 this is because localized land surface characteristics and vegetation indexes can be more easily represented with higher spatial resolution fine grained compared to global satellite soil moisture datasets beyond process based models empirical downscaling approaches treat the data mechanism regulating the ssm variability as unknown liu et al 2017 these empirical approaches can be based in probability theory or may employ machine learning approaches including regression trees deep learning methods or combined approaches such as ensemble or multiple regressors or classifiers across all downscaling approaches many studies leverage linear and nonlinear models for predicting or downscaling satellite soil moisture estimates using a variety of ancillary information available with increased granularity guevara and vargas 2019 merlin et al 2013 montzka et al 2018 piles et al 2011 ranney et al 2015 sharma et al 2021 yan and bai 2020 zappa et al 2019 arguably most common predictors for soil moisture are vegetation indexes and climate datasets although there are a large number of environmental layers potentially useful for predicting satellite soil moisture values with higher granularity and accuracy than satellite estimates while using ancillary vegetation data may improve downscaling performance it also increases the risk of confounding problems e g spurious correlations in downstream investigations into vegetation ssm relationships spatiotemporal relationships between ssm and vegetation phenology are of great importance to ecological and agricultural sciences as ssm is an important environmental variable for developing agricultural drought forecasting systems cec 2021 ford and quiring 2019 han et al 2014 as an example a researcher investigating landscape scale drought patterns may want to examine correlations between a spectral vegetation index and a downscaled ssm grid but if the downscaled ssm grid used this vegetation index as an ancillary predictor dataset the resulting investigation would be inherently biased towards the downscaling model relationship and results could be potentially influenced by spurious correlations recent research has demonstrated that a purely geomorphometric i e terrain is the only ancillary dataset employed downscaling approach is viable for continental scale application at a moderate resolution of one kilometer though the usefulness of such an approach at landscape scale resolutions 100 m has not been explored guevara and vargas 2019 while a few downscaling approaches have targeted resolutions in the 30 100 m range capable of assessing landscape scale ssm variations abowarda et al 2021 merlin et al 2013 ranney et al 2015 all have employed vegetation datasets as ancillary predictors this study presents a landscape scale ssm downscaling methodology employing a kernel based approach that relies on spatial information e g spatial structure of satellite soil moisture values topographic land surface characteristics and meteorological data rather than vegetation or land cover data the overarching goal of this study was to develop a methodology for downscaling a coarse spatial resolution global daily ssm dataset to a spatial resolution suitable for evaluating landscape scale ssm variability i e 100 m resolution that minimizes potential confounding bias in subsequent investigations of downscaled ssm with relation to local vegetation indices e g ndvi and land cover classes the specific goals of this study were to evaluate the performance of this downscaling approach compared to a coarse resolution remotely sensed product against a local ssm monitoring network explore potential relationships between ssm estimates and vegetation and land cover data and identify limitations and areas of poor downscaling performance to target in future downscaling efforts this study focuses on the state of delaware usa and its surrounding watersheds this study area is anticipated to experience a complex shift of hydrologic regimes in the coming decades with potentially higher mean annual precipitation but also higher occurrence of droughts and intense storm events that may impact agricultural activities najjar et al 2000 huntington et al 2009 the study area contains a relatively dense meteorological monitoring network that includes 21 ssm monitoring stations allowing for testing and evaluation of downscaling methodologies 2 methods 2 1 study area the area considered in this study included the state of delaware usa and portions of major watersheds usgs huc12 delineations flowing into or out of the state constituting a total land area of roughly 8130 km2 the study area was elected because it has a dense meteorological network with in situ soil moisture

minimum monthly mean of 1 8 ºc in january and maximum monthly mean of 25 ºc in july average annual precipitation is roughly 1143 mm office of the delaware state climatologist http www climate udel edu 2 2 data sources esa cci and deos network the satellite based estimates of daily soil moisture were taken from the soil moisture program of the european space agency s climate change initiative esa cci sm version 4 5 dorigo et al 2017 gruber et al 2017 2019 this dataset consists of daily global soil moisture estimates at 0 25 degree spatial resolution approximately 27 km vertical and 21 km horizontal in our study area which are generated by combining multiple satellite soil moisture records available since the late 1970 s dorigo et al 2015 dorigo et al 2017 this dataset is constantly being updated and improved chung et al 2018 soil moisture records contained in the esa cci are estimated using passive and active microwave remote sensors e g spaceborne radiometers and radar sensors able to measure the dielectric constant in the top layer of soil from 0 to roughly 5 cm depth llamas et al 2020 specifically esa cci sm was developed by combining data from c band scatterometers from european remote sensing satellite missions e g ers ½ metop and data from multi frequency radiometers such as the scanning multichannel microwave radiometer smmr special sensor microwave imager ssm i microwave imager tmi advanced microwave scanning radiometer amsr e and windsat llamas et al 2020 ground based in situ soil moisture measurements were taken from the delaware environmental observing system deos network the deos maintains a dense network of meteorological monitoring stations throughout the state of delaware extending northward into southeastern pennsylvania to cover the upper basins of the brandywine river white clay creek and red clay creek the network has been operating for over 15 years and now consists of over 60 monitoring stations recently deos has begun to add soil moisture and soil temperature monitoring capabilities across its many stations using probes capturing the upper 0 5 cm of the soil in total 21 of the deos stations had consistent ssm data for 2018 the study year of interest and these station observations were used as an independent benchmark for evaluating and calibrating both the esa datasets and downscaled ssm estimates fig 1 weather data obtained from deos included ambient air temperature soil temperature and precipitation for all variables 5 min observations were averaged to produce daily mean values except precipitation which was considered as the sum of the 5 min intervals because of gaps in the data at least 12 h of soil moisture data or 18 h for weather data must have been present for daily values to be valid one of the 21 stations located near dover delaware towards the center of the study area had a large gap in its ssm record during spring and early summer 2018 200 days but was still used for evaluation purposes in other seasons 2 3 ancillary data processing terrain attributes were extracted from a 100 m resolution dem which was generated by resampling a lidar derived 3 m resolution dem of the study area a resolution of 100 m was selected as it captured general landscape features i e hills and valleys while still allowing for relatively rapid computation lidar for the state of delaware was collected during the leaf off period of winter 2014 with a minimum return density of 2 points m 2 and hydroflattened water bodies while small portions of the northern section of the study area were taken from 1 m resolution county level elevation datasets in the states of pennsylvania and maryland a set of terrain attributes were derived from the dem using several saga gis terrain analysis modules saga gis 6 4 and are described in table 1 surface layer saturated conductivity data was sourced from the national resources conservation service s soil survey geographic database soil survey staff national resources conservation service us department of agriculture 2015 which was converted to a gridded format at 100 m resolution an additional set of six oblique or rotated geographic coordinate axes were generated and converted to gridded values to be considered as potential predictors oblique coordinates are used as spatially explicit predictors in the downscaling model as one may use latitude and longitude but unlike 2 dimensional latitude and longitude oblique coordinates are less likely to introduce orthogonal artifacts in resulting prediction grids made by nonlinear models møller et al 2020 the elevation attributes oblique coordinates and soil data were referred to as temporally static predictors because ssm is a temporally dynamic variable our downscaling methodology also incorporated daily grids of antecedent mean temperature antecedent cumulative precipitation and day length grids as predictors daily temperature and precipitation at the deos network stations were interpolated to a 100 m grid spatially aligned with the elevation grid using a regularized spline with an n value i e the number of points considered for local approximation of 10 and smoothing weight of 0 2 the resulting daily grids were stacked and processed to generate precipitation and temperature variables to establish a meteorological context of current and antecedent conditions across the study area antecedent precipitation and temperature conditions were considered as potential predictors as they have shown to be related to ssm dynamics in previous research buczko et al 2007 han et al 2014 day length grids were based on a single value estimated from the day of year and the latitude of the centroid of our study area this set of predictors were referred to as temporally dynamic predictors 2 4 model training and variable selection the downscaling method used in this study employed a kernel k nearest neighbors kknn regression algorithm for fitting esa cci ssm values to terrain attributes and temporal predictors this algorithm was chosen based on its relative speed simplicity and demonstrated performance in previous ssm downscaling efforts at larger scales guevara and vargas 2019 guevara et al 2021 the methodology of training kknn models in the variable selection process and in the final model training followed the same general approach shown in fig 1 a set of 10 kknn models were trained based on a set of 100 randomly selected dates in 2018 on each date a stack of predictor grids was built consisting of esa cci ssm estimates and grids of predictor variables temporally static predictor variables were held constant while temporally dynamic variables were specific for each date spatial points n 200 were then randomly sampled from each date s predictor stack yielding a dataset of 20 000 input points a kknn model was then fit to these points using 10 repetitions of 5 fold cross validation to select the optimal kernel function and k number of surrounding points to consider that minimized cross validated mean absolute error mae fig 1 we selected mae as the reference criteria over root mean square error as it provides a general measure of model error but is less sensitive to infrequent large magnitude errors to select which of the predictor variables will be included in the model each predictor variable was sequentially excluded from repetitions of the described kknn model training process and evaluated for its importance based on the change in model mae before and after its exclusion variables that had consistently low importance across this process were then eliminated from the predictor set yielding a set of influential predictor variables that also reduced the dimensionality of the predictor variable space a final ensemble of 10 kknn models were then trained using the final set of predictor variables using the workflow illustrated in fig 1 soil moisture predictions were then extrapolated from each model across the study area on each date using gridded data of each predictor variable final downscaled estimated daily ssm values represent the mean prediction of all ten model outputs at each 100 m grid cell 2 5 evaluation against ground network observations we evaluated ssm predictions using methods similar to those used in global scale ssm studies gruber et al 2020 daily estimated ssm was compared to daily deos network ssm observations in grid cells corresponding to station locations given the narrow and conservative range of values modeled from the esa cci soil moisture product daily predicted grids both coarse resolution and downscaled were then normalized from zero to one over the entire prediction domain these grids were then linearly rescaled based on the highest and lowest ssm values observed by the deos network on each day i e values taken from two of the 21 stations the purpose of this rescaling or calibration was to better account for spatiotemporal variability in ssm values that is lost due to the averaging effects of the large footprint esa cci product grid cells while it is possible that this calibration may introduce a small degree of confounding bias into later evaluations of downscaling model performance beyond the two stations used for daily calibration the remaining deos network stations were not used to calibrate ssm values in any way for the remainder of this manuscript the following terms will be used deosobs ssm observed by the deos network esaraw ssm values from original esa cci soil moisture grid cells esasc esaraw values that are calibrated to daily minimum and maximum ssm observed by the deos network kknnraw modeled ssm from our downscaling method kknnsc kknnraw values that are calibrated to daily minimum and maximum ssm observed by the deos network raw and calibrated values of both the esa and kknn products were evaluated spatially based on the mean absolute error mae and mean bias error mbe between predicted values and deosobs these performance metrics were evaluated across all network stations on a daily basis between predicted ssm at grid cells corresponding to deos station observations an overall coefficient of determination r2 was calculated for all predictions and corresponding observations over the whole study period to assess the predictive performance of ssm estimates temporally i e at individual network stations over time nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was calculated for each station on a seasonal and annual basis nash and sutcliffe 1970 values of nse theoretically range from negative infinity to one with values greater than zero indicating that the predictive performance of a given model for a given site is greater than simply using the mean of observed data these evaluations allowed us to assess the general performance of our downscaling method relative to the coarser esa product as well as the performance of both products after being calibrated to observed daily maximum and minimum values in the ground based network 2 6 comparison across land cover classes and vegetation indices we investigated how different ssm estimates varied across land cover classes and in relation to the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi with the intent of identifying strengths and weaknesses of the estimates in the context of observations from previous research distributions of predicted soil moisture across different land cover classes were assessed using the 2016 national land cover dataset nlcd yang et al 2018 zonal means standard deviations s d and coefficients of variation c v standard deviation expressed as a percentage of the mean of ssm were extracted for each date and each land cover class in the published nlcd 2016 grid after resampling from 30 m to 100 m resolution based on the majority class of each cell spatiotemporal relationships between ssm estimates from each of the four methods and ndvi were investigated for each ndvi retrieval in 2018 the ndvi product used was a modis terra 16 day composite ndvi generated at 250 m resolution and processed to minimize influences from clouds aerosols and view angles didan 2015 pixel wise linear regressions were used to investigate temporal relationships at each individual point across the 22 ndvi retrieval dates which were evaluated based on the regression slope p values and r2 values for all individual grid cells and within different land cover classes correlations between ndvi and ssm across space were also examined for each ndvi retrieval date and were evaluated based on the same metrics for each retrieval date 2 7 software and packages all terrain attributes and daily climate surfaces were produced in saga gis version 6 4 conrad et al 2015 all statistical analyses and modeling were performed in r

example code and small set of test data is available on github warner 2020 and the downscaled ssm grids produced in this study are available on the hydroshare repository warner et al 2020 3 results 3

and two day antecedent mean temperature a visualization of a daily esaraw dataset and resulting downscaled kknnraw dataset is shown in fig 2 after training model testing set mae values ranged 0 019 0 020 m3 m 3 in this instance values of mae reflect how well testing set predictions matched the values of the esa grid cells used as inputs rather than in situ ssm observations model optimal k ranged from 13 to 16 and the optimal kernel across all models was triangular 3 2 evaluation of ssm estimation methods against ground network observations over the course of 2018 deosobs had an annual mean 1 s d of 0 26 0 11 m3 m 3 across individual dates mean deosobs ranged 0 09 0 38 m3 m 3 and standard deviations ranged 0 02 0 13 m3 m 3 with generally higher values in spring fall and winter and several network wide decreases in ssm during july august and september fig s1 in early january 2018 several dates with very low observed ssm let to high errors to corresponding modeled grid cell values these erroneous dates correspond to a series of cold snaps with daily ambient temperatures well below 0 ºc across the deos network potentially causing frozen soil conditions that decrease accuracy of measurements by soil moisture probes fig 3 illustrates mae and mbe from spatial evaluations i e comparisons of ssm estimates in grid cells corresponding to deos ssm monitoring station locations of the four ssm estimates relative to deosobs calculated of each date in 2018 and a summary of these values is provided in table 2 mae for kknnsc was relatively low throughout the year while both esaraw and kknnraw had large positive bias and absolute error in the summer and early fall fig 3 corresponding to periods of low ssm based on deosobs fig s1 although esasc and kknnsc had relatively lower mae and mbe than esaraw and kknnraw in the summer months both estimates had a wet bias and consistently overestimated ssm in the spring and winter months fig 3b as a result the annual means of mbe values for esaraw kknnraw and esasc were roughly double that of kknnsc at 0 031 0 030 and 0 032 compared to 0 015 m3 m 3 respectively evaluating across all daily predictions corresponding to deosobs station locations ssm estimates from esaraw kknnraw esasc and kknnsc had r2 values of 0 48 0 52 0 66 and 0 73 respectively fig s2 temporal evaluations of ssm estimates against deosobs were calculated on an annual and seasonal basis for each ssm monitoring station in the deos network when evaluated on an annual basis nse from kknnsc was greater than zero for 62 of deos network stations compared to 43 29 and 19 for esasc kknnraw and esaraw respectively with noticeably improved performance in the southern portion of the study area fig 4 kknnsc ssm estimates generally had higher nse across network stations when evaluated on a seasonal basis though esaraw and kknnraw estimate nse exceeded the calibrated estimates only in winter when performance of all estimation methods was poor fig s3 3 3 spatial and temporal variability of ssm with land cover class and ndvi estimates of daily zonal mean ssm varied significantly across major land cover classes although the relative differences among land cover classes were similar for each estimation method fig 5 variability in daily zonal mean ssm was much higher in esasc and kknnsc and lowest in kknnraw cropland barren evergreen forest and woody wetland land cover classes had consistently low daily mean ssm while pasture land developed and deciduous forest land cover classes were consistently high although emergent wetlands had generally higher ssm than woody wetlands neither wetland class was predicted to have high mean daily ssm relative to the other classes in any of the estimation methods developed land cover classes had very little separation among daily mean values daily zonal c v varied within each estimation method as well with particularly high c v values in barren land cover and particularly low values in pasture lands the four methods i e esaraw esasc kknnraw and kknnsc yielded significant differences pairwise wilcoxon test p 0 05 in daily mean ssm over the entire year for several land cover classes kknnsc estimated lower ssm than all other methods in barren lands evergreen and mixed forests croplands and both wetland land cover classes in emergent wetlands both kknn datasets had significantly lower estimated ssm than both esa products in pasture lands both esasc and kknnsc estimated higher ssm than the other products daily zonal c v values also varied across the different estimation methods and were generally higher for esasc and kknnsc over the course of 2018 significant p 0 05 pixel wise correlations between ndvi and estimated ssm were identified at 2 and 7 of grid cells using the esaraw and kknnraw methods and 77 and 91 of grid cells using the esasc and kknnsc methods respectively fig 6 top row the occurrence of these significant relationships varied across land cover class notably significant ndvi and ssm relationships were less common in barren cropland and evergreen forest grid cells 63 71 and 79 of grid cells for esasc and 66 85 and 85 of grid cells for kknnsc respectively than for pastureland deciduous forest and mixed forest grid cells 83 96 and 96 for esasc and 98 99 and 99 for kknnsc respectively slopes and r2 values of pixel wise ndvi ssm relationships showed similar variability among land cover classes for both esasc and kknnsc with both datasets identifying the highest mean pixel wise r2 values and steeply negative slopes in deciduous forests mixed forests emergent wetlands and pasture lands barren lands croplands and evergreen forest classes generally showed weaker relationships less steeply negative slopes between ndvi and ssm from esasc and kknnsc coarse resolution grid cell specific artifacts were evident in the relationships between ndvi and ssm derived from esasc data fig 6 with rectangular zones exhibiting particularly strong or weak relationships relative to other coarse cell footprints we did not identify any clear spatial correlations between ndvi and ssm on each retrieval date 4 discussion 4 1 strengths and limitations of the kknn based downscaling method this study demonstrates a geomorphometry based downscaling method that provides estimates of daily ssm at much higher spatial resolution than is available in daily remotely sensed products using ancillary terrain spatial and meteorological data from publicly available data sources the performance indicators i e mae and mbe calculated between our best performing high resolution downscaled ssm estimates kknnsc and in situ observations were comparable to those identified in continental scale comparisons of observations and coarse remotely sensed draper et al 2012 albergel et al 2012 gruber et al 2020 and downscaled guevara and vargas 2019 ssm products a novel benefit of this approach is that by not using ancillary vegetation or land cover data in the downscaling process we are able to examine spatiotemporal relationships between downscaled ssm estimates vegetation distributions and land cover maps while minimizing the risk of confounding factors and misleading interpretations e g spurious correlations it should be noted however that land cover and ndvi are not wholly independent of terrain features in the northern portion of our study region for example developed areas and pasturelands primarily occupy the relatively flat hilltops in the landscape while steep hillslopes and valley bottoms contain dense forested and scrub areas that are unsuitable for development or agriculture thus some confounding effects are inevitable in any geospatial research kedron et al 2021 our results highlight the importance of comparing and calibrating remotely sensed environmental products with field observations when assessing ssm at specific regions or localities although kknnraw showed slightly higher temporal predictive performance for deos network stations than esaraw fig 4 daily calculated mae and mbe was similar for both estimates reflecting the limited ability of the raw values to capture the pronounced seasonal decline of ssm during the warm summer months fig 3 this lack of seasonality resulted in a narrow range of ssm values across all land cover classes fig 5 and a lack of significant temporal correlations between ndvi and ssm estimates from esaraw and kknnraw fig 6 calibrating daily ssm datasets to the daily minima and maxima of doesobs helped capture these seasonal patterns and revealed widespread significant relationships between ndvi and ssm in both the coarse and downscaled datasets fig 6 both esasc and kknnsc outperformed their non calibrated counterparts in both the daily calculated performance metrics table 2 fig 3 and in their predictive performance i e nse for deos network stations over the study year fig 4 the higher nse values observed from kknnsc in the southern part of the study area may indicate a benefit of the increased resolution of the downscaled estimates as this area has a large degree of spatial heterogeneity in network station observations that may be challenging to resolve using low resolution satellite products the need for calibration is not unexpected as previous research has highlighted the need for calibration as a way to overcome the hurdle of systematic differences between large scale remotely sensed ssm products and field observations reichle et al 2004 draper et al 2012 thus the accuracy of ssm estimates in our study region appears to be highly dependent on the availability of in situ data and our calibrated ssm estimates are influenced by the environmental monitoring network design the deos network is an excellent data source but it is fundamentally designed as a meteorological network with stations located in open fields and roadsides to provide exposure to wind and solar radiation it is unlikely that this distribution captures the full spectrum of spatial heterogeneity of ssm terrain and land cover across the study region consequently this network design limits our downscaling and calibration efforts improved ssm monitoring capabilities in this region and others will facilitate the development of high resolution data products that better capture the spatiotemporal variability of ssm while the downscaling and calibration method used in this study showed promise when evaluated against in situ ssm observations there are major limitations of this method in some areas one limitation is the challenge of model interpretability that results from an approach using a randomly generated ensemble of empirical machine learning models which makes assessing variable dependence challenging we clarify that this is not necessarily a weakness of our approach but we recognize that this is a challenge for interpretation of machine learning approaches gilpin et al 2018 a more practical limitation was identified because downscaled ssm estimates in wetland land cover classes were similar to or lower than many other land cover classes across all seasons fig 5 this is a clear underestimation as wetland soils are by definition saturated or near saturation for most of the year however wetland ssm was also similarly low in both coarse resolution esa datasets fig 5 wetlands have long been known to present challenges for coarse scale remotely sensed ssm products due their small spatial extent but high ssm within a given grid cell wagner et al 1999 as a result the coarse resolution ssm products used as inputs to our downscaling model cannot reflect the very high ssm of wetland features within the landscape due to averaging effects within each grid cell within the multivariate space of our ancillary data alone the extensive coastal wetland networks within our study area likely appear similar to nearby coastal plain areas i e flat to mild slopes low elevation low relief which generally sit atop well drained sandy soils containing agricultural fields as a result the model was unable to distinguish the coastal wetlands from the neighboring dry soils thus the inputs to our geomorphological downscaling methodology i e esaraw values and ancillary terrain and spatial datasets inherently limit the ability of its outputs i e kknnsc values to represent these high ssm features accounting for this remains a major challenge to prioritize in future downscaling efforts across landscapes containing wetland areas our results demonstrated a consistent wet bias towards higher values of both esasc and kknnsc in the spring fall and winter fig 3 which may explain why calibrated estimates had lower nse at many sites in winter and fall fig s3 this bias may be explained by the relatively small scale of the study area relative to esaraw grid resolution our downscaling methodology is based on daily information derived from esaraw values where each grid cell provides a single ssm value representing all the heterogeneity within its 27 km footprint the spatial extent of our study area is defined by the spatial extent of the deos network which limits the number of esaraw grid cells from which our randomized sampling could draw on any given day and in turn limits the number of possible values that could be modeled in the kknnraw output on any given day this resulted in limited variance among higher range ssm estimates which when calibrated to deos network minima and maxima yielded wide swaths of the study area with values skewed towards the daily maximum ssm observed by the deos network this highlights the challenges of accounting for small scale spatial ssm heterogeneity particularly in separating localized high ssm features from the greater landscape 4 2 spatial and temporal relationships of ssm with land cover and ndvi we were able to examine how different estimation methods lead to differences in ssm among land cover classes as well as the variability of ssm values within each class by comparing zonal means and c v values of daily ssm estimates mean daily estimated ssm showed similar variations among land cover classes for all four estimation methods suggesting that both coarse and downscaled resolution methods were able to distinguish general differences in ssm between land cover over the course of the year across our study region fig 5 however the downscaled grids have the advantage of the ability to resolve sub grid cell variability that is lost in the coarser esa datasets in fact the combination of downscaling and calibration i e kknnsc led to the greatest degree of ssm variability throughout the study region compared to other estimation methods as ssm c v i e the zonal standard deviation expressed as a percentage of the zonal mean was consistently higher from kknnsc than other estimation methods for most land cover classes fig 5 except for wetland land cover classes all ssm estimation methods provided values that generally agreed with observed ssm in major land cover classes in this region unfortunately the deos network ssm monitoring locations were only located in cropland open spaces and reported ssm observations from many other land cover classes are scarce ssm values in the cropland class fell within ranges of surface water content reported in previous work in various types of croplands in the mid atlantic coastal plain mccann et al 2007 roygard et al 2002 which contains most croplands in the study area of the forest classes mixed and deciduous forests are concentrated in the northern piedmont region and scattered throughout the rest of the study area while evergreen forests are almost exclusively located on sandy coastal plain soils in the southern portion of the study area fig 1 estimated ranges of ssm for deciduous and mixed forests fell within ranges of in situ seasonal observations from a recent study in a typical piedmont forest in this region warner et al 2018 barren and grassland land cover classes occupy a very small fraction of the study area and though they generally correspond to beaches and dune areas we found no in situ ssm data for comparison in this region reported in situ ssm observations for the study region were also lacking for developed land cover classes for all methods estimated ssm was similar across all developed land cover intensities which may reflect a limitation of our methodology to capture the well established heterogeneity of urban ssm driven by human influenced factors like soil disturbances and the extent of impermeable surfaces wiesner et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 the ancillary datasets used in our downscaling methodology could not account for such factors limiting its ability to resolve fine scale variation of soil moisture in developed areas we highlight the importance of collecting and cataloging in situ ssm data in all heterogeneous features and varieties of land cover to support future ssm downscaling and modeling efforts echoing the sentiments of other recent research on soil moisture downscaling zappa et al 2019 estimates from esaraw appeared unsuitable for evaluating temporal relationships between ndvi and ssm across the study region based on the pixel wise linear regressions of which only 2 suggested significant correlations p 0 05 downscaling alone i e kknnraw only slightly increased the number of significant temporal relationships 7 most of which featured very steep slopes resulting from the narrow range of kknnraw ssm values throughout the year the additional calibration to daily deos network minima and maxima i e esasc and kknnsc greatly improved our ability to identify temporal relationships between ssm and ndvi 77 and 91 spatial evaluations of relationships between ndvi and kknnsc had the additional benefit over esasc of being free from artifacts introduced by the coarse resolution esa grids fig 6 which arise from the averaging of estimated ssm across all land cover and vegetation heterogeneity within each esa grid cell footprint the pixel wise temporal correlations between ndvi and kknnsc indicated that ssm and ndvi are generally negatively correlated through time across the study area fig 6 this reflects seasonal transitions of vegetation greening and corresponding increases in root zone water use resulting in decreased ssm the r squared values suggested that these relationships were particularly strong in deciduous forests mixed forests and pasture lands conversely these relationships were relatively weak in evergreen forests barren lands and croplands these weaker correlations may be a result of limited seasonal variations in evergreen forest canopy foliage a lack of foliage in barren lands and irregular seasonality of ndvi in croplands due to agricultural practices i e irrigation regimes harvest land tillage for which our downscaling approach cannot account hmimina et al 2013 moulin et al 1997 in fact 71 of grid cells lacking significant temporal correlations between ndvi and kknnsc corresponded to croplands though croplands accounted for only 41 of the study area agricultural land management may also explain the lack of clear spatial correlations between ndvi and ssm estimates across the study area for each date of ndvi retrieval as the modeled ssm cannot account for irrigation practices that may keep cropland ndvi values high throughout the growing season the spatial distribution of agricultural land management regimes for individual crop fields is unknown in this region and coordinated studies with agricultural stakeholders may help improve future ssm downscaling efforts for the benefit of the agricultural community without including such land management strategies high spatial resolution ssm downscaling methods employing primarily terrain data may have limited application for targeted field or farm specific studies though they may still be useful for assessing mesoscale ssm dynamics in agricultural areas 5 conclusions this study demonstrates the strengths and limitations of a geomorphometric kernel k nearest neighbors downscaling method for estimating high resolution distributions of ssm based on remote sensing products from the esa cci soil moisture program using meteorological data from a ground network spatial coordinates and terrain attributes as predictors our downscaled estimates were evaluated against ground network data and showed improvement over the coarse resolution product although calibration of both coarse and downscaled ssm was necessary for capturing seasonal ssm variations and identifying temporal relationships to ndvi all ssm estimates indicated a consistent wet bias and subsequent analysis of ssm estimates in relation to land cover classes found clear limitations of all estimation methods in wetland areas our methodology provided high spatiotemporal resolution ssm maps with lower error than coarse resolution datasets and showed higher predictive performance through time when evaluated against monitoring network observations this data driven downscaling methodology may be applied to other coarse spatial scale high temporal scale remotely sensed ssm datasets e g smap entekhabi et al 2010a and in other regions provided the necessary spatial and monitoring network data we highlight the need for more spatially representative ground based ssm monitoring networks that will enhance our ability to evaluate and refine downscaled ssm estimates future work should address the challenges posed by downscaling remotely sensed ssm in wetland areas and attempt to account for causes of wet bias perhaps with greater interaction between ground networks and satellite data finally we emphasize the importance of developing downscaling techniques that allow for investigations into spatiotemporal relationships between ssm and remotely sensed vegetation data which will support investigations into ecological processes drought forecasting and

8096,study region rocky mountains united states study focus groundwater flow modeling requires estimates of hydraulic properties namely hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity values commonly vary over orders of magnitudes however and estimation may require extensive field campaigns applying slug or pumping tests as an alternative specific capacity tests can be used to estimate hydraulic properties for large areas when benchmarked with slug or pumping tests this study combined aquifer testing with specific capacity data to estimate hydraulic properties in a large alluvial aquifer new hydrological insights for region in the wet mountain valley colorado both slug tests and pumping tests were conducted resulting in a likely range of hydraulic conductivity values aquifer testing results were related to specific capacity data a more spatially distributed dataset to expand the area of aquifer characterization beyond the distribution of wells included in aquifer testing specific capacity data were used in two ways 1 a regression was built between specific capacity values and transmissivity derived from aquifer testing and 2 an iterative method was utilized to estimate transmissivity from specific capacity at all sites including sites lacking aquifer tests study results indicate that there is a statistically significant difference between hydraulic conductivity values estimated using the two approaches and that the regression method yields systematically greater values these results indicate that careful consideration of methods that use specific capacity for extrapolating aquifer properties is warranted as bias could be introduced depending on the applied methodology keywords colorado groundwater flow groundwater hydraulics hydraulic properties hydraulic testing 1 introduction simulation of groundwater flow is commonly undertaken to estimate the availability of water resources groundwater flow models are applied at a variety of scales from small local models to regional models of entire states or provinces reasonable model results and calibration require detailed knowledge of aquifer geometry thickness extent interlayering etc and properties hydraulic conductivity and storage determining aquifer properties specifically hydraulic conductivity k length time l t or transmissivity t l2 t where t is the product of k and aquifer thickness b l t kb is often difficult because these properties can vary over orders of magnitude in a single hydrologic environment freeze and cherry 1979 various aquifer testing methods can be used to estimate k the most common of which are pumping tests and slug tests butler 1997 kruseman and de ridder 1990 typically it is preferred to conduct pumping tests that include observation wells because this testing method uses an expanded monitoring network such that a greater volume of aquifer material is observed in addition long term pumping tests can potentially detect the effects of hydrologic boundaries such as streams or faults although pumping tests are effective for determining both t and storage properties such as specific yield and specific storage these tests have the disadvantage of being time consuming intricate in testing design expensive to implement and potentially difficult to analyze depending on the method and the availability of observations alternatively single hole methods such as slug tests and single hole pumping tests may be used one advantage of single hole testing methods is that these tests can be completed in domestic wells which provide for a greater distribution of well sites for testing than other well types however single hole tests do not use observation wells and so calculated storage properties using these results may be highly uncertain freeze and cherry 1979 an alternative method of determining k is to utilize specific capacity sc to estimate t and thereby k richard et al 2016 rotzoll and el kadi 2008 specific capacity is the ratio of pumping rate q l3 t to water level decline drawdown s l sc q s because sc data are commonly collected during well drilling and recorded on permits or well completion reports these data can be cost effectively obtained by query of well permitting databases although using sc to calculate k has been widely applied ahmed and de marsily 1987 mclin 2005 razack and huntley 1991 the method is not without difficulties because of aquifer heterogeneity and the need to establish site specific relations between k and sc mace 1997 previous research has focused on the relations between k and t derived sc calculations and pumping tests patriarche et al 2005 richard et al 2016 but relatively little work has focused on evaluating the data worth of combining slug testing and sc this paper discusses the utility of single hole aquifer testing methods including slug tests and single hole pumping tests and sc data to estimate k of an alluvial aquifer in an intermontane basin in colorado usa by using results from slug tests and single hole pumping tests in conjunction with sc data k can be estimated and extrapolated to parts of the valley without aquifer tests specifically this research compares two methods for using sc data to calculate hydraulic properties the iterative method bradbury and rothschild 1985 richard et al 2016 and the regression method patriarche et al 2005 priebe et al 2018 these methods have both been used throughout the literature but the results of both have not been directly compared additionally these methods have not been used in combination with short term aquifer testing but have traditionally been used with long term pumping tests insights into which method is most appropriate will be useful for practitioners designing aquifer characterization programs in data poor regions 1 1 study site the study site for this research is the wet mountain valley a roughly north south trending intermontane basin located in southern central colorado usa fig 1 the west side of the valley is bounded by the sangre de cristo mountains which are primarily composed of precambrian igneous rocks and paleozoic pennsylvanian and permian sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks lindsey 2010 the east side of the valley is bounded by the wet mountains which are primarily composed of tertiary igneous rocks cappa 1998 exposures of the tertiary santa fe formation a lacustrine to fluvial sandstone brister and gries 1994 are found at the base of both the sangre de cristo and wet mountains the central portion of the valley is composed of quaternary alluvium which thickens to the west crouch et al 1984 zohdy et al 1971 the wet mountain valley is a semi enclosed hydrologic basin with two surface water outlets grape creek and texas creek both of which are tributaries to the arkansas river to the north quaternary sand and gravel deposits derived from the surrounding mountains form an extensive basin fill alluvial aquifer in the wet mountain valley fig 1 the aquifer is composed of older alluvium from glacial deposits younger alluvium from stream deposits and alluvial fans along the mountain front londquist and livingston 1978 grain size distributions determined during well installation from drilling logs up to 400 m deep colorado decision support system cdss 2019 indicate that coarse and medium grained sediments are nearly equally distributed 21 and 25 respectively of all logged intervals whereas fine grained sediments makeup a smaller proportion of the alluvial material 9 each of logged intervals however these distributions are generalizations because they are taken from qualitative drilling logs the water bearing potential of paleozoic basement rocks and tertiary volcanic rocks is variable crouch et al 1984 a slight topographic divide in the southern part of the valley and the eastern and western mountain ranges provide surface water and potentially groundwater divides population in the region has grown rapidly within the past 20 years and is expected to continue to increase through 2040 colorado department of local affairs 2019 because the climate of the valley floor is semi arid much of the available water for consumptive use is sourced from streams entering the west side of the valley and the alluvial aquifer numerous groundwater wells are completed in the alluvial aquifer and surrounding bedrock aquifers and data pertaining to these wells are available from the cdss 2019 most wells 80 are registered for domestic use other well uses include irrigation 3 stock 6 commercial 4 and undefined uses 7 no water use statistics are available to estimate total groundwater withdrawals according to well types increasing groundwater demand from the alluvial aquifer and the desire to better understand groundwater and surface water interactions in the basin created the need for additional water resource studies in the area the basin is the subject of predictive groundwater flow modeling which is partially reliant on the hydraulic conductivity values derived from this analysis hydrologic monitoring has been conducted by the u s geological survey usgs in the wet mountain valley for over 20 years but this dataset consists almost exclusively of groundwater level observations to date no datasets pertaining to the hydraulic properties of the alluvial aquifer or groundwater and surface water interactions have been collected the focus of this paper is on aquifer testing and the estimation of hydraulic properties investigations of groundwater and surface water interactions are not discussed in depth in this analysis but are mentioned in this research to provide context for ongoing water resource studies current groundwater level monitoring in the basin consists of 29 wells fig 1 a portion of the wells were equipped with pressure transducers for continuous water level monitoring and the remaining had periodic manual groundwater level measurements nearly all wells are completed within the alluvial aquifer 26 of 29 nine wells 7 of which were instrumented with pressure transducers were selected for aquifer testing fig 1 and the attributes of these wells are summarized in table 1 wells were selected for aquifer testing based on spatial distribution examination of drilling logs and evaluation of previous water level monitoring data 2 methods the purpose of this work is to evaluate the applicability of various types of data collection and analysis in deriving k values that can be used in groundwater flow modeling first a subset of wells 9 locations was the subject of aquifer testing using traditional slug and single hole pumping tests section 2 1 next a combination of two low cost methods using sc data were utilized and evaluated section 2 2 finally the results of these methods were evaluated statistically both methods using sc data are described briefly and conceptually illustrated in fig 2 2 1 aquifer testing single hole aquifer tests were completed in nine wells table 1 testing consisted of slug tests and single well pumping tests slug tests typically consist of displacement of the water level in the well using a solid cylindrical tube of known volume the slug slug tests commonly include slug in falling head and slug out rising head tests when the slug is instantaneously inserted below the water table the water level rises in the well producing a temporary increase of water levels in the well which dissipates over time and thus gives the name falling head when the water level has approached pre testing conditions the slug is then instantaneously removed producing a decline in water level and a temporary decrease in the water level in the well which is filled by inflowing water thus giving the name rising head water levels are monitored on a frequent basis during this entire process butler 1997 cunningham and schalk 2011 single hole pumping tests consisted of pumping the well and monitoring both the decline of water levels during pumping and the rebound of water levels after pumping ceased in conjunction with recording of the pumping rate from the well kruseman and de ridder 1990 slug testing was completed in one monitoring well and single hole pumping tests were completed on the other eight wells single hole pumping tests were not performed in the monitoring well because of the narrow diameter which did not allow for both data recording devices and pump to be inserted simultaneously site 1 table 1 both falling head slug in and rising head slug out tests were conducted three times each in the monitoring well the three tests used different initial displacements ho as suggested by butler 1997 to evaluate theoretical applicability i e to determine how closely field conditions correspond to simplified theoretical conditions assumed in the calculations initial displacements were 0 16 m 0 54 ft 0 33 m 1 08 ft and 0 51 m 1 68 ft single hole pumping tests were conducted in wells with dedicated pumps each of these tests consisted of measuring the depth to water for 4 8 min prior to the test to ensure static conditions existed after which pumping was initiated and discharge and depth to water were measured over time discharge from the well was measured using timed volumetric methods and water level displacement was measured using pressure transducers at intervals of 250 ms after enough water level displacement was measured to clearly see the effect of pumping in the data pumping was discontinued and recovery was observed until approximate static conditions were once again reached pumping times varied from 10 to 261 min according to observed displacement these pumping times are considered great enough to produce stress on the aquifer in the immediate vicinity of the well but likely short enough such that interfering processes such as tidal influences may be ignored the maximum drawdown in each well obtained during testing varied based on pumping rate and the hydraulic properties in the vicinity of the well some pumps cycled during testing producing a step drawdown type of curve and these data were also analyzed additional details on duration of pumping pumping rates and drawdown in each well is provided in newman 2020 results of testing were analyzed using the computer program aqtesolv duffield 2007 various analytical methods were applied for each test to evaluate the effect of each method s assumptions and theoretical approaches and to find the best fit to the test results analysis of slug test data utilized the bouwer rice bouwer and rice 1976 and hvorslev 1951 methods the bouwer rice method is best suited for application to unconfined aquifers whereas the hvorslev method is generally applied to confined aquifers butler 1997 however within aqtesolv the hvorslev solution can be applied with an unconfined assumption duffield 2007 and this approach was used herein to allow direct comparison with the other methods used and because specific information on confining layers in the vicinity of the wells is not available both the bouwer rice and hvorslev methods have various assumptions related to penetration of the aquifer position of the well screen and flow behavior within the well butler 1997 although theoretically the methods are applicable under different scenarios assumptions listed above both were applied here to compare the response of wells included in aquifer testing against each solution a full review of the assumptions of each aquifer testing method may be found in butler 1997 and kruseman and de ridder 1990 the confined versus unconfined nature of the alluvial aquifer in the vicinity of each wells is not known with certainty because of sparse subsurface information on confining layers however confined conditions have been reported in the past londquist and livingston 1978 the first slug test in site 1 was conducted prior to redevelopment of the well results from this test indicated the presence of a well skin which is caused by interferences between the aquifer material and the well bore butler 1997 the first slug test at site 1 therefore likely does not represent hydraulic properties of the aquifer following the first test the well was redeveloped using a waterra pump for approximately 2 h until the produced water was no longer turbid subsequent slug testing was then conducted at a later date to allow static conditions to be achieved following redevelopment the theis 1935 and cooper jacob cooper and jacob 1946 methods were used to evaluate data for the single hole pumping tests data were included from both pumping and recovery portions of the tests i e pumping rates and the entire record of water levels from the initiation of pumping to the conclusion of recovery based on synthetic aquifer tests halford et al 2006 concluded that the cooper jacob method is the most applicable analytical solution to single hole pumping tests for unconfined conditions regardless of partial penetration or other potentially complicating factors however the theis method also was used in this analysis to evaluate differences between the solutions because the theis method is commonly used to analyze pumping tests with variable observation networks e g sun 2018 one of the goals of this work is to assess potential differences between multiple types of potentially applicable analytical solutions such that practitioners of aquifer testing programs may understand how the usage of different solutions could affect resultant calculated hydraulic properties the recovery portion of the data water level data collected after pumping ceased from single hole pumping tests was also analyzed using the hvorslev and bouwer rice methods this analysis was conducted to evaluate the applicability of these solutions for pump test data such that a greater number of k estimates from each well may be obtained for use in statistical evaluation for this analysis the recovery period was treated as a rising head slug test although the theoretical underpinnings of slug testing and pump testing are different many of the assumptions are the same between the analytical methods for example both the cooper jacob and hvorslev methods assume an infinite homogeneous uniform thickness aquifer the primary differences in the methods are that the hvorslev method assumes an instantaneous water level displacement whereas the cooper jacob method assumes unsteady flow treatment of the recovery period of single hole pumping tests as a rising head slug out test explores the applicability of slug test solutions to recovery data from single hole pumping tests and provides practitioners with information on the range of methodologies that may be applied in initial aquifer characterization programs in data poor regions one of the goals of this study in order to quantify the degree to which pumping approaches an instantaneous head change the quantity recovery ratio rr was defined herein and calculated for each test according to 1 r r t m t s t r t m t displacement t recovery where tm denotes time to maximum displacement in seconds sec ts denotes time of test initiation sec tr denotes time of recovery attainment sec δtdisplacement denotes time from test initiation to maximum displacement and δtrecovery denotes time from maximum displacement to recovery recovery was considered attained when the water level in the well was within 2 of the water level prior to test initiation the rr value approaches zero for tests with truly instantaneous water level displacement and approaches infinity when displacement occurs slowly in comparison to recovery pumping tests with small rr values approach the behavior of a slug test in that water level displacement occurs rapidly in comparison to recovery a primary assumption of slug testing analytical solutions the rr was used to assess the timing of water level displacement in both slug and pumping tests a criterion for maximum value of rr 0 2 was used recovery portions of pumping tests with rr values less than this threshold were analyzed using hvorslev and bouwer rice methods whereas those with rr values greater than the threshold were only analyzed using theis and cooper jacob methods the cutoff value of rr 0 2 was determined by trial and error to remove testing with prolonged recovery while maintaining inclusion of testing with relatively rapid recovery regardless of the analytical solution applied hvorslev bouwer rice theis or cooper jacob when early response data were shown to control the solution i e when there was a substantial change in slope of displacement at the beginning the test two solutions were calculated one in which early recovery data were included and one in which they were removed when early recovery data are not removed they tend to bias the calculated k values this analysis therefore includes some subjectivity based on the experience of the practitioner as to the recognition of borehole storage or other early recovery effects the geometric mean of all solutions for a given well aside from when early recovery occurred was calculated to provide the estimated k value from aquifer testing kt for the well geometric means are appropriate in situations except when extremely small or highly variable k values are prevalent jensen 1991 sanchez vila et al 2006 which was not the case in this study using the geometric mean of all solutions also provides a method by which to consider the range of values in aggregate as opposed to subjectively choosing the solution to use for k although the assumptions of some models are met more closely in certain situations there is always uncertainty and ambiguity with respect to subsurface conditions near the wells because of these uncertainties the geometric mean is the most robust method for estimating the central tendency of k values from aquifer testing in each well because it is less susceptible to outliers than other estimates of central tendency when the data are log normally distributed helsel et al 2020 which is the case in this study these kt values are then compared to results of k estimation from sc see below it is critical to understand that analysis of aquifer testing data is inherently subjective the analyst chooses solutions to compare to and determines best fit by visual evaluation because of the subjectivity it is most robust to include several analytical solutions as was applied in this study which minimizes the subjective choices of the analyst on quantitative estimates of hydraulic properties 2 2 specific capacity specific capacity is commonly tested and recorded on well drilling records for groundwater wells and is calculated according to priebe et al 2018 2 sc q s where sc denotes specific capacity m2 day q denotes well discharge m3 day and s denotes drawdown m both q and s were recorded from drillers logs sourced from the cdss 2019 wells were selected from throughout the wet mountain valley to provide for greater spatial extent of the calculations in total data were analyzed from 65 alluvial wells and 36 bedrock wells based on spatial distribution range of well depth and available information on lithology and well characteristics several variables affect the accuracy of sc including pumping discharge rate consistency of pumping rate and well construction risser 2010 ranges of q were 0 94 liters per minute lpm 0 25 gallons per minute gpm to 3028 lpm 800 gpm for deep long screened large diameter wells of the 101 wells included in the dataset 35 had q less than 19 lpm 5 gpm 69 had q less than 57 lpm 15 gpm and 93 had q less than 151 lpm 40 gpm these pumping rates are generally in the range such that most wells likely display non turbulent flow for their diameter risser 2010 though turbulent flows are apparent in a subset of wells as described in the results section most wells have only one data point for drawdown but some wells do have time drawdown data recorded from drillers logs enabling evaluation of the effects of continued pumping on sc in unconfined aquifers s must be corrected because the theis solution is directly applicable only to confined aquifers therefore corrected drawdown was calculated according to astm 1999 and richard et al 2016 3 s s s 2 2 m where s denotes corrected drawdown m and m denotes saturated thickness of the aquifer prior to pumping m confining layers for aquifers in the wet mountain valley have not been studied nor mapped therefore the alluvial deposits were assumed to be unconfined and the bedrock was assumed to be confined analysis of geospatial data and well logs indicates that wells completed in bedrock are typically drilled through alluvium and the contrasting hydraulic properties of the alluvium bedrock interface may be substantial enough to create a hydraulic barrier 2 2 1 iterative method an iterative method was used to calculate t and thereby k from the sc components q and s using the theoretical foundation of the cooper jacob equation following richard et al 2016 an iterative equation for calculation of t is 4 t i 1 q 4 π s t ln t i q 4 π s t ln 2 25 t r w 2 s where ti denotes the estimated t m2 day from the i th iteration ti 1 denotes the t estimated in the i 1 iteration m2 day s t denotes corrected drawdown observed at time t t denotes time days rw denotes the radius of the well m and s denotes the aquifer storage coefficient dimensionless when time drawdown pumping data are available the iterative approach was applied to only the first pair of q and s values a complete theoretical description of the iterative approach is provided in bradbury and rothschild 1985 and richard et al 2016 using this iterative method an initial t ti to was estimated as the product of the screen length b for each well and k for applicable aquifer materials from the literature freeze and cherry 1979 previous studies have evaluated using the screen length versus true aquifer thickness for computations between t and k halford et al 2006 patriarche et al 2005 priebe et al 2018 with varying results in this instance using screen length was deemed appropriate because the true thickness of the aquifer in the vicinity of any particular well is not known with certainty using estimates of the total aquifer thickness could substantially affect results of the calculations because aquifer thickness may be much thicker than the thickness actively contributing water to the well but the aquifer thickness cannot be known a priori the aquifer storage parameter was also estimated based on literature values priebe et al 2018 found that the relation between t and sc was relatively insensitive to storage parameter s assumptions so the storage value applied in this study is not expected to substantially affect the calculations iterative calculations in this study used s 0 05 for alluvial wells and s 1 10 6 for bedrock wells both values from freeze and cherry 1979 once the initial to is estimated an iterative approach is utilized wherein a new ti 1 is calculated the values of ti and ti 1 are compared and iteration is continued until there is less than 1 difference in subsequent values the same criterion as used by richard et al 2016 a computer code was written in the python programming language van rossum and drake 2009 to complete iterative calculations final estimated t was then converted back to k for comparison with aquifer tests as described by priebe et al 2018 using k versus t allows comparability between various literature sources and results of this testing transmissivity is the aquifer property that describes bulk productivity halford et al 2006 and k is a transformed value using b in this instance that describes properties of the aquifer more applicable to smaller aquifer volumes near wells this approach was utilized to calculate a k value for all wells with appropriate sc data ksc hydraulic conductivity calculated from sc measurements ksc using the iterative method was then compared to k values obtained from aquifer testing kt for the wells included in table 1 to evaluate the differences comparisons are made using log log relations which are more resistant to outliers patriarche et al 2005 and statistically using the wilcoxon rank sum test which is well suited for application to non parametric datasets helsel et al 2020 this iterative approach is conceptually outlined in fig 2 and variables are defined in table 2 2 2 2 regression method after a kt value was calculated for each well included in the aquifer testing a t value representative of in situ testing tt was calculated using the screen length as aquifer thickness b tt ktb a log log linear regression between tt and sc was then plotted for the nine wells with aquifer test results using this regression a t value was estimated for all alluvial wells in the aquifer using compiled sc values the regression method is conceptually illustrated on fig 2 and variables are defined in table 2 similar regression methods have been utilized by patriarche et al 2005 and priebe et al 2018 though they have not been compared against iterative methods as described above the regression method was not applied to bedrock wells because the aquifer parameters derived from aquifer testing kt tt are only applicable to alluvial wells no site specific aquifer testing was conducted in bedrock wells for this analysis because the alluvial aquifer was the primary subject of this study bedrock sc values are compiled here to provide a basis for future evaluation of hydraulic properties of the bedrock aquifer within the study area 3 results and discussion 3 1 aquifer testing all raw testing data pumping rates for single hole tests well logs and aqtesolv results are included in an accompanying usgs data release newman 2020 and examples of aquifer test data are illustrated in fig 3 results of calculated k values are summarized for each well in tables 3 and 4 and fig 4 which include the calculated k value from each analytical solution the geometric mean of all calculated k values kt the estimated k value from sc calculations ksc using the iterative method and the evaluation of timescales of drawdown and recovery using the recovery ratio rr additionally the best fit solution based on comparison of analytical solutions and observations is indicated for each well in table 3 plots comparing all analytical solutions and observations are illustrated in newman 2020 it is important to note that not all analytical solutions illustrated in newman 2020 are considered reasonable the process of fitting solutions to data is used to differentiate applicable solutions from inapplicable solutions both of which are included in the usgs data release newman 2020 thus only results of aquifer testing considered to be reasonable are summarized in table 3 reasonability of solutions was assessed using several criteria including 1 fit of data to theoretical solutions 2 field information indicating noisy data and 3 conceptual agreement between the aquifer in the vicinity of the well based on well logs with assumptions of the given model hvorslev bouwer rice theis or cooper jacob subjective decision making was used to determine solutions that were reasonable to use in subsequent analyses the best fit solutions based on the aforementioned criteria are identified in table 3 as are notes on specific analyses and their reasonability or other factors examples of water level data fig 3 paired with calculation of rr table 4 show that pumping tests have varying degrees of drawdown timescales the value of rr for pumping tests ranges from 0 039 in site 3 indicating near instantaneous water level displacement to 415 in site 9 indicating that drawdown required long time periods in relation to water level recovery values for rr in slug tests ranged from 0 001 to 0 002 water temperature data also may be useful for qualitatively evaluating timescales of aquifer response as water temperature changes during pumping and slug testing fig 3 and newman 2020 specifically water temperature appears to change more during pump testing at site 7 than during slug testing at site 1 the greater change in water temperature is likely linked to the volume of aquifer material influenced by the testing with greater changes being indicative of greater influence on the aquifer temperature data may be useful in qualitative evaluation of aquifer testing data and temperature data have a wide range of uses in hydrologic characterization anderson 2005 slug testing was completed at site 1 utilizing three separate tests with different displacements as described in the methods section 2 1 pump testing was not completed at this site because of the narrow well diameter the first slug test indicated non ideal characteristics variable behavior for slug in versus slug out test so the well was redeveloped by purging at a high rate two slug tests were then completed after redevelopment with different ho for both tests analysis of post development data resulted in an increase in k and a consistent k for both the slug in and slug out portions of the test fig 4 these results indicate that well redevelopment improved the hydraulic connection between the well and the aquifer therefore the post development test results are considered more representative of the aquifer properties the hvorslev and bouwer rice methods calculated nearly identical k values despite the different assumptions of each method butler 1997 single well drawdown and recovery pumping tests generally resulted in drawdown signals with minimal oscillation in water level displacement see plots of water level displacement for all wells in newman 2020 and for site 7 in fig 3 pumping rates did vary in several wells however leading to a more complex drawdown signal variable drawdown can complicate single well testing analysis li et al 2018 analysis of pumping and recovery data using the theis and cooper jacob methods generally produced similar results fig 4 although theis results tended to yield slightly greater k values than cooper jacob results 6 of 8 wells differences between these solution methods may relate to the penetration of the aquifer halford et al 2006 noted that partial penetration of the aquifer is a substantial departure from the original theis model despite this aqtesolv duffield 2007 does include options for partial penetration of the aquifer when completing calculations partial penetration is nearly certain for all the wells considered in this study although the calculations using the theis solution were completed using options for partial penetration the estimates of k by the theis method may be biased high because of their departure from theory e g halford et al 2006 nevertheless all results were included in calculation of kt for each well using the geometric mean because results were on the same order of magnitude as those using the cooper jacob solution and because evaluating the effect of aggregation on derived hydraulic parameters is one of the goals of the study slug test solutions bouwer rice hvorslvev and solutions for recovery theis cooper jacob were completed for sites 3 7 and 8 i e wells with rr values less than 0 2 the calculated k values for these sites are similar between the slug test and pump test solutions indicating that the rr method is useful for evaluating timescales of water level displacement in pumping tests and when pumping tests approach slug test behavior there was no systematic difference between solutions at these sites early recovery data potentially influenced the analysis in tests at sites 3 5 and 8 table 3 the geometric mean at these sites was calculated both including and excluding solutions with early time data results fig 4 indicate that bulk k values as represented by the geometric mean are not substantially changed by the inclusion or exclusion of early time recovery data as geometric means were generally the same order of magnitude where early time data were included tables 3 and 4 a wilcoxon rank sum test was conducted on the geometric means including all solutions kt and those excluding early recovery data resulting in a p value 0 792 this indicates the geometric means are not significantly different at the p 0 05 level when early recovery data are excluded 3 2 specific capacity specific capacity was calculated for all wells alluvial and bedrock using eqs 2 and 3 spatial analysis of the distribution of sc values fig 5 indicates that alluvial wells on the western margin of the alluvial aquifer tend to have lesser calculated sc values than wells in the central region of the valley this difference may be the result of the transport distance of sediments where alluvium on the western margin has not been transported as far from the sediment source area sangre de cristo mountains and is therefore poorly sorted leading to lesser permeability bedrock wells tend to be located on the periphery of the valley at the base of the sangre de cristo and wet mountains aside from two bedrock wells located in the center of the valley bedrock sc does not appear to vary systematically across the valley aside from consistently low bedrock sc in the south fig 5 bedrock wells were not differentiated by lithology because 30 of the 36 are completed within the santa fe formation and the other six are completed in various other lithologies including precambrian igneous paleozoic sedimentary and tertiary igneous rocks cdss 2019 thus further subdivision is unlikely to provide information on hydraulic properties of each individual rock type a statistical comparison of calculated sc in alluvial and bedrock wells illustrates that alluvial wells have greater sc values than bedrock wells fig 6 the similarity of the datasets for alluvial and bedrock sc values were assessed using the wilcoxon rank sum test which is suited to non parametric datasets such as these helsel et al 2020 the results of the test show that the p value for the comparison of alluvial to bedrock sc is 5 22 10 6 indicating that the datasets are statistically significantly different at the p 0 001 level analysis of well completion depth versus sc showed a moderate relation fig 7 shallower wells less than 100 m in depth tend to have sc values greater than 1 m2 day for both bedrock and alluvial wells alluvial wells also tend to have sc values slightly greater than bedrock wells at depths greater than 50 m whereas at shallower depths the two datasets are more similar see loess smooths on fig 7 a loess smooth is a technique to illustrate the central tendency of a dataset graphically helsel et al 2020 variations in sc could also be explained by screen location well diameter and pumping rates but those were not statistically assessed as part of this study these results indicate that shallower portions of the aquifer are more likely to be productive for groundwater withdrawal a subset of nine wells also had time drawdown pumping data available and were evaluated to determine if the length of the pumping period and the total withdrawal volume affect sc values reported on well logs analysis of time discharge data during well installation indicates that sc is partially dependent on pumping duration fig 8 for wells with temporal data sc tended to be greatest in the early phases of testing and decreased with additional withdrawal risser 2010 noted that this pattern may be caused by turbulent flow in the well based on data in fig 8 it is likely that turbulent flow occurred in wells 201 934 and 216 285 corresponding to well log numbers shown in the explanation of fig 8 whereas other wells generally displayed more consistent sc through time the implication of this result is that sc and by association t calculated using only point in time drawdown would tend to result in higher end estimates whereas using time drawdown data would result in lesser values of sc and t 3 3 comparison of methods for deriving hydraulic parameter values a primary goal of this research was to compare results of multiple types of short term aquifer tests slug tests single hole pumping and recovery tests with hydraulic properties derived from sc data and to extrapolate results to areas of the basin without recorded aquifer testing below are discussions of the iterative and regression methods 3 3 1 iterative method and results of aquifer testing estimated k values determined by aqtesolv were compared to the ksc values estimated from sc data by the iterative method additionally values for k from each analytical method were compared with ksc as was the result of the geometric mean calculation kt fig 9 fig 9 illustrates the calculated k value from each analytical method and the geometric mean kt plotted against the k value estimated from sc data and the iterative method ksc this figure shows that there is a range of agreement between the various analytical methods values of kt derived from aquifer testing tended to be biased high compared to ksc when kt was greater than 1 m day points plotting above the 1 1 line and biased low when kt was less than 1 m day points plotting below the 1 1 line evaluation of the discrepancy between ksc values and various analytical methods table 5 indicates that slug testing methods hvorslev bouwer rice had smaller root mean squared error rmse values than approximations using pumping tests the high rmse values for the theis and cooper jacob methods are predominantly influenced by high values at sites 2 and 9 for those analytical methods aquifer testing at these sites may have been influenced by the observed variable pumping rates newman 2020 or potentially by turbulent drawdown additionally the cooper jacob solution can overestimate t in some situations such as leakage from an adjacent confining layer halford et al 2006 which may have occurred for these sites the rmse for the kt values was also high likely influenced by the high k values from pump test solutions the implication of these comparisons of in situ aquifer testing with ksc is that there may be substantial differences in the absolute values of estimated k but that these differences were not statistically significant at the p 0 05 level from the wilcoxon rank sum test therefore using the iterative method for initial evaluation of k appears to be well founded and can produce reasonable estimates site specific testing is likely to still be warranted in most instances however the use of multiple analytical solutions and the geometric mean is further useful for explore ranges of k in each tested well 3 3 2 regression method and results of aquifer testing extrapolation of aquifer testing results can be accomplished by establishing a relation between sc and t that allows for t to be calculated based only on sc patriarche et al 2005 a relation between sc and t is different than the relation between kt and ksc described previously fig 9 because a correlation between sc and t allows for t to be calculated independently from the iterative methodology fig 2 and table 2 to allow for an independent relation to be established the t value from in situ aquifer testing tt was calculated for each well from the kt value table 2 the logarithm of tt was plotted with the logarithm of sc logarithms were used for numerical stability and applicability patriarche et al 2005 results fig 10 show a moderate correlation that spans nearly the entire range of observed sc values in the alluvial well dataset sc from bedrock wells was not included because no tt values are available for bedrock wells because no bedrock wells were included in in situ aquifer testing a small number of wells in the alluvial dataset had lower log sc values than log sc values for wells included in aquifer testing i e the points used to create the linear regression do not extend to the left most side or tail end of the histogram shown in the upper panel of fig 10 specifically the full alluvial well dataset has a minimum log sc value equal 1 2 whereas the dataset used in the regression has a minimum log sc value equal to 0 15 this likely does not affect the results substantially because few wells in the alluvial well dataset have log sc values less than 0 an alternative regression was also calculated excluding potential outlier points sites 2 and 9 this alternative regression has a shallower slope and similar intercept value to the full regression but a lower r2 value the alternative regression also does not span as much of the log sc values observed in the dataset using the relation for the full dataset red regression on fig 10 it is possible to calculate the t value for all other wells in the alluvial dataset for which there are sc data but were not included in aquifer testing although wells with sc data outside the range of the regression will have greater uncertainty it is important to note the differences in this method from the iterative approach described in fig 2 table 2 and associated text the iterative approach uses an assumed initial t value for calculations as well as a variety of attributes of the well screen length radius etc the regression approach illustrated in fig 10 uses the measured sc from each well to calculate a t value which may then be converted to k by using the screen length the regression method is therefore independent of initial assumptions of t and storage parameters 3 3 3 comparison of iterative and regression methods results from the iterative and regression methods were compared because the iterative and regression based methods are both used in the literature bradbury and rothschild 1985 patriarche et al 2005 priebe et al 2018 richard et al 2016 but to date there are no comparisons of their applicability calculated log k values for each alluvial well from both the regression and iterative method are illustrated in fig 11 these results show that the k values calculated using the regression method are systematically biased high when compared to the results of the iteration method and are significantly different at the p 0 001 level using the wilcoxon rank sum test the likely cause of this bias is the inclusion of pumping tests with possible turbulent losses fig 10 these pumping tests at sites 2 and 9 produced high k values fig 8 table 4 which then may have biased the entire regression upwards fig 10 using a different set of aquifer tests to define kt would result in a different regression and thus a different relation between the results of the two methods the ranges of calculated k values are similar to those estimated for a similar aquifer near the study site by watts 2005 for alluvial materials of similar geologic origin watts 2005 estimated a range of log k values in m day from 3 67 to 2 66 which are similar to log k values estimated in this work from the regression method from 2 94 to 3 47 and from the iteration method from 3 81 to 0 96 fig 11 because both ranges are similar to the previous work of watts 2005 neither can be entirely eliminated aside from the upper end estimate of the regression method results i e log k values greater than 3 which are substantially greater than any previously reported values the implication of this comparison of the k estimated from both methods is that the methods should not be considered interchangeable and that careful consideration of testing design and application should be undertaken when using these methods in addition to comparison between the log k of results presented here and those of watts 2005 it is useful to evaluate spatial trends in calculated k values of the alluvial aquifer between the iterative and regression methods a spatial comparison of interpolated k for both methods is illustrated in fig 12 which shows that in addition to k from the regression method being biased high as illustrated in fig 11 the two methods also produce different zones of high k in the aquifer the interpolated k surface from the regression method has a distinctive high in the central portion of the alluvial aquifer while the iteration based k values are high both in the central portion of the aquifer and along the northwestern edge where several creeks exit the mountains conceptually the high k values in both interpolations near the center of the aquifer are consistent with increasing sorting of grains as streams transport sediments from west to east it is consistent with the conceptual model of the aquifer that the periphery would have lower k values where streams deposit poorly sorted materials the substantial difference in the absolute value of the different interpolated k surfaces occurs because the logarithmic transformation in fig 11 somewhat disguises the significant differences between the two estimates because they appear to have linear correlation in log log space these differences are highlighted in statistical tests and the spatial evaluation however illustrating that practitioners of either method should utilize similar techniques in assessing the results of aquifer testing 4 conclusions in the wet mountain valley of southern colorado two types of low cost aquifer testing traditional slug tests and short term single hole pumping tests were applied and analyzed for an alluvial aquifer with few available data relating to hydraulic properties in addition to site specific aquifer testing two methods of using sc data were applied the regression and iteration based methods hydraulic properties calculated using results of water level displacement generally agree with previous estimates from the study area and are internally consistent comparison of several analytical solutions hvorslev bouwer rice cooper jacob and theis indicated consistent results except in instances of hypothesized turbulent losses during testing in addition to in situ aquifer testing measurements of drawdown and pumping rate during well installation were cataloged from a publicly available dataset throughout the valley and used to calculate sc providing a much wider spatial distribution than would be possible using aquifer tests alone results of sc calculations were in turn used in both iterative and regression based methods to calculate t and likewise k comparison of the k values calculated from the iterative and regression methods illustrated that aquifer properties calculated using the methods are significantly different and result in substantially different spatial patterns in hydraulic properties bias may occur when outliers are included in the regression as was the case for high k values derived from pumping tests that displayed non ideal behavior nevertheless both methods may produce ranges of hydraulic property values that are generally consistent with previous investigations and may therefore be useful to provide bounds for inverse methods in groundwater flow modeling overall these results indicate that both low cost aquifer testing methods slug testing and single hole pump testing and sc are useful for calculating k in data poor basins although results may not be expected to be directly comparable to those from larger tests which stress the aquifer more such as pumping tests practitioners may utilize a workflow consisting of querying available databases of well logs for sc data then applying the iterative method for t and k calculation using input values appropriate for the hydrogeologic setting in querying well log databases care is warranted in evaluating sc data for turbulent flow or other complicating factors turbulent flow may be recognized in well log data by plotting sc over time where changes in sc may indicate turbulent flow within the well once first approximations of aquifer properties are derived site specific aquifer testing may be utilized either slug tests or pumping tests to further target specific wells with hydraulic property values representative of the total distribution or of specific areas of interest within the distribution using these site specific aquifer tests additional variability can be explored within the dataset leading to a more complete understanding of hydraulic characteristics when advanced techniques such as inversion

8096,study region rocky mountains united states study focus groundwater flow modeling requires estimates of hydraulic properties namely hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity values commonly vary over orders of magnitudes however and estimation may require extensive field campaigns applying slug or pumping tests as an alternative specific capacity tests can be used to estimate hydraulic properties for large areas when benchmarked with slug or pumping tests this study combined aquifer testing with specific capacity data to estimate hydraulic properties in a large alluvial aquifer new hydrological insights for region in the wet mountain valley colorado both slug tests and pumping tests were conducted resulting in a likely range of hydraulic conductivity values aquifer testing results were related to specific capacity data a more spatially distributed dataset to expand the area of aquifer characterization beyond the distribution of wells included in aquifer testing specific capacity data were used in two ways 1 a regression was built between specific capacity values and transmissivity derived from aquifer testing and 2 an iterative method was utilized to estimate transmissivity from specific capacity at all sites including sites lacking aquifer tests study results indicate that there is a statistically significant difference between hydraulic conductivity values estimated using the two approaches and that the regression method yields systematically greater values these results indicate that careful consideration of methods that use specific capacity for extrapolating aquifer properties is warranted as bias could be introduced depending on the applied methodology keywords colorado groundwater flow groundwater hydraulics hydraulic properties hydraulic testing 1 introduction simulation of groundwater flow is commonly undertaken to estimate the availability of water resources groundwater flow models are applied at a variety of scales from small local models to regional models of entire states or provinces reasonable model results and calibration require detailed knowledge of aquifer geometry thickness extent interlayering etc and properties hydraulic conductivity and storage determining aquifer properties specifically hydraulic conductivity k length time l t or transmissivity t l2 t where t is the product of k and aquifer thickness b l t kb is often difficult because these properties can vary over orders of magnitude in a single hydrologic environment freeze and cherry 1979 various aquifer testing methods can be used to estimate k the most common of which are pumping tests and slug tests butler 1997 kruseman and de ridder 1990 typically it is preferred to conduct pumping tests that include observation wells because this testing method uses an expanded monitoring network such that a greater volume of aquifer material is observed in addition long term pumping tests can potentially detect the effects of hydrologic boundaries such as streams or faults although pumping tests are effective for determining both t and storage properties such as specific yield and specific storage these tests have the disadvantage of being time consuming intricate in testing design expensive to implement and potentially difficult to analyze depending on the method and the availability of observations alternatively single hole methods such as slug tests and single hole pumping tests may be used one advantage of single hole testing methods is that these tests can be completed in domestic wells which provide for a greater distribution of well sites for testing than other well types however single hole tests do not use observation wells and so calculated storage properties using these results may be highly uncertain freeze and cherry 1979 an alternative method of determining k is to utilize specific capacity sc to estimate t and thereby k richard et al 2016 rotzoll and el kadi 2008 specific capacity is the ratio of pumping rate q l3 t to water level decline drawdown s l sc q s because sc data are commonly collected during well drilling and recorded on permits or well completion reports these data can be cost effectively obtained by query of well permitting databases although using sc to calculate k has been widely applied ahmed and de marsily 1987 mclin 2005 razack and huntley 1991 the method is not without difficulties because of aquifer heterogeneity and the need to establish site specific relations between k and sc mace 1997 previous research has focused on the relations between k and t derived sc calculations and pumping tests patriarche et al 2005 richard et al 2016 but relatively little work has focused on evaluating the data worth of combining slug testing and sc this paper discusses the utility of single hole aquifer testing methods including slug tests and single hole pumping tests and sc data to estimate k of an alluvial aquifer in an intermontane basin in colorado usa by using results from slug tests and single hole pumping tests in conjunction with sc data k can be estimated and extrapolated to parts of the valley without aquifer tests specifically this research compares two methods for using sc data to calculate hydraulic properties the iterative method bradbury and rothschild 1985 richard et al 2016 and the regression method patriarche et al 2005 priebe et al 2018 these methods have both been used throughout the literature but the results of both have not been directly compared additionally these methods have not been used in combination with short term aquifer testing but have traditionally been used with long term pumping tests insights into which method is most appropriate will be useful for practitioners designing aquifer characterization programs in data poor regions 1 1 study site the study site for this research is the wet mountain valley a roughly north south trending intermontane basin located in southern central colorado usa fig 1 the west side of the valley is bounded by the sangre de cristo mountains which are primarily composed of precambrian igneous rocks and paleozoic pennsylvanian and permian sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks lindsey 2010 the east side of the valley is bounded by the wet mountains which are primarily composed of tertiary igneous rocks cappa 1998 exposures of the tertiary santa fe formation a lacustrine to fluvial sandstone brister and gries 1994 are found at the base of both the sangre de cristo and wet mountains the central portion of the valley is composed of quaternary alluvium which thickens to the west crouch et al 1984 zohdy et al 1971 the wet mountain valley is a semi enclosed hydrologic basin with two surface water outlets grape creek and texas creek both of which are tributaries to the arkansas river to the north quaternary sand and gravel deposits derived from the surrounding mountains form an extensive basin fill alluvial aquifer in the wet mountain valley fig 1 the aquifer is composed of older alluvium from glacial deposits younger alluvium from stream deposits and alluvial fans along the mountain front londquist and livingston 1978 grain size distributions determined during well installation from drilling logs up to 400 m deep colorado decision support system cdss 2019 indicate that coarse and medium grained sediments are nearly equally distributed 21 and 25 respectively of all logged intervals whereas fine grained sediments makeup a smaller proportion of the alluvial material 9 each of logged intervals however these distributions are generalizations because they are taken from qualitative drilling logs the water bearing potential of paleozoic basement rocks and tertiary volcanic rocks is variable crouch et al 1984 a slight topographic divide in the southern part of the valley and the eastern and western mountain ranges provide surface water and potentially groundwater divides population in the region has grown rapidly within the past 20 years and is expected to continue to increase through 2040 colorado department of local affairs 2019 because the climate of the valley floor is semi arid much of the available water for consumptive use is sourced from streams entering the west side of the valley and the alluvial aquifer numerous groundwater wells are completed in the alluvial aquifer and surrounding bedrock aquifers and data pertaining to these wells are available from the cdss 2019 most wells 80 are registered for domestic use other well uses include irrigation 3 stock 6 commercial 4 and undefined uses 7 no water use statistics are available to estimate total groundwater withdrawals according to well types increasing groundwater demand from the alluvial aquifer and the desire to better understand groundwater and surface water interactions in the basin created the need for additional water resource studies in the area the basin is the subject of predictive groundwater flow modeling which is partially reliant on the hydraulic conductivity values derived from this analysis hydrologic monitoring has been conducted by the u s geological survey usgs in the wet mountain valley for over 20 years but this dataset consists almost exclusively of groundwater level observations to date no datasets pertaining to the hydraulic properties of the alluvial aquifer or groundwater and surface water interactions have been collected the focus of this paper is on aquifer testing and the estimation of hydraulic properties investigations of groundwater and surface water interactions are not discussed in depth in this analysis but are mentioned in this research to provide context for ongoing water resource studies current groundwater level monitoring in the basin consists of 29 wells fig 1 a portion of the wells were equipped with pressure transducers for continuous water level monitoring and the remaining had periodic manual groundwater level measurements nearly all wells are completed within the alluvial aquifer 26 of 29 nine wells 7 of which were instrumented with pressure transducers were selected for aquifer testing fig 1 and the attributes of these wells are summarized in table 1 wells were selected for aquifer testing based on spatial distribution examination of drilling logs and evaluation of previous water level monitoring data 2 methods the purpose of this work is to evaluate the applicability of various types of data collection and analysis in deriving k values that can be used in groundwater flow modeling first a subset of wells 9 locations was the subject of aquifer testing using traditional slug and single hole pumping tests section 2 1 next a combination of two low cost methods using sc data were utilized and evaluated section 2 2 finally the results of these methods were evaluated statistically both methods using sc data are described briefly and conceptually illustrated in fig 2 2 1 aquifer testing single hole aquifer tests were completed in nine wells table 1 testing consisted of slug tests and single well pumping tests slug tests typically consist of displacement of the water level in the well using a solid cylindrical tube of known volume the slug slug tests commonly include slug in falling head and slug out rising head tests when the slug is instantaneously inserted below the water table the water level rises in the well producing a temporary increase of water levels in the well which dissipates over time and thus gives the name falling head when the water level has approached pre testing conditions the slug is then instantaneously removed producing a decline in water level and a temporary decrease in the water level in the well which is filled by inflowing water thus giving the name rising head water levels are monitored on a frequent basis during this entire process butler 1997 cunningham and schalk 2011 single hole pumping tests consisted of pumping the well and monitoring both the decline of water levels during pumping and the rebound of water levels after pumping ceased in conjunction with recording of the pumping rate from the well kruseman and de ridder 1990 slug testing was completed in one monitoring well and single hole pumping tests were completed on the other eight wells single hole pumping tests were not performed in the monitoring well because of the narrow diameter which did not allow for both data recording devices and pump to be inserted simultaneously site 1 table 1 both falling head slug in and rising head slug out tests were conducted three times each in the monitoring well the three tests used different initial displacements ho as suggested by butler 1997 to evaluate theoretical applicability i e to determine how closely field conditions correspond to simplified theoretical conditions assumed in the calculations initial displacements were 0 16 m 0 54 ft 0 33 m 1 08 ft and 0 51 m 1 68 ft single hole pumping tests were conducted in wells with dedicated pumps each of these tests consisted of measuring the depth to water for 4 8 min prior to the test to ensure static conditions existed after which pumping was initiated and discharge and depth to water were measured over time discharge from the well was measured using timed volumetric methods and water level displacement was measured using pressure transducers at intervals of 250 ms after enough water level displacement was measured to clearly see the effect of pumping in the data pumping was discontinued and recovery was observed until approximate static conditions were once again reached pumping times varied from 10 to 261 min according to observed displacement these pumping times are considered great enough to produce stress on the aquifer in the immediate vicinity of the well but likely short enough such that interfering processes such as tidal influences may be ignored the maximum drawdown in each well obtained during testing varied based on pumping rate and the hydraulic properties in the vicinity of the well some pumps cycled during testing producing a step drawdown type of curve and these data were also analyzed additional details on duration of pumping pumping rates and drawdown in each well is provided in newman 2020 results of testing were analyzed using the computer program aqtesolv duffield 2007 various analytical methods were applied for each test to evaluate the effect of each method s assumptions and theoretical approaches and to find the best fit to the test results analysis of slug test data utilized the bouwer rice bouwer and rice 1976 and hvorslev 1951 methods the bouwer rice method is best suited for application to unconfined aquifers whereas the hvorslev method is generally applied to confined aquifers butler 1997 however within aqtesolv the hvorslev solution can be applied with an unconfined assumption duffield 2007 and this approach was used herein to allow direct comparison with the other methods used and because specific information on confining layers in the vicinity of the wells is not available both the bouwer rice and hvorslev methods have various assumptions related to penetration of the aquifer position of the well screen and flow behavior within the well butler 1997 although theoretically the methods are applicable under different scenarios assumptions listed above both were applied here to compare the response of wells included in aquifer testing against each solution a full review of the assumptions of each aquifer testing method may be found in butler 1997 and kruseman and de ridder 1990 the confined versus unconfined nature of the alluvial aquifer in the vicinity of each wells is not known with certainty because of sparse subsurface information on confining layers however confined conditions have been reported in the past londquist and livingston 1978 the first slug test in site 1 was conducted prior to redevelopment of the well results from this test indicated the presence of a well skin which is caused by interferences between the aquifer material and the well bore butler 1997 the first slug test at site 1 therefore likely does not represent hydraulic properties of the aquifer following the first test the well was redeveloped using a waterra pump for approximately 2 h until the produced water was no longer turbid subsequent slug testing was then conducted at a later date to allow static conditions to be achieved following redevelopment the theis 1935 and cooper jacob cooper and jacob 1946 methods were used to evaluate data for the single hole pumping tests data were included from both pumping and recovery portions of the tests i e pumping rates and the entire record of water levels from the initiation of pumping to the conclusion of recovery based on synthetic aquifer tests halford et al 2006 concluded that the cooper jacob method is the most applicable analytical solution to single hole pumping tests for unconfined conditions regardless of partial penetration or other potentially complicating factors however the theis method also was used in this analysis to evaluate differences between the solutions because the theis method is commonly used to analyze pumping tests with variable observation networks e g sun 2018 one of the goals of this work is to assess potential differences between multiple types of potentially applicable analytical solutions such that practitioners of aquifer testing programs may understand how the usage of different solutions could affect resultant calculated hydraulic properties the recovery portion of the data water level data collected after pumping ceased from single hole pumping tests was also analyzed using the hvorslev and bouwer rice methods this analysis was conducted to evaluate the applicability of these solutions for pump test data such that a greater number of k estimates from each well may be obtained for use in statistical evaluation for this analysis the recovery period was treated as a rising head slug test although the theoretical underpinnings of slug testing and pump testing are different many of the assumptions are the same between the analytical methods for example both the cooper jacob and hvorslev methods assume an infinite homogeneous uniform thickness aquifer the primary differences in the methods are that the hvorslev method assumes an instantaneous water level displacement whereas the cooper jacob method assumes unsteady flow treatment of the recovery period of single hole pumping tests as a rising head slug out test explores the applicability of slug test solutions to recovery data from single hole pumping tests and provides practitioners with information on the range of methodologies that may be applied in initial aquifer characterization programs in data poor regions one of the goals of this study in order to quantify the degree to which pumping approaches an instantaneous head change the quantity recovery ratio rr was defined herein and calculated for each test according to 1 r r t m t s t r t m t displacement t recovery where tm denotes time to maximum displacement in seconds sec ts denotes time of test initiation sec tr denotes time of recovery attainment sec δtdisplacement denotes time from test initiation to maximum displacement and δtrecovery denotes time from maximum displacement to recovery recovery was considered attained when the water level in the well was within 2 of the water level prior to test initiation the rr value approaches zero for tests with truly instantaneous water level displacement and approaches infinity when displacement occurs slowly in comparison to recovery pumping tests with small rr values approach the behavior of a slug test in that water level displacement occurs rapidly in comparison to recovery a primary assumption of slug testing analytical solutions the rr was used to assess the timing of water level displacement in both slug and pumping tests a criterion for maximum value of rr 0 2 was used recovery portions of pumping tests with rr values less than this threshold were analyzed using hvorslev and bouwer rice methods whereas those with rr values greater than the threshold were only analyzed using theis and cooper jacob methods the cutoff value of rr 0 2 was determined by trial and error to remove testing with prolonged recovery while maintaining inclusion of testing with relatively rapid recovery regardless of the analytical solution applied hvorslev bouwer rice theis or cooper jacob when early response data were shown to control the solution i e when there was a substantial change in slope of displacement at the beginning the test two solutions were calculated one in which early recovery data were included and one in which they were removed when early recovery data are not removed they tend to bias the calculated k values this analysis therefore includes some subjectivity based on the experience of the practitioner as to the recognition of borehole storage or other early recovery effects the geometric mean of all solutions for a given well aside from when early recovery occurred was calculated to provide the estimated k value from aquifer testing kt for the well geometric means are appropriate in situations except when extremely small or highly variable k values are prevalent jensen 1991 sanchez vila et al 2006 which was not the case in this study using the geometric mean of all solutions also provides a method by which to consider the range of values in aggregate as opposed to subjectively choosing the solution to use for k although the assumptions of some models are met more closely in certain situations there is always uncertainty and ambiguity with respect to subsurface conditions near the wells because of these uncertainties the geometric mean is the most robust method for estimating the central tendency of k values from aquifer testing in each well because it is less susceptible to outliers than other estimates of central tendency when the data are log normally distributed helsel et al 2020 which is the case in this study these kt values are then compared to results of k estimation from sc see below it is critical to understand that analysis of aquifer testing data is inherently subjective the analyst chooses solutions to compare to and determines best fit by visual evaluation because of the subjectivity it is most robust to include several analytical solutions as was applied in this study which minimizes the subjective choices of the analyst on quantitative estimates of hydraulic properties 2 2 specific capacity specific capacity is commonly tested and recorded on well drilling records for groundwater wells and is calculated according to priebe et al 2018 2 sc q s where sc denotes specific capacity m2 day q denotes well discharge m3 day and s denotes drawdown m both q and s were recorded from drillers logs sourced from the cdss 2019 wells were selected from throughout the wet mountain valley to provide for greater spatial extent of the calculations in total data were analyzed from 65 alluvial wells and 36 bedrock wells based on spatial distribution range of well depth and available information on lithology and well characteristics several variables affect the accuracy of sc including pumping discharge rate consistency of pumping rate and well construction risser 2010 ranges of q were 0 94 liters per minute lpm 0 25 gallons per minute gpm to 3028 lpm 800 gpm for deep long screened large diameter wells of the 101 wells included in the dataset 35 had q less than 19 lpm 5 gpm 69 had q less than 57 lpm 15 gpm and 93 had q less than 151 lpm 40 gpm these pumping rates are generally in the range such that most wells likely display non turbulent flow for their diameter risser 2010 though turbulent flows are apparent in a subset of wells as described in the results section most wells have only one data point for drawdown but some wells do have time drawdown data recorded from drillers logs enabling evaluation of the effects of continued pumping on sc in unconfined aquifers s must be corrected because the theis solution is directly applicable only to confined aquifers therefore corrected drawdown was calculated according to astm 1999 and richard et al 2016 3 s s s 2 2 m where s denotes corrected drawdown m and m denotes saturated thickness of the aquifer prior to pumping m confining layers for aquifers in the wet mountain valley have not been studied nor mapped therefore the alluvial deposits were assumed to be unconfined and the bedrock was assumed to be confined analysis of geospatial data and well logs indicates that wells completed in bedrock are typically drilled through alluvium and the contrasting hydraulic properties of the alluvium bedrock interface may be substantial enough to create a hydraulic barrier 2 2 1 iterative method an iterative method was used to calculate t and thereby k from the sc components q and s using the theoretical foundation of the cooper jacob equation following richard et al 2016 an iterative equation for calculation of t is 4 t i 1 q 4 π s t ln t i q 4 π s t ln 2 25 t r w 2 s where ti denotes the estimated t m2 day from the i th iteration ti 1 denotes the t estimated in the i 1 iteration m2 day s t denotes corrected drawdown observed at time t t denotes time days rw denotes the radius of the well m and s denotes the aquifer storage coefficient dimensionless when time drawdown pumping data are available the iterative approach was applied to only the first pair of q and s values a complete theoretical description of the iterative approach is provided in bradbury and rothschild 1985 and richard et al 2016 using this iterative method an initial t ti to was estimated as the product of the screen length b for each well and k for applicable aquifer materials from the literature freeze and cherry 1979 previous studies have evaluated using the screen length versus true aquifer thickness for computations between t and k halford et al 2006 patriarche et al 2005 priebe et al 2018 with varying results in this instance using screen length was deemed appropriate because the true thickness of the aquifer in the vicinity of any particular well is not known with certainty using estimates of the total aquifer thickness could substantially affect results of the calculations because aquifer thickness may be much thicker than the thickness actively contributing water to the well but the aquifer thickness cannot be known a priori the aquifer storage parameter was also estimated based on literature values priebe et al 2018 found that the relation between t and sc was relatively insensitive to storage parameter s assumptions so the storage value applied in this study is not expected to substantially affect the calculations iterative calculations in this study used s 0 05 for alluvial wells and s 1 10 6 for bedrock wells both values from freeze and cherry 1979 once the initial to is estimated an iterative approach is utilized wherein a new ti 1 is calculated the values of ti and ti 1 are compared and iteration is continued until there is less than 1 difference in subsequent values the same criterion as used by richard et al 2016 a computer code was written in the python programming language van rossum and drake 2009 to complete iterative calculations final estimated t was then converted back to k for comparison with aquifer tests as described by priebe et al 2018 using k versus t allows comparability between various literature sources and results of this testing transmissivity is the aquifer property that describes bulk productivity halford et al 2006 and k is a transformed value using b in this instance that describes properties of the aquifer more applicable to smaller aquifer volumes near wells this approach was utilized to calculate a k value for all wells with appropriate sc data ksc hydraulic conductivity calculated from sc measurements ksc using the iterative method was then compared to k values obtained from aquifer testing kt for the wells included in table 1 to evaluate the differences comparisons are made using log log relations which are more resistant to outliers patriarche et al 2005 and statistically using the wilcoxon rank sum test which is well suited for application to non parametric datasets helsel et al 2020 this iterative approach is conceptually outlined in fig 2 and variables are defined in table 2 2 2 2 regression method after a kt value was calculated for each well included in the aquifer testing a t value representative of in situ testing tt was calculated using the screen length as aquifer thickness b tt ktb a log log linear regression between tt and sc was then plotted for the nine wells with aquifer test results using this regression a t value was estimated for all alluvial wells in the aquifer using compiled sc values the regression method is conceptually illustrated on fig 2 and variables are defined in table 2 similar regression methods have been utilized by patriarche et al 2005 and priebe et al 2018 though they have not been compared against iterative methods as described above the regression method was not applied to bedrock wells because the aquifer parameters derived from aquifer testing kt tt are only applicable to alluvial wells no site specific aquifer testing was conducted in bedrock wells for this analysis because the alluvial aquifer was the primary subject of this study bedrock sc values are compiled here to provide a basis for future evaluation of hydraulic properties of the bedrock aquifer within the study area 3 results and discussion 3 1 aquifer testing all raw testing data pumping rates for single hole tests well logs and aqtesolv results are included in an accompanying usgs data release newman 2020 and examples of aquifer test data are illustrated in fig 3 results of calculated k values are summarized for each well in tables 3 and 4 and fig 4 which include the calculated k value from each analytical solution the geometric mean of all calculated k values kt the estimated k value from sc calculations ksc using the iterative method and the evaluation of timescales of drawdown and recovery using the recovery ratio rr additionally the best fit solution based on comparison of analytical solutions and observations is indicated for each well in table 3 plots comparing all analytical solutions and observations are illustrated in newman 2020 it is important to note that not all analytical solutions illustrated in newman 2020 are considered reasonable the process of fitting solutions to data is used to differentiate applicable solutions from inapplicable solutions both of which are included in the usgs data release newman 2020 thus only results of aquifer testing considered to be reasonable are summarized in table 3 reasonability of solutions was assessed using several criteria including 1 fit of data to theoretical solutions 2 field information indicating noisy data and 3 conceptual agreement between the aquifer in the vicinity of the well based on well logs with assumptions of the given model hvorslev bouwer rice theis or cooper jacob subjective decision making was used to determine solutions that were reasonable to use in subsequent analyses the best fit solutions based on the aforementioned criteria are identified in table 3 as are notes on specific analyses and their reasonability or other factors examples of water level data fig 3 paired with calculation of rr table 4 show that pumping tests have varying degrees of drawdown timescales the value of rr for pumping tests ranges from 0 039 in site 3 indicating near instantaneous water level displacement to 415 in site 9 indicating that drawdown required long time periods in relation to water level recovery values for rr in slug tests ranged from 0 001 to 0 002 water temperature data also may be useful for qualitatively evaluating timescales of aquifer response as water temperature changes during pumping and slug testing fig 3 and newman 2020 specifically water temperature appears to change more during pump testing at site 7 than during slug testing at site 1 the greater change in water temperature is likely linked to the volume of aquifer material influenced by the testing with greater changes being indicative of greater influence on the aquifer temperature data may be useful in qualitative evaluation of aquifer testing data and temperature data have a wide range of uses in hydrologic characterization anderson 2005 slug testing was completed at site 1 utilizing three separate tests with different displacements as described in the methods section 2 1 pump testing was not completed at this site because of the narrow well diameter the first slug test indicated non ideal characteristics variable behavior for slug in versus slug out test so the well was redeveloped by purging at a high rate two slug tests were then completed after redevelopment with different ho for both tests analysis of post development data resulted in an increase in k and a consistent k for both the slug in and slug out portions of the test fig 4 these results indicate that well redevelopment improved the hydraulic connection between the well and the aquifer therefore the post development test results are considered more representative of the aquifer properties the hvorslev and bouwer rice methods calculated nearly identical k values despite the different assumptions of each method butler 1997 single well drawdown and recovery pumping tests generally resulted in drawdown signals with minimal oscillation in water level displacement see plots of water level displacement for all wells in newman 2020 and for site 7 in fig 3 pumping rates did vary in several wells however leading to a more complex drawdown signal variable drawdown can complicate single well testing analysis li et al 2018 analysis of pumping and recovery data using the theis and cooper jacob methods generally produced similar results fig 4 although theis results tended to yield slightly greater k values than cooper jacob results 6 of 8 wells differences between these solution methods may relate to the penetration of the aquifer halford et al 2006 noted that partial penetration of the aquifer is a substantial departure from the original theis model despite this aqtesolv duffield 2007 does include options for partial penetration of the aquifer when completing calculations partial penetration is nearly certain for all the wells considered in this study although the calculations using the theis solution were completed using options for partial penetration the estimates of k by the theis method may be biased high because of their departure from theory e g halford et al 2006 nevertheless all results were included in calculation of kt for each well using the geometric mean because results were on the same order of magnitude as those using the cooper jacob solution and because evaluating the effect of aggregation on derived hydraulic parameters is one of the goals of the study slug test solutions bouwer rice hvorslvev and solutions for recovery theis cooper jacob were completed for sites 3 7 and 8 i e wells with rr values less than 0 2 the calculated k values for these sites are similar between the slug test and pump test solutions indicating that the rr method is useful for evaluating timescales of water level displacement in pumping tests and when pumping tests approach slug test behavior there was no systematic difference between solutions at these sites early recovery data potentially influenced the analysis in tests at sites 3 5 and 8 table 3 the geometric mean at these sites was calculated both including and excluding solutions with early time data results fig 4 indicate that bulk k values as represented by the geometric mean are not substantially changed by the inclusion or exclusion of early time recovery data as geometric means were generally the same order of magnitude where early time data were included tables 3 and 4 a wilcoxon rank sum test was conducted on the geometric means including all solutions kt and those excluding early recovery data resulting in a p value 0 792 this indicates the geometric means are not significantly different at the p 0 05 level when early recovery data are excluded 3 2 specific capacity specific capacity was calculated for all wells alluvial and bedrock using eqs 2 and 3 spatial analysis of the distribution of sc values fig 5 indicates that alluvial wells on the western margin of the alluvial aquifer tend to have lesser calculated sc values than wells in the central region of the valley this difference may be the result of the transport distance of sediments where alluvium on the western margin has not been transported as far from the sediment source area sangre de cristo mountains and is therefore poorly sorted leading to lesser permeability bedrock wells tend to be located on the periphery of the valley at the base of the sangre de cristo and wet mountains aside from two bedrock wells located in the center of the valley bedrock sc does not appear to vary systematically across the valley aside from consistently low bedrock sc in the south fig 5 bedrock wells were not differentiated by lithology because 30 of the 36 are completed within the santa fe formation and the other six are completed in various other lithologies including precambrian igneous paleozoic sedimentary and tertiary igneous rocks cdss 2019 thus further subdivision is unlikely to provide information on hydraulic properties of each individual rock type a statistical comparison of calculated sc in alluvial and bedrock wells illustrates that alluvial wells have greater sc values than bedrock wells fig 6 the similarity of the datasets for alluvial and bedrock sc values were assessed using the wilcoxon rank sum test which is suited to non parametric datasets such as these helsel et al 2020 the results of the test show that the p value for the comparison of alluvial to bedrock sc is 5 22 10 6 indicating that the datasets are statistically significantly different at the p 0 001 level analysis of well completion depth versus sc showed a moderate relation fig 7 shallower wells less than 100 m in depth tend to have sc values greater than 1 m2 day for both bedrock and alluvial wells alluvial wells also tend to have sc values slightly greater than bedrock wells at depths greater than 50 m whereas at shallower depths the two datasets are more similar see loess smooths on fig 7 a loess smooth is a technique to illustrate the central tendency of a dataset graphically helsel et al 2020 variations in sc could also be explained by screen location well diameter and pumping rates but those were not statistically assessed as part of this study these results indicate that shallower portions of the aquifer are more likely to be productive for groundwater withdrawal a subset of nine wells also had time drawdown pumping data available and were evaluated to determine if the length of the pumping period and the total withdrawal volume affect sc values reported on well logs analysis of time discharge data during well installation indicates that sc is partially dependent on pumping duration fig 8 for wells with temporal data sc tended to be greatest in the early phases of testing and decreased with additional withdrawal risser 2010 noted that this pattern may be caused by turbulent flow in the well based on data in fig 8 it is likely that turbulent flow occurred in wells 201 934 and 216 285 corresponding to well log numbers shown in the explanation of fig 8 whereas other wells generally displayed more consistent sc through time the implication of this result is that sc and by association t calculated using only point in time drawdown would tend to result in higher end estimates whereas using time drawdown data would result in lesser values of sc and t 3 3 comparison of methods for deriving hydraulic parameter values a primary goal of this research was to compare results of multiple types of short term aquifer tests slug tests single hole pumping and recovery tests with hydraulic properties derived from sc data and to extrapolate results to areas of the basin without recorded aquifer testing below are discussions of the iterative and regression methods 3 3 1 iterative method and results of aquifer testing estimated k values determined by aqtesolv were compared to the ksc values estimated from sc data by the iterative method additionally values for k from each analytical method were compared with ksc as was the result of the geometric mean calculation kt fig 9 fig 9 illustrates the calculated k value from each analytical method and the geometric mean kt plotted against the k value estimated from sc data and the iterative method ksc this figure shows that there is a range of agreement between the various analytical methods values of kt derived from aquifer testing tended to be biased high compared to ksc when kt was greater than 1 m day points plotting above the 1 1 line and biased low when kt was less than 1 m day points plotting below the 1 1 line evaluation of the discrepancy between ksc values and various analytical methods table 5 indicates that slug testing methods hvorslev bouwer rice had smaller root mean squared error rmse values than approximations using pumping tests the high rmse values for the theis and cooper jacob methods are predominantly influenced by high values at sites 2 and 9 for those analytical methods aquifer testing at these sites may have been influenced by the observed variable pumping rates newman 2020 or potentially by turbulent drawdown additionally the cooper jacob solution can overestimate t in some situations such as leakage from an adjacent confining layer halford et al 2006 which may have occurred for these sites the rmse for the kt values was also high likely influenced by the high k values from pump test solutions the implication of these comparisons of in situ aquifer testing with ksc is that there may be substantial differences in the absolute values of estimated k but that these differences were not statistically significant at the p 0 05 level from the wilcoxon rank sum test therefore using the iterative method for initial evaluation of k appears to be well founded and can produce reasonable estimates site specific testing is likely to still be warranted in most instances however the use of multiple analytical solutions and the geometric mean is further useful for explore ranges of k in each tested well 3 3 2 regression method and results of aquifer testing extrapolation of aquifer testing results can be accomplished by establishing a relation between sc and t that allows for t to be calculated based only on sc patriarche et al 2005 a relation between sc and t is different than the relation between kt and ksc described previously fig 9 because a correlation between sc and t allows for t to be calculated independently from the iterative methodology fig 2 and table 2 to allow for an independent relation to be established the t value from in situ aquifer testing tt was calculated for each well from the kt value table 2 the logarithm of tt was plotted with the logarithm of sc logarithms were used for numerical stability and applicability patriarche et al 2005 results fig 10 show a moderate correlation that spans nearly the entire range of observed sc values in the alluvial well dataset sc from bedrock wells was not included because no tt values are available for bedrock wells because no bedrock wells were included in in situ aquifer testing a small number of wells in the alluvial dataset had lower log sc values than log sc values for wells included in aquifer testing i e the points used to create the linear regression do not extend to the left most side or tail end of the histogram shown in the upper panel of fig 10 specifically the full alluvial well dataset has a minimum log sc value equal 1 2 whereas the dataset used in the regression has a minimum log sc value equal to 0 15 this likely does not affect the results substantially because few wells in the alluvial well dataset have log sc values less than 0 an alternative regression was also calculated excluding potential outlier points sites 2 and 9 this alternative regression has a shallower slope and similar intercept value to the full regression but a lower r2 value the alternative regression also does not span as much of the log sc values observed in the dataset using the relation for the full dataset red regression on fig 10 it is possible to calculate the t value for all other wells in the alluvial dataset for which there are sc data but were not included in aquifer testing although wells with sc data outside the range of the regression will have greater uncertainty it is important to note the differences in this method from the iterative approach described in fig 2 table 2 and associated text the iterative approach uses an assumed initial t value for calculations as well as a variety of attributes of the well screen length radius etc the regression approach illustrated in fig 10 uses the measured sc from each well to calculate a t value which may then be converted to k by using the screen length the regression method is therefore independent of initial assumptions of t and storage parameters 3 3 3 comparison of iterative and regression methods results from the iterative and regression methods were compared because the iterative and regression based methods are both used in the literature bradbury and rothschild 1985 patriarche et al 2005 priebe et al 2018 richard et al 2016 but to date there are no comparisons of their applicability calculated log k values for each alluvial well from both the regression and iterative method are illustrated in fig 11 these results show that the k values calculated using the regression method are systematically biased high when compared to the results of the iteration method and are significantly different at the p 0 001 level using the wilcoxon rank sum test the likely cause of this bias is the inclusion of pumping tests with possible turbulent losses fig 10 these pumping tests at sites 2 and 9 produced high k values fig 8 table 4 which then may have biased the entire regression upwards fig 10 using a different set of aquifer tests to define kt would result in a different regression and thus a different relation between the results of the two methods the ranges of calculated k values are similar to those estimated for a similar aquifer near the study site by watts 2005 for alluvial materials of similar geologic origin watts 2005 estimated a range of log k values in m day from 3 67 to 2 66 which are similar to log k values estimated in this work from the regression method from 2 94 to 3 47 and from the iteration method from 3 81 to 0 96 fig 11 because both ranges are similar to the previous work of watts 2005 neither can be entirely eliminated aside from the upper end estimate of the regression method results i e log k values greater than 3 which are substantially greater than any previously reported values the implication of this comparison of the k estimated from both methods is that the methods should not be considered interchangeable and that careful consideration of testing design and application should be undertaken when using these methods in addition to comparison between the log k of results presented here and those of watts 2005 it is useful to evaluate spatial trends in calculated k values of the alluvial aquifer between the iterative and regression methods a spatial comparison of interpolated k for both methods is illustrated in fig 12 which shows that in addition to k from the regression method being biased high as illustrated in fig 11 the two methods also produce different zones of high k in the aquifer the interpolated k surface from the regression method has a distinctive high in the central portion of the alluvial aquifer while the iteration based k values are high both in the central portion of the aquifer and along the northwestern edge where several creeks exit the mountains conceptually the high k values in both interpolations near the center of the aquifer are consistent with increasing sorting of grains as streams transport sediments from west to east it is consistent with the conceptual model of the aquifer that the periphery would have lower k values where streams deposit poorly sorted materials the substantial difference in the absolute value of the different interpolated k surfaces occurs because the logarithmic transformation in fig 11 somewhat disguises the significant differences between the two estimates because they appear to have linear correlation in log log space these differences are highlighted in statistical tests and the spatial evaluation however illustrating that practitioners of either method should utilize similar techniques in assessing the results of aquifer testing 4 conclusions in the wet mountain valley of southern colorado two types of low cost aquifer testing traditional slug tests and short term single hole pumping tests were applied and analyzed for an alluvial aquifer with few available data relating to hydraulic properties in addition to site specific aquifer testing two methods of using sc data were applied the regression and iteration based methods hydraulic properties calculated using results of water level displacement generally agree with previous estimates from the study area and are internally consistent comparison of several analytical solutions hvorslev bouwer rice cooper jacob and theis indicated consistent results except in instances of hypothesized turbulent losses during testing in addition to in situ aquifer testing measurements of drawdown and pumping rate during well installation were cataloged from a publicly available dataset throughout the valley and used to calculate sc providing a much wider spatial distribution than would be possible using aquifer tests alone results of sc calculations were in turn used in both iterative and regression based methods to calculate t and likewise k comparison of the k values calculated from the iterative and regression methods illustrated that aquifer properties calculated using the methods are significantly different and result in substantially different spatial patterns in hydraulic properties bias may occur when outliers are included in the regression as was the case for high k values derived from pumping tests that displayed non ideal behavior nevertheless both methods may produce ranges of hydraulic property values that are generally consistent with previous investigations and may therefore be useful to provide bounds for inverse methods in groundwater flow modeling overall these results indicate that both low cost aquifer testing methods slug testing and single hole pump testing and sc are useful for calculating k in data poor basins although results may not be expected to be directly comparable to those from larger tests which stress the aquifer more such as pumping tests practitioners may utilize a workflow consisting of querying available databases of well logs for sc data then applying the iterative method for t and k calculation using input values appropriate for the hydrogeologic setting in querying well log databases care is warranted in evaluating sc data for turbulent flow or other complicating factors turbulent flow may be recognized in well log data by plotting sc over time where changes in sc may indicate turbulent flow within the well once first approximations of aquifer properties are derived site specific aquifer testing may be utilized either slug tests or pumping tests to further target specific wells with hydraulic property values representative of the total distribution or of specific areas of interest within the distribution using these site specific aquifer tests additional variability can be explored within the dataset leading to a more complete understanding of hydraulic characteristics when advanced techniques such as inversion

8097,study region xijiang river south china study focus this paper discusses the application of wrf hydro a distributed hydrological model to a complicated watershed the model performance on simulating streamflow soil moisture soil temperature and evapotranspiration is evaluated changes and characteristics of streamflow and related variables simulated by the model are analyzed new hydrological insights for the region in this study thirteen sensitive parameters used in this model are tested in large and small watersheds of the basin it is found that large basins are more sensitive to base flow parameters than small basins the wrf default soil type dataset is replaced by the beijing normal university bnu soil type dataset that is more accurate the model can simulate temporal changes of streamflow as well as temporary variabilities of hydrological variables the model can be applied in small and large watersheds the trend of streamflow in the basin is spatially uneven with an increasing trend in the upper part and a decreasing trend in the lower part the changes in streamflow are partly related to precipitation and evapotranspiration trends the trends of 30 day maximum minimum streamflow are not significant but the reversals demonstrate significant changes during 1980 2018 this study is expected to serve as a reference for the application of the model in this basin and model calibration over different sizes of study area keywords wrf hydro streamflow application soil moisture evapotranspiration iha 1 introduction knowledge of hydrological cycle is important for water resources management and assessment of water related hazards such as floods and droughts liu et al 2008 wang et al 2011 in the context of global warming the magnitude and frequency of hydrological disasters are increasing ma et al 2019 winsemius et al 2016 hydrological models are the most important tool for the simulation and forecast of hydrological processes these models can be used to predict floods and droughts and help water resources management beskow et al 2011 hydrological models can be roughly divided into two types lumped models and distributed models devia et al 2015 in lumped models the spatial variability is neglected and the entire river basin is taken as one unit therefore the spatial processes in the watershed are not explicitly considered different to lumped models the spatial variations of parameters variables and conventional hydrometeorological data are considered in distributed models the entire watershed is divided into small units to produce predictions in distributed models therefore the intra basin variability can be carefully studied and the values of model parameters from geospatial data such as land cover and soil types can be inferred wang et al 2011 with the development of the geographic information system and computer sciences distributed models have been improved and widely used in recent years lei et al 2014 in this

atmosphere sea coupling studies rummler et al 2019 varlas et al 2018 senatore et al 2015 indicated that wrf hydro can rightly simulate the land surface water cycle processes with a 3 year simulation in southern italy arnault et al 2016 proposed that wrf hydro can reflect the impact of land atmosphere processes on surface runoff kerandi et al 2017 found that wrf hydro coupled with wrf weather research and forecasting model model can be used as a tool to quantify the atmospheric terrestrial water balance in the tana river basin ryu et al 2017 revealed that wrf hydro coupled with wrf model can help predict flood events in a small watershed in korea silver et al 2017 pointed out that wrf hydro coupled with wrf model can truly reflect the actual runoff changes in the arid semi arid of israel and jordan despite it is wide application around the world wrf hydro is rarely used in china and its performance in china especially in large scale basins with complicated terrain should be carefully examined the xijiang river west river is the longest river in the basin of the pearl river it provides 63 9 of the total river discharge and accounts for 77 8 of the total area of the pearl river zhong et al 2018 which makes it very important for the socio economic development in south china yuan et al 2017 because of its importance for the pearl river delta the xijiang river is also called the golden waterway lin et al 2017 the water resource in the xijiang river basin is an important component of the water supply that meets the demand of the pearl river delta sun and niu 2019 besides both floods and droughts occur frequently in the xijiang river basin cui et al 2007 in recent years this basin has experienced more floods and droughts yuan et al 2017 due to the influence of global warming the geological environment of the xijiang river basin is very complicated which leads to complex land surface processes and hydrological processes thereby hydrological simulation and forecast in this basin remains an extremely challenging issue a hydrological model with complete dynamic and thermal processes is required for realistic simulation and prediction of hydrological conditions in this basin wrf hydro is a good choice to serve these requirements some hydrological models have been applied to this basin but the resolutions of those models are relatively coarse chen et al 2019 jiang et al 2011 shan et al 2015 yuan et al 2014 in this study wrf hydro model is applied to the xijiang river basin for processes studies over both small sub basins and the entire river basin with a relatively high spatial resolution the object of this study is to evaluate the performance of wrf hydro in reproducing the streamflow and hydrological conditions in the xijiang river mainstream basin and its several sub basins and determine whether the model is suitable for studies over both large and small basins with different topographies also the changes and characteristics of the streamflow during 1980 2018 and their possible causes are explored and discussed 2 data and method 2 1 study area the pearl river is the second largest river in china in terms of annual streamflow and the xijiang river is the largest tributary of the pearl river yuan et al 2017 the xijiang river originates in the east of the maxiong mountain flows through yunnan guizhou guangxi and guangdong provinces and ultimately flows into the south sea the length of the xijiang river is 2214 km and the drainage area is 346 000 km2 which accounts for nearly 80 of the total drainage area of the pearl river basin niu et al 2015 it is important for the development of the economy and culture in guangdong province and guangxi province this area is characterized by complex terrain with several land use types fig 3 and various climate regimes the west part representing the upstream of the river is mainly a mountainous area the east representing the downstream of the river is flat the topography and the location of the xijiang river basin are shown in fig 1 the xijiang river basin is located in a tropical and subtropical region that is hot and humid the annual average temperature is around 20 c the annual average air humidity is about 75 the annual average rainfall approximately is 1700 mm the spatial distribution of annual mean rainfall 1980 1984 and 2006 2014 is shown in fig 2 due to the monsoon rainfall both precipitation and streamflow demonstrate large seasonal variabilities zhang et al 2009 this river is a semi perennial river whose streamflow is low in dry season but increases significantly in wet season the precipitation from april to september accounts for nearly 65 of the annual mean precipitation and the streamflow from april to september accounts for nearly 75 of the annual mean streamflow yu et al 2016 in order to study the model s applications in different conditions of terrain and land use several tributaries of the xijiang river are selected including the beipanjiang river gaoche station is the representative station and the mabie river maling station is the representative station in the upstream of the xijiang river and the liujiang river liuzhou station is the representative station and the guijiang river pingle station is the representative station in the downstream of the xijiang river shown in fig 1 the elevations of the beipanjiang river and the mabie river basins are higher compared with the elevations of the liujiang river and the guijiang river basins the predominant landuse type is savannas in the beipanjiang river the mabie river basin and the guijiang river basins woody savannas is the prevailing landuse type in the liujiang river basin shown in fig 3 2 2 datasets wrf hydro requires a number of files to describe the model domain parameters initial condition and meteorological conditions the high resolution global dem data are extracted from the hydrosheds data hydrological data and maps based on shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales https hydrosheds cr usgs gov dataavail php the hydrosheds dem dataset is developed based on high resolution radar topography mission srtm the resolution of this dataset is divided into three categories that is 3 about 90 m 15 about 500 m and 30 about 1 km lehner et al 2008 due to the area size and complexity of the xijiang river basin the resolution of 15 is selected for this research the dem is processed by arcgis to get the accurate river network to run the offline model several meteorological variables are needed these variables include downward long wave radiation downward short wave radiation surface pressure precipitation rate specific humidity air temperature near surface u and v wind components the main source of meteorological data used in this paper is the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd which is a near surface meteorological reanalysis dataset developed by the institute of tibetan plateau research of the chinese academy of sciences this dataset is developed based on the princeton reanalysis data gldas global land data assimilation system data gewex srb global energy and water cycle experiment surface radiation budget radiation data trmm tropical rainfall measuring mission precipitation data and conventional meteorological observation data of china meteorological administration its temporal resolution is 3 h and its spatial resolution is 0 1 chen et al 2011 this dataset has been used in the fields of hydrology climate simulation and land surface process simulation ma et al 2019 sun et al 2017 since cmfd only includes wind speed but no wind direction which is required by wrf hydro u and v wind components of era5 are also used in this research the era5 hersbach et al 2020 is a reanalysis dataset released by the european center for medium range weather forecasts with horizontal resolution of 30 km and the era5 data at 6 hour intervals are used in our research precipitation plays an important role in hydrological models liu et al 2017 cn05 1 is a widely used daily precipitation dataset with a resolution of 0 25 and it is based on in situ observations at over 2400 weather stations in china wu and gao 2013 the resolution of cn05 1 is coarse compared with the model resolution 5000 m and 6 h and cannot meet the research demand therefore the precipitation of cmfd is used the precipitation of cmfd was evaluated before it is implemented for the present study distributions of annual mean precipitation over the basin during the periods of 1980 1984 and 2006 2014 derived from the cn05 1 and cmfd are compared fig 2 it can be seen that the annual mean precipitation decreases from southeast to northwest for both datasets the spatial correlation coefficient and the root mean square error rmse between cmfd and cn05 1 precipitation are 0 84 and 3 1 mm respectively the performance of the cmfd precipitation dataset is acceptable and thus this dataset is used in the present research the observed streamflow data are extracted from the published hydrological yearbook the books are borrowed from the library of the hohai university due to the incompleteness of the dataset the time period is divided into two parts 1980 1984 and 2006 2014 1979 and 2005 running ten times are used to spin up the model separately the model is calibrated over the period 2006 2010 while the two periods 1980 1984 and 2011 2014 are used for the verification of the model to evaluate the simulated soil moisture soil temperature and evapotranspiration the soil moisture and soil temperature of cldas china meteorological administration land surface data assimilation system real time product dataset the observed monthly soil moisture observation stations and observed daily evaporation observation stations in china are used cldas is developed by the national meteorological information center of china which has a temporal resolution of 1 h and a spatial resolution of 1 16 1 16 han et al 2015 the dataset starts from 2008 the soil moisture of the dataset has a good agreement with the ground soil moisture observations with an average correlation coefficient of 0 89 and a rmse of 0 02 m3 m3 in china the soil temperature of the dataset also agrees well with the ground soil temperature observations with a correlation coefficient of 0 99 and a rmse of 1 22 k in china 2 3 statistical methods the performance of wrf hydro in simulating streamflow is quantitatively evaluated through several typical statistical metrics including correlation coefficient cc nash efficiency coefficient nse logarithmic efficiency score nse logq rmse and relative error bias units they are defined by eqs 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively though these metrics are mathematically related each of them has certain differences from others together they could lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the performance of the model tedeschi 2006 cc reflects the linear relationship between simulations and observations it ranges from 1 0 to 1 0 and a value of 1 represents perfect positive correlation performance nse is a commonly used metric in hydrological evaluations which measures both the magnitude of errors and the variability of timeseries it ranges from minus infinity to 1 0 nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the ideal value is 1 the closer the value is to 1 the better the model performance if the value is 0 the model performance is just as good as yielding the mean observation if the value is less than 0 the performance of the model is poor nse logq is used to test the model performance in simulating streamflow during the low flow period in winter beskow et al 2011 its value is within the range from to 1 and the ideal value is 1 rmse is used to measure the deviation between simulations and observations with a range form 0 to and the idea value is 0 bias reflects the range of underestimation or overestimation and the ideal value is 0 1 cc n q obs i q mod i q obs i q mod i n q obs i 2

i q obs i ⅹ 100 where q obs i denotes the i th observed streamflow qmod i denotes the i th model simulated streamflow q obs i denotes the temporal average of observed streamflow n is the number of days to describe the change of streamflow several statistical metrics are used including linear regression 5 year running average and indicators of hydrologic alteration iha iha is one of the popular metrics which is proposed to describe the characteristics and variation of streamflow the iha contains 33 hydro statistical metrics which can be divided into the following 5 groups magnitude of monthly streamflow condition magnitude and duration of annual extreme streamflow condition timing of annual extreme water condition frequency and duration of high and low pulses and rate and frequency of water condition change the details of these parameters are shown in table 1 group 1 is used to show the characters and trends of streamflow in different months group 2 is used to evaluate the peculiarity of annual minimum and maximum streamflow and the base flow index is presented by the radio of the 7 day minimum streamflow to the annual mean streamflow group 3 shows the date of maximum minimum streamflow in every year group 4 shows the periods wherein daily streamflow exceeds the 75th percentile or drops below the 25th percentile of the time series group 5 represents the streamflow reversals from increasing to decreasing or from decreasing to increasing which show the rate and frequency of the streamflow changes 2 4 models wrf is used to provide the initial conditions such as land use and soil type for wrf hydro and in this section the details of wrf are described wrf is a mesoscale meteorological model developed by the national centers for environmental prediction ncep and the national center for atmospheric research ncar skamarock et al 2008 there are two types of dynamic cores arw advanced research wrf and non hydrostatic mesoscale model nmm and the arw dynamic core is used in this research the land use and soil type are extracted from the modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer land use dataset and beijing normal university soil type dataset fig 3 respectively wrf hydro is a distributed hydrological model that can be applied to the study of hydrometeorology and hydroclimatology the model can be either used in an offline mode or in a coupled mode in which it is coupled with atmospheric or earth system models wrf hydro extends the traditional noah land model by providing the framework of routing including base flow process subsurface flow process surface overland flow process and channel routing in this study in addition to the surface process the base flow process and subsurface flow process are also activated wrf hydro v5 0 is used in this research the resolutions of lsm grid and routing grid can be different which allows a higher resolution for the process of routing for each timestep the meteorological forcing is available a sub grid spatial weighting method is used to disaggregate from lsm grid to routing grid in this study the lsm resolution is 5000 m and the routing resolution is 500 m 2 5 model calibration due to the uncertainties of parameters parameters calibration is crucial for wrf hydro model in this section the influences of parameters on the streamflow are evaluated the model spin up time is 10 years the model is calibrated against the observed streamflow at each sub basin and the main basin during 2006 2010 the validation is done against several datasets including the observed streamflow at the outlet during 2011 2014 and observed streamflow at the interior stream stations during 2011 2014 since the automatic calibration requires large computation time to optimize parameters manual calibration is performed in this study yucel et al 2015 proposed four parameters that are important for streamflow simulation i e the runoff infiltration parameter refkdt that is used to divide the total water into surface runoff and under surface runoff the surface retention depth scaling parameter retdeprtfac that can adjust the initial retention depth the overland flow roughness scaling parameter ovroughrtfac that controls the speed of infiltration excess water that flows into channel networks and the channel manning roughness mannn that is related to the channel roughness according to naabil et al 2017 lateral saturated conductivity scaling factor lksatfac and slope index slope are also related to the runoff simulation the spatial distribution of soil hydraulic properties can influence the performance of wrf hydro therefore saturated soil moisture smcmax and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity dksat that influence flood generation mechanisms are considered in this research besides the parameters related to base flow are considered the calibration approach is divided into two parts the parameters related to water volume are calibrated first including the summer peaks refkdt and base flow slope bexp c and zmax and the parameters related to hydrograph shapes ovroughrtfac lksatfac retdeprtfac and mannn are then calibrated yucel et al 2015 if the values of the above parameters are constant in the basin the values will be replaced by the calibrated values if the values are spatially varying then multipliers are applied to the initial values the details of those calibrated parameters are shown in table 2 the influence of base flow is small for the three sub basins but its influence for the main basin is large 3 results the model performance is evaluated in two forms streamflow hydrographs at selected stations and spatial distribution of hydrological variables the linear regression analysis and 5 year running average are applied to reveal changes in the hydrological characteristics 3 1 model performance 3 1 1 streamflow to evaluate the model performance on simulating streamflow the xijiang river basin and its three sub basins with 11 hydrological stations shown in fig 1 are selected the spatial distribution of these stations makes a relatively full coverage of the xijiang river basin fig 4 shows daily streamflow at 11 stations during the calibration period and the two verification periods the model performance on daily streamflow simulation is good at most stations with high ccs and reasonable nses and low biases however the model underestimates streamflow at the upper part of the xijiang river basin and at some small sub watersheds whereas it overestimates streamflow at the lower part of the xijiang river basin and some large sub watersheds from the hydrographs of the maling station located in the mabie river basin and gaoche station located in the beipanjiang river basin it can be seen that the simulated streamflow is lower than the observed streamflow in both wet and dry periods but the model realistically reproduces temporal variation of the streamflow the hydrograph of the liuzhou station located at the outlet of the liujiang river indicates that the simulated streamflow well matches the observed streamflow in both the magnitude and the timing the performance of simulating peak streamflow is good with the nse is 0 82 for simulated streamflow higher than 75 of the observed streamflow in the calibration period however the model underestimates streamflow at the tributaries of the liujiang river fig 4 c and d the hydrograph of the pingle station located at the outlet of the guijiang river shows that wrf hydro underestimates the streamflow during 1980 1984 and overestimates it during 2011 2014 but the model performs well in simulating the timing of the streamflow and in the calibration period the nse is 0 75 for simulated streamflow higher than 75 of the observed streamflow from the hydrographs of the wuzhou station and gaoyao station located in the lower reaches of the xijiang river it can be seen that the model overestimates the streamflow in flood periods but the simulated timing is basically correct table 3 gives the results of the statistical metrics for all stations these results indicate that the model performance on streamflow simulation is worse during 2011 2014 than during 1980 1984 which reflects the fact that when the model simulation is not realistic often the same unrealistic result can be found for the whole basin motovilov et al 1999 wrf hydro underestimates streamflow in most sub basins whereas it overestimates the streamflow in the main river basin the correlation coefficients for all stations are above 0 5 and can reach up to 0 95 at some stations this result suggests that the model can properly simulate the temporal variability of streamflow the values of nses are above 0 3 for most stations and above 0 75 for some stations the biases are negative for most stations but in the lower reaches of the xijiang river mainstream and the outlets of the sub basins the biases are positive note that the value of nse log q is highly influenced by the recession period of the hydrograph while the values of nse log q are slightly lower than nse they are acceptable for most stations this result indicates that the model has the ability to capture the streamflow during dry periods gaoche liuzhou pingle and gaoyao stations are selected to calibrate the model for each basin therefore the model performance in those stations are better compared with the un calibrated stations in each basin huanjiang and shihuichang stations are located at the tributaries of the liujiang river and liuzhou station was used to calibrate the model in the liujiang river therefore the parameters may not be suitable for these two stations for gaoche and maling stations there are reservoirs in the upstream of the basin and the human activities may influence the model performance besides those two basins are small and the china meteorological administration stations cmfd used are sparse in those basins the accuracy of the cmfd may also influence the performance based on the hydrographs and statistical metrics results for all stations it can be found that wrf hydro can simulate temporal variability of daily streamflow for all the stations the model can simulate streamflow over different terrain areas from mountains the upper reaches of the xijiang river to plains the lower reaches of the xijiang river the scatterplots of simulated and observed monthly streamflow are shown in fig 5 the orange and purple lines are the linear regression lines for the periods 1980 1984 and 2011 2014 respectively and the black line is a 45 degree line r 2 is the coefficient of determination and a higher r 2 means a better linear relationship between simulations and observations the scatters for most stations are evenly distributed along the black line indicating that the model can well simulate the seasonal variation of streamflow at the maling station the model overestimates streamflow for the period 1980 1984 but underestimates it for the period 2011 2014 at gaoche station the orange and purple lines are below the black line which means that the model underestimates the streamflow in most months the model underestimates streamflow in almost every month at shihuichang and huanjiang stations at liuzhou guilin yangshuo and pingle stations the model performance on the simulation of streamflow magnitude is good and the r 2 corresponding to the orange and purple lines are larger than 0 72 this result indicates that the model performs well in simulating temporal changes of streamflow at these stations the model overestimates streamflow for the period 2011 2014 and underestimates it for period 1980 1984 at gongcheng station at wuzhou and gaoyao stations the model slightly overestimates the streamflow and the r 2 are high which means that the model performance on the simulation of temporal variation of streamflow is good as for the monthly streamflow simulation the ccs are higher than 0 9 for most stations and the nses reach 0 85 for some stations the model simulation of monthly streamflow is evaluated to be good when nse 0 65 and 25 bias 25 and very good when nse 0 75 and 10 bias 10 moriasi et al 2007 based on the metrics listed in table 4 it is found that the model performance can be regarded as very good for several stations and good for most stations overall the model performance on monthly streamflow simulation is satisfactory and the model demonstrates the ability to simulate the seasonal variations of streamflow 3 1 2 soil conditions soil moisture is an important variable that measures the dry and wet conditions of soil legates et al 2011 and there are complicated interactions between soil moisture and climate elements tuttle and salvucci 2016 walker and rowntree 1977 wei et al 2008 researchers have found that soil moisture is an influential factor for climate anomalies stéfanon et al 2013 wei and dirmeyer 2012 due to the memory of soil moisture it can help predict future weather and climate douville and chauvin 2000 guo and dirmeyer 2006 soil temperature is a measurement of soil heat storage it is an important physical property of soil and has significant climatic effects carson and moses 1963 bai et al 2010 xue et al 2012 fig 6 shows the ccs biases and rmses of monthly soil moisture between simulations and station observations during 1992 2013 it can be seen that the model can capture the temporal variability of the soil moisture with the ccs larger than 0 7 at the upper part of the xijiang river and some areas of the lower part fig 6 b shows that the model overestimates soil moisture for most areas the rmses are lower than 0 13 m3 m3 at all stations and the average rmse is about 0 07 m3 m3 which is within the acceptable range annual average soil moisture and soil temperature 2008 2014 from simulations and cldas and the ccs rmses between them are displayed in fig 7 fig 7 a and b indicate that the model overestimates the soil moisture in the whole basin and the spatial distributions of simulated and cldas soil moisture also demonstrate some differences especially in the southwest of the basin cldas shows some dry regions located in the southwest of the basin whereas the model cannot capture this pattern this is attributed to the soil types used in the model cldas indicates that sandy clay loam is the dominant soil type in the southwest the soil types used in the model are different fig 3 which makes it hard to reproduce the features specific for sandy clay loam the spatial pattern of low soil moisture in the west and high soil moisture in the north is reproduced by the model the ccs between simulations and cldas daily soil moisture are larger than 0 75 fig 7 g which means that the model can capture the temporal variability of soil moisture it can be seen from the spatial distribution of rmses fig 7 i that the biases between the simulations and cldas soil moisture are small with the rmses lower than 0 08 m3 m3 in most areas although the rmse is higher in some areas of the southwest in the east area of the basin the ccs are more than 0 85 the model performance in simulating soil moisture is acceptable with high ccs and low rmses overall the model captures the temporal variability of soil moisture but shows a wetter condition in the first layer which may be related to the redistribution and reinfiltrating processes of the model the spatial distributions of annual mean soil temperature fig 7 d and e from simulations and cldas indicate that the simulated soil temperature is a little lower than that of cldas the spatial pattern of the simulated soil temperature is similar to that of the cldas soil temperature and the spatial cc is 0 97 the cldas soil temperature is lower in the northwest part of the xijiang river basin and higher in the southeast the simulated soil temperature captures this spatial variability it can be seen from fig 7 h that the ccs are higher than 0 96 which suggests that the model well captures the temporal changes of soil temperature the rmses of soil temperature are smaller than 2 k in most areas indicating that the model can realistically simulate soil temperature overall the simulations can capture temporal changes of soil temperature and soil moisture during 2008 2014 and the differences between the simulations and the cldas are small the model performance on the soil temperature simulation is better than the soil moisture simulation 3 1 3 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration et is an important component of the surface water cycle and it is also an important term in surface energy balance et is the sum of soil evaporation e plant transpiration t and canopy interception which is closely related to meteorological condition underlying surface condition and vegetation wang et al 2016 the evapotranspiration products can be roughly divided into two categories remote sensing retrievals and model simulations sun et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 fig 8 shows the cc between the simulated et and observed daily evaporation during 1980 2017 the evaporation data are downloaded from the china meteorological data network including 699 basic stations which includes several stations located in the study region it can be seen that ccs are lower in the upper part of the basin and higher in the lower part of the basin the ccs are higher than 0 8 in most areas and the model can reasonably simulate the variability of et 3 2 streamflow changes the 5 year running average and linear regression method are employed to reveal the trends of annual streamflow fig 9 shows annual streamflow at 11 stations located in different areas of the basin from fig 9 it can be found that the trends of the streamflow in different areas are spatially uneven the annual streamflow shows a slightly increasing trend in the downstream of the xijiang river and a slightly decreasing trend in the upstream except for gongcheng station there is no significant trend at other stations the 5 year running average shows that the annual streamflow trends at different stations in the downstream are similar where a downward trend occurred during 1980 1990 and 1996 2010 while an upward trend appeared during other periods the changes of the trend at gaoche and maling stations are small the increasing and decreasing streamflow trends in different seasons are shown in fig 10 which indicates that trends in different seasons show different characters the spring streamflow shows a slightly downward trend at gaoche huangjiang gongcheng wuzhou and gaoyao stations and an upward trend in other stations the summer streamflow shows an upward trend at most stations except gaoche and maling stations where the summer streamflow has a downward trend the trends of summer streamflow are similar to that of the annual streamflow except for gaoche and maling stations the autumn and winter streamflow show an upward trend at all other stations the trends of annual 30 day maximum and minimum streamflow are presented in table 5 which shows that the trends of maximum and minimum streamflow are spatially uneven the trends in the upstream of the basin change more smoothly than the trends in the downstream the minimum streamflow at those stations in the guijiang river and liujiang river basins displayed a downward trend before 1990 and an upward trend after 1990 not shown the annual minimum streamflow demonstrates a continuous downward trend in the upper basin and an upward trend downstream of the basin the maximum streamflow changes smoothly at stations in the upstream of the basin and the maximum streamflow increases significantly at the guijing river basin the trends of streamflow of liujiang and the downstream of xijiang are similar with an increasing trend before 1995 and a decreasing trend after 1995 figure not shown the occurrence dates of the minimum and maximum streamflow change little the maximum streamflow generally occurs in summer and the minimum streamflow mostly occurs in winter both the low and high pulses increase significantly at most stations the reversals represent the frequency of streamflow reversing from rising to falling or from falling to rising and the rise and fall rates stand for the slopes of the rising or falling events respectively it can be seen from the table that the reversal and rise rate both increase significantly at most stations and the fall rate drops distinctly at most stations 4 discussion 4 1 physical processes base flow and lateral processes are two important processes that influence the simulation accuracy especially for large watersheds the model uses a simple conceptual bucket base flow model which connects base flow and overlaying channel in one way the parameters related to base flow process have no physical meaning therefore these parameters need to be carefully calibrated before using the model during the calibration it is found that large basins are more sensitive to these base flow parameters a better streamflow simulation can be achieved by application of appropriate base flow parameters the base flow parameters also play an important role in model spin up and the values of these parameters in the spin up period can influence the model performance later due to the limitation of the base flow process in the wrf hydro a more physically base flow process could be helpful 4 2 soil type changes soil types can strongly influence the model performance on soil moisture simulation as each soil type has its unique hydraulic properties different soil types can lead to different water diversions in this study the fao food and agriculture organization of the united nations soil type dataset wrf default used in wrf is replaced by the beijing normal university bnu soil type dataset wei et al 2014 the fao soil type dataset used in wrf was produced by the u s department of agriculture in 1991 which includes 12 basic types determined according to the content of each soil type component the spatial resolution of this dataset can reach 30 in the united states but the dataset uses 5 data provided by fao in other regions in china this dataset is produced using the 1 5 million soil distribution map and 60 soil profiles data in the world emissions inventory project and these 60 profiles are mainly located in northern china therefore the correctness and accuracy of this dataset are questionable in china the bnu soil type dataset is produced based on the 1 1 million soil distribution map of china and contains nearly 9000 original soil profiles therefore it can represent the soil spatial heterogeneity better than the fao dataset especially in regions outside of northern china such as southern china strict quality control is conducted during the integration of the profile dataset and the type connection method and distance connection method are adopted to develop the final chinese soil attribute dataset wei et al 2014 the spatial distributions of soil types from different datasets in xijiang river basin are displayed in fig 11 which shows that the difference between these two datasets is large the soil type in the west part of the basin is clay in the fao dataset but it is clay loam in the bnu dataset in the southwest area the soil type changes from sandy clay loam in the fao dataset to clay loam in the bnu dataset in the northeast part the soil type changes from clay loam in the default to silty clay in the bnu dataset and in the southeast area it changes from sandy clay loam to clay the changes of soil types can influence the model simulation of soil moisture 4 3 the possible reason for streamflow change it can be seen from section 3 2 that the trends of streamflow are different in different areas of the basin in this section the reasons are roughly discussed based on precipitation and evapotranspiration et the trends of annual precipitation and et are similar in the basin where the maling station is located and their trends may lead to the trend of streamflow at maling station the same results can be found at gaoche station the running averages of precipitation and et shown in fig 12 c indicate that the trends of precipitation and et are in opposite direction that is precipitation increase while et decrease the trend of streamflow is similar to the trend of precipitation and the opposite trends of precipitation and et mentioned above could strengthen the trend of streamflow the same results can be found in fig 12 d and e the changes of streamflow may be the results of changes in precipitation and et 5 conclusions there are different topographies and land use types in the xijiang river basin such as mountains and plains crop lands and forests etc simulation and forecast of streamflow in this basin are challenging in the present study a relatively new and comprehensive distributed hydrological model wrf hydro is evaluated for its ability to simulate hydrological conditions in the whole basin wrf hydro is coupled with the noah lsm which describes complete kinetic and thermal processes traditional metrics of cc nse nse logq rmse and bias statistical indices are used to evaluate the performance of the distributed wrf hydro hydrological model in the xijiang river basin and its several sub basins the periods of 1980 1984 and 2006 2014 are chosen for the present study the period of 2006 2010 is used for calibration and the periods of 1980 1984 and 2011 2014 are used for verification the results show that the performance of the model is acceptable for both the calibration period and the two verification periods the cc of the simulated daily streamflow is above 0 5 for almost all the stations and it reaches 0 8 for some stations this result indicates that the model can reasonably simulate the temporal variation of daily streamflow the nse is relatively high and can reach 0 76 for some stations suggesting that the model performance in simulating daily streamflow is acceptable in this basin based on the hydrographs and the results of the statistical metrics it can be concluded that this model has the ability to capture the peak streamflow and the minimum streamflow in the recession periods the cc of monthly streamflow is larger than 0 9 which means that this model can well simulate the seasonal variations of the streamflow the model performance on simulating monthly streamflow can be regarded as good for most stations and very good for some stations the model also has the ability to simulate hydrological variables such as evapotranspiration soil temperature and soil moisture etc from the statistical metrics it can be seen that the model can properly simulate the temporal variations of soil moisture and soil temperature the performance on simulating soil temperature is better than that of soil moisture the ccs between simulated evapotranspiration and observed evaporation are high which implies that this model has the ability to simulate the temporal variations of evapotranspiration the trends of annual and seasonal streamflow are spatially uneven in the xijiang river basin both of which decrease in the upper part and increase in the lower part some statistical metrics such as the reversals also show significant increasing decreasing trends the present study indicates that the model can be used not only in small watersheds but also in large watersheds and its performance in simulating streamflow in different areas of a watershed is acceptable besides the model can be used in basins with various terrains such as mountains and plains and different land use types in summary the offline wrf hydro model is a useful tool to simulate streamflow and hydrological conditions of both large and small watersheds in the xijiang river basin it can be used for practical research such as the simulation and prediction of hydrological variability in this basin however the model applications in real time forecast and seasonal prediction still need to be evaluated in south china also its performances in other main river basins of china such as the yangtze river and the yellow river basins and its simulation abilities in different climate zones such as the semi arid and arid zones still need to be examined credit authorship contribution statement songnan liu

8097,study region xijiang river south china study focus this paper discusses the application of wrf hydro a distributed hydrological model to a complicated watershed the model performance on simulating streamflow soil moisture soil temperature and evapotranspiration is evaluated changes and characteristics of streamflow and related variables simulated by the model are analyzed new hydrological insights for the region in this study thirteen sensitive parameters used in this model are tested in large and small watersheds of the basin it is found that large basins are more sensitive to base flow parameters than small basins the wrf default soil type dataset is replaced by the beijing normal university bnu soil type dataset that is more accurate the model can simulate temporal changes of streamflow as well as temporary variabilities of hydrological variables the model can be applied in small and large watersheds the trend of streamflow in the basin is spatially uneven with an increasing trend in the upper part and a decreasing trend in the lower part the changes in streamflow are partly related to precipitation and evapotranspiration trends the trends of 30 day maximum minimum streamflow are not significant but the reversals demonstrate significant changes during 1980 2018 this study is expected to serve as a reference for the application of the model in this basin and model calibration over different sizes of study area keywords wrf hydro streamflow application soil moisture evapotranspiration iha 1 introduction knowledge of hydrological cycle is important for water resources management and assessment of water related hazards such as floods and droughts liu et al 2008 wang et al 2011 in the context of global warming the magnitude and frequency of hydrological disasters are increasing ma et al 2019 winsemius et al 2016 hydrological models are the most important tool for the simulation and forecast of hydrological processes these models can be used to predict floods and droughts and help water resources management beskow et al 2011 hydrological models can be roughly divided into two types lumped models and distributed models devia et al 2015 in lumped models the spatial variability is neglected and the entire river basin is taken as one unit therefore the spatial processes in the watershed are not explicitly considered different to lumped models the spatial variations of parameters variables and conventional hydrometeorological data are considered in distributed models the entire watershed is divided into small units to produce predictions in distributed models therefore the intra basin variability can be carefully studied and the values of model parameters from geospatial data such as land cover and soil types can be inferred wang et al 2011 with the development of the geographic information system and computer sciences distributed models have been improved and widely used in recent years lei et al 2014 in this paper a distributed hydrological model i e the weather research and forecasting model hydrological modeling system wrf hydro v5 0 gochis et al 2018 is evaluated in the xijiang river basin wrf hydro is interactively coupled with the noah land surface model lsm which includes kinetic and thermal processes gochis et al 2018 senatore et al 2015 wrf hydro can be used as an offline hydrological model while it can also be coupled with atmospheric models eg weather research and forecasting model wrf and other earth system modeling systems to form a coupled architecture the model can simulate and predict hydrological processes at various spatial scales from headwater catchment to continental river basin and temporal resolutions from minute to season it can be run efficiently on high performance computing systems wrf hydro provides the arcgis tools gochis et al 2018 to generate the model static inputs which are important for its applications the model has been used in a wide range of researches and applications including flash flood prediction lin et al 2018 varlas et al 2019 seasonal forecast of water resources kerandi et al 2017 somos valenzuela and palmer 2018 and land atmosphere sea coupling studies rummler et al 2019 varlas et al 2018 senatore et al 2015 indicated that wrf hydro can rightly simulate the land surface water cycle processes with a 3 year simulation in southern italy arnault et al 2016 proposed that wrf hydro can reflect the impact of land atmosphere processes on surface runoff kerandi et al 2017 found that wrf hydro coupled with wrf weather research and forecasting model model can be used as a tool to quantify the atmospheric terrestrial water balance in the tana river basin ryu et al 2017 revealed that wrf hydro coupled with wrf model can help predict flood events in a small watershed in korea silver et al 2017 pointed out that wrf hydro coupled with wrf model can truly reflect the actual runoff changes in the arid semi arid of israel and jordan despite it is wide application around the world wrf hydro is rarely used in china and its performance in china especially in large scale basins with complicated terrain should be carefully examined the xijiang river west river is the longest river in the basin of the pearl river it provides 63 9 of the total river discharge and accounts for 77 8 of the total area of the pearl river zhong et al 2018 which makes it very important for the socio economic development in south china yuan et al 2017 because of its importance for the pearl river delta the xijiang river is also called the golden waterway lin et al 2017 the water resource in the xijiang river basin is an important component of the water supply that meets the demand of the pearl river delta sun and niu 2019 besides both floods and droughts occur frequently in the xijiang river basin cui et al 2007 in recent years this basin has experienced more floods and droughts yuan et al 2017 due to the influence of global warming the geological environment of the xijiang river basin is very complicated which leads to complex land surface processes and hydrological processes thereby hydrological simulation and forecast in this basin remains an extremely challenging issue a hydrological model with complete dynamic and thermal processes is required for realistic simulation and prediction of hydrological conditions in this basin wrf hydro is a good choice to serve these requirements some hydrological models have been applied to this basin but the resolutions of those models are relatively coarse chen et al 2019 jiang et al 2011 shan et al 2015 yuan et al 2014 in this study wrf hydro model is applied to the xijiang river basin for processes studies over both small sub basins and the entire river basin with a relatively high spatial resolution the object of this study is to evaluate the performance of wrf hydro in reproducing the streamflow and hydrological conditions in the xijiang river mainstream basin and its several sub basins and determine whether the model is suitable for studies over both large and small basins with different topographies also the changes and characteristics of the streamflow during 1980 2018 and their possible causes are explored and discussed 2 data and method 2 1 study area the pearl river is the second largest river in china in terms of annual streamflow and the xijiang river is the largest tributary of the pearl river yuan et al 2017 the xijiang river originates in the east of the maxiong mountain flows through yunnan guizhou guangxi and guangdong provinces and ultimately flows into the south sea the length of the xijiang river is 2214 km and the drainage area is 346 000 km2 which accounts for nearly 80 of the total drainage area of the pearl river basin niu et al 2015 it is important for the development of the economy and culture in guangdong province and guangxi province this area is characterized by complex terrain with several land use types fig 3 and various climate regimes the west part representing the upstream of the river is mainly a mountainous area the east representing the downstream of the river is flat the topography and the location of the xijiang river basin are shown in fig 1 the xijiang river basin is located in a tropical and subtropical region that is hot and humid the annual average temperature is around 20 c the annual average air humidity is about 75 the annual average rainfall approximately is 1700 mm the spatial distribution of annual mean rainfall 1980 1984 and 2006 2014 is shown in fig 2 due to the monsoon rainfall both precipitation and streamflow demonstrate large seasonal variabilities zhang et al 2009 this river is a semi perennial river whose streamflow is low in dry season but increases significantly in wet season the precipitation from april to september accounts for nearly 65 of the annual mean precipitation and the streamflow from april to september accounts for nearly 75 of the annual mean streamflow yu et al 2016 in order to study the model s applications in different conditions of terrain and land use several tributaries of the xijiang river are selected including the beipanjiang river gaoche station is the representative station and the mabie river maling station is the representative station in the upstream of the xijiang river and the liujiang river liuzhou station is the representative station and the guijiang river pingle station is the representative station in the downstream of the xijiang river shown in fig 1 the elevations of the beipanjiang river and the mabie river basins are higher compared with the elevations of the liujiang river and the guijiang river basins the predominant landuse type is savannas in the beipanjiang river the mabie river basin and the guijiang river basins woody savannas is the prevailing landuse type in the liujiang river basin shown in fig 3 2 2 datasets wrf hydro requires a number of files to describe the model domain parameters initial condition and meteorological conditions the high resolution global dem data are extracted from the hydrosheds data hydrological data and maps based on shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales https hydrosheds cr usgs gov dataavail php the hydrosheds dem dataset is developed based on high resolution radar topography mission srtm the resolution of this dataset is divided into three categories that is 3 about 90 m 15 about 500 m and 30 about 1 km lehner et al 2008 due to the area size and complexity of the xijiang river basin the resolution of 15 is selected for this research the dem is processed by arcgis to get the accurate river network to run the offline model several meteorological variables are needed these variables include downward long wave radiation downward short wave radiation surface pressure precipitation rate specific humidity air temperature near surface u and v wind components the main source of meteorological data used in this paper is the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd which is a near surface meteorological reanalysis dataset developed by the institute of tibetan plateau research of the chinese academy of sciences this dataset is developed based on the princeton reanalysis data gldas global land data assimilation system data gewex srb global energy and water cycle experiment surface radiation budget radiation data trmm tropical rainfall measuring mission precipitation data and conventional meteorological observation data of china meteorological administration its temporal resolution is 3 h and its spatial resolution is 0 1 chen et al 2011 this dataset has been used in the fields of hydrology climate simulation and land surface process simulation ma et al 2019 sun et al 2017 since cmfd only includes wind speed but no wind direction which is required by wrf hydro u and v wind components of era5 are also used in this research the era5 hersbach et al 2020 is a reanalysis dataset released by the european center for medium range weather forecasts with horizontal resolution of 30 km and the era5 data at 6 hour intervals are used in our research precipitation plays an important role in hydrological models liu et al 2017 cn05 1 is a widely used daily precipitation dataset with a resolution of 0 25 and it is based on in situ observations at over 2400 weather stations in china wu and gao 2013 the resolution of cn05 1 is coarse compared with the model resolution 5000 m and 6 h and cannot meet the research demand therefore the precipitation of cmfd is used the precipitation of cmfd was evaluated before it is implemented for the present study distributions of annual mean precipitation over the basin during the periods of 1980 1984 and 2006 2014 derived from the cn05 1 and cmfd are compared fig 2 it can be seen that the annual mean precipitation decreases from southeast to northwest for both datasets the spatial correlation coefficient and the root mean square error rmse between cmfd and cn05 1 precipitation are 0 84 and 3 1 mm respectively the performance of the cmfd precipitation dataset is acceptable and thus this dataset is used in the present research the observed streamflow data are extracted from the published hydrological yearbook the books are borrowed from the library of the hohai university due to the incompleteness of the dataset the time period is divided into two parts 1980 1984 and 2006 2014 1979 and 2005 running ten times are used to spin up the model separately the model is calibrated over the period 2006 2010 while the two periods 1980 1984 and 2011 2014 are used for the verification of the model to evaluate the simulated soil moisture soil temperature and evapotranspiration the soil moisture and soil temperature of cldas china meteorological administration land surface data assimilation system real time product dataset the observed monthly soil moisture observation stations and observed daily evaporation observation stations in china are used cldas is developed by the national meteorological information center of china which has a temporal resolution of 1 h and a spatial resolution of 1 16 1 16 han et al 2015 the dataset starts from 2008 the soil moisture of the dataset has a good agreement with the ground soil moisture observations with an average correlation coefficient of 0 89 and a rmse of 0 02 m3 m3 in china the soil temperature of the dataset also agrees well with the ground soil temperature observations with a correlation coefficient of 0 99 and a rmse of 1 22 k in china 2 3 statistical methods the performance of wrf hydro in simulating streamflow is quantitatively evaluated through several typical statistical metrics including correlation coefficient cc nash efficiency coefficient nse logarithmic efficiency score nse logq rmse and relative error bias units they are defined by eqs 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively though these metrics are mathematically related each of them has certain differences from others together they could lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the performance of the model tedeschi 2006 cc reflects the linear relationship between simulations and observations it ranges from 1 0 to 1 0 and a value of 1 represents perfect positive correlation performance nse is a commonly used metric in hydrological evaluations which measures both the magnitude of errors and the variability of timeseries it ranges from minus infinity to 1 0 nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the ideal value is 1 the closer the value is to 1 the better the model performance if the value is 0 the model performance is just as good as yielding the mean observation if the value is less than 0 the performance of the model is poor nse logq is used to test the model performance in simulating streamflow during the low flow period in winter beskow et al 2011 its value is within the range from to 1 and the ideal value is 1 rmse is used to measure the deviation between simulations and observations with a range form 0 to and the idea value is 0 bias reflects the range of underestimation or overestimation and the ideal value is 0 1 cc n q obs i q mod i q obs i q mod i n q obs i 2

i q obs i ⅹ 100 where q obs i denotes the i th observed streamflow qmod i denotes the i th model simulated streamflow q obs i denotes the temporal average of observed streamflow n is the number of days to describe the change of streamflow several statistical metrics are used including linear regression 5 year running average and indicators of hydrologic alteration iha iha is one of the popular metrics which is proposed to describe the characteristics and variation of streamflow the iha contains 33 hydro statistical metrics which can be divided into the following 5 groups magnitude of monthly streamflow condition magnitude and duration of annual extreme streamflow condition timing of annual extreme water condition frequency and duration of high and low pulses and rate and frequency of water condition change the details of these parameters are shown in table 1 group 1 is used to show the characters and trends of streamflow in different months group 2 is used to evaluate the peculiarity of annual minimum and maximum streamflow and the base flow index is presented by the radio of the 7 day minimum streamflow to the annual mean streamflow group 3 shows the date of maximum minimum streamflow in every year group 4 shows the periods wherein daily streamflow exceeds the 75th percentile or drops below the 25th percentile of the time series group 5 represents the streamflow reversals from increasing to decreasing or from decreasing to increasing which show the rate and frequency of the streamflow changes 2 4 models wrf is used to provide the initial conditions such as land use and soil type for wrf hydro and in this section the details of wrf are described wrf is a mesoscale meteorological model developed by the national centers for environmental prediction ncep and the national center for atmospheric research ncar skamarock et al 2008 there are two types of dynamic cores arw advanced research wrf and non hydrostatic mesoscale model nmm and the arw dynamic core is used in this research the land use and soil type are extracted from the modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer land use dataset and beijing normal university soil type dataset fig 3 respectively wrf hydro is a distributed hydrological model that can be applied to the study of hydrometeorology and hydroclimatology the model can be either used in an offline mode or in a coupled mode in which it is coupled with atmospheric or earth system models wrf hydro extends the traditional noah land model by providing the framework of routing including base flow process subsurface flow process surface overland flow process and channel routing in this study in addition to the surface process the base flow process and subsurface flow process are also activated wrf hydro v5 0 is used in this research the resolutions of lsm grid and routing grid can be different which allows a higher resolution for the process of routing for each timestep the meteorological forcing is available a sub grid spatial weighting method is used to disaggregate from lsm grid to routing grid in this study the lsm resolution is 5000 m and the routing resolution is 500 m 2 5 model calibration due to the uncertainties of parameters parameters calibration is crucial for wrf hydro model in this section the influences of parameters on the streamflow are evaluated the model spin up time is 10 years the model is calibrated against the observed streamflow at each sub basin and the main basin during 2006 2010 the validation is done against several datasets including the observed streamflow at the outlet during 2011 2014 and observed streamflow at the interior stream stations during 2011 2014 since the automatic calibration requires large computation time to optimize parameters manual calibration is performed in this study yucel et al 2015 proposed four parameters that are important for streamflow simulation i e the runoff infiltration parameter refkdt that is used to divide the total water into surface runoff and under surface runoff the surface retention depth scaling parameter retdeprtfac that can adjust the initial retention depth the overland flow roughness scaling parameter ovroughrtfac that controls the speed of infiltration excess water that flows into channel networks and the channel manning roughness mannn that is related to the channel roughness according to naabil et al 2017 lateral saturated conductivity scaling factor lksatfac and slope index slope are also related to the runoff simulation the spatial distribution of soil hydraulic properties can influence the performance of wrf hydro therefore saturated soil moisture smcmax and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity dksat that influence flood generation mechanisms are considered in this research besides the parameters related to base flow are considered the calibration approach is divided into two parts the parameters related to water volume are calibrated first including the summer peaks refkdt and base flow slope bexp c and zmax and the parameters related to hydrograph shapes ovroughrtfac lksatfac retdeprtfac and mannn are then calibrated yucel et al 2015 if the values of the above parameters are constant in the basin the values will be replaced by the calibrated values if the values are spatially varying then multipliers are applied to the initial values the details of those calibrated parameters are shown in table 2 the influence of base flow is small for the three sub basins but its influence for the main basin is large 3 results the model performance is evaluated in two forms streamflow hydrographs at selected stations and spatial distribution of hydrological variables the linear regression analysis and 5 year running average are applied to reveal changes in the hydrological characteristics 3 1 model performance 3 1 1 streamflow to evaluate the model performance on simulating streamflow the xijiang river basin and its three sub basins with 11 hydrological stations shown in fig 1 are selected the spatial distribution of these stations makes a relatively full coverage of the xijiang river basin fig 4 shows daily streamflow at 11 stations during the calibration period and the two verification periods the model performance on daily streamflow simulation is good at most stations with high ccs and reasonable nses and low biases however the model underestimates streamflow at the upper part of the xijiang river basin and at some small sub watersheds whereas it overestimates streamflow at the lower part of the xijiang river basin and some large sub watersheds from the hydrographs of the maling station located in the mabie river basin and gaoche station located in the beipanjiang river basin it can be seen that the simulated streamflow is lower than the observed streamflow in both wet and dry periods but the model realistically reproduces temporal variation of the streamflow the hydrograph of the liuzhou station located at the outlet of the liujiang river indicates that the simulated streamflow well matches the observed streamflow in both the magnitude and the timing the performance of simulating peak streamflow is good with the nse is 0 82 for simulated streamflow higher than 75 of the observed streamflow in the calibration period however the model underestimates streamflow at the tributaries of the liujiang river fig 4 c and d the hydrograph of the pingle station located at the outlet of the guijiang river shows that wrf hydro underestimates the streamflow during 1980 1984 and overestimates it during 2011 2014 but the model performs well in simulating the timing of the streamflow and in the calibration period the nse is 0 75 for simulated streamflow higher than 75 of the observed streamflow from the hydrographs of the wuzhou station and gaoyao station located in the lower reaches of the xijiang river it can be seen that the model overestimates the streamflow in flood periods but the simulated timing is basically correct table 3 gives the results of the statistical metrics for all stations these results indicate that the model performance on streamflow simulation is worse during 2011 2014 than during 1980 1984 which reflects the fact that when the model simulation is not realistic often the same unrealistic result can be found for the whole basin motovilov et al 1999 wrf hydro underestimates streamflow in most sub basins whereas it overestimates the streamflow in the main river basin the correlation coefficients for all stations are above 0 5 and can reach up to 0 95 at some stations this result suggests that the model can properly simulate the temporal variability of streamflow the values of nses are above 0 3 for most stations and above 0 75 for some stations the biases are negative for most stations but in the lower reaches of the xijiang river mainstream and the outlets of the sub basins the biases are positive note that the value of nse log q is highly influenced by the recession period of the hydrograph while the values of nse log q are slightly lower than nse they are acceptable for most stations this result indicates that the model has the ability to capture the streamflow during dry periods gaoche liuzhou pingle and gaoyao stations are selected to calibrate the model for each basin therefore the model performance in those stations are better compared with the un calibrated stations in each basin huanjiang and shihuichang stations are located at the tributaries of the liujiang river and liuzhou station was used to calibrate the model in the liujiang river therefore the parameters may not be suitable for these two stations for gaoche and maling stations there are reservoirs in the upstream of the basin and the human activities may influence the model performance besides those two basins are small and the china meteorological administration stations cmfd used are sparse in those basins the accuracy of the cmfd may also influence the performance based on the hydrographs and statistical metrics results for all stations it can be found that wrf hydro can simulate temporal variability of daily streamflow for all the stations the model can simulate streamflow over different terrain areas from mountains the upper reaches of the xijiang river to plains the lower reaches of the xijiang river the scatterplots of simulated and observed monthly streamflow are shown in fig 5 the orange and purple lines are the linear regression lines for the periods 1980 1984 and 2011 2014 respectively and the black line is a 45 degree line r 2 is the coefficient of determination and a higher r 2 means a better linear relationship between simulations and observations the scatters for most stations are evenly distributed along the black line indicating that the model can well simulate the seasonal variation of streamflow at the maling station the model overestimates streamflow for the period 1980 1984 but underestimates it for the period 2011 2014 at gaoche station the orange and purple lines are below the black line which means that the model underestimates the streamflow in most months the model underestimates streamflow in almost every month at shihuichang and huanjiang stations at liuzhou guilin yangshuo and pingle stations the model performance on the simulation of streamflow magnitude is good and the r 2 corresponding to the orange and purple lines are larger than 0 72 this result indicates that the model performs well in simulating temporal changes of streamflow at these stations the model overestimates streamflow for the period 2011 2014 and underestimates it for period 1980 1984 at gongcheng station at wuzhou and gaoyao stations the model slightly overestimates the streamflow and the r 2 are high which means that the model performance on the simulation of temporal variation of streamflow is good as for the monthly streamflow simulation the ccs are higher than 0 9 for most stations and the nses reach 0 85 for some stations the model simulation of monthly streamflow is evaluated to be good when nse 0 65 and 25 bias 25 and very good when nse 0 75 and 10 bias 10 moriasi et al 2007 based on the metrics listed in table 4 it is found that the model performance can be regarded as very good for several stations and good for most stations overall the model performance on monthly streamflow simulation is satisfactory and the model demonstrates the ability to simulate the seasonal variations of streamflow 3 1 2 soil conditions soil moisture is an important variable that measures the dry and wet conditions of soil legates et al 2011 and there are complicated interactions between soil moisture and climate elements tuttle and salvucci 2016 walker and rowntree 1977 wei et al 2008 researchers have found that soil moisture is an influential factor for climate anomalies stéfanon et al 2013 wei and dirmeyer 2012 due to the memory of soil moisture it can help predict future weather and climate douville and chauvin 2000 guo and dirmeyer 2006 soil temperature is a measurement of soil heat storage it is an important physical property of soil and has significant climatic effects carson and moses 1963 bai et al 2010 xue et al 2012 fig 6 shows the ccs biases and rmses of monthly soil moisture between simulations and station observations during 1992 2013 it can be seen that the model can capture the temporal variability of the soil moisture with the ccs larger than 0 7 at the upper part of the xijiang river and some areas of the lower part fig 6 b shows that the model overestimates soil moisture for most areas the rmses are lower than 0 13 m3 m3 at all stations and the average rmse is about 0 07 m3 m3 which is within the acceptable range annual average soil moisture and soil temperature 2008 2014 from simulations and cldas and the ccs rmses between them are displayed in fig 7 fig 7 a and b indicate that the model overestimates the soil moisture in the whole basin and the spatial distributions of simulated and cldas soil moisture also demonstrate some differences especially in the southwest of the basin cldas shows some dry regions located in the southwest of the basin whereas the model cannot capture this pattern this is attributed to the soil types used in the model cldas indicates that sandy clay loam is the dominant soil type in the southwest the soil types used in the model are different fig 3 which makes it hard to reproduce the features specific for sandy clay loam the spatial pattern of low soil moisture in the west and high soil moisture in the north is reproduced by the model the ccs between simulations and cldas daily soil moisture are larger than 0 75 fig 7 g which means that the model can capture the temporal variability of soil moisture it can be seen from the spatial distribution of rmses fig 7 i that the biases between the simulations and cldas soil moisture are small with the rmses lower than 0 08 m3 m3 in most areas although the rmse is higher in some areas of the southwest in the east area of the basin the ccs are more than 0 85 the model performance in simulating soil moisture is acceptable with high ccs and low rmses overall the model captures the temporal variability of soil moisture but shows a wetter condition in the first layer which may be related to the redistribution and reinfiltrating processes of the model the spatial distributions of annual mean soil temperature fig 7 d and e from simulations and cldas indicate that the simulated soil temperature is a little lower than that of cldas the spatial pattern of the simulated soil temperature is similar to that of the cldas soil temperature and the spatial cc is 0 97 the cldas soil temperature is lower in the northwest part of the xijiang river basin and higher in the southeast the simulated soil temperature captures this spatial variability it can be seen from fig 7 h that the ccs are higher than 0 96 which suggests that the model well captures the temporal changes of soil temperature the rmses of soil temperature are smaller than 2 k in most areas indicating that the model can realistically simulate soil temperature overall the simulations can capture temporal changes of soil temperature and soil moisture during 2008 2014 and the differences between the simulations and the cldas are small the model performance on the soil temperature simulation is better than the soil moisture simulation 3 1 3 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration et is an important component of the surface water cycle and it is also an important term in surface energy balance et is the sum of soil evaporation e plant transpiration t and canopy interception which is closely related to meteorological condition underlying surface condition and vegetation wang et al 2016 the evapotranspiration products can be roughly divided into two categories remote sensing retrievals and model simulations sun et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 fig 8 shows the cc between the simulated et and observed daily evaporation during 1980 2017 the evaporation data are downloaded from the china meteorological data network including 699 basic stations which includes several stations located in the study region it can be seen that ccs are lower in the upper part of the basin and higher in the lower part of the basin the ccs are higher than 0 8 in most areas and the model can reasonably simulate the variability of et 3 2 streamflow changes the 5 year running average and linear regression method are employed to reveal the trends of annual streamflow fig 9 shows annual streamflow at 11 stations located in different areas of the basin from fig 9 it can be found that the trends of the streamflow in different areas are spatially uneven the annual streamflow shows a slightly increasing trend in the downstream of the xijiang river and a slightly decreasing trend in the upstream except for gongcheng station there is no significant trend at other stations the 5 year running average shows that the annual streamflow trends at different stations in the downstream are similar where a downward trend occurred during 1980 1990 and 1996 2010 while an upward trend appeared during other periods the changes of the trend at gaoche and maling stations are small the increasing and decreasing streamflow trends in different seasons are shown in fig 10 which indicates that trends in different seasons show different characters the spring streamflow shows a slightly downward trend at gaoche huangjiang gongcheng wuzhou and gaoyao stations and an upward trend in other stations the summer streamflow shows an upward trend at most stations except gaoche and maling stations where the summer streamflow has a downward trend the trends of summer streamflow are similar to that of the annual streamflow except for gaoche and maling stations the autumn and winter streamflow show an upward trend at all other stations the trends of annual 30 day maximum and minimum streamflow are presented in table 5 which shows that the trends of maximum and minimum streamflow are spatially uneven the trends in the upstream of the basin change more smoothly than the trends in the downstream the minimum streamflow at those stations in the guijiang river and liujiang river basins displayed a downward trend before 1990 and an upward trend after 1990 not shown the annual minimum streamflow demonstrates a continuous downward trend in the upper basin and an upward trend downstream of the basin the maximum streamflow changes smoothly at stations in the upstream of the basin and the maximum streamflow increases significantly at the guijing river basin the trends of streamflow of liujiang and the downstream of xijiang are similar with an increasing trend before 1995 and a decreasing trend after 1995 figure not shown the occurrence dates of the minimum and maximum streamflow change little the maximum streamflow generally occurs in summer and the minimum streamflow mostly occurs in winter both the low and high pulses increase significantly at most stations the reversals represent the frequency of streamflow reversing from rising to falling or from falling to rising and the rise and fall rates stand for the slopes of the rising or falling events respectively it can be seen from the table that the reversal and rise rate both increase significantly at most stations and the fall rate drops distinctly at most stations 4 discussion 4 1 physical processes base flow and lateral processes are two important processes that influence the simulation accuracy especially for large watersheds the model uses a simple conceptual bucket base flow model which connects base flow and overlaying channel in one way the parameters related to base flow process have no physical meaning therefore these parameters need to be carefully calibrated before using the model during the calibration it is found that large basins are more sensitive to these base flow parameters a better streamflow simulation can be achieved by application of appropriate base flow parameters the base flow parameters also play an important role in model spin up and the values of these parameters in the spin up period can influence the model performance later due to the limitation of the base flow process in the wrf hydro a more physically base flow process could be helpful 4 2 soil type changes soil types can strongly influence the model performance on soil moisture simulation as each soil type has its unique hydraulic properties different soil types can lead to different water diversions in this study the fao food and agriculture organization of the united nations soil type dataset wrf default used in wrf is replaced by the beijing normal university bnu soil type dataset wei et al 2014 the fao soil type dataset used in wrf was produced by the u s department of agriculture in 1991 which includes 12 basic types determined according to the content of each soil type component the spatial resolution of this dataset can reach 30 in the united states but the dataset uses 5 data provided by fao in other regions in china this dataset is produced using the 1 5 million soil distribution map and 60 soil profiles data in the world emissions inventory project and these 60 profiles are mainly located in northern china therefore the correctness and accuracy of this dataset are questionable in china the bnu soil type dataset is produced based on the 1 1 million soil distribution map of china and contains nearly 9000 original soil profiles therefore it can represent the soil spatial heterogeneity better than the fao dataset especially in regions outside of northern china such as southern china strict quality control is conducted during the integration of the profile dataset and the type connection method and distance connection method are adopted to develop the final chinese soil attribute dataset wei et al 2014 the spatial distributions of soil types from different datasets in xijiang river basin are displayed in fig 11 which shows that the difference between these two datasets is large the soil type in the west part of the basin is clay in the fao dataset but it is clay loam in the bnu dataset in the southwest area the soil type changes from sandy clay loam in the fao dataset to clay loam in the bnu dataset in the northeast part the soil type changes from clay loam in the default to silty clay in the bnu dataset and in the southeast area it changes from sandy clay loam to clay the changes of soil types can influence the model simulation of soil moisture 4 3 the possible reason for streamflow change it can be seen from section 3 2 that the trends of streamflow are different in different areas of the basin in this section the reasons are roughly discussed based on precipitation and evapotranspiration et the trends of annual precipitation and et are similar in the basin where the maling station is located and their trends may lead to the trend of streamflow at maling station the same results can be found at gaoche station the running averages of precipitation and et shown in fig 12 c indicate that the trends of precipitation and et are in opposite direction that is precipitation increase while et decrease the trend of streamflow is similar to the trend of precipitation and the opposite trends of precipitation and et mentioned above could strengthen the trend of streamflow the same results can be found in fig 12 d and e the changes of streamflow may be the results of changes in precipitation and et 5 conclusions there are different topographies and land use types in the xijiang river basin such as mountains and plains crop lands and forests etc simulation and forecast of streamflow in this basin are challenging in the present study a relatively new and comprehensive distributed hydrological model wrf hydro is evaluated for its ability to simulate hydrological conditions in the whole basin wrf hydro is coupled with the noah lsm which describes complete kinetic and thermal processes traditional metrics of cc nse nse logq rmse and bias statistical indices are used to evaluate the performance of the distributed wrf hydro hydrological model in the xijiang river basin and its several sub basins the periods of 1980 1984 and 2006 2014 are chosen for the present study the period of 2006 2010 is used for calibration and the periods of 1980 1984 and 2011 2014 are used for verification the results show that the performance of the model is acceptable for both the calibration period and the two verification periods the cc of the simulated daily streamflow is above 0 5 for almost all the stations and it reaches 0 8 for some stations this result indicates that the model can reasonably simulate the temporal variation of daily streamflow the nse is relatively high and can reach 0 76 for some stations suggesting that the model performance in simulating daily streamflow is acceptable in this basin based on the hydrographs and the results of the statistical metrics it can be concluded that this model has the ability to capture the peak streamflow and the minimum streamflow in the recession periods the cc of monthly streamflow is larger than 0 9 which means that this model can well simulate the seasonal variations of the streamflow the model performance on simulating monthly streamflow can be regarded as good for most stations and very good for some stations the model also has the ability to simulate hydrological variables such as evapotranspiration soil temperature and soil moisture etc from the statistical metrics it can be seen that the model can properly simulate the temporal variations of soil moisture and soil temperature the performance on simulating soil temperature is better than that of soil moisture the ccs between simulated evapotranspiration and observed evaporation are high which implies that this model has the ability to simulate the temporal variations of evapotranspiration the trends of annual and seasonal streamflow are spatially uneven in the xijiang river basin both of which decrease in the upper part and increase in the lower part some statistical metrics such as the reversals also show significant increasing decreasing trends the present study indicates that the model can be used not only in small watersheds but also in large watersheds and its performance in simulating streamflow in different areas of a watershed is acceptable besides the model can be used in basins with various terrains such as mountains and plains and different land use types in summary the offline wrf hydro model is a useful tool to simulate streamflow and hydrological conditions of both large and small watersheds in the xijiang river basin it can be used for practical research such as the simulation and prediction of hydrological variability in this basin however the model applications in real time forecast and seasonal prediction still need to be evaluated in south china also its performances in other main river basins of china such as the yangtze river and the yellow river basins and its simulation abilities in different climate zones such as the semi arid and arid zones still need to be examined credit authorship contribution statement songnan liu

8098,study region mozambique study focus mozambique does not currently have the necessary tools for systematic monitoring and forecasting of drought at a subnational scale the purpose of this study was to characterize drought conditions and trends throughout the country and to evaluate the influence of major climatic drivers on drought events period 1950 2019 drought conditions were studied by means of the standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index spei and run theory the principal component analysis technique and the k means clustering method were applied for defining homogenous drought regions the mann kendall trend test and rescaled range statistical analysis were used for defining the temporal characteristics of drought the cross correlation method a spectral analysis based on the fast fourier transform and a cross wavelet analysis were used to identify possible climate drivers the results are ultimately intended to contribute to the development of a drought monitoring system in this country new hydrological insights for the region three homogeneous drought regions can be defined in mozambique the south and centre regions showed more intense and severe drought events in all regions a significant trend towards a higher incidence of droughts and long term a persistence were found el niño southern oscillation and darwin sea level pressure anomalies were identified as significant drivers of drought variability especially in the southern regions these climate indices can be used as predictors in drought forecasting models keywords drought standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index spei regionalization trend persistence teleconnections climatic indices 1 introduction droughts are among the most common natural phenomena worldwide and can occur anywhere under any climate regime bryant et al 2005 sheffield and wood 2012 however they constitute one of the least understood natural hazards due to their complexity and difficulties in quantification hagenlocher et al 2019 the effects of droughts can be felt in chains of energy production food water supply etc yet are generally detected when the consequences of the phenomenon are difficult to mitigate and thus droughts constitute the disaster that causes the greatest socioeconomic losses worldwide wmo 2006 in addition the effects of droughts are expected to worsen in the coming decades as a result of climate change changes in spatial temporal patterns of precipitation and extreme temperatures are likely to make droughts more recurrent mishra and singh 2011 as stated by the ipcc 2014 there are trends of increasing intensities and frequencies of droughts around the world with arid and semi arid areas possibly being the most affected this might invalidate traditional methods for examining the impact of environmental factors on drought based as they are on the assumption of stationarity jehanzaib et al 2020 specific spatiotemporal drought assessments at regional or local levels are needed for reliable decision making in the context of adaptation planning to future climate conditions see e g jehanzaib and kim 2020 kim and jehanzaib 2020 and the references therein according to wilhite et al 2000 one of the first steps for drought assessment and management in a given zone country or river basin should be a spatial division into regions according to drought characteristics the techniques of hierarchical and non hierarchical clustering santos et al 2010 vicente serrano 2006a and principal component analysis agutu et al 2017 lovino et al 2014 vicente serrano 2006b can be applied directly to drought indicators for identifying homogenous drought regions the next steps should be aimed at developing a drought monitoring system to create early warnings of emerging drought conditions the temporal variability of droughts in the area under analysis must be studied to accomplish this objective the historical drought variability is usually analysed by means of a technique such as run theory yevjevich 1969 accompanied by trend and persistence tests of the drought characteristics ayantobo et al 2017 huang et al 2016 zambreski et al 2018 the subsequent step is then to forecast droughts thus it is necessary to understand the climate drivers that trigger drought events in the region and to use this teleconnection information as a forecasting tool to achieve this goal methods such as cross correlation araneda cabrera et al 2021a hair et al 1998 and various spectral analysis applied to climate indices and drought indicators have become popular as a means of identifying appropriate drought predictors el kenawy et al 2016 espinosa et al 2019 fleming et al 2002 zeleke et al 2017 a large number of drought indicators serve as a basis for these analyses svodova et al 2016 the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 is widely used due to its versatility and effectiveness alley 1984 nam et al 2015 quiring and papakryiakou 2003 the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 currently recommended by the world meteorological organization uses rainfall series to define drought periods and has also been used widely in studies around the world ayantobo et al 2017 stagge et al 2017 one of its main advantages compared to the pdsi is that it can be computed for multiple time scales which allows the assessment of water availability according to the process under consideration e g 3 month spi provides a seasonal estimation of precipitation whereas 12 month spi reflects long term precipitation patterns guttman 1999 1998 more recently the standardized precipitation and evaporation index spei was introduced by vicente serrano et al 2010a 2010b its versatility is similar to that of the spi and it has the advantage of considering both precipitation and evapotranspiration vicente serrano et al 2010a 2010b found that spei had a better performance than spi and pdsi under global warming scenarios since it could reflect the increase in drought severity associated with higher water demand due to evapotranspiration however the need for long term and high quality input data is often a problem for the application of these indicators especially in poorly monitored regions easterling 2013 in recent years global databases such as climate research unit cru harris et al 2014 terraclimate abatzoglou et al 2018 and the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc rudolf et al 2011 have emerged as alternative data sources showing good performance in drought studies araneda cabrera et al 2021b 2020 lovino et al 2014 in this study we evaluate the spatiotemporal distribution of drought in mozambique and explore its relationships with large scale climate variability this country is one of the poorest in the world highly dependent on rain fed agriculture and very prone to droughts it has very little water infrastructure and a lack of monitoring systems so its resilience to extreme hydrological events is very low osbahr et al 2008 to the best of the authors knowledge there is a lack of comprehensive drought studies at the national level that might provide the basis for the development of national drought monitoring and forecasting systems the possibility of drought forecasting has only been explored in small parts of the country with a focus on the limpopo basin dutra et al 2013 seibert et al 2017 trambauer et al 2015 2014 climate variability has also been studied in specific regions as part of vulnerability and adaptation assessments eriksen and silva 2009 macarringue et al 2017 osbahr et al 2008 uele et al 2017 similarly the relationship between droughts and climate indices has not been widely analysed in the country manhique et al 2011 note that el niño southern oscillation enso appears to play a significant role in the inter annual frequency of the main summer rainfall over mozambique however other climate indices such as darwin sea level pressure have been shown to influence the climate in neighbouring countries manatsa et al 2008a 2008b the main objective of the current study is to characterize drought conditions and trends over mozambique between 1950 and 2019 and to identify the influence of large scale climatic drivers on drought events we follow a five step methodology described in section 2 of general applicability i e one that could be used in any other country or region worldwide comprising drought regionalization characterization trend analysis long term dependence and cross dependence with climatic factors given that mozambique is heavily reliant on agriculture the analysis focuses on persistent drought which can affect agricultural production and food security in this way the results are intended to be of practical value to water managers and users the ultimate aim is to support drought management planning with tools that enable better monitoring and prediction of risk at the regional scale 2 materials and methodology the methodology developed in this study involves the following steps 1 the calculation of the spei drought index with a 12 month time scale spei 12 for the period 1950 2019 2 the application of principal component analysis pca analysis and the k means clustering method to define homogeneous drought regions that follow the time patterns of the drought index series 3 the characterization of the drought events according to run theory 4 the application of the modified mann kendall mmk trend test method and the rescaled range r s analysis to determine the temporal variability of droughts and 5 the exploration of the relationships between the spei time series and several large scale climate indices to find appropriate drought predictors the cross correlation method the fast fourier transform fft and cross wavelet analysis were used for this latter purpose the methods employed at each step were complementary and not exclusive fig 1 summarizes the steps in a methodological flow chart the entire methodology was developed and computed using the r software rstudio team 2016 specifically we used the r package spei begueria and vicente serrano 2017 stat bolar 2019 lmomrfa trend pohlert 2020 pracma borchers 2019 tseries trapletti et al 2020 stats developed by r core team and contributors worldwide and biwavelet gouhier et al 2016 2 1 study area mozambique covers an area of 801 000 km2 fig 2a it is in the southern cone of africa one of the most drought prone areas worldwide where extreme hydrological events are expected to become more frequent and damaging due to climate change eriksen and silva 2009 osbahr et al 2008 patt and schröter 2008 the climate is tropical with a hot and rainy summer season from november to march 80 of the year s precipitation falls during this period and a cool and dry winter season from april to october the national average annual precipitation varies from 683 mm to 1276 mm with the south and central west being the drier regions the mean annual temperature varies from 23 c to 25 c with the coastal regions of the centre and north of the country plus the centre west being the warmest the national average annual precipitation level has high interannual variability and has been below the average for most years in the past two decades fig 2b the average annual temperature has increased considerably over the last 20 years where its anomalies have reached 1 c in relation to the period 1950 2019 fig 2c according to the international disaster database em dat 2020 the drought events of 1987 1991 1992 1995 and 2016 were among the severest in the country causing losses of 650 million dollars and affecting at least 24 million people munichre 2018 in these years low precipitation and high temperature anomalies were observed although rainfall volumes are higher in the north than in the south droughts are a recurrent problem throughout the country affecting the socio economic activities and negatively impacting the quality of life of the population the national directorate of water dna divides the country into three regional water administrations aras administração regional de águas which are responsible for managing extreme events such as droughts conselho de ministros 2020 south ara from the country s southern border to the save river central ara running from the save river to the licungo river and north ara comprising the territory from the licungo river to the country s northern border with tanzania fig 2a it should be noted that this division into 3 aras is very recent five aras were initially created in mozambique as part of the 1991 water law based on geographic and infrastructural conditions specific to their jurisdictional areas prioritizing their institutional capacity inguane et al 2014 2 2 the standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index spei the spei was selected as a hydro meteorological drought index due to its flexibility as a multi scalar index unlike the pdsi and because of its functionality under climate change conditions in that it can account for the role of temperature increase in future drought conditions unlike the spi the spei has been used successfully for drought monitoring in various studies around the world lovino et al 2014 meresa et al 2016 and has been found to be more effective than other indices in capturing drought responses for ecological agricultural and hydrological applications vicente serrano et al 2012 the spei is based on the probability distribution of a long term climatic water balance c w b p e t p time series where p is the precipitation and etp the potential evapotranspiration it is typically computed by summing c w b over k months similar to spi termed accumulation periods and fitting these accumulated values to a parametric statistical distribution from which probabilities are standardized u 0 σ 1 given that the cwb series can have values below zero a three parameter distribution is needed to model them vicente serrano et al 2010a the three parameter log logistic distribution has been found to fit the cwb series very well across most of the world for most time scales vicente serrano et al 2010b so we have used this distribution here we utilized a 12 months accumulation k 12 to analyse the interannual variability of drought conditions the choice of time scale is driven by the objectives of the study which ultimately are to provide useful information for water managers and users for monitoring and forecasting drought drought at this scale can cause yield reductions for both rainfed and irrigated crops posing a severe threat to food security in this country it has also been seen in mozambique that spei 12 is strongly correlated to spei at other scales and that it is effective at detecting the country s historical drought records araneda cabrera et al 2021b however it should be noted that using this timescale presents some challenges such as generating time series of independent measurements and capturing the whole drought cycle in a watershed or region monthly p and etp data were downloaded from the climate research unit cru ts v 4 04 http www cru uea ac uk data to compute the spei cru offers monthly climatic time series at a 0 5 resolution 55 km in the equator worldwide harris et al 2014 at this resolution a total of 343 time series of spei were computed in mozambique fig 2a the time span of the analysis was from january 1950 to december 2019 70 years for the purposes of this study a drought event started when the spei took values lower than 1 and ended when its value returned to values higher than this threshold which corresponds to moderate droughts according to the categories in mckee et al 1993 in addition to ensure that drought events were independent of each other and to group mutually dependent droughts we used the inter event time method introduced by zelenhasić and salvai 1987 which is still widely applied in the recent literature e g liu et al 2020 rivera et al 2021 drought events were designated as independent if the inter event time lasted more than 2 months i e 2 consecutive months above the proposed drought threshold while a drought qualified as an event if it lasted more than 2 months the events were characterized according to run theory explained in detail in yevjevich 1969 the intensity int is the minimum monthly value that is reached by the index throughout the event the duration du is the number of months that the event lasts and the severity sev is computed as the sum of monthly spei values throughout the event 2 3 drought regionalization principal component analysis pca was used to identify drought patterns in the spei series and hence define homogeneous regions with similar drought variability and characteristics it has been widely used for similar regionalization purposes in other parts of the world espinosa et al 2019 lovino et al 2014 santos et al 2010 vicente serrano 2006b the method consisted of calculating the covariance matrix of the data spei series with the corresponding eigenvalues and eigenvectors the principal components pc are given by linear combinations of the time series spei with maximum variance rencher 2002 the number of regions were defined by the number of chosen pcs there are several methods for finding the right number of pcs cangelosi and goriely 2007 here the criterion selected was that they explain at least 75 of the accumulated variance while the following pc represents less than 5 then the main components were rotated rotated principal components rpc using the varimax technique espinosa et al 2019 to locate more accurately the spatial patterns of drought variability to improve their interpretation and to redistribute the final explained variance vicente serrano 2006b to identify the spatial patterns of the spei pearson s correlation coefficients r were calculated between each rpc and the spei series of each cru resulting in smooth and gradual patterns of the spi 12 field espinosa et al 2019 when a group of centroids cru cells had the high correlations r with an rpc we delimited a new region in parallel hierarchical clustering analysis was applied through the k means method santos et al 2010 vicente serrano 2006a wilks 2006 the goal was to compare the number of optimal clusters with the number of pcs obtained according to the above criterion to validate the regionalization defined by the pca method to choose the optimal number of clusters we used the euclidean distances between the created clusters which yields the lowest possible number with the greatest possible homogeneity euclidean distances ensured heterogeneity between clusters so in order to guarantee the homogeneity within clusters the regional heterogeneity measure hn proposed by hosking and wallis 1993 was used this as a means of assessing whether the resulting regions were statistically homogeneous a region is considered acceptably homogeneous if hn 1 possibly heterogeneous if 1 hn 2 and definitely heterogeneous if hn 2 from this point onwards all subsequent analyses were performed with spei 12 series representative of the resulting homogeneous regions obtained by averaging all the time series contained in each of them 2 4 trend and persistence analysis this step sought to analyse the temporal variability of droughts by exploring trends and their long term persistence on the one hand the mann kendall mk trend test was used to analyse whether the spei time series presented a significant trend either positive or negative the mk trend test is a rank based non parametric method that analyses the difference in signs between the previous and subsequent data points using the standard normal variant z hipel and mcleod 1994 although the mk trend method requires the measurements to be independent for simplicity of analysis in the present paper we have assumed that monthly spei 12 meet this condition as other studies have also done garcía garizábal 2017 yao et al 2018 on the other hand the rescaled range r s statistical analysis was applied to the spei time series in order to quantify the long term persistence of trends we ascertained whether the drought trends observed to be statistically significant in the study period past persist in time future since this is related to the predictability of droughts and climate change koutsoyiannis 2005 2003 this analysis was introduced by hurst 1956 the long term persistence of trends in the time series is analysed by estimating the autocorrelation properties of the time series for instance this allows us to see whether humid years cluster in multiannual humid periods or if drought years cluster in multiannual dry periods such an estimation is made by means of the hurst index h which is a measure of long term persistence the h index classifies the time series into 3 types according to their value when h 0 5 the series is completely uncorrelated and its future trend is different or equal to the past one when h 0 5 the future trend of the series will the opposite of the past series and when h 0 5 the future trend of the series will be the same as the past trend in the latter two cases with the lowest and highest values of h respectively the strength of the persistence is greatest the steps of the computation can be seen in gao et al 2020 these two analyses were applied to the monthly and annual spei time series averaged over the homogeneous drought regions obtained in the previous step the annual series was assessed in this section to strengthen the limitations of using spei 12 as these measures can be considered non dependent 2 5 relationships with large scale climate indices a series of large scale climate indices were selected to analyse their possible relationships with the variability of the spei time series averaged over the homogeneous drought regions the climate indices are based on the fluctuations of atmospheric pressure at sea level slp of different points around the globe darwin slp tahiti slp soi and nao indices and the sea surface temperature sst of the atlantic tna tsa nat sat and tasi indices pacific enso indices niño 1 2 niño 3 niño 4 niño3 4 and pdo and indian swio wtio setio and dmi indices oceans the climate indices used are listed in table 1 together with the data sources and the available period of data for consistency with the spei time series a 12 month moving average was applied to the climatic indices from 1950 to 2019 with a monthly resolution except for pdo swio tasi nat and sat which were not available for the whole time period the cross correlation method hair et al 1998 was applied between the monthly and annual spei series and the climatic indices to quantify the strength of the link between them since the relationships between climatic and drought indices necessarily could not occur at the same time we first analysed the correlation with zero lag time and then looked for the time lag on a monthly scale in which the correlation is greater between the two series the time lag is associated with the early prediction of one series using the other while the correlation coefficient indicates how strong that relationship would be based on the cross correlation results a reduced set of climate indices was selected for the next steps of the methodology a spectral analysis based on fast fourier transform fft and a cross wavelet analysis was then performed between the monthly spei series and the climatic indices that showed the best correlations in the previous analysis the idea was to further explore the relationship between these two types of indicators in each homogeneous drought region of the country the fft is a well known mathematical procedure that allows us to convert signals time series from the time domain to the frequency domain this process is very useful for decomposing a time series comprising various pure frequencies sinuses and cosines in only a few recurring periods period 1 frequency of different lengths here we looked for the periods in the spei and their highly correlated climatic indices for details of the mathematical process see fleming et al 2002 cross wavelet analysis was initially introduced by hudgins et al 1993 and explores the relationships between two associated time series in this case the spei series and the climatic indices it combines wavelet transformation with cross spectrum analysis and can notionally capture the characteristic changes and associated oscillations of these two time series in both the time and frequency fields grinsted et al 2004 a detailed description of the calculation method and applications can be found in torrence and compo 1997 these methods have been applied in other similar studies for example the cross correlation method was used by lima and aghakouchak 2017 in amazonia to correlate the pdsi with climate indices santos et al 2010 used fft in portugal to determine the periodicity of droughts according to the spi 6 and räsänen et al 2016 applied cross wavelet analysis in mainland southeast asia to analyse the relationship between the enso and the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution of droughts following the procedure described in section 2 2 a total of 343 time series of spei values were calculated these corresponding to the cru coordinates presented in fig 2a each spei 12 time series had a length of 840 months from 1950 to 2019 pca analysis was applied to the matrix that contained the times series of spei with 840 rows corresponding to the length of the time series and 343 columns corresponding to the coordinates of cru to transform its variables into principal components pc by simple linear transformations the first pc explained a large percentage of the total variance 46 83 the variance retained by the pc2 and pc3 were 25 17 and 7 51 respectively following the proposed criteria these three pcs were chosen for the varimax orthogonal rotation since together they explained 79 5 of the variance and the part of the total variance retained by the next pc pc4 was below 5 4 26 inverse distance weighting idw interpolation was used to plot pearson s correlations between the three chosen rpcs and each of the 343 spei series fig 3 this technique was applied only for plotting purposes regionalization was based on the values at the cru grid points three regions were clearly defined north reg1 south reg2 and centre reg3 following the classification obtained by the best correlations r 0 60 the coordinates of each spei series belonging to each rpc are listed in the supplementary materials table s1 it should be noted that other temporal aggregations spei 3 and spei 6 were also tested in this step obtaining very similar homogeneous drought regions as can be seen in fig s1 of the supplementary materials in what follows we used the regionalization obtained with pca on the spei 12 series the non hierarchical k means clustering method was applied to the 343 spei time series to validate the regionalization obtained by pca according to pca a successful regionalization would be a classification into 3 groups so here we analysed a clustering of 2 3 and 4 regions i e a variation of 1 with respect to the pca result the spatial extent of the resulting clusters is shown in fig 4 and the coordinates of the spei series belonging to each cluster are detailed in the supplementary materials table s1 using the euclidean distance between clusters method table 2 the classification into 2 groups fig 4a is considered inadequate since the distance between both clusters in this configuration 26 76 is less than the distance between them 37 36 when grouped into 3 clusters fig 4b when clustering into 4 groups fig 4c the area representing cluster 1 in the 3 group division fig 4b is divided into clusters 1 and 4 while cluster 2 remains invariant to be accepted as a better classification the two distances cluster 1 and 4 with respect to cluster 2 should be greater than the distance between cluster 1 and 2 when grouped into 3 clusters since this is not true for the distance between clusters 2 and 4 35 41 37 36 the division into 4 clusters is rejected although not shown in this paper regionalization was also performed with ward s hierarchical clustering method wilks 2006 obtaining similar results based on these results in what follows we used the regionalization obtained with pca which divides mozambique into 3 homogeneous drought regions fig 3 in these 3 regions the hn index was 0 111 for the northern region 0 004 for the central region and 0 024 for the southern region thus both heterogeneity between clusters and homogeneity within clusters was guaranteed the spei series were averaged in each region 93 spei series on the north 110 on the south and 140 on the centre regions to use in the subsequent analysis fig 5 3 2 characterization of drought events run theory was adopted to characterize the drought events in the 3 regions previously determined table 3 a lower number of drought events but of longer duration and higher severity were found in the centre region on average drought events were less intense and severe in the north they occurred on average every 4 9 years in the north every 4 years in the south and every 5 9 years in the centre region the longest most intense and severest events began in 1982 1987 1991 1994 2005 2009 and 2016 and most of them affected all three regions 3 3 temporal variability and persistence of droughts the representative spei time series for each region are shown in fig 5 they are clearly non monotonic non stationary according to acf analysis autocorrelation function not shown here and trend stationary statistical significance level of 1 according to the kpss test the kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shin test the mk test z index and the r s analysis h index applied to the annual and monthly spei time series of the three homogeneous drought regions are presented in table 4 in all cases and regions the trends were negative illustrated in fig 5 although in the north region they were statistically non significant at a level of 5 for the annual spei in all cases the hurst index h was greater than 0 5 which suggests that the negative long term trends will persist in the near future in the south and centre regions the h values were higher suggesting that trends will persist with greater strength while long term trend persistence strength will be weak in the north region 3 4 identification of large scale climate drivers the cross correlations and lagged cross correlations between the proposed climate indices table 1 and the spei of the homogeneous drought regions are shown in table 5 the best correlations are shown in the top rows of the table the anomalies in the time series of the best correlated climate indices are shown in fig 6 most of the correlations were negative darwin niño 3 4 niño 3 niño 4 wtio and setio and only one was positive soi indicating they are anti phase or in phase respectively relative to the spei the north region persistently showed a poor correlation with the climate indices analysed while the strongest correlations were obtained in the south and centre regions in these two regions strong correlations with the different el niño indices were noticeable r up to 0 59 with the higher correlations being found for the el niño 4 and el niño 3 4 sst indices which showed crests around 2 3 months earlier than the negative peak of the spei another strong correlation r 0 58 with a similar time lag was found with the darwin slp index based on the above observations el niño 4 and darwin indices were chosen for the spectral analysis using the fft technique and cross wavelet analysis fft allowed us to appreciate the periodic behaviour of the monthly spei patterns in each homogeneous drought region and of darwin slp and niño 4 climatic indices the periodograms are set out in fig 7 the results showed that climatic indices and spei series have a periodicity associated with high energies between 40 and 120 months 3 5 and 10 years in the north region periods of between 35 and 60 months 3 and 5 years were found these periods are consistent and similar to those reported in other studies in africa oguntunde et al 2018 2017 the spectral analysis of the spei darwin slp and el niño 4 patterns was expanded using cross wavelet transform fig 8 both darwin slp and el niño 4 events showed strong impacts on the monthly series of spei especially in the south and centre regions indicating that they play a relevant role in the characteristics of the evolution of droughts in mozambique specifically the positive events of niño 4 show statistically significant negative links confidence level 95 with the monthly spei series of the south and centre regions with a signal of 16 128 months 1 3 10 7 years in the north region climatic indices did not show strong effects on the evolution of droughts something previously seen in the low correlations however the statistically significant strongest signals were found for 16 64 months 1 4 5 4 years over the entire study period in the three regions the energy density is higher in the periods where drought events were detected e g the major drought event of 1991 4 discussion the above results provide new insights into the spatial and temporal patterns of drought in mozambique and their relationship with the large scale climate variability the resulting drought regionalisation differs from other divisions created for other management purposes fews net moçambique 2014 ingc 2009 as shown in fig 3 the regions as defined also do not entirely coincide with those used by the mozambican government for water resources management aras although the spatial positioning patterns north centre and south are maintained the use of the proposed divisions as drought management areas would allow for more appropriate regional strategies for assessing monitoring and responding to drought wilhite et al 2000 the most important drought events identified in these regions have been listed and coincided with the major ones at the national level the trends observed in the spei series were consistent with the trends found for the spei input variables i e precipitation and temperature shown in fig 2b and c where trends were positive for temperature and negative for precipitation in addition these findings are in line with similar ones reported by jury 2013 who used satellite sensor data to analyse climate trends in southern africa and found that temperature and precipitation trends were positive and negative respectively over the period 1980 2010 in mozambique as a whole on the other hand the persistence analysis points to an increase in the incidence of droughts throughout the country although these results should be taken with caution due to the climate system complexity they further highlight the need for the development of drought forecasting tools and more specific in depth studies on drought variability in the homogeneous regions these results are consistent with those found at the continental level and in other regions of africa masih et al 2014 rouault and richard 2005 and with the variations seen in recent years on precipitation and temperature in mozambique jury 2013 uele et al 2017 relationships found between droughts and el niño 4 and el niño 3 4 sst indices agree with those described in manhique et al 2011 for southern africa and mozambique as a whole and in manatsa et al 2008a for the neighbouring tropical country of zimbabwe the strong climatic influence of the darwin slp index was also found by manatsa et al 2008b in zimbabwe other tropical regions of the world have also found el niño 4 and darwin to be drought triggers d arrigo and smerdon 2008 gu et al 2020 lyon and barnston 2005 so these and following results are also of hydrological interest for countries located in these climatic regions the periodic behaviour of the monthly spei patterns according to ftt match those reported in section 3 2 and coincide with the historical drought records documented in em dat 2020 and masih et al 2014 thus these results are of great importance as well as being novel for the region the periodicity found in the el niño 4 the same oscillation period was observed for darwin spl index is consistent with the widely accepted 3 7 year period mcphaden et al 1998 the results of the spectral analysis consistently point to an anti phase relationship between the drought events detected by spei and the climatic indices darwin slp and el niño 4 in the south and centre regions the north region showed a poor relationship with the climatic indicators in this region of the country drought events are less intense and severe although the number of events is higher this may be explained by the relationship between the temperate tropical depressions and enso this relationship affects the precipitation patterns in southeast africa making enso less influential in the north of mozambique and meaning that it is a wetter area than the rest of the country manhique et al 2011 these climate indices could be used in drought forecasting models as predictors of drought in mozambique with a lead time of 2 3 months based on the lagged correlations such a lead time would enable the establishment of preventive measures against possible upcoming droughts e g accumulating water in reservoirs prioritizing water use for different uses etc in this way a forecasting model could be employed to infer the probability and intensity of drought events in the short term future relying on past values of the climate indices hao et al 2018 and allowing actions to be implemented when a drought is expected 5 conclusions the main objective of this study was to investigate the spatio temporal characteristics of droughts and their relationships with possible predictors of the phenomenon in mozambique although mozambique is very prone to droughts and suffers continuously from their effects it does not have the necessary management tools to monitor and predict the phenomenon the proposed five step methodology consists of several methods organised in a coherent way for use in mozambique or in any other region country or river basin that requires a first assessment of the spatio temporal characteristics of droughts here efforts have been made to adapt the methodology specifically to mozambique where local meteorological and hydrological monitoring data are extremely limited the monthly spei 12 was calculated as an indicator of drought from 1950 to 2019 at a high resolution 0 5 principal component analysis with the varimax rotation method was used to define 3 homogeneous drought regions located in the north south and centre of the country this regionalization was validated with hierarchical and non hierarchical clustering methods the regions as delimited do not coincide entirely with those identified by the mozambican national directorate of water but are preferable for drought monitoring and management based on run theory the south and centre regions are the ones that have presented the most intense and severe drought events in the past a statistically significant trend towards a higher incidence of droughts was found in the three regions and rescale range analysis suggests that this trend might persist in the near future this section presented valuable information for mozambique on the temporal variability of droughts however given the limitations derived from the use of spei 12 it would be advisable to consider additional time scales in future studies to gain further insights into the temporal patterns of drought in each region strong correlations between two climatic indices el niño 4 enso and darwin slp and droughts were found in the south and centre regions with a time lag of 2 3 months these climate indices are representative drought triggers in tropical regions of the world such as mozambique with the fft technique it was found that the periods of spei and these two climate indices have a similar periodicity of between 3 and 8 years this being a novel statement with reference to mozambique spectral analysis by means of cross wavelet transform confirmed that spei and el niño 4 and darwin slp are strongly related in anti phase for periods between 1 4 and 10 4 years these climate indices could thus be used to develop a drought forecasting system providing sufficient lead time to establish prevention strategies in summary this study has provided an understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of droughts in mozambique the results are of great potential use for mozambique s regional water administrations towards developing drought contingency plans simplified management regions have been defined characterised and strongly related to potential drought predictors the proposed methodology can be used elsewhere in the world however given its limitations and the large number of topics it covers

8098,study region mozambique study focus mozambique does not currently have the necessary tools for systematic monitoring and forecasting of drought at a subnational scale the purpose of this study was to characterize drought conditions and trends throughout the country and to evaluate the influence of major climatic drivers on drought events period 1950 2019 drought conditions were studied by means of the standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index spei and run theory the principal component analysis technique and the k means clustering method were applied for defining homogenous drought regions the mann kendall trend test and rescaled range statistical analysis were used for defining the temporal characteristics of drought the cross correlation method a spectral analysis based on the fast fourier transform and a cross wavelet analysis were used to identify possible climate drivers the results are ultimately intended to contribute to the development of a drought monitoring system in this country new hydrological insights for the region three homogeneous drought regions can be defined in mozambique the south and centre regions showed more intense and severe drought events in all regions a significant trend towards a higher incidence of droughts and long term a persistence were found el niño southern oscillation and darwin sea level pressure anomalies were identified as significant drivers of drought variability especially in the southern regions these climate indices can be used as predictors in drought forecasting models keywords drought standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index spei regionalization trend persistence teleconnections climatic indices 1 introduction droughts are among the most common natural phenomena worldwide and can occur anywhere under any climate regime bryant et al 2005 sheffield and wood 2012 however they constitute one of the least understood natural hazards due to their complexity and difficulties in quantification hagenlocher et al 2019 the effects of droughts can be felt in chains of energy production food water supply etc yet are generally detected when the consequences of the phenomenon are difficult to mitigate and thus droughts constitute the disaster that causes the greatest socioeconomic losses worldwide wmo 2006 in addition the effects of droughts are expected to worsen in the coming decades as a result of climate change changes in spatial temporal patterns of precipitation and extreme temperatures are likely to make droughts more recurrent mishra and singh 2011 as stated by the ipcc 2014 there are trends of increasing intensities and frequencies of droughts around the world with arid and semi arid areas possibly being the most affected this might invalidate traditional methods for examining the impact of environmental factors on drought based as they are on the assumption of stationarity jehanzaib et al 2020 specific spatiotemporal drought assessments at regional or local levels are needed for reliable decision making in the context of adaptation planning to future climate conditions see e g jehanzaib and kim 2020 kim and jehanzaib 2020 and the references therein according to wilhite et al 2000 one of the first steps for drought assessment and management in a given zone country or river basin should be a spatial division into regions according to drought characteristics the techniques of hierarchical and non hierarchical clustering santos et al 2010 vicente serrano 2006a and principal component analysis agutu et al 2017 lovino et al 2014 vicente serrano 2006b can be applied directly to drought indicators for identifying homogenous drought regions the next steps should be aimed at developing a drought monitoring system to create early warnings of emerging drought conditions the temporal variability of droughts in the area under analysis must be studied to accomplish this objective the historical drought variability is usually analysed by means of a technique such as run theory yevjevich 1969 accompanied by trend and persistence tests of the drought characteristics ayantobo et al 2017 huang et al 2016 zambreski et al 2018 the subsequent step is then to forecast droughts thus it is necessary to understand the climate drivers that trigger drought events in the region and to use this teleconnection information as a forecasting tool to achieve this goal methods such as cross correlation araneda cabrera et al 2021a hair et al 1998 and various spectral analysis applied to climate indices and drought indicators have become popular as a means of identifying appropriate drought predictors el kenawy et al 2016 espinosa et al 2019 fleming et al 2002 zeleke et al 2017 a large number of drought indicators serve as a basis for these analyses svodova et al 2016 the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 is widely used due to its versatility and effectiveness alley 1984 nam et al 2015 quiring and papakryiakou 2003 the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 currently recommended by the world meteorological organization uses rainfall series to define drought periods and has also been used widely in studies around the world ayantobo et al 2017 stagge et al 2017 one of its main advantages compared to the pdsi is that it can be computed for multiple time scales which allows the assessment of water availability according to the process under consideration e g 3 month spi provides a seasonal estimation of precipitation whereas 12 month spi reflects long term precipitation patterns guttman 1999 1998 more recently the standardized precipitation and evaporation index spei was introduced by vicente serrano et al 2010a 2010b its versatility is similar to that of the spi and it has the advantage of considering both precipitation and evapotranspiration vicente serrano et al 2010a 2010b found that spei had a better performance than spi and pdsi under global warming scenarios since it could reflect the increase in drought severity associated with higher water demand due to evapotranspiration however the need for long term and high quality input data is often a problem for the application of these indicators especially in poorly monitored regions easterling 2013 in recent years global databases such as climate research unit cru harris et al 2014 terraclimate abatzoglou et al 2018 and the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc rudolf et al 2011 have emerged as alternative data sources showing good performance in drought studies araneda cabrera et al 2021b 2020 lovino et al 2014 in this study we evaluate the spatiotemporal distribution of drought in mozambique and explore its relationships with large scale climate variability this country is one of the poorest in the world highly dependent on rain fed agriculture and very prone to droughts it has very little water infrastructure and a lack of monitoring systems so its resilience to extreme hydrological events is very low osbahr et al 2008 to the best of the authors knowledge there is a lack of comprehensive drought studies at the national level that might provide the basis for the development of national drought monitoring and forecasting systems the possibility of drought forecasting has only been explored in small parts of the country with a focus on the limpopo basin dutra et al 2013 seibert et al 2017 trambauer et al 2015 2014 climate variability has also been studied in specific regions as part of vulnerability and adaptation assessments eriksen and silva 2009 macarringue et al 2017 osbahr et al 2008 uele et al 2017 similarly the relationship between droughts and climate indices has not been widely analysed in the country manhique et al 2011 note that el niño southern oscillation enso appears to play a significant role in the inter annual frequency of the main summer rainfall over mozambique however other climate indices such as darwin sea level pressure have been shown to influence the climate in neighbouring countries manatsa et al 2008a 2008b the main objective of the current study is to characterize drought conditions and trends over mozambique between 1950 and 2019 and to identify the influence of large scale climatic drivers on drought events we follow a five step methodology described in section 2 of general applicability i e one that could be used in any other country or region worldwide comprising drought regionalization characterization trend analysis long term dependence and cross dependence with climatic factors given that mozambique is heavily reliant on agriculture the analysis focuses on persistent drought which can affect agricultural production and food security in this way the results are intended to be of practical value to water managers and users the ultimate aim is to support drought management planning with tools that enable better monitoring and prediction of risk at the regional scale 2 materials and methodology the methodology developed in this study involves the following steps 1 the calculation of the spei drought index with a 12 month time scale spei 12 for the period 1950 2019 2 the application of principal component analysis pca analysis and the k means clustering method to define homogeneous drought regions that follow the time patterns of the drought index series 3 the characterization of the drought events according to run theory 4 the application of the modified mann kendall mmk trend test method and the rescaled range r s analysis to determine the temporal variability of droughts and 5 the exploration of the relationships between the spei time series and several large scale climate indices to find appropriate drought predictors the cross correlation method the fast fourier transform fft and cross wavelet analysis were used for this latter purpose the methods employed at each step were complementary and not exclusive fig 1 summarizes the steps in a methodological flow chart the entire methodology was developed and computed using the r software rstudio team 2016 specifically we used the r package spei begueria and vicente serrano 2017 stat bolar 2019 lmomrfa trend pohlert 2020 pracma borchers 2019 tseries trapletti et al 2020 stats developed by r core team and contributors worldwide and biwavelet gouhier et al 2016 2 1 study area mozambique covers an area of 801 000 km2 fig 2a it is in the southern cone of africa one of the most drought prone areas worldwide where extreme hydrological events are expected to become more frequent and damaging due to climate change eriksen and silva 2009 osbahr et al 2008 patt and schröter 2008 the climate is tropical with a hot and rainy summer season from november to march 80 of the year s precipitation falls during this period and a cool and dry winter season from april to october the national average annual precipitation varies from 683 mm to 1276 mm with the south and central west being the drier regions the mean annual temperature varies from 23 c to 25 c with the coastal regions of the centre and north of the country plus the centre west being the warmest the national average annual precipitation level has high interannual variability and has been below the average for most years in the past two decades fig 2b the average annual temperature has increased considerably over the last 20 years where its anomalies have reached 1 c in relation to the period 1950 2019 fig 2c according to the international disaster database em dat 2020 the drought events of 1987 1991 1992 1995 and 2016 were among the severest in the country causing losses of 650 million dollars and affecting at least 24 million people munichre 2018 in these years low precipitation and high temperature anomalies were observed although rainfall volumes are higher in the north than in the south droughts are a recurrent problem throughout the country affecting the socio economic activities and negatively impacting the quality of life of the population the national directorate of water dna divides the country into three regional water administrations aras administração regional de águas which are responsible for managing extreme events such as droughts conselho de ministros 2020 south ara from the country s southern border to the save river central ara running from the save river to the licungo river and north ara comprising the territory from the licungo river to the country s northern border with tanzania fig 2a it should be noted that this division into 3 aras is very recent five aras were initially created in mozambique as part of the 1991 water law based on geographic and infrastructural conditions specific to their jurisdictional areas prioritizing their institutional capacity inguane et al 2014 2 2 the standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index spei the spei was selected as a hydro meteorological drought index due to its flexibility as a multi scalar index unlike the pdsi and because of its functionality under climate change conditions in that it can account for the role of temperature increase in future drought conditions unlike the spi the spei has been used successfully for drought monitoring in various studies around the world lovino et al 2014 meresa et al 2016 and has been found to be more effective than other indices in capturing drought responses for ecological agricultural and hydrological applications vicente serrano et al 2012 the spei is based on the probability distribution of a long term climatic water balance c w b p e t p time series where p is the precipitation and etp the potential evapotranspiration it is typically computed by summing c w b over k months similar to spi termed accumulation periods and fitting these accumulated values to a parametric statistical distribution from which probabilities are standardized u 0 σ 1 given that the cwb series can have values below zero a three parameter distribution is needed to model them vicente serrano et al 2010a the three parameter log logistic distribution has been found to fit the cwb series very well across most of the world for most time scales vicente serrano et al 2010b so we have used this distribution here we utilized a 12 months accumulation k 12 to analyse the interannual variability of drought conditions the choice of time scale is driven by the objectives of the study which ultimately are to provide useful information for water managers and users for monitoring and forecasting drought drought at this scale can cause yield reductions for both rainfed and irrigated crops posing a severe threat to food security in this country it has also been seen in mozambique that spei 12 is strongly correlated to spei at other scales and that it is effective at detecting the country s historical drought records araneda cabrera et al 2021b however it should be noted that using this timescale presents some challenges such as generating time series of independent measurements and capturing the whole drought cycle in a watershed or region monthly p and etp data were downloaded from the climate research unit cru ts v 4 04 http www cru uea ac uk data to compute the spei cru offers monthly climatic time series at a 0 5 resolution 55 km in the equator worldwide harris et al 2014 at this resolution a total of 343 time series of spei were computed in mozambique fig 2a the time span of the analysis was from january 1950 to december 2019 70 years for the purposes of this study a drought event started when the spei took values lower than 1 and ended when its value returned to values higher than this threshold which corresponds to moderate droughts according to the categories in mckee et al 1993 in addition to ensure that drought events were independent of each other and to group mutually dependent droughts we used the inter event time method introduced by zelenhasić and salvai 1987 which is still widely applied in the recent literature e g liu et al 2020 rivera et al 2021 drought events were designated as independent if the inter event time lasted more than 2 months i e 2 consecutive months above the proposed drought threshold while a drought qualified as an event if it lasted more than 2 months the events were characterized according to run theory explained in detail in yevjevich 1969 the intensity int is the minimum monthly value that is reached by the index throughout the event the duration du is the number of months that the event lasts and the severity sev is computed as the sum of monthly spei values throughout the event 2 3 drought regionalization principal component analysis pca was used to identify drought patterns in the spei series and hence define homogeneous regions with similar drought variability and characteristics it has been widely used for similar regionalization purposes in other parts of the world espinosa et al 2019 lovino et al 2014 santos et al 2010 vicente serrano 2006b the method consisted of calculating the covariance matrix of the data spei series with the corresponding eigenvalues and eigenvectors the principal components pc are given by linear combinations of the time series spei with maximum variance rencher 2002 the number of regions were defined by the number of chosen pcs there are several methods for finding the right number of pcs cangelosi and goriely 2007 here the criterion selected was that they explain at least 75 of the accumulated variance while the following pc represents less than 5 then the main components were rotated rotated principal components rpc using the varimax technique espinosa et al 2019 to locate more accurately the spatial patterns of drought variability to improve their interpretation and to redistribute the final explained variance vicente serrano 2006b to identify the spatial patterns of the spei pearson s correlation coefficients r were calculated between each rpc and the spei series of each cru resulting in smooth and gradual patterns of the spi 12 field espinosa et al 2019 when a group of centroids cru cells had the high correlations r with an rpc we delimited a new region in parallel hierarchical clustering analysis was applied through the k means method santos et al 2010 vicente serrano 2006a wilks 2006 the goal was to compare the number of optimal clusters with the number of pcs obtained according to the above criterion to validate the regionalization defined by the pca method to choose the optimal number of clusters we used the euclidean distances between the created clusters which yields the lowest possible number with the greatest possible homogeneity euclidean distances ensured heterogeneity between clusters so in order to guarantee the homogeneity within clusters the regional heterogeneity measure hn proposed by hosking and wallis 1993 was used this as a means of assessing whether the resulting regions were statistically homogeneous a region is considered acceptably homogeneous if hn 1 possibly heterogeneous if 1 hn 2 and definitely heterogeneous if hn 2 from this point onwards all subsequent analyses were performed with spei 12 series representative of the resulting homogeneous regions obtained by averaging all the time series contained in each of them 2 4 trend and persistence analysis this step sought to analyse the temporal variability of droughts by exploring trends and their long term persistence on the one hand the mann kendall mk trend test was used to analyse whether the spei time series presented a significant trend either positive or negative the mk trend test is a rank based non parametric method that analyses the difference in signs between the previous and subsequent data points using the standard normal variant z hipel and mcleod 1994 although the mk trend method requires the measurements to be independent for simplicity of analysis in the present paper we have assumed that monthly spei 12 meet this condition as other studies have also done garcía garizábal 2017 yao et al 2018 on the other hand the rescaled range r s statistical analysis was applied to the spei time series in order to quantify the long term persistence of trends we ascertained whether the drought trends observed to be statistically significant in the study period past persist in time future since this is related to the predictability of droughts and climate change koutsoyiannis 2005 2003 this analysis was introduced by hurst 1956 the long term persistence of trends in the time series is analysed by estimating the autocorrelation properties of the time series for instance this allows us to see whether humid years cluster in multiannual humid periods or if drought years cluster in multiannual dry periods such an estimation is made by means of the hurst index h which is a measure of long term persistence the h index classifies the time series into 3 types according to their value when h 0 5 the series is completely uncorrelated and its future trend is different or equal to the past one when h 0 5 the future trend of the series will the opposite of the past series and when h 0 5 the future trend of the series will be the same as the past trend in the latter two cases with the lowest and highest values of h respectively the strength of the persistence is greatest the steps of the computation can be seen in gao et al 2020 these two analyses were applied to the monthly and annual spei time series averaged over the homogeneous drought regions obtained in the previous step the annual series was assessed in this section to strengthen the limitations of using spei 12 as these measures can be considered non dependent 2 5 relationships with large scale climate indices a series of large scale climate indices were selected to analyse their possible relationships with the variability of the spei time series averaged over the homogeneous drought regions the climate indices are based on the fluctuations of atmospheric pressure at sea level slp of different points around the globe darwin slp tahiti slp soi and nao indices and the sea surface temperature sst of the atlantic tna tsa nat sat and tasi indices pacific enso indices niño 1 2 niño 3 niño 4 niño3 4 and pdo and indian swio wtio setio and dmi indices oceans the climate indices used are listed in table 1 together with the data sources and the available period of data for consistency with the spei time series a 12 month moving average was applied to the climatic indices from 1950 to 2019 with a monthly resolution except for pdo swio tasi nat and sat which were not available for the whole time period the cross correlation method hair et al 1998 was applied between the monthly and annual spei series and the climatic indices to quantify the strength of the link between them since the relationships between climatic and drought indices necessarily could not occur at the same time we first analysed the correlation with zero lag time and then looked for the time lag on a monthly scale in which the correlation is greater between the two series the time lag is associated with the early prediction of one series using the other while the correlation coefficient indicates how strong that relationship would be based on the cross correlation results a reduced set of climate indices was selected for the next steps of the methodology a spectral analysis based on fast fourier transform fft and a cross wavelet analysis was then performed between the monthly spei series and the climatic indices that showed the best correlations in the previous analysis the idea was to further explore the relationship between these two types of indicators in each homogeneous drought region of the country the fft is a well known mathematical procedure that allows us to convert signals time series from the time domain to the frequency domain this process is very useful for decomposing a time series comprising various pure frequencies sinuses and cosines in only a few recurring periods period 1 frequency of different lengths here we looked for the periods in the spei and their highly correlated climatic indices for details of the mathematical process see fleming et al 2002 cross wavelet analysis was initially introduced by hudgins et al 1993 and explores the relationships between two associated time series in this case the spei series and the climatic indices it combines wavelet transformation with cross spectrum analysis and can notionally capture the characteristic changes and associated oscillations of these two time series in both the time and frequency fields grinsted et al 2004 a detailed description of the calculation method and applications can be found in torrence and compo 1997 these methods have been applied in other similar studies for example the cross correlation method was used by lima and aghakouchak 2017 in amazonia to correlate the pdsi with climate indices santos et al 2010 used fft in portugal to determine the periodicity of droughts according to the spi 6 and räsänen et al 2016 applied cross wavelet analysis in mainland southeast asia to analyse the relationship between the enso and the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution of droughts following the procedure described in section 2 2 a total of 343 time series of spei values were calculated these corresponding to the cru coordinates presented in fig 2a each spei 12 time series had a length of 840 months from 1950 to 2019 pca analysis was applied to the matrix that contained the times series of spei with 840 rows corresponding to the length of the time series and 343 columns corresponding to the coordinates of cru to transform its variables into principal components pc by simple linear transformations the first pc explained a large percentage of the total variance 46 83 the variance retained by the pc2 and pc3 were 25 17 and 7 51 respectively following the proposed criteria these three pcs were chosen for the varimax orthogonal rotation since together they explained 79 5 of the variance and the part of the total variance retained by the next pc pc4 was below 5 4 26 inverse distance weighting idw interpolation was used to plot pearson s correlations between the three chosen rpcs and each of the 343 spei series fig 3 this technique was applied only for plotting purposes regionalization was based on the values at the cru grid points three regions were clearly defined north reg1 south reg2 and centre reg3 following the classification obtained by the best correlations r 0 60 the coordinates of each spei series belonging to each rpc are listed in the supplementary materials table s1 it should be noted that other temporal aggregations spei 3 and spei 6 were also tested in this step obtaining very similar homogeneous drought regions as can be seen in fig s1 of the supplementary materials in what follows we used the regionalization obtained with pca on the spei 12 series the non hierarchical k means clustering method was applied to the 343 spei time series to validate the regionalization obtained by pca according to pca a successful regionalization would be a classification into 3 groups so here we analysed a clustering of 2 3 and 4 regions i e a variation of 1 with respect to the pca result the spatial extent of the resulting clusters is shown in fig 4 and the coordinates of the spei series belonging to each cluster are detailed in the supplementary materials table s1 using the euclidean distance between clusters method table 2 the classification into 2 groups fig 4a is considered inadequate since the distance between both clusters in this configuration 26 76 is less than the distance between them 37 36 when grouped into 3 clusters fig 4b when clustering into 4 groups fig 4c the area representing cluster 1 in the 3 group division fig 4b is divided into clusters 1 and 4 while cluster 2 remains invariant to be accepted as a better classification the two distances cluster 1 and 4 with respect to cluster 2 should be greater than the distance between cluster 1 and 2 when grouped into 3 clusters since this is not true for the distance between clusters 2 and 4 35 41 37 36 the division into 4 clusters is rejected although not shown in this paper regionalization was also performed with ward s hierarchical clustering method wilks 2006 obtaining similar results based on these results in what follows we used the regionalization obtained with pca which divides mozambique into 3 homogeneous drought regions fig 3 in these 3 regions the hn index was 0 111 for the northern region 0 004 for the central region and 0 024 for the southern region thus both heterogeneity between clusters and homogeneity within clusters was guaranteed the spei series were averaged in each region 93 spei series on the north 110 on the south and 140 on the centre regions to use in the subsequent analysis fig 5 3 2 characterization of drought events run theory was adopted to characterize the drought events in the 3 regions previously determined table 3 a lower number of drought events but of longer duration and higher severity were found in the centre region on average drought events were less intense and severe in the north they occurred on average every 4 9 years in the north every 4 years in the south and every 5 9 years in the centre region the longest most intense and severest events began in 1982 1987 1991 1994 2005 2009 and 2016 and most of them affected all three regions 3 3 temporal variability and persistence of droughts the representative spei time series for each region are shown in fig 5 they are clearly non monotonic non stationary according to acf analysis autocorrelation function not shown here and trend stationary statistical significance level of 1 according to the kpss test the kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shin test the mk test z index and the r s analysis h index applied to the annual and monthly spei time series of the three homogeneous drought regions are presented in table 4 in all cases and regions the trends were negative illustrated in fig 5 although in the north region they were statistically non significant at a level of 5 for the annual spei in all cases the hurst index h was greater than 0 5 which suggests that the negative long term trends will persist in the near future in the south and centre regions the h values were higher suggesting that trends will persist with greater strength while long term trend persistence strength will be weak in the north region 3 4 identification of large scale climate drivers the cross correlations and lagged cross correlations between the proposed climate indices table 1 and the spei of the homogeneous drought regions are shown in table 5 the best correlations are shown in the top rows of the table the anomalies in the time series of the best correlated climate indices are shown in fig 6 most of the correlations were negative darwin niño 3 4 niño 3 niño 4 wtio and setio and only one was positive soi indicating they are anti phase or in phase respectively relative to the spei the north region persistently showed a poor correlation with the climate indices analysed while the strongest correlations were obtained in the south and centre regions in these two regions strong correlations with the different el niño indices were noticeable r up to 0 59 with the higher correlations being found for the el niño 4 and el niño 3 4 sst indices which showed crests around 2 3 months earlier than the negative peak of the spei another strong correlation r 0 58 with a similar time lag was found with the darwin slp index based on the above observations el niño 4 and darwin indices were chosen for the spectral analysis using the fft technique and cross wavelet analysis fft allowed us to appreciate the periodic behaviour of the monthly spei patterns in each homogeneous drought region and of darwin slp and niño 4 climatic indices the periodograms are set out in fig 7 the results showed that climatic indices and spei series have a periodicity associated with high energies between 40 and 120 months 3 5 and 10 years in the north region periods of between 35 and 60 months 3 and 5 years were found these periods are consistent and similar to those reported in other studies in africa oguntunde et al 2018 2017 the spectral analysis of the spei darwin slp and el niño 4 patterns was expanded using cross wavelet transform fig 8 both darwin slp and el niño 4 events showed strong impacts on the monthly series of spei especially in the south and centre regions indicating that they play a relevant role in the characteristics of the evolution of droughts in mozambique specifically the positive events of niño 4 show statistically significant negative links confidence level 95 with the monthly spei series of the south and centre regions with a signal of 16 128 months 1 3 10 7 years in the north region climatic indices did not show strong effects on the evolution of droughts something previously seen in the low correlations however the statistically significant strongest signals were found for 16 64 months 1 4 5 4 years over the entire study period in the three regions the energy density is higher in the periods where drought events were detected e g the major drought event of 1991 4 discussion the above results provide new insights into the spatial and temporal patterns of drought in mozambique and their relationship with the large scale climate variability the resulting drought regionalisation differs from other divisions created for other management purposes fews net moçambique 2014 ingc 2009 as shown in fig 3 the regions as defined also do not entirely coincide with those used by the mozambican government for water resources management aras although the spatial positioning patterns north centre and south are maintained the use of the proposed divisions as drought management areas would allow for more appropriate regional strategies for assessing monitoring and responding to drought wilhite et al 2000 the most important drought events identified in these regions have been listed and coincided with the major ones at the national level the trends observed in the spei series were consistent with the trends found for the spei input variables i e precipitation and temperature shown in fig 2b and c where trends were positive for temperature and negative for precipitation in addition these findings are in line with similar ones reported by jury 2013 who used satellite sensor data to analyse climate trends in southern africa and found that temperature and precipitation trends were positive and negative respectively over the period 1980 2010 in mozambique as a whole on the other hand the persistence analysis points to an increase in the incidence of droughts throughout the country although these results should be taken with caution due to the climate system complexity they further highlight the need for the development of drought forecasting tools and more specific in depth studies on drought variability in the homogeneous regions these results are consistent with those found at the continental level and in other regions of africa masih et al 2014 rouault and richard 2005 and with the variations seen in recent years on precipitation and temperature in mozambique jury 2013 uele et al 2017 relationships found between droughts and el niño 4 and el niño 3 4 sst indices agree with those described in manhique et al 2011 for southern africa and mozambique as a whole and in manatsa et al 2008a for the neighbouring tropical country of zimbabwe the strong climatic influence of the darwin slp index was also found by manatsa et al 2008b in zimbabwe other tropical regions of the world have also found el niño 4 and darwin to be drought triggers d arrigo and smerdon 2008 gu et al 2020 lyon and barnston 2005 so these and following results are also of hydrological interest for countries located in these climatic regions the periodic behaviour of the monthly spei patterns according to ftt match those reported in section 3 2 and coincide with the historical drought records documented in em dat 2020 and masih et al 2014 thus these results are of great importance as well as being novel for the region the periodicity found in the el niño 4 the same oscillation period was observed for darwin spl index is consistent with the widely accepted 3 7 year period mcphaden et al 1998 the results of the spectral analysis consistently point to an anti phase relationship between the drought events detected by spei and the climatic indices darwin slp and el niño 4 in the south and centre regions the north region showed a poor relationship with the climatic indicators in this region of the country drought events are less intense and severe although the number of events is higher this may be explained by the relationship between the temperate tropical depressions and enso this relationship affects the precipitation patterns in southeast africa making enso less influential in the north of mozambique and meaning that it is a wetter area than the rest of the country manhique et al 2011 these climate indices could be used in drought forecasting models as predictors of drought in mozambique with a lead time of 2 3 months based on the lagged correlations such a lead time would enable the establishment of preventive measures against possible upcoming droughts e g accumulating water in reservoirs prioritizing water use for different uses etc in this way a forecasting model could be employed to infer the probability and intensity of drought events in the short term future relying on past values of the climate indices hao et al 2018 and allowing actions to be implemented when a drought is expected 5 conclusions the main objective of this study was to investigate the spatio temporal characteristics of droughts and their relationships with possible predictors of the phenomenon in mozambique although mozambique is very prone to droughts and suffers continuously from their effects it does not have the necessary management tools to monitor and predict the phenomenon the proposed five step methodology consists of several methods organised in a coherent way for use in mozambique or in any other region country or river basin that requires a first assessment of the spatio temporal characteristics of droughts here efforts have been made to adapt the methodology specifically to mozambique where local meteorological and hydrological monitoring data are extremely limited the monthly spei 12 was calculated as an indicator of drought from 1950 to 2019 at a high resolution 0 5 principal component analysis with the varimax rotation method was used to define 3 homogeneous drought regions located in the north south and centre of the country this regionalization was validated with hierarchical and non hierarchical clustering methods the regions as delimited do not coincide entirely with those identified by the mozambican national directorate of water but are preferable for drought monitoring and management based on run theory the south and centre regions are the ones that have presented the most intense and severe drought events in the past a statistically significant trend towards a higher incidence of droughts was found in the three regions and rescale range analysis suggests that this trend might persist in the near future this section presented valuable information for mozambique on the temporal variability of droughts however given the limitations derived from the use of spei 12 it would be advisable to consider additional time scales in future studies to gain further insights into the temporal patterns of drought in each region strong correlations between two climatic indices el niño 4 enso and darwin slp and droughts were found in the south and centre regions with a time lag of 2 3 months these climate indices are representative drought triggers in tropical regions of the world such as mozambique with the fft technique it was found that the periods of spei and these two climate indices have a similar periodicity of between 3 and 8 years this being a novel statement with reference to mozambique spectral analysis by means of cross wavelet transform confirmed that spei and el niño 4 and darwin slp are strongly related in anti phase for periods between 1 4 and 10 4 years these climate indices could thus be used to develop a drought forecasting system providing sufficient lead time to establish prevention strategies in summary this study has provided an understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of droughts in mozambique the results are of great potential use for mozambique s regional water administrations towards developing drought contingency plans simplified management regions have been defined characterised and strongly related to potential drought predictors the proposed methodology can be used elsewhere in the world however given its limitations and the large number of topics it covers certain limitations will need to be considered in future studies credit authorship contribution statement this research is part of the phd thesis of araneda cabrera r both bermúdez m and puertas j

s and adjacent resorts shoreline waters dye tracer tests water quality δ15n macroalgal and δ15n and δ18o no3 measurements along with stable isotope mixing models were combined to assess water quality impairment caused by different onsite sewage disposal system osds types and used to predict water quality improvements from future management actions new hydrological insights for the region sewage indicators were highest within puakō s shoreline waters including enterococcus spp clostridium perfringens human associated bacteroides and δ15n no3 mixing model results using δ15n and δ18o no3 suggest that sewage was a dominant no3 source comprising 40 at 10 of the 16 shoreline stations δ15n macroalgae measurements confirmed presence of sewage at most stations in groundwater wells and at adjacent resorts shoreline waters sewage indicators were low and δ15no3 was indicative of soils and fertilizers puakō dye tracer tests revealed that sewage reached the shoreline within 5 h to 10 d and that osds type did not affect travel time water quality was similar in front of homes with different osds in conclusion sewage is entering the groundwater at puakō and the underlying geology rather

throughout the state today one area of concern in hawai i is the south kohala region on hawai i island this area has the largest contiguous coral reef in the state and is thought be impacted by land based pollution including sewage noaa 2016 puakō a coastal community in this region has some of the richest coral reefs in hawai i but their condition has been continually declining since the 1970s coral cover has decreased by 50 and macroalgal cover has increased by a similar percentage over this time period minton et al 2012 hdar 2013 it is thought in part that sewage pollution is contributing to the decline of the reef concerns over sewage pollution at puakō began in the 1960s schott 2010 as a result in 1990 puakō was designated as a critical wastewater disposal area by hawai i county these are areas where the disposal of sewage has or may cause adverse effects on human health or the environment due to existing hydrogeological conditions as a result homeowners building new homes or renovating existing ones are required to install septic tanks with a surface elevation that is only 1 5 m above mean sea level osds and their drainage fields are in close proximity to groundwater since 2014 researchers have been working to document the presence of sewage pollution along puakō s shoreline its transport offshore and contact with the coral reef and possible effects on reef condition couch et al 2014 yoshioka et al 2016 abaya et al 2018a 2018b aguiar 2020 as part of this ongoing effort puakō community members wanted to know if sewage pollution in their nearshore waters was from their homes or from adjacent resort developments or upslope residential communities this information is critical for management decisions being considered by the puakō community for reducing sewage pollution in their nearshore waters alternatives to cesspools and septic tanks under consideration are converting all cesspools to atus or connecting to an existing nearby stp or building one within their community aqua engineering 2015 the goals of this study were to 1 identify the location within the puakō watershed where sewage was entering into the groundwater using biological and chemical sewage indicators 2 determine the source of fecal indicator bacteria fib and nitrate no3 through microbial source tracking mst and stable isotopes of nitrate using mixing models respectively 3 quantify water quality impairment caused by homes with osds through dye tracer studies and measurements of sewage indicators and 4 assess whether proposed sewage treatment upgrades are sufficient for meeting state water quality standards this information is critical for puakō to help guide their decision regarding upgrading sewage collection treatment and disposal approaches and results from this project provide a roadmap for future projects dealing with sewage pollution in nearshore waters throughout hawai i state and other coastal communities worldwide 2 methods 2 1 site description

a check standard 2 3 4 macroalgal tissue δ15n at the time of water sample collection the most abundant macroalgae species were sampled 5 g at all shoreline stations and analyzed for δ15n the number of macroalgal species collected varied with station at puakō ulva fasciata 23 occurrences cladophora spp 28 occurrences and gelidiella acerosa 28 occurrences were collected plus 10 unknown species at the resort shoreline stations ulva spp 9 occurrences pterocladiella spp 9 occurrences and turf algae 9 occurrences were collected macroalgal tissues were placed on ice during transport to the laboratory where tissues were rinsed with deionized water subsamples of macroalgal tissue were preserved as voucher specimens and identified to the lowest taxonomic resolution using an olympustm ch30 microscope abbott 1999 abbott and huisman 2004 the remaining portions of the samples were dried at 60 c until a constant weight was achieved ground and homogenized using a wig l bug grinding mill and 2 mg of the macroalgal tissue were folded in 4 6 mm tin capsules for stable isotope analysis because a common macroalgal species was not found at all stations and the number of species identified at each station varied we collected tissues from all species present and compiled them into a composite sample where their tissues were ground together macroalgal tissues were analyzed for δ15n using a thermo

relative to δ15n source values to determine their n sources derse et al 2007 wiegner et al 2016 abaya et al 2018a 2 4 dye tracer study dye tracer studies were conducted to determine the hydrological connection of cesspools septic tanks and atus to nearshore waters ten homes were identified four with cesspools three with septic tanks and three with atus within the puakō community fig 1 a known concentration of fluorescein a non toxic organic dye was administered to the osds over 10 h each hour 50 or 100 g of dye were mixed with 20 l of tap water and slowly added to the osds additional tap water was added as needed and its volume recorded to calculate initial dye concentration cesspool data are from an earlier study abaya et al 2018a and these data are incorporated into the water quality impairment and improvement analysis see section 2 7 3 six shoreline stations in front of each home 60 70 m were sampled for the presence of dye these stations represented groundwater springs with varying salinity and two background stations with higher salinity and no apparent freshwater input water samples were collected at each station before and during the dye tracer study in opaque brown high density polyethylene bottles to prevent photo degradation pre rinsed with sample water and stored at 4 c until analysis during the first 12 h of the dye study samples were collected every two h to identify any fast flow pathways afterwards two samples were collected at each station within an hour of the lowest low tide each day for up to 14 d to quantify the concentration of fluorescein samples were brought to room temperature filtered gf f whatmantm and analyzed using a turner au10 fluorometer in the dark fluorescein standards were made by dilution from a 100 000 ppb stock solution to 10 200 ppb the detection limit for our analysis was 0 95 ppb usepa 2011 when salinity was not measured in the field conductivity of samples was measured in the laboratory orion star and converted to pss 78 salinity unesco 1981 water and macroalgae samples were also collected in front of the homes to assess water quality conditions stations were determined based on where dye emerged at springs water samples were collected from a single station in front of each home three times water samples were analyzed for fib nutrients and stable isotopes of no3 macroalgae were analyzed for δ15n 2 5 data analyses 2 5 1 statistical analyses to determine if fib nutrients and δ15n and δ18o no3 values differed among watershed locations and shoreline regions in puakō fig 1 one way analysis of variance anova tests were used for each variable two sample t tests were used to compare differences among these parameters between the north and south resorts data were tested for normality and equal variances if assumptions were not met for parametric analyses log transformations were used all statistical analyses were conducted using minitab17 2010 with α 0 05 2 5 2 siar mixing models to determine the relative percent contributions of different n sources to no3 pools among and within watershed locations we used each water types δ15n and δ18o no3 values along with δ15n and δ18o no3 from n sources and analyzed them in a mixing model stable isotope analysis in r siar v 4 0 note two isotopes are required for the model to run our primary isotope of interest was δ15n the first step in this analysis was to visualize the stable isotope data for samples relative to values for the sources to do this bi plots of δ 15n and δ 18o no3 were created graphing averages for each station relative to averages for all potential no3 sources data not shown these figures were used to decide on which sources to include in siar mixing models this analysis also allowed us to determine if different sources have overlapping stable isotope values if there is overlap it is harder to distinguish each source s contribution to a sample from one another in the modeling effort based on this analysis we decided to include sewage groundwater and kiawe fertilized soil in the mixing models ocean water was not included as a no3 source as its no3 concentrations were below detection limits for stable isotope analysis 2 µmol l coplen et al 2012 and therefore considered to be negligible two mixing models were executed the first model examined potential no3 sources to mid elevation groundwater wells low elevation groundwater wells puakō s anchialine ponds the resorts shoreline waters and puakō s shoreline waters in this model data from all stations within a water type were averaged and station differences within water types were not examined the second model then examined potential no3 sources to puakō s and the resorts shoreline stations this analysis was done to identify any shoreline sewage pollution hot spots the siar mixing model uses a bayesian framework which takes into account natural variability and uncertainty within a system by allowing multiple sources of uncertainty to be incorporated parnell et al 2010 the shapiro wilk test was used to verify the normality of the isotope data for the three no3 sources and these data were normal relative percent contributions are reported as 50 bayesian credibility intervals allowing a wider range of variability to be reported 2 5 3 quantifying water quality impairment from osds dye concentration vs time data were used to calculate flow rate and travel time of the dye between the osds and the ocean to determine if fib nutrients stable isotopes of no3 and δ15n macroalgal tissue differed in front of homes with different osds types a one way anova was used a mixing model in siar was used to partition potential no3 sources in front of homes with different types of osds in addition we calculated water quality improvement with regards to fib at the shoreline that will occur by switching from the current distribution of osds to all atus or a stp a mixing model was used to estimate the fraction of fib enterococcus spp and c perfringens from sewage in groundwater sampled at shoreline springs and predict improvements in fib concentration that would occur by upgrading cesspools of the three end member sources of spring water considered sewage groundwater and seawater sewage is the dominant source of fib with concentrations more than two orders of magnitude greater than the other sources based on end member fib concentrations measured in this and earlier studies abaya et al 2018a 2018b assuming sources other than sewage are negligible at contributing fib to the spring water we simplified the model so that fib concentrations at the spring ct are solely derived from sewage either cesspools septic systems or atus 1 fcr 1 f ecr ct in this equation f is the fraction of cesspools in the neighborhood cr is the fib concentration in raw sewage and e is the fraction of fib remaining after treatment by septic systems and atus at puakō osds are 44 cesspools 48 septic systems and 8 atus aqua engineering 2015 septic tanks decrease enterococcus spp and c perfringens by 50 and 68 respectively based on published studies chauret et al 1999 withers et al 2011 since no published information regarding the effectiveness of atus removing fib was found we assumed the same reduction as septic systems this assumption may underestimate fib reduction in atus as residence time and concentration of oxygen can differ between atus and septic tanks oxygen can affect the survival of fib differentially as enterococcus spp can survive in aerobic conditions while c perfringens is an obligate anaerobe by converting all cesspools to septic systems or atus the new concentration at a spring would be ct ecr the percent reduction of fib at the spring was then calculated as r ct ct ct combining these with eq 1 the percent reduction of fib at the spring is simplified to 2 r 1 e f 1 f e the predicted spring concentration after transition away from cesspools was calculated as ct ct 1 r in addition to assuming sewage is the only source of fib to spring water this model assumes that different sewage sources are well mixed before groundwater discharge at springs e g hydrodynamic dispersion by tides and that the fraction of sewage in the spring water does not change after upgrades so while the fib concentration may decrease other components of sewage like nutrients may or may not change depending on how the osds treats that component of the sewage 3 results 3 1 fib enterococcus spp concentrations significantly differed among watershed locations p 0 0001 table 1 but were similar among puakō s shoreline regions puakō s anchialine ponds had enterococcus spp concentrations that were an order of magnitude higher range 324 19 018 mpn 100 ml compared to other watershed locations fig 2a table 1 puakō s shoreline waters and the low elevation wells had the second highest enterococcus spp concentrations 0 7985 mpn 100 ml mid and high elevation wells as well as shoreline waters at the resorts had similar concentrations and they were the lowest of all the watershed locations sampled 0 147 mpn 100 ml 4 out of 34 samples were above 35 mpn 100 ml in comparison to enterococcus spp c perfringens was rarely detected at the different watershed locations fig 2b table 1 in fact it was only detected in puakō s anchialine ponds and shoreline waters 0 90 cfu 100 ml 39 of 141 samples were above 5 cfu 100 ml table 1 like c perfringens human associated bacteroides hf183 and bachum markers were only detected in puakō s anchialine ponds and shoreline waters fig 2c table 1 3 2 nutrients nutrient concentrations tended to be higher in inland waters wells anchialine ponds and were lower at the shoreline table 2 this pattern was observed for no3 no2 and h4sio4 table 2 for nh4 tdn and po4 3 concentrations were generally similar among watershed locations with the exception of resorts shoreline waters being lower than one of the well water locations table 2 along puakō s shoreline the southern and middle regions had the highest nutrient concentrations with respect to no3 no2 nh4 tdn and po4 3 p 0 0001 in contrast h4sio4 concentrations were similar among puakō s shoreline regions nutrient concentrations and salinity were similar between the northern and southern resorts 3 3 δ 15n in macroalgae δ 15n macroalgal values were highest in south puakō compared to the middle and northern regions fig 3 p 0 0001 seven stations along puakō s shoreline had δ 15n macroalgal values 7 or greater which is considered to be within the range of values measured for sewage reviewed in wiegner et al 2016 at the northern and southern resorts δ 15n macroalgal tissue values were similar to each other and lower than those observed at many of the puakō shoreline stations fig 3 values at the resorts were indicative of no3 from upper and lower elevational wells well fertilized soils and ones under kiawe trees and ocean water fig 3 3 4 siar mixing models sewage contributions to the no3 pool varied among watershed locations fig 4 table 3 puakō s anchialine ponds had the largest sewage contribution to the no3 pool 36 55 followed by puakō s shoreline waters 23 26 resort shoreline waters 12 17 low elevational groundwater wells 9 20 and mid elevational groundwater wells 1 4 along puakō s shoreline ten stations had sewage contributing up to 40 or more high end of the range to the shoreline no3 all stations were located in south 6 stations and north 4 stations puakō 3 5 quantifying water quality impairment caused by osds dye was observed flowing out of shoreline springs during five of the six dye tracer tests groundwater flow rates ranged from 3 to 137 m d allowing dye to reach the shoreline between 5 h and 11 d the type of osds septic tank vs atu did not affect how fast dye reached the shoreline with atus having both the slowest and fastest flow rates in general dye appeared at the shoreline sooner in front of homes with drainage fields closer to the shoreline the only dye tracer test where dye was not observed at the shoreline was from a septic system farthest landward here the drainage field was 122 m from the shoreline at the other five homes this averaged 40 m additionally this home was located in the northern part of the neighborhood where fewer groundwater springs have been observed we may have missed the spring where the dye emerged adsorption of the dye to organic matter in the septic tank may have been greater than we anticipated or we did not sample long enough to capture the dye emerging from the spring after 16 d flow rate of 8 m d concentrations of fib and nutrients were similar in front of homes with different osds fig 5 the average enterococcus spp concentration in front of homes with different osds all exceeded the hdoh statistical threshold value fig 5 a with concentrations ranging from 0 to 34 330 mpn 100 ml similarly c perfringens concentrations in front of the homes with different osds encompassed the standard recommended to hdoh for marine recreational waters of 5 cfu 100 ml fujioka et al 1997 but they ranged from 0 to 27 cfu 100 ml and were not higher than the range reported for non point source sewage pollution of 10 100 cfu 100 ml fig 5b fung et al 2007 δ15n in macroalgae was similar in front of homes with the different osds fig 6 they were all within the reported sewage range for puakō nutrient concentrations in front of dye tracer test homes were high average tdn concentrations exceeded 100 µmol l fig 5c with no3 no2 comprising most of the tdn average tdp concentrations were all greater than 3 µmol l fig 5c with po4 3 comprising most of the tdp h4sio4 concentrations did differ in front of these homes but this difference was most likely from salinity as h4sio4 is an indicator for fresh groundwater data not shown proportional contributions of sewage to the no3 pool in front of homes with different osds types varied fig 6 sewage comprised 25 35 of the no3 in front of homes with cesspools 41 49 in front of homes with septic tanks and 12 23 in front of homes with atus fig 6 3 6 assessing proposed sewage treatment upgrades conversion of the entire puakō neighborhood to atus would reduce average enterococcus spp and c perfringens concentrations at the shoreline by 30 and 48 respectively appendix table a2 this reduction is dependent on the number of cesspools converted and the efficiency of atus to remove fib for enterococcus spp this transition would reduce the percent of stations that exceed the hdoh statistical threshold value from 81 to 69 for c perfringens the reduction is greater with atus with only one station exceeding the recommended marine standard of 5 cfu 100 ml fujioka et al 1997 these reductions could be greater if the atus used are more effective at removing fib than estimated in our calculations 50 for enterococcus spp 68 for c perfringens a stp would reduce fib concentrations well below the hdoh standards by specifically targeting the removal of fib with chlorine ozone or ultraviolet treatment 4 discussion 4 1 source of sewage to groundwater this study successfully used a variety of biological and chemical sewage indicators to determine locations in puakō s watershed where sewage was entering into groundwater this information is critical for appropriate management actions to be determined and implemented in targeted locations fib concentrations were generally low in puakō s upper watershed and in the adjacent resorts shoreline waters and only substantially increased or exceeded hdoh standards in puakō s anchialine ponds wells and shoreline waters this was observed for both enterococcus spp and c perfringens enterococcus spp concentrations in puakō s anchialine ponds wells and shoreline waters consistently exceeded the hdoh statistical threshold standard of 130 mpn 100 ml hdoh 2014 epidemiological studies have shown that a swimmer s chance of contracting gastroenteritis is 3 6 at enterococcus spp concentrations of 35 mpn 100 ml reviewed in fujioka et al 2015 our results suggest that swimmers along the puakō shoreline are at an even greater risk of contracting gastroenteritis all upper and mid elevation wells and resorts shoreline waters had enterococcus spp concentrations below 35 mpn 100 ml likewise c perfringens concentrations consistently exceeded the recommended standard to hdoh of 5 cfu 100 ml for marine recreational waters fujioka et al 1997 in all of the anchialine ponds sampled at puakō as well as some of the puakō s shoreline stations these c perfringens concentrations were all within the range reported for non point source sewage pollution fung et al 2007 additionally mst markers specifically developed to detect bacteroides bacteria originating from the human gut hf183 and bachum were only detected in puakō s anchialine ponds and shoreline waters note that while we did not have human bacteroides measurements from the resorts shoreline waters our interpretation would not have changed as the enterococcus spp and c perfringens concentrations were very low and indicative of low sewage contamination table 1 and fig 2 additionally a linear relationship between hf183 and bachum concentrations with risk of contracting gastroenteritis has been established boehm et al 2015 using these equations the risk of contracting gastroenteritis in puakō s anchialine ponds and shoreline waters ranges from 0 to 43 with the risk being less than 1 most of the time fig 2c note raw sewage has average values log10 3 4 sd 0 1 and 5 5 0 1 copies 100 ml for hf183 and bachum respectively shanks et al 2010 which are an order of magnitude higher than average values found at puakō table 1 also the risk of contracting gastroenteritis could be greater than predicted by the boehm et al 2015 model as hf183 and bachum bacteria markers decay in the environment faster than human associated viral markers ahmed et al 2019 together all of these fib measurements illustrate that sewage is primarily entering the groundwater at puakō and not within the upper watershed or at the adjacent resorts and that there are likely health risks to swimming in these shoreline waters while fib concentrations are used to determine if sewage is present and at levels that could pose a health threat to recreational water users they do not provide information on the relative contribution of sewage to measured pollution levels one approach that has successfully overcome this limitation is the combined use of stable isotopes of nitrate δ 15n and δ 18o and mixing models wiegner et al 2016 we utilized this approach to determine the percent contribution of sewage to the no3 pool at different locations within puakō s watershed we found that sewage contributions to the no3 pool varied among watershed locations sewage comprised the largest percentage of no3 in puakō s anchialine ponds 36 55 and shoreline waters 23 26 the two locations with the highest fib concentrations sewage comprised a lower percentage of the no3 pool at the resorts shoreline waters 12 17 low elevation groundwater wells 9 20 and mid elevation groundwater wells 1 4 these findings support conclusions from the fib measurements that sewage is entering into the groundwater at puakō in puakō s effort to transition away from cesspools and septic tanks determining hotspots of sewage pollution along its shoreline is critical for prioritizing removal locations the region that consistently had the highest sewage indicator values was south puakō here nutrient concentrations were highest δ 15n in macroalgal tissue and no3 were the most reflective of sewage pollution and mixing models suggest that up to 52 of the no3 is comprised of sewage two stations 3 and 4 within south puakō were previously identified as sewage pollution hotspots abaya et al 2018a there is also substantial evidence that sewage is present at other locations along the shoreline mixing models suggest that sewage comprised more than 40 of the no3 at four stations in north puakō also concentrations of all fib enterococcus spp c perfringens and human associated bacteroides were similar among puakō s three regions additionally it is likely that δ 15n macroalgal tissue values were underestimated due to increased n isotope discrimination up to 6 under high no3 concentrations 10 μmol l fujita 1985 swart et al 2014 if the δ 15n macroalgal values are adjusted for this discrimination then algal shoreline values fall within the range reported for sewage 7 reviewed in wiegner et al 2016 the pervasive presence of sewage along puakō s shoreline is likely a result of all homes using osds in an area with permeable basalt a high water table and substantial sgd similar h4sio4 concentrations among puakō s shoreline regions substantiates the ubiquitous presence of sgd in the nearshore waters which carries sewage from the osds to shoreline springs 4 2 differences among osds types dye tracer studies provide irrefutable evidence that sewage from osds and stp is entering and contaminating water bodies hdoh 1984 yates 1985 glenn et al 2013 previous dye tracer studies at puakō demonstrated that sewage from cesspools reached the shoreline within 9 h to 3 d 4 76 m d abaya et al 2018a our current study expands these findings by including results from septic tanks and atus with sewage travel times from 5 h to 11 d 3 137 m d the type of osds cesspool vs septic tank vs atu or the presence of a leach field did not affect how fast dye reached the shoreline in general dye appeared at the shoreline from homes with drainage fields closer to the shoreline sooner than those further away the fastest flow rates in this study likely occurred where the leach field was built directly atop a highly fractured portion of the underlying lava flow these fractures transport sewage to shoreline springs slower flow rates were likely in regions with fewer or smaller fractures in the basalt or a greater thicknesses of soil fill between the drainage field and the shoreline this information is essential for the puakō community as it will be used to decide which alternative to cesspools will be pursued to reduce or eliminate sewage from puakō s nearshore waters water quality was also similar in front of homes with different osds types and values for parameters were suggestive of the presence of sewage enterococcus spp concentrations consistently exceeded the hdoh statistical threshold value of 130 mpn 100 ml with some measurements as high as 34 330 mpn 100 ml c perfringens concentrations encompassed the standard recommended to hdoh for marine recreational waters of 5 cfu 100 ml fujioka et al 1997 but were not higher than the range reported for non point sewage pollution of 10 100 cfu 100 ml fig 5b fung et al 2007 δ15n macroalgal values were all within the reported range for sewage at puakō fig 6 abaya et al 2018a nutrient concentrations were high with no3 comprising the majority of the tdn concentrations which exceeded 100 µmol l results from the siar mixing model suggest that sewage was a substantial component of the shoreline no3 pool in front of homes with different osds ranging from 12 to 49 fig 7 these findings suggest that regardless of the type of osds used by homes in puakō shoreline waters fronting these homes are contaminated with sewage any differences in these parameters that may exist in the sewage effluent of different osds is lost by the time the sewage reaches the shoreline because of dispersion and tidal mixing of groundwater before discharge at the shoreline 4 3 proposed sewage treatment improvements most homes at puakō use cesspools and septic tanks to dispose of their sewage cesspools are underground pits used for temporary storage of sewage while septic tanks are underground chambers where solids settle out before the effluent drains into a leach field beyond removing solids neither system treats sewage septic systems rely on a thick layer of soil below the leach field for microbial breakdown of sewage before it reaches groundwater but this is absent at puakō where the groundwater is close to the land surface and the substrate is highly permeable fractured basalt instead of soil hence three alternatives to cesspools have been proposed for sewage disposal and treatment in puakō they include 1 converting all cesspools to atus 2 connecting to the existing nearby mauna lani stp or 3 building a stp within puakō each of these solutions treats sewage differently and will have a different outcome for future nearshore water quality at puakō atu systems collect sewage into an underground container like septic tanks where solids settle out however atus have additional treatment beyond the settling out of the solids whereas septic tanks do not the type of additional treatment that occurs within an atu varies with models and brands but can include a disinfection component as well as nutrient removal the type of atu proposed for puakō cycles between aerobic anaerobic anoxic and decanting stages aqua engineering 2015 this treatment cycle removes organic pollutants and nutrients our calculations based on our water quality measurements stable isotope mixing models and published information on the atu proposed for puakō suggests that conversion of the entire neighborhood to atus would reduce average enterococcus spp and c perfringens concentrations at the shoreline by 48 for enterococcus spp this transition would reduce the percent of stations that exceed the hdoh statistical threshold value from 81 to 69 for c perfringens the reduction is greater with only one station exceeding the recommended marine standard of 5 cfu 100 ml fujioka et al 1997 transporting sewage from homes at puakō to a stp is the other option under consideration one alternative will transport sewage to the mauna lani stp fig 1 at this plant sewage passes through bar screens and an aerated grit chamber before entering two aerated lagoons mauna lani stp inc 2006 at the time of this study lagoon water was chlorinated and then used for irrigation on a sod farm on the mauna lani property mauna lani stp inc 2006 the other alternative is for puakō to build an onsite stp this plant would contain a screening system secondary treatment tanks and clarifiers sand filters and a uv disinfection system and would have the capability of producing r 1 quality water which could be used for irrigation hdoh 2002 aqua engineering 2015 crops irrigated with the r 1 water can reduce the amount of water percolating down to the aquifer and further reduce any remaining nutrients in the water aqua engineering 2015 with either stp option sewage from puakō would be completely removed from puakō s groundwater as it will enter into a sewer system at puakō this would mean that water now discharging at shoreline seeps would only be a mixture of groundwater and seawater however if the mauna lani stp is the alternative selected sewage that has not undergone pathogen or nutrient removal would still be transported via sgd to the nearshore waters of the puakō mauna lani reef as of 2017 the end of our study the mauna lani stp stopped chlorinating lagoon water and now dispose of it via two on site injection wells the injection wells are located just upslope from the southern portion of the puakō community this is potentially concerning for coral reefs in the area as sewage disposed of via injection wells have resulted in tremendous economic and ecological damage on the island of maui van beukering and cesar 2004 smith et al 2005 the use of injection wells as a means of sewage disposal was reviewed by the u s supreme court 04 23 2020 as a result of the coral reef and water quality conditions in maui maui county v hawai i wildlife fund sierra club maui group surfrider foundation west maui preservation association 2019 the u s supreme court ruled that the clean water act requires that sewage injection wells have permits to discharge their effluent if it reaches navigable waters like the ocean through groundwater 5 conclusions use of multiple biological and chemical sewage indicators allowed us to successfully identify where sewage was entering into puakō s watershed groundwater sewage indicator values were greatest within puakō and sewage quickly reached shoreline waters 5 h 10 d sewage travel time to puakō s shoreline and water quality in front of homes was similar among all osds types these results suggest that the underlying geology on each property is more important in affecting the travel time of the sewage to the shoreline than the osds type our assessment of water quality impairment caused by osds revealed that if all cesspools and septic tanks were converted to atus across the entire puakō neighborhood fib concentrations would be reduced but not to acceptable concentrations if sewage is treated and disposed of through a stp sewage would be completely removed from puakō s groundwater from a water quality standpoint both in regards to human and coral reef health puakō building its own stp would be best it will have a higher level of treatment than currently used at the mauna lani stp the plant will also convert the sewage into r 1 quality water which could be used to irrigate crops that can further reduce any remaining nutrients in the water rather than disposing of it through an injection well hdoh 2002 aqua engineering 2015 in conclusion this study s approach can be adapted to other locations with sewage pollution to identify the location that sewage is entering into the groundwater and to assess potential management actions to improve water quality credit authorship contribution statement tracy n wiegner conceptualization data curation

8099,study region puakō hawai i island study focus locations of sewage pollution in the puakō watershed were identified through measurements of sewage indicators at groundwater wells and within puakō s and adjacent resorts shoreline waters dye tracer tests water quality δ15n macroalgal and δ15n and δ18o no3 measurements along with stable isotope mixing models were combined to assess water quality impairment caused by different onsite sewage disposal system osds types and used to predict water quality improvements from future management actions new hydrological insights for the region sewage indicators were highest within puakō s shoreline waters including enterococcus spp clostridium perfringens human associated bacteroides and δ15n no3 mixing model results using δ15n and δ18o no3 suggest that sewage was a dominant no3 source comprising 40 at 10 of the 16 shoreline stations δ15n macroalgae measurements confirmed presence of sewage at most stations in groundwater wells and at adjacent resorts shoreline waters sewage indicators were low and δ15no3 was indicative of soils and fertilizers puakō dye tracer tests revealed that sewage reached the shoreline within 5 h to 10 d and that osds type did not affect travel time water quality was similar in front of homes with different osds in conclusion sewage is entering the groundwater at puakō and the underlying geology rather

systems osds like cesspools septic tanks and aerobic treatment units atus osds are commonly used in rural areas and are more widely used in hawai i than any other state in the country hdoh 2015 hawai i department of health hdoh estimates that there are presently 110 000 osds statewide with 49 000 classified as cesspools on hawai i island whittier and el kadi 2014 in 2015 hdoh banned construction of new cesspools due to concerns about threats to human and coral reef health it was the last state to do so following rhode island who banned them in 1968 hdoh 2015 in 2017 hawai i state passed legislation to replace all cesspools by 2050 hdoh 2017 with sea level rise it is anticipated that the frequency and magnitude of sewage pollution water quality issues will increase as more osds become inundated elmir 2018 mckenzie et al 2021 sewage pollution is a chronic environmental problem in hawai i first documented in kāneʻohe bay o ahu in 1951 smith et al 1981 and it is an ongoing issue throughout the state today one area of concern in hawai i is the south kohala region on hawai i island this area has the largest contiguous coral reef in the state and is thought be impacted by land based pollution including sewage noaa 2016 puakō a coastal community in this region has some of the richest coral reefs in hawai i but their condition has been continually declining since the 1970s coral cover has decreased by 50 and macroalgal cover has increased by a similar percentage over this time period minton et al 2012 hdar 2013 it is thought in part that sewage pollution is contributing to the decline of the reef concerns over sewage pollution at puakō began in the 1960s schott 2010 as a result in 1990 puakō was designated as a critical wastewater disposal area by hawai i county these are areas where the disposal of sewage has or may cause adverse effects on human health or the environment due to existing hydrogeological conditions as a result homeowners building new homes or renovating existing ones are required to install septic tanks with a surface elevation that is only 1 5 m above mean sea level osds and their drainage fields are in close proximity to groundwater since 2014 researchers have been working to document the presence of sewage pollution along puakō s shoreline its transport offshore and contact with the coral reef and possible effects on reef condition couch et al 2014 yoshioka et al 2016 abaya et al 2018a 2018b aguiar 2020 as part of this ongoing effort puakō community members wanted to know if sewage pollution in their nearshore waters was from their homes or from adjacent resort developments or upslope residential communities this information is critical for management decisions being considered by the puakō community for reducing sewage pollution in their nearshore waters alternatives to cesspools and septic tanks under consideration are converting all cesspools to atus or connecting to an existing nearby stp or building one within their community aqua engineering 2015 the goals of this study were to 1 identify the location within the puakō watershed where sewage was entering into the groundwater using biological and chemical sewage indicators 2 determine the source of fecal indicator bacteria fib and nitrate no3 through microbial source tracking mst and stable isotopes of nitrate using mixing models respectively 3 quantify water quality impairment caused by homes with osds through dye tracer studies and measurements of sewage indicators and 4 assess whether proposed sewage treatment upgrades are sufficient for meeting state water quality standards this information is critical for puakō to help guide their decision regarding upgrading sewage collection treatment and disposal approaches and results from this project provide a roadmap for future projects dealing with sewage pollution in nearshore waters throughout hawai i state and other coastal communities worldwide 2 methods 2 1 site description

manually at 500 relative fluorescence units note other bacteroides markers are available for non human animals however for this study we chose to solely use the human associated markers as we wanted to address the sewage pollution issue relative to osds additionally this is a residential neighborhood where other bacteroides sources would be minimal while there are some wild pigs and goats it would take much longer for bacteria from their feces to reach the water table at puakō as it is very dry especially in comparison to the osds where many of them are situated within the water table 2 3

abbott 1999 abbott and huisman 2004 the remaining portions of the samples were dried at 60 c until a constant weight was achieved ground and homogenized using a wig l bug grinding mill and 2 mg of the macroalgal tissue were folded in 4 6 mm tin capsules for stable isotope analysis because a common macroalgal species was not found at all stations and the number of species identified at each station

connection of cesspools septic tanks and atus to nearshore waters ten homes were identified four with cesspools three with septic tanks and three with atus within the puakō community fig 1 a known concentration of fluorescein a non toxic organic dye was administered to the osds over 10 h each hour 50 or 100 g of dye were mixed with 20 l of tap water and slowly added to the osds additional tap water was added as needed and its volume recorded to calculate initial dye concentration cesspool data are from an earlier study abaya et al 2018a and these data are incorporated into the water quality impairment and improvement analysis see section 2 7 3 six shoreline stations in front of each home 60 70 m were sampled for the presence of dye these stations represented groundwater springs with varying salinity and two background stations with higher salinity and no apparent freshwater input water samples were collected at each station before and during the dye tracer study in opaque brown high density polyethylene bottles to prevent photo degradation pre rinsed with sample water and stored at 4 c until analysis during the first 12 h of the dye study samples were collected every two h to identify any fast flow pathways afterwards two samples were collected at each station within an hour of the lowest low tide each day for up to 14 d to quantify the concentration of fluorescein samples were brought to room temperature filtered gf f whatmantm and analyzed using a turner au10 fluorometer in the dark fluorescein standards were made by dilution from a 100 000 ppb stock solution to 10 200 ppb the detection limit for our analysis was 0 95 ppb usepa 2011 when salinity was not measured in the field conductivity of samples was measured in the laboratory orion star and converted to pss 78 salinity unesco 1981 water and macroalgae samples were also collected in front of the homes to assess water quality conditions stations were determined based on where dye emerged at springs water samples were collected from a single station in front of each home three times water samples were analyzed for fib nutrients and stable isotopes of no3 macroalgae were analyzed for δ15n 2 5 data analyses 2 5 1 statistical analyses to determine if fib nutrients and δ15n and δ18o no3 values differed among watershed locations and shoreline regions in puakō fig 1 one way analysis of variance anova tests were used for each variable two sample t tests were used to compare differences among these parameters between the north and south resorts data were tested for normality and equal variances if assumptions were not met for parametric analyses log transformations were used all statistical analyses were conducted using minitab17 2010 with α 0 05 2 5 2 siar mixing models to determine the relative percent contributions of different n sources to no3 pools among and within watershed locations we used each water types δ15n and δ18o no3 values along with δ15n and δ18o no3 from n sources and analyzed them in a mixing model stable isotope analysis in r siar v 4 0 note two isotopes are required for the model to run our primary isotope of interest was δ15n the first step in this analysis was to visualize the stable isotope data for samples relative to values for the sources to do this bi plots of δ 15n and δ 18o no3 were created graphing averages for each station relative to averages for all potential no3 sources data not shown these figures were used to decide on which sources to include in siar mixing models this analysis also allowed us to determine if different sources have overlapping stable isotope values if there is overlap it is harder to distinguish each source s contribution to a sample from one another in the modeling effort based on this analysis we decided to include sewage groundwater and kiawe fertilized soil in the mixing models ocean water was not included as a no3 source as its no3 concentrations were below detection limits for stable isotope analysis 2 µmol l coplen et al 2012 and therefore considered to be negligible two mixing models were executed the first model examined potential no3 sources to mid elevation groundwater wells low elevation groundwater wells puakō s anchialine ponds the resorts shoreline waters and puakō s shoreline waters in this model data from all stations within a water type were averaged and station differences within water types were not examined the second model then examined potential no3 sources to puakō s and the resorts shoreline stations this analysis was done to identify any shoreline sewage pollution hot spots the siar mixing model uses a bayesian framework which takes into account natural variability and uncertainty within a system by allowing multiple sources of uncertainty to be incorporated parnell et al 2010 the shapiro wilk test was used to verify the normality of the isotope data for the three no3 sources and these data were normal relative percent contributions are reported as 50 bayesian credibility intervals allowing a wider range of variability to be reported 2 5 3 quantifying water quality impairment from osds dye concentration vs time data were used to calculate flow rate and travel time of the dye between the osds and the ocean to determine if fib nutrients stable isotopes of no3 and δ15n macroalgal tissue differed in front of homes with different osds types a one way anova was used a mixing model in siar was used to partition potential no3 sources in front of homes with different types of osds in addition we calculated water quality improvement with regards to fib at the shoreline that will occur by switching from the current distribution of osds to all atus or a stp a mixing model was used to estimate the fraction of fib enterococcus spp and c perfringens from sewage in groundwater sampled at shoreline springs and predict improvements in fib concentration that would occur by upgrading cesspools of the three end member sources of spring water considered sewage groundwater and seawater sewage is the dominant source of fib with concentrations more than two orders of magnitude greater than the other sources based on end member fib concentrations measured in this and earlier studies abaya et al 2018a 2018b assuming sources other than sewage are negligible at contributing fib to the spring water we simplified the model so that fib concentrations at the spring ct are solely derived from sewage either cesspools septic systems or atus 1 fcr 1 f ecr ct in this equation f is the fraction of cesspools in the neighborhood cr is the fib concentration in raw sewage and e is the fraction of fib remaining after treatment by septic systems and atus at puakō osds are 44 cesspools 48 septic systems and 8 atus aqua engineering 2015 septic tanks decrease enterococcus spp and c perfringens by 50 and 68 respectively based on published studies chauret et al 1999 withers et al 2011 since no published information regarding the effectiveness of atus removing fib was found we assumed the same reduction as septic systems this assumption may underestimate fib reduction in atus as residence time and concentration of oxygen can differ between atus and septic tanks oxygen can affect the survival of fib differentially as enterococcus spp can survive in aerobic conditions while c perfringens is an obligate anaerobe by converting all cesspools to septic systems or atus the new concentration at a spring would be ct ecr the percent reduction of fib at the spring was then calculated as r ct ct ct combining these with eq 1 the percent reduction of fib at the spring is simplified to 2 r 1 e f 1 f e the predicted spring concentration after transition away from cesspools was calculated as ct ct 1 r in addition to assuming sewage is the only source of fib to spring water this model assumes that different sewage sources are well mixed before groundwater discharge at springs e g hydrodynamic dispersion by tides and that the fraction of sewage in the spring water does not change after upgrades so while the fib concentration may decrease other components of sewage like nutrients may or may not change depending on how the osds treats that component of the sewage 3 results 3 1 fib enterococcus spp concentrations significantly differed among watershed locations p 0 0001 table 1 but were similar among puakō s shoreline regions puakō s anchialine ponds had enterococcus spp concentrations that were an order of magnitude higher range 324 19 018 mpn 100 ml compared to other watershed locations fig 2a table 1 puakō s shoreline waters and the low elevation wells had the second highest enterococcus spp concentrations 0 7985 mpn 100 ml mid and high elevation wells as well as shoreline waters at the resorts had similar concentrations and they were the lowest of all the watershed locations sampled 0 147 mpn 100 ml 4 out of 34 samples were above 35 mpn 100 ml in comparison to enterococcus spp c perfringens was rarely detected at the different watershed locations fig 2b table 1 in fact it was only detected in puakō s anchialine ponds and shoreline waters 0 90 cfu 100 ml 39 of 141 samples were above 5 cfu 100 ml table 1 like c perfringens human associated bacteroides hf183 and bachum markers were only detected in puakō s anchialine ponds and shoreline waters fig 2c table 1 3 2 nutrients nutrient concentrations tended to be higher in inland waters wells anchialine ponds and were lower at the shoreline table 2 this pattern was observed for no3 no2 and h4sio4 table 2 for nh4 tdn and po4 3 concentrations were generally similar among watershed locations with the exception of resorts shoreline waters being lower than one of the well water locations table 2 along puakō s shoreline the southern and middle regions had the highest nutrient concentrations with respect to no3 no2 nh4 tdn and po4 3 p 0 0001 in contrast h4sio4 concentrations were similar among puakō s shoreline regions nutrient concentrations and salinity were similar between the northern and southern resorts 3 3 δ 15n in macroalgae δ 15n macroalgal values were highest in south puakō compared to the middle and northern regions fig 3 p 0 0001 seven stations along puakō s shoreline had δ 15n macroalgal values 7 or greater which is considered to be within the range of values measured for sewage reviewed in wiegner et al 2016 at the northern and southern resorts δ 15n macroalgal tissue values were similar to each other and lower than those observed at many of the puakō shoreline stations fig 3 values at the resorts were indicative of no3 from upper and lower elevational wells well fertilized soils and ones under kiawe trees and ocean water fig 3 3 4 siar mixing models sewage contributions to the no3 pool varied among watershed locations fig 4 table 3 puakō s anchialine ponds had the largest sewage contribution to the no3 pool 36 55 followed by puakō s shoreline waters 23 26 resort shoreline waters 12 17 low elevational groundwater wells 9 20 and mid elevational groundwater wells 1 4 along puakō s shoreline ten stations had sewage contributing up to 40 or more high end of the range to the shoreline no3 all stations were located in south 6 stations and north 4 stations puakō 3 5 quantifying water quality impairment caused by osds dye was observed flowing out of shoreline springs during five of the six dye tracer tests groundwater flow rates ranged from 3 to 137 m d allowing dye to reach the shoreline between 5 h and 11 d the type of osds septic tank vs atu did not affect how fast dye reached the shoreline with atus having both the slowest and fastest flow rates in general dye appeared at the shoreline sooner in front of homes with drainage fields closer to the shoreline the only dye tracer test where dye was not observed at the shoreline was from a septic system farthest landward here the drainage field was 122 m from the shoreline at the other five homes this averaged 40 m additionally this home was located in the northern part of the neighborhood where fewer groundwater springs have been observed we may have missed the spring where the dye emerged adsorption of the dye to organic matter in the septic tank may have been greater than we anticipated or we did not sample long enough to capture the dye emerging from the spring after 16 d flow rate of 8 m d concentrations of fib and nutrients were similar in front of homes with different osds fig 5 the average enterococcus spp concentration in front of homes with different osds all exceeded the hdoh statistical threshold value fig 5 a with concentrations ranging from 0 to 34 330 mpn 100 ml similarly c perfringens concentrations in front of the homes with different osds encompassed the standard recommended to hdoh for marine recreational waters of 5 cfu 100 ml fujioka et al 1997 but they ranged from 0 to 27 cfu 100 ml and were not higher than the range reported for non point source sewage pollution of 10 100 cfu 100 ml fig 5b fung et al 2007 δ15n in macroalgae was similar in front of homes with the different osds fig 6 they were all within the reported sewage range for puakō nutrient concentrations in front of dye tracer test homes were high average tdn concentrations exceeded 100 µmol l fig 5c with no3 no2 comprising most of the tdn average tdp concentrations were all greater than 3 µmol l fig 5c with po4 3 comprising most of the tdp h4sio4 concentrations did differ in front of these homes but this difference was most likely from salinity as h4sio4 is an indicator for fresh groundwater data not shown proportional contributions of sewage to the no3 pool in front of homes with different osds types varied fig 6 sewage comprised 25 35 of the no3 in front of homes with cesspools 41 49 in front of homes with septic tanks and 12 23 in front of homes with atus fig 6 3 6 assessing proposed sewage treatment upgrades conversion of the entire puakō neighborhood to atus would reduce average enterococcus spp and c perfringens concentrations at the shoreline by 30 and 48 respectively appendix table a2 this reduction is dependent on the number of cesspools converted and the efficiency of atus to remove fib for enterococcus spp this transition would reduce the percent of stations that exceed the hdoh statistical threshold value from 81 to 69 for c perfringens the reduction is greater with atus with only one station exceeding the recommended marine standard of 5 cfu 100 ml fujioka et al 1997 these reductions could be greater if the atus used are more effective at removing fib than estimated in our calculations 50 for enterococcus spp 68 for c perfringens a stp would reduce fib concentrations well below the hdoh standards by specifically targeting the removal of fib with chlorine ozone or ultraviolet treatment 4 discussion 4 1 source of sewage to groundwater this study successfully used a variety of biological and chemical sewage indicators to determine locations in puakō s watershed where sewage was entering into groundwater this information is critical for appropriate management actions to be determined and implemented in targeted locations fib concentrations were generally low in puakō s upper watershed and in the adjacent resorts shoreline waters and only substantially increased or exceeded hdoh standards in puakō s anchialine ponds wells and shoreline waters this was observed for both enterococcus spp and c perfringens enterococcus spp concentrations in puakō s anchialine ponds wells and shoreline waters consistently exceeded the hdoh statistical threshold standard of 130 mpn 100 ml hdoh 2014 epidemiological studies have shown that a swimmer s chance of contracting gastroenteritis is 3 6 at enterococcus spp concentrations of 35 mpn 100 ml reviewed in fujioka et al 2015 our results suggest that swimmers along the puakō shoreline are at an even greater risk of contracting gastroenteritis all upper and mid elevation wells and resorts shoreline waters had enterococcus spp concentrations below 35 mpn 100 ml likewise c perfringens concentrations consistently exceeded the recommended standard to hdoh of 5 cfu 100 ml for marine recreational waters fujioka et al 1997 in all of the anchialine ponds sampled at puakō as well as some of the puakō s shoreline stations these c perfringens concentrations were all within the range reported for non point source sewage pollution fung et al 2007 additionally mst markers specifically developed to detect bacteroides bacteria originating from the human gut hf183 and bachum were only detected in puakō s anchialine ponds and shoreline waters note that while we did not have human bacteroides measurements from the resorts shoreline waters our interpretation would not have changed as the enterococcus spp and c perfringens concentrations were very low and indicative of low sewage contamination table 1 and fig 2 additionally a linear relationship between hf183 and bachum concentrations with risk of contracting gastroenteritis has been established boehm et al 2015 using these equations the risk of contracting gastroenteritis in puakō s anchialine ponds and shoreline waters ranges from 0 to 43 with the risk being less than 1 most of the time fig 2c note raw sewage has average values log10 3 4 sd 0 1 and 5 5 0 1 copies 100 ml for hf183 and bachum respectively shanks et al 2010 which are an order of magnitude higher than average values found at puakō table 1 also the risk of contracting gastroenteritis could be greater than predicted by the boehm et al 2015 model as hf183 and bachum bacteria markers decay in the environment faster than human associated viral markers ahmed et al 2019 together all of these fib measurements illustrate that sewage is primarily entering the groundwater at puakō and not within the upper watershed or at the adjacent resorts and that there are likely health risks to swimming in these shoreline waters while fib concentrations are used to determine if sewage is present and at levels that could pose a health threat to recreational water users they do not provide information on the relative contribution of sewage to measured pollution levels one approach that has successfully overcome this limitation is the combined use of stable isotopes of nitrate δ 15n and δ 18o and mixing models wiegner et al 2016 we utilized this approach to determine the percent contribution of sewage to the no3 pool at different locations within puakō s watershed we found that sewage contributions to the no3 pool varied among watershed locations sewage comprised the largest percentage of no3 in puakō s anchialine ponds 36 55 and shoreline waters 23 26 the two locations with the highest fib concentrations sewage comprised a lower percentage of the no3 pool at the resorts shoreline waters 12 17 low elevation groundwater wells 9 20 and mid elevation groundwater wells 1 4 these findings support conclusions from the fib measurements that sewage is entering into the groundwater at puakō in puakō s effort to transition away from cesspools and septic tanks determining hotspots of sewage pollution along its shoreline is critical for prioritizing removal locations the region that consistently had the highest sewage indicator values was south puakō here nutrient concentrations were highest δ 15n in macroalgal tissue and no3 were the most reflective of sewage pollution and mixing models suggest that up to 52 of the no3 is comprised of sewage two stations 3 and 4 within south puakō were previously identified as sewage pollution hotspots abaya et al 2018a there is also substantial evidence that sewage is present at other locations along the shoreline mixing models suggest that sewage comprised more than 40 of the no3 at four stations in north puakō also concentrations of all fib enterococcus spp c perfringens and human associated bacteroides were similar among puakō s three regions additionally it is likely that δ 15n macroalgal tissue values were underestimated due to increased n isotope discrimination up to 6 under high no3 concentrations 10 μmol l fujita 1985 swart et al 2014 if the δ 15n macroalgal values are adjusted for this discrimination then algal shoreline values fall within the range reported for sewage 7 reviewed in wiegner et al 2016 the pervasive presence of sewage along puakō s shoreline is likely a result of all homes using osds in an area with permeable basalt a high water table and substantial sgd similar h4sio4 concentrations among puakō s shoreline regions substantiates the ubiquitous presence of sgd in the nearshore waters which carries sewage from the osds to shoreline springs 4 2 differences among osds types dye tracer studies provide irrefutable evidence that sewage from osds and stp is entering and contaminating water bodies hdoh 1984 yates 1985 glenn et al 2013 previous dye tracer studies at puakō demonstrated that sewage from cesspools reached the shoreline within 9 h to 3 d 4 76 m d abaya et al 2018a our current study expands these findings by including results from septic tanks and atus with sewage travel times from 5 h to 11 d 3 137 m d the type of osds cesspool vs septic tank vs atu or the presence of a leach field did not affect how fast dye reached the shoreline in general dye appeared at the shoreline from homes with drainage fields closer to the shoreline sooner than those further away the fastest flow rates in this study likely occurred where the leach field was built directly atop a highly fractured portion of the underlying lava flow these fractures transport sewage to shoreline springs slower flow rates were likely in regions with fewer or smaller fractures in the basalt or a greater thicknesses of soil fill between the drainage field and the shoreline this information is essential for the puakō community as it will be used to decide which alternative to cesspools will be pursued to reduce or eliminate sewage from puakō s nearshore waters water quality was also similar in front of homes with different osds types and values for parameters were suggestive of the presence of sewage enterococcus spp concentrations consistently exceeded the hdoh statistical threshold value of 130 mpn 100 ml with some measurements as high as 34 330 mpn 100 ml c perfringens concentrations encompassed the standard recommended to hdoh for marine recreational waters of 5 cfu 100 ml fujioka et al 1997 but were not higher than the range reported for non point sewage pollution of 10 100 cfu 100 ml fig 5b fung et al 2007 δ15n macroalgal values were all within the reported range for sewage at puakō fig 6 abaya et al 2018a nutrient concentrations were high with no3 comprising the majority of the tdn concentrations which exceeded 100 µmol l results from the siar mixing model suggest that sewage was a substantial component of the shoreline no3 pool in front of homes with different osds ranging from 12 to 49 fig 7 these findings suggest that regardless of the type of osds used by homes in puakō shoreline waters fronting these homes are contaminated with sewage any differences in these parameters that may exist in the sewage effluent of different osds is lost by the time the sewage reaches the shoreline because of dispersion and tidal mixing of groundwater before discharge at the shoreline 4 3 proposed sewage treatment improvements most homes at puakō use cesspools and septic tanks to dispose of their sewage cesspools are underground pits used for temporary storage of sewage while septic tanks are underground chambers where solids settle out before the effluent drains into a leach field beyond removing solids neither system treats sewage septic systems rely on a thick layer of soil below the leach field for microbial breakdown of sewage before it reaches groundwater but this is absent at puakō where the groundwater is close to the land surface and the substrate is highly permeable fractured basalt instead of soil hence three alternatives to cesspools have been proposed for sewage disposal and treatment in puakō they include 1 converting all cesspools to atus 2 connecting to the existing nearby mauna lani stp or 3 building a stp within puakō each of these solutions treats sewage differently and will have a different outcome for future nearshore water quality at puakō atu systems collect sewage into an underground container like septic tanks where solids settle out however atus have additional treatment beyond the settling out of the solids whereas septic tanks do not the type of additional treatment that occurs within an atu varies with models and brands but can include a disinfection component as well as nutrient removal the type of atu proposed for puakō cycles between aerobic anaerobic anoxic and decanting stages aqua engineering 2015 this treatment cycle removes organic pollutants and nutrients our calculations based on our water quality measurements stable isotope mixing models and published information on the atu proposed for puakō suggests that conversion of the entire neighborhood to atus would reduce average enterococcus spp and c perfringens concentrations at the shoreline by 48 for enterococcus spp this transition would reduce the percent of stations that exceed the hdoh statistical threshold value from 81 to 69 for c perfringens the reduction is greater with only one station exceeding the recommended marine standard of 5 cfu 100 ml fujioka et al 1997 transporting sewage from homes at puakō to a stp is the other option under consideration one alternative will transport sewage to the mauna lani stp fig 1 at this plant sewage passes through bar screens and an aerated grit chamber before entering two aerated lagoons mauna lani stp inc 2006 at the time of this study lagoon water was chlorinated and then used for irrigation on a sod farm on the mauna lani property mauna lani stp inc 2006 the other alternative is for puakō to build an onsite stp this plant would contain a screening system secondary treatment tanks and clarifiers sand filters and a uv disinfection system and would have the capability of producing r 1 quality water which could be used for irrigation hdoh 2002 aqua engineering 2015 crops irrigated with the r 1 water can reduce the amount of water percolating down to the aquifer and further reduce any remaining nutrients in the water aqua engineering 2015 with either stp option sewage from puakō would be completely removed from puakō s groundwater as it will enter into a sewer system at puakō this would mean that water now discharging at shoreline seeps would only be a mixture of groundwater and seawater however if the mauna lani stp is the alternative selected sewage that has not undergone pathogen or nutrient removal would still be transported via sgd to the nearshore waters of the puakō mauna lani reef as of 2017 the end of our study the mauna lani stp stopped chlorinating lagoon water and now dispose of it via two on site injection wells the injection wells are located just upslope from the southern portion of the puakō community this is potentially concerning for coral reefs in the area as sewage disposed of via injection wells have resulted in tremendous economic and ecological damage on the island of maui van beukering and cesar 2004 smith et al 2005 the use of injection wells as a means of sewage disposal was reviewed by the u s supreme court 04 23 2020 as a result of the coral reef and water quality conditions in maui maui county v hawai i wildlife fund sierra club maui group surfrider foundation west maui preservation association 2019 the u s supreme court ruled that the clean water act requires that sewage injection wells have permits to discharge their effluent if it reaches navigable waters like the ocean through groundwater 5 conclusions use of multiple biological and chemical sewage indicators allowed us to successfully identify where sewage was entering into puakō s watershed groundwater sewage indicator values were greatest within puakō and sewage quickly reached shoreline waters 5 h 10 d sewage travel time to puakō s shoreline and water quality in front of homes was similar among all osds types these results suggest that the underlying geology on each property is more important in affecting the travel time of the sewage to the shoreline than the osds type our assessment of water quality impairment caused by osds revealed that if all cesspools and septic tanks were converted to atus across the entire puakō neighborhood fib concentrations would be reduced but not to acceptable concentrations if sewage is treated and disposed of through a stp sewage would be completely removed from puakō s groundwater from a water quality standpoint both in regards to human and coral reef health puakō building its own stp would be best it will have a higher level of treatment than currently used at the mauna lani stp the plant will also convert the sewage into r 1 quality water which could be used to irrigate crops that can further reduce any remaining nutrients in the water rather than disposing of it through an injection well hdoh 2002 aqua engineering 2015 in conclusion this study s approach can be adapted to other locations with sewage pollution to identify the location that sewage is entering into the groundwater and to assess potential management actions to improve water quality credit authorship contribution statement tracy n wiegner conceptualization data curation
