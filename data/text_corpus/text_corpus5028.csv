25140,the main challenges for ecological studies are the complexity and non stationarity of data that are difficult to handle using traditional modelling methods thus to address these problems modern modelling techniques have been developed and introduced for applications in time series data the cross wavelet transform cwt and cross correlation function ccf serve as promising tools to analyze the dynamics of fish populations through time and space here we employed these two well known time series modelling approaches to model the spatial and temporal dynamics of small mud carp species henicorhynchus lobatus and henicorhynchus siamensis and examine the influence of flow pulses on their dynamics using spatial and time series data collected from the tonle sap lake and river system the phase angle given by the cwt provided a useful tool for statistically detecting and reconstructing the phase relationship between the two time series of fish data moreover the correlation coefficients at each lag between the water level and fish abundance identified by the ccf provided a mechanism to understand how the flow pulse influenced the dynamics of fish the results showed that h lobatus moved out of the floodplain and the lake earlier than h siamensis herein h lobatus retreats slower than h siamensis in the tonle sap lake but they retreated at similar speeds when they reach the tonle sap river this suggests that the two species respond differently to the out flow pulse only when they are inside the tsl indicating the main role of flow pulses in determining the occurrence and movement of fish in the tonle sap ecosystem we also discussed the role and applications of these modelling approaches for linking the changes in environmental parameters and fish the cwt and ccf based on our results are helpful modelling approaches for analyzing time series data to understand the phase relationship and the periodicity of synchronisation joint periodicity i e the role of environmental factors in shaping fish occurrence and movement in a flood pulse ecosystem keywords co occurrence migration patterns fish synchronisation phase relationship cross wavelet transform cross correlation function 1 introduction spatial and temporal dynamics of populations and communities have become an interesting research area for ecological studies mcgill et al 2006 vellend 2010 this is because assessing the spatial and temporal dynamics of communities or a given species in an ecosystem can provide useful knowledge on how individuals of its population synchronise and migrate e g before leading at the same time or after lagging the synchronisation of its meta community with which it interacts chevalier et al 2018 leibold et al 2004 wilson 1992 moreover knowledge on the spatial and temporal dynamics of a target species can lead to a greater understanding of variations in its population size e g where and when it fluctuates over time and movements e g up and downstream of a river and the driving forces that govern such variations and movements begon et al 1991 juliano 2007 ruokolainen et al 2009 in aquatic environments flood pulse ecosystems refer to water bodies that are regulated by periodic inundation i e flood pulses that is coupled and decoupled from their interconnected water bodies rivers in these ecosystems the pulsing is one of the major forces responsible for productivity and biotic interactions junk et al 1989 sverdrup jensen 2002 for fishes flow pulses play a pivotal role in their ecology because they create habitat diversities and improve food supply degrandchamp et al 2008 valbo jorgensen 2003 which are crucial for the survival and development of fishes fishes mainly use the main channels and floodplains of the system as a migration route spawning ground or refuge during the dry season this indicates that variation in flow pulses or water levels may have a strong influence on the spatial and temporal dynamics of fish communities occurring at different locations in the system being studied ngor et al 2018b sabo et al 2017 stoffels et al 2015 the tonle sap lake tsl is the largest freshwater lake in southeast asia and is the largest floodplain water body of the mekong river basin mrc 2005 the tsl is connected to the mekong river by the tonle sap river tsr fig 1 the tsl the tsr and their tributaries form a large natural ecosystem called the tonle sap ecosystem tse lamberts 2006 the tsl hydrological flows are influenced by flood waters of the mekong river and this creates a complex flood pulse ecosystem kummu et al 2014 mrc 2005 due to this fact combined with other suitable habitat conditions e g feeding and breeding grounds many surrounding tributaries and heterogeneous land covers the tse supports high biodiversity and thus provides substantial contributions of fisheries resources to the people in the region lieng and zalinge 2001 for example 296 fish species have been reported from the tse baran et al 2013 of which 7 species e g henicorhynchus spp labiobarbus spp and paralaubuca spp are among the dominant species in the annual fish catch from the tsr halls et al 2013 ngor et al 2015 however knowledge on fish communities and dynamics are relatively limited in this flood pulse ecosystem to date only few studies have been conducted in this system e g fish species diversity and distribution

moreover no studies have attempted to investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of key fisheries species and their relations to the water level variation over an extended period for this reason analyzing the spatial and temporal dynamics of keystone species e g henicorhynchus spp trey riel will provide essential knowledge and insights to better support fisheries monitoring and management cross wavelet transform cwt grinsted et al 2004 with phase angle and coherency parameters is a local bivariate analysis that is commonly used for time series data to analyze the relationships in time frequency space phase relationships and coherency between the two time series grinsted et al 2004 maraun and kurths 2004 prokoph and bilali 2008 the main components of the cwt are to compare the frequency contents of the two time series and highlight the synchronicity of the series at a given period and across given ranges of time roesch and schmidbauer 2014a moreover the cross correlation function ccf has been used to determine the correlation between the two time series as a function of the time lag or delay zhang and wu 2006 it produces global correlation coefficients between two time series data at each lag these two modelling techniques are useful tools to assess the influence of environmental variables e g flow pulse on the spatial and temporal dynamics of fish species by using the cwt and ccf we studied the dynamics i e by means of occurrence synchronisation i e the collective swimming of fish individuals in a large school peak abundance and behavioural movement patterns of two small mud carp species i e h lobatus smith 1945 and h siamensis sauvage 1881 in the tse additionally we investigated the influence of water levels on their spatial and temporal dynamics our questions of interest are 1 is there any synchrony in occurrence between the two species and is there a constant periodic occurrence of each species e g re occurring monthly or seasonally or annually 2 how is the period of synchronisation and movement patterns of each species varied across the tse 3 is there any time lagged relationship between the synchronisation of each species and water levels since it has been shown that h lobatus and h siamensis have dissimilarities in ecological preferences and life history traits hurwood et al 2006 we expected distinct periods of the occurrence synchronisation and time lagged relationship to be observed for each species in different parts of the tse following the variation in water levels 2 materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions the study was carried out in the tse which is located in the northwest part of cambodia fig 1 the tse is a tropical flood pulse system due to its seasonal and predictable periodicity in hydrological flows in the wet season may october the water flows into the tsl through the tsr due to increased water levels in the mekong river whereas in the dry season november april a reverse flow occurs through the tsr again due to the receding water levels in the mekong river mrc 2005 the water levels highly vary between seasons the water depth ranges from 0 5 m in april dry season to 9 m in september october rainy season in 2011 one of the wettest years the maximum water level in the tsl was recorded at 9 9 m ngor et al 2018a this variation leads to a varied surface area of the tsl throughout the year and thus creates more heterogeneous habitats compared to the tsr mrc 2005 2 2 data collection and processing the fish data used in this study were provided by the mekong river commission mrc fisheries programme the fish catch monitoring approach follows the mrc s fish monitoring method applied in the lower mekong basin mrc 2008 ngor et al 2014 in the present study daily fish catch monitoring from january 2012 to december 2015 was selected from three sampling sites in the tse fig 1 in the northern tsl hereafter abbreviated to nl in the southern tsl sl and the in the outlet river or of the tsr fig 1 at each sampling site nylon gillnets with 2 to 6 5 cm mesh sizes were used to capture as many fish species as possible gillnets have been considered the most common and popular fishing gear used in the tse and are suitable to be applied in different habitat types mrc 2008 the gillnets used had a length of 400 m 100 m the variation in the gillnet length was due to the habitat availability e g inundated forest open water of the tsl rivers streams and creeks which varies according to the annual hydrological cycle fishes were identified to the species level following the identification guide by rainboth 1996 in cross checking with fishbase froese and pauly 2017 and kottelat 2013 and enumerated and recorded in a logbook the logbooks were then collected from fishers on a quarterly basis and cross checked for its correctness and completeness of the recorded data by research specialists unidentified species were later identified by an expert taxonomist in the laboratory in this study only two small mud carp species h lobatus and h siamensis were extracted from the fish monitoring database for analyses henicorhynchus spp are indeed among the most ecologically and economically important species in the tse fukushima et al 2014 mrc 2009 ngor et al 2015 they significantly contributed to sustaining livelihoods and food security in the country and in the region e g they make up the highest proportion 43 by weight of dai fishery catches in the tsr hall et al 2007 halls et al 2013 moreover henicorhynchus spp are of major importance to produce fish paste prahok smoked fish salted fish and fish sauce which can be kept for use particularly during rice cultivation periods and when wild fish is scarce hall et al 2007 halls et al 2013 mrc 2009 2002 the water level dataset used in this study was registered by the mrc the daily water levels were measured and recorded from two sites in the tsl and tsr fig 1 2 3 modelling techniques and analyses 2 3 1 modelling techniques the cwt can locally detect extract and reconstruct the relationship between two nonstationary signals in frequency and time grinsted et al 2004 the cwt of the two time series x t and y t with cross wavelet forms w x and w y respectively is calculated based on the formula w xy τ s 1 s w x τ s w y τ s where τ is the time localization and s is the scale factor that determines the characteristic frequency or wavelength and denotes the complex conjugate prokoph and bilali 2008 roesch and schmidbauer 2014a monte carlo simulation is a general post hoc analysis performed to provide frequency specific probability distributions the cwt provides an analogy of the cross correlation with localization in time and scale the correlation level between the two time series is measured using the cross wavelet power cwp which is measured according to the norm of w xy τ s p xy τ s w xy τ s when the two time series data have a high or a low cwp it means that they have a high or low correlation respectively the contour line revealed by the cwt indicates the significance of the joint time interval the interval of time containing a significant correlation between the two time series roesch and schmidbauer 2014a the phase angle describes the phase difference between the two time series data of which the phase difference of x over y at the time and scale is based on the formula angle τ s arg wave xy τ s roesch and schmidbauer 2014a the phase angle in an interval 3π 2 π 2 as shown by arrows pointing right and illustrates the in phase relationship whereas the phase angle in an interval π 2 3π 2 as shown by arrows pointing left and illustrates the anti phase or the out of phase relationship specifically when the arrows are pointing right up and left down and the first series leads the second and when the arrows are pointing left up and right down and the second series leads the first see roesch and schmidbauer 2014a for details the ccf is a bivariate method applied to analyze the global correlation between the two time series data the ccf is a promising method that can be used to determine a level of similarity or correlation between the two time series as a function of the time lag or delay zhang and wu 2006 the ccf produces correlation coefficients i e a positive and negative correlation between the two time series at each lag in the ccfs the input time series data represent the influential time series and the output time series data represent the affected time series welsh 1999 the ccf of the two time series xt and yt is given by c c f τ x t y t τ d t where the lag τ is the size of the time shift welsh 1999 in the ccf plot the length of the vertical line indicates the value of the correlation coefficient between the two time series at each lag the areas above and below the blue horizontal dashed line represent a significant positive correlation and a significant negative correlation respectively in other words the vertical line of the lag that is extended above the upper blue horizontal dashed line represents a significant positive correlation whereas the vertical line of the lag that is situated below the below blue horizontal dashed line represents a significant negative correlation between the two time series 2 3 2 data analyses the daily catch of the two species and water level data were summarised into a weekly basis based on mean comprising a total of 210 weeks over the whole timescale of the study for the three sites for each studied site the cwt was used to analyze occurrence correlation and recursivity e g a recursive occurrence at an interval over a particular timescale between the two time series data of h lobatus abundance x and h siamensis abundance y by utilising the function analyze coherency in the waveletcomp package of r roesch and schmidbauer 2014b internally the time series are standardised before they build the cwt the cwt analysis also allows the determination of whether h lobatus occurrence leads or lags h siamensis occurrence here the 95 conﬁdence interval was selected for the wavelet power as the signiﬁcance criterion practically the ability of the cwt to analyze coherency enabled us to highlight the co occurrence and synchronisation periodicity of the two species the ccfs were then employed to determine a period e g how many weeks when h lobatus synchronisation and peak abundance leads or lags those of h siamensis using the function ccf in the stats package of r to investigate how periods of synchronisation and peak abundance vary across the studied sites the ccfs were used to determine the time lagged relationship of the abundance of each species between paired sites e g h lobatus abundance in nl x and sl y the results of this analysis were then used to identify the movement patterns of each species e g a period it takes to migrate from nl to sl swimming speed km day of each species is therefore inferred from the time lags and distances between study sites finally the ccfs were also employed to examine the time lagged relationship between the water levels and the abundance of each species at each site in this analysis the water level data measured from site ws1 was analyzed with the fish data collected from the nl and sl sites whereas that from ws2 was analyzed with the fish data collected from the or site by the end of this analysis we were able to estimate the movement periods of both species e g how many weeks the peak water level leads or lags the peak abundance of each species here we selected the lag containing the highest correlation coefficients between the two time series as the time lag the ccf allowed us to determine the link between the flow pulse and fish abundance and identify the time lag between the water level peak and fish synchronisation the ccf thus enables the determination of the role of flood pulse in spatial and temporal dynamics of fish species in the tse to be made all statistical analyses were performed using r program v 3 3 3 for windows statistical software package http www r project org r core team 2017 3 results 3 1 occurrence correlations and periodicities there was a correlation between the occurrence of h lobatus and h siamensis and their periodic occurrence was also observed at each studied site fig 2 in nl a significant positive correlation meaning that h lobatus led h siamensis occurred at a high frequency periodicity of 46 9 52 weeks as indicated by the in phase relationship detected over the whole timescale of the study fig 2 supplementary material s1 in sl significant positive correlations were also observed at different periodicities fig 2 a rather weak but significant correlation that occurred at a high frequency periodicity of 46 9 52 weeks was observed for the whole timescale of study and strong correlations that occurred at low frequency periodicities 3 9 4 4 weeks were observed over a short timescale of study between late 2012 and early 2013 and between late 2014 and early 2015 in or significant positive and negative correlations were detected as indicated by the in and anti phase relationships of the cwt analysis respectively the results also indicated a significant positive correlation that occurred at the high frequency periodicities of 46 9 52 weeks stronger significant negative or positive correlations which occurred at the lower frequency periodicities 3 9 4 4 weeks were observed over three short timescales i e between december and february of the study fig 2 3 2 synchronisation peak abundance and movement patterns in nl significant synchronisation and peak abundance of h lobatus occurred within 6 weeks and 1 week respectively before those of h siamensis fig 3 in sl and or the synchronisation of h lobatus appeared to occur before that of h siamensis but the peak abundance of both species occurred in the same week fig 3 based on the paired sites the ccf bivariate plots fig 4 illustrated that after the peak abundance of h lobatus observed in nl it was detected again within 8 weeks in sl and again within 1 week in or after the peak abundance of h siamensis occurred in nl it was detected again within 2 weeks in sl and again within 1 week in or 3 3 the time lagged relationship with water levels the results of the ccfs revealed that the highest water level always led the peak abundance of both species the highest water level was 7 weeks ahead of the peak abundance of h lobatus in nl 14 weeks in sl and 15 weeks in or fig 5 on the other hand the highest water level led the synchronisation and peak abundance of h siamensis for 12 weeks in nl 14 weeks in sl and 13 weeks in or fig 6 summaries of the in and out flow pulses the peak water level the peak abundance of the two fish species and fish movement speed in the tsl are provided in fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 performance and applications of time series analyses the cwt and ccf play a significant role in our study explicitly the cwt enabled us to highlight the co occurrence and synchronisation of two species whereas the ccf allowed us to determine the link between the flow pulse and fish abundance and identify the time lag between the peak of water level and fish synchronisation the ccf thus allows us to identify the role of flood pulse in the dynamics of fish species in the tse at both time and space our results could increase our understanding of how a flood pulse system work the cwt and ccf are helpful tools for time series analysis to interpret how the flow pulse influences fish spatial and temporal dynamics these two time series modelling techniques provide complementary information for understanding the co occurrence synchronisation and movement patterns of both fish species in a tropical flood pulse ecosystem the data used in this study were collected on a daily basis for four years 2012 2015 and such high resolution data are rarely found in ecology these high resolution time series data are valuable to build the cwt and ccf to model the spatial and temporal dynamics of fish species therefore we believe that the results of this study can be used to improve flow pulse management and fishery resources conservation in the system 4 2 the role of flow pulse in the spatial and temporal dynamics of fishes we found a positive relationship of annual co occurrence pattern between the two species at each site by the high frequency periodicity of 46 9 to 52 weeks corresponding to a period between october and december however the most distinctive pattern was found in only nl as indicated by a very strong positive correlation fig 2 supplementary material s1 suggesting that the most active and dynamic annual co occurrence and synchronisation of the two species mainly happened in nl when their individuals are about to retreat to sl and then to or and finally to the mekong river for sl and or we found a strong and clear monthly co occurrence pattern from december through february as illustrated by the low frequency periodicity of 3 9 to 4 4 weeks in the cross wavelet analysis this means that the monthly cycle of increasing synchronisation and peak abundance and decreasing trends in the abundance of each species occurs every month from december to february apart from falling water level lunar phase appears to have a strong relationship with peak fish migration out of the tsl through the tsr as observed at the 100 year old dai fishery ngor et al 2018c therefore related flow pulse conditions play a key role in facilitating fish migrations e g migration for dry season refuges spawning and rearing feeding changes in flow pulse condition that caused by anthropogenic activities would disrupt spawning rearing and feeding success of fish and thus their natural stocks flow pulse is one of the main factors driving fish dynamics and their productions sverdrup jensen 2002 annual flow pulses i e rising and falling water levels play an important role in signalling fish migration and in opening up floodplain habitats for resources and fish reproduction poulsen et al 2004 2002 sverdrup jensen 2002 welcomme 1999 this pattern is also observed in our study as inferred by the leading flow pulse over fish migrations into the tsl the in flow pulse from the mekong river in the early wet season brings young individuals newly hatched and countless larvae of henicorhynchus spp to the tsl and its surround floodplain area that are covered by flooded forest shrub and aquatic vegetation campbell et al 2006 poulsen et al 2004 sverdrup jensen 2002 the area provides an array of food resources such as fruits algae aquatic vegetation and other macroinvertebrates i e molluscs insects and crustaceans sor et al 2017 additionally the in flow pulse also deposits a large volume of sediment flux into the tsl kummu et al 2005 which contains paramount nutrient resources e g phosphorus and nitrate contents supporting the food webs in the tonle sap ecosystem as a whole sarkkula et al 2004 2003 the rich resources combined with large living space and stable environment in the tse enhance the outburst of fish growth including young individuals of h lobatus and h siamensis particularly for the period from five to six months following the first in flow pulse poulsen 2003 during the dry season as expected falling water lead to a more spontaneous response of small short bodied fishes we found that the out flow pulse triggers the retreat of each species to the mekong river differently within the tsl the out flow pulse prompts the retreat of h lobatus from nl to sl 7 weeks after the peak flow with the swimming speed of 2 3 km day whereas h siamensis retreated 12 weeks after the peak flow with swimming speed of 7 9 km day figs 4 7 in the small route from sl to the or individuals of the two species retreat with more or less the same speed i e 1 week or 16 km day this movement patterns could be explained by the heterogeneous and homogeneous habitats observed in the floodplain of the tsl and the river channel respectively moreover the speed of the out flow pulse can also influence the retreat of each species to the mekong river as such after the out flow pulse begins the species synchronise and migrate in a large school back to the tsl then the tsr and finally to the mekong river for the dry season refuges and possibly for the spawning grounds upstream degrandchamp et al 2007 ngor et al 2018b our results further suggest that during the period of migrating out of the tse h lobatus but not h siamensis prefers moving to different habitats floodplain areas within the tsl where possible retreating along with the gradually decreased water levels besides the two species share similar movement patterns in the rivers that are characterised by a smaller passage and less variation in habitat characteristics therefore all these flow pulse related conditions play a key role in facilitating adult fish recruitment which can guarantee an increased abundance of fish species observed at 5 months after the in flow pulse begins as observed in our study and by poulsen 2003 4 3 monitoring and management perspectives understanding the occurrence synchronisation and movement patterns of fish species and the influence of water level variation on their spatial and temporal dynamics provides useful knowledge to better understand fish species migration and behavioural ecology løkkeborg et al 2002 mcgill et al 2006 peoples and frimpong 2016 pollock et al 2014 ruetz et al 2005 this knowledge can be used to support more effective monitoring management and conservation efforts at local and larger spatial and temporal scales for instance the timing of the retreat of the two species identified in this study delivers useful insights that can be used to support regulations and policy initiatives aiming for better management and conservation of the two species good initiatives will allow adult individuals to complete the next step of their life cycle i e to freely pass through the tsr during their peak abundance these individuals can consequently reach the refuge spawning rearing and feeding grounds in the upstream portions of the mekong river and its major tributaries and can thus sustain the annual production furthermore our findings can act as a fundamental baseline for investigations of other economically and ecologically important species in the case that further studies investigating different keystone species find similar synchronisation and peak abundance periods and similar movement patterns and timing in their retreats these results will together provide key knowledge to support better monitoring and management of fisheries resources in the tse also the spatial and temporal dynamics of fish are found to be fine turned with the natural flow pulse variation maintaining such conditions are therefore necessary for fish species to migrate to complete their life cycles human actions such as hydropower dams that alter natural flow pulses of the mekong i e change in flow seasonality and predictability is highly likely to also alter fish assemblage structure and their composition fish migration patterns and spawning decisions which consequently have severe implication on fish reproductive rearing and feeding successes ngor et al 2018b finally our study demonstrated that the cwt and ccf are useful time series modelling approaches for investigating the phase relationship joint periodicity and the time lagged relationship between environmental parameters e g water level and fish species in the flood pulse ecosystems 5 conclusions investigating the spatial and temporal dynamics of fish species enables ecologists and fisheries managers to better understand variation in their occurrence synchronisation peak abundance and movement patterns and the key factors driving such variation by using modern time series modelling approaches i e the cwt and ccfs to analyze high resolution time series data we found that for this study the two small mud carp species can co occur together but the synchronisation and movements of h lobatus always lead those of h siamensis the annual re occurrence a long periodicity of each species was detected in nl between october and december while their monthly re occurrence a short periodicity was mainly observed in or from december to february moreover after water recession in the tsl h lobatus individuals began to retreat earlier than h siamensis individuals however the former species retreats 2 3 km day slower than the latter species 7 9 km day but they retreated at similar speeds when they reached the outlet river tsr at 16 km day these patterns were found to correspond to the variation in water levels across the tse suggesting that the flow pulse is one of the main factors responsible for the spatial and temporal dynamics of the small mud carp species in the tse therefore the seasonality and predictability of the mekong river should be maintained to sustain the natural dynamics of fish species e g the periods of recruitment synchronisation peak abundance and movements that have long developed and adapted to such a flood pulse system the timing of migration and swimming speed of the two species identified in this study should be an important part of regulation or policy consideration to better manage and conserve the two species the ability of the cwt to analyze coherency enabled us to highlight the co occurrence and synchronisation periodicity of two species whereas the ccf allowed us to determine the link between the flow pulse and fish abundance and identify the lag between the peak water peak and fish synchronisation the ccf thus allows us to identify the role of flood pulse in the dynamics of fish species in the tse at spatial and temporal scales acknowledgements we would like to express our sincere gratitude to the erasmus mundus

moved out of the floodplain and the lake earlier than h siamensis herein h lobatus retreats slower than h siamensis in the tonle sap lake but they retreated at similar speeds when they reach the tonle

frequency contents of the two time series and highlight the synchronicity of the series at a given period and across given ranges of time roesch and schmidbauer 2014a moreover the cross correlation function ccf has been used to determine the correlation between the two time series as a function of the time lag or delay zhang and wu 2006 it produces global correlation coefficients between two time series data at each lag these two modelling techniques are useful tools to assess the influence of environmental variables e g flow pulse on the spatial and temporal dynamics of fish species by using the cwt and ccf we studied the dynamics i e by means of occurrence synchronisation i e the collective swimming of fish individuals in a large school peak abundance and behavioural movement patterns of two small mud carp species i e h lobatus smith 1945 and h siamensis sauvage 1881 in the tse additionally we investigated the influence of water levels on their spatial and temporal dynamics our questions of interest are 1 is there any synchrony in occurrence between the two species and is there a constant periodic occurrence of each species e g re occurring monthly or seasonally or annually 2 how is the period of synchronisation and movement patterns of each species varied across the tse 3 is there any time lagged relationship between the synchronisation of each species and water levels since it has been shown that h lobatus and h siamensis have dissimilarities in ecological preferences and life history traits hurwood et al 2006 we expected distinct periods of the occurrence synchronisation and time lagged relationship to be observed for each species in different parts of the tse following the variation in water levels 2 materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions the study was carried out in the tse which is located in the northwest part of cambodia fig 1 the tse is a tropical flood pulse system due to its seasonal and predictable periodicity in hydrological flows in the wet season may october the water flows into the tsl through the tsr due to increased water levels in the mekong river whereas in the dry season november april a reverse flow occurs through the tsr again due to the receding water levels in the mekong river mrc 2005 the water levels highly vary between seasons the water depth ranges from 0 5 m in april dry season to 9 m in september october rainy season in 2011 one of the wettest years the maximum water level in the tsl was recorded at 9 9 m ngor et al 2018a this variation leads to a varied surface area of the tsl throughout the year and thus creates more heterogeneous habitats compared to the tsr mrc 2005 2 2 data collection and processing the fish data used in this study were provided by the mekong river commission mrc fisheries programme the fish catch monitoring approach follows the mrc s fish monitoring method applied in the lower mekong basin mrc 2008 ngor et al 2014 in the present study daily fish catch monitoring from january 2012 to december 2015 was selected from three sampling sites in the tse fig 1 in the northern tsl hereafter abbreviated to nl in the southern tsl sl and the in the outlet river or of the tsr fig 1 at each sampling site nylon gillnets with 2 to 6 5 cm mesh sizes were used to capture as many fish species as possible gillnets have been considered the most common and popular fishing gear used in the tse and are suitable to be applied in different habitat types mrc 2008 the gillnets used had a length of 400 m 100 m the variation in the gillnet length was due to the habitat availability e g inundated forest open water of the tsl rivers streams and creeks which varies according to the annual hydrological cycle fishes were identified to the species level following the identification guide by rainboth 1996 in cross checking with fishbase froese and pauly 2017 and kottelat 2013 and enumerated and recorded in a logbook the logbooks were then collected from fishers on a quarterly basis and cross checked for its correctness and completeness of the recorded data by research specialists unidentified species were later identified by an expert taxonomist in the laboratory in this study only two small mud carp species h lobatus and h siamensis were extracted from the fish monitoring database for analyses henicorhynchus spp are indeed among the most ecologically and economically important species in the tse fukushima et al 2014 mrc 2009 ngor et al 2015 they significantly contributed to sustaining livelihoods and food security in the country and in the region e g they make up the highest proportion 43 by weight of dai fishery catches in the tsr hall et al 2007 halls et al 2013 moreover henicorhynchus spp are of major importance to produce fish paste prahok smoked fish salted fish and fish sauce which can be kept for use particularly during rice cultivation periods and when wild fish is scarce hall et al 2007 halls et al 2013 mrc 2009 2002 the water level dataset used in this study was registered by the mrc the daily water levels were measured and recorded from two sites in the tsl and tsr fig 1 2 3 modelling techniques and analyses 2 3 1 modelling techniques the cwt can locally detect extract and reconstruct the relationship between two nonstationary signals in frequency and time grinsted et al 2004 the cwt of the two time series x t and y t with cross wavelet forms w x and w y respectively is calculated based on the formula w xy τ s 1 s w x τ s w y τ s where τ is the time localization and s is the scale factor that determines the characteristic frequency or wavelength and denotes the complex conjugate prokoph and bilali 2008 roesch and schmidbauer 2014a monte carlo simulation is a general post hoc analysis performed to provide frequency specific probability distributions the cwt provides an analogy of the cross correlation with localization in time and scale the correlation level between the two time series is measured using the cross wavelet power cwp which is measured according to the norm of w xy τ s p xy τ s w xy τ s when the two time series data have a high or a low cwp it means that they have a high or low correlation respectively the contour line revealed by the cwt indicates the significance of the joint time interval the interval of time containing a significant correlation between the two time series roesch and schmidbauer 2014a the phase angle describes the phase difference between the two time series data of which the phase difference of x over y at the time and scale is based on the formula angle τ s arg wave xy τ s roesch and schmidbauer 2014a the phase angle in an interval 3π 2 π 2 as shown by arrows pointing right and illustrates the in phase relationship whereas the phase angle in an interval π 2 3π 2 as shown by arrows pointing left and illustrates the anti phase or the out of phase relationship specifically when the arrows are pointing right up and left down and the first series leads the second and when the arrows are pointing left up and right down and the second series leads the first see roesch and schmidbauer 2014a for details the ccf is a bivariate method applied to analyze the global correlation between the two time series data the ccf is a promising method that can be used to determine a level of similarity or correlation between the two time series as a function of the time lag or delay zhang and wu 2006 the ccf produces correlation coefficients i e a positive and negative correlation between the two time series at each lag in the ccfs the input time series data represent the influential time series and the output time series data represent the affected time series welsh 1999 the ccf of the two time series xt and yt is given by c c f τ x t y t τ d t where the lag τ is the size of the time shift welsh 1999 in the ccf plot the length of the vertical line indicates the value of the correlation coefficient between the two time series at each lag the areas above and below the blue horizontal dashed line represent a significant positive correlation and a significant negative correlation respectively in other words the vertical line of the lag that is extended above the upper blue horizontal dashed line represents a significant positive correlation whereas the vertical line of the lag that is situated below the below blue horizontal dashed line represents a significant negative correlation between the two time series 2 3 2 data analyses the daily catch of the two species and water level data were summarised into a weekly basis based on mean comprising a total of 210 weeks over the whole timescale of the study for the three sites for each studied site the cwt was used to analyze occurrence correlation and recursivity e g a recursive occurrence at an interval over a particular timescale between the two time series data of h lobatus abundance x and h siamensis abundance y by utilising the function analyze coherency in the waveletcomp package of r roesch and schmidbauer 2014b internally the time series are standardised before they build the cwt the cwt analysis also allows the determination of whether h lobatus occurrence leads or lags h siamensis occurrence here the 95 conﬁdence interval was selected for the wavelet power as the signiﬁcance criterion practically the ability of the cwt to analyze coherency enabled us to highlight the co occurrence and synchronisation periodicity of the two species the ccfs were then employed to determine a period e g how many weeks when h lobatus synchronisation and peak abundance leads or lags those of h siamensis using the function ccf in the stats package of r to investigate how periods of synchronisation and peak abundance vary across the studied sites the ccfs were used to determine the time lagged relationship of the abundance of each species between paired sites e g h lobatus abundance in nl x and sl y the results of this analysis were then used to identify the movement patterns of each species e g a period it takes to migrate from nl to sl swimming speed km day of each species is therefore inferred from the time lags and distances between study sites finally the ccfs were also employed to examine the time lagged relationship between the water levels and the abundance of each species at each site in this analysis the water level data measured from site ws1 was analyzed with the fish data collected from the nl and sl sites whereas that from ws2 was analyzed with the fish data collected from the or site by the end of this analysis we were able to estimate the movement periods of both species e g how many weeks the peak water level leads or lags the peak abundance of each species here we selected the lag containing the highest correlation coefficients between the two time series as the time lag the ccf allowed us to determine the link between the flow pulse and fish abundance and identify the time lag between the water level peak and fish synchronisation the ccf thus enables the determination of the role of flood pulse in spatial and temporal dynamics of fish species in the tse to be made all statistical analyses were performed using r program v 3 3 3 for windows statistical software package http www r project org r core team 2017 3 results 3 1 occurrence correlations and periodicities there was a correlation between the occurrence of h lobatus and h siamensis and their periodic occurrence was also observed at each studied site fig 2 in nl a significant positive correlation meaning that h lobatus led h siamensis occurred at a high frequency periodicity of 46 9 52 weeks as indicated by the in phase relationship detected over the whole timescale of the study fig 2 supplementary material s1 in sl significant positive correlations were also observed at different periodicities fig 2 a rather weak but significant correlation that occurred at a high frequency periodicity of 46 9 52 weeks was observed for the whole timescale of study and strong correlations that occurred at low frequency periodicities 3 9 4 4 weeks were observed over a short timescale of study between late 2012 and early 2013 and between late 2014 and early 2015 in or significant positive and negative correlations were detected as indicated by the in and anti phase relationships of the cwt analysis respectively the results also indicated a significant positive correlation that occurred at the high frequency periodicities of 46 9 52 weeks stronger significant negative or positive correlations which occurred at the lower frequency periodicities 3 9 4 4 weeks were observed over three short timescales i e between december and february of the study fig 2 3 2 synchronisation peak abundance and movement patterns in nl significant synchronisation and peak abundance of h lobatus occurred within 6 weeks and 1 week respectively before those of h siamensis fig 3 in sl and or the synchronisation of h lobatus appeared to occur before that of h siamensis but the peak abundance of both species occurred in the same week fig 3 based on the paired sites the ccf bivariate plots fig 4 illustrated that after the peak abundance of h lobatus observed in nl it was detected again within 8 weeks in sl and again within 1 week in or after the peak abundance of h siamensis occurred in nl it was detected again within 2 weeks in sl and again within 1 week in or 3 3 the time lagged relationship with water levels the results of the ccfs revealed that the highest water level always led the peak abundance of both species the highest water level was 7 weeks ahead of the peak abundance of h lobatus in nl 14 weeks in sl and 15 weeks in or fig 5 on the other hand the highest water level led the synchronisation and peak abundance of h siamensis for 12 weeks in nl 14 weeks in sl and 13 weeks in or fig 6 summaries of the in and out flow pulses the peak water level the peak abundance of the two fish species and fish movement speed in the tsl are provided in fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 performance and applications of time series analyses the cwt and ccf play a significant role in our study explicitly the cwt enabled us to highlight the co occurrence and synchronisation of two species whereas the ccf allowed us to determine the link between the flow pulse and fish abundance and identify the time lag between the peak of water level and fish synchronisation the ccf thus allows us to identify the role of flood pulse in the dynamics of fish species in the tse at both time and space our results could increase our understanding of how a flood pulse system work the cwt and ccf are helpful tools for time series analysis to interpret how the flow pulse influences fish spatial and temporal dynamics these two time series modelling techniques provide complementary information for understanding the co occurrence synchronisation and movement patterns of both fish species in a tropical flood pulse ecosystem the data used in this study were collected on a daily basis for four years 2012 2015 and such high resolution data are rarely found in ecology these high resolution time series data are valuable to build the cwt and ccf to model the spatial and temporal dynamics of fish species therefore we believe that the results of this study can be used to improve flow pulse management and fishery resources conservation in the system 4 2 the role of flow pulse in the spatial and temporal dynamics of fishes we found a positive relationship of annual co occurrence pattern between the two species at each site by the high frequency periodicity of 46 9 to 52 weeks corresponding to a period between october and december however the most distinctive pattern was found in only nl as indicated by a very strong positive correlation fig 2 supplementary material s1 suggesting that the most active and dynamic annual co occurrence and synchronisation of the two species mainly happened in nl when their individuals are about to retreat to sl and then to or and finally to the mekong river for sl and or we found a strong and clear monthly co occurrence pattern from december through february as illustrated by the low frequency periodicity of 3 9 to 4 4 weeks in the cross wavelet analysis this means that the monthly cycle of increasing synchronisation and peak abundance and decreasing trends in the abundance of each species occurs every month from december to february apart from falling water level lunar phase appears to have a strong relationship with peak fish migration out of the tsl through the tsr as observed at the 100 year old dai fishery ngor et al 2018c therefore related flow pulse conditions play a key role in facilitating fish migrations e g migration for dry season refuges spawning and rearing feeding changes in flow pulse condition that caused by anthropogenic activities would disrupt spawning rearing and feeding success of fish and thus their natural stocks flow pulse is one of the main factors driving fish dynamics and their productions sverdrup jensen 2002 annual flow pulses i e rising and falling water levels play an important role in signalling fish migration and in opening up floodplain habitats for resources and fish reproduction poulsen et al 2004 2002 sverdrup jensen 2002 welcomme 1999 this pattern is also observed in our study as inferred by the leading flow pulse over fish migrations into the tsl the in flow pulse from the mekong river in the early wet season brings young individuals newly hatched and countless larvae of henicorhynchus spp to the tsl and its surround floodplain area that are covered by flooded forest shrub and aquatic vegetation campbell et al 2006 poulsen et al 2004 sverdrup jensen 2002 the area provides an array of food resources such as fruits algae aquatic vegetation and other macroinvertebrates i e molluscs insects and crustaceans sor et al 2017 additionally the in flow pulse also deposits a large volume of sediment flux into the tsl kummu et al 2005 which contains paramount nutrient resources e g phosphorus and nitrate contents supporting the food webs in the tonle sap ecosystem as a whole sarkkula et al 2004 2003 the rich resources combined with large living space and stable environment in the tse enhance the outburst of fish growth including young individuals of h lobatus and h siamensis particularly for the period from five to six months following the first in flow pulse poulsen 2003 during the dry season as expected falling water lead to a more spontaneous response of small short bodied fishes we found that the out flow pulse triggers the retreat of each species to the mekong river differently within the tsl the out flow pulse prompts the retreat of h lobatus from nl to sl 7 weeks after the peak flow with the swimming speed of 2 3 km day whereas h siamensis retreated 12 weeks after the peak flow with swimming speed of 7 9 km day figs 4 7 in the small route from sl to the or individuals of the two species retreat with more or less the same speed i e 1 week or 16 km day this movement patterns could be explained by the heterogeneous and homogeneous habitats observed in the floodplain of the tsl and the river channel respectively moreover the speed of the out flow pulse can also influence the retreat of each species to the mekong river as such after the out flow pulse begins the species synchronise and migrate in a large school back to the tsl then the tsr and finally to the mekong river for the dry season refuges and possibly for the spawning grounds upstream degrandchamp et al 2007 ngor et al 2018b our results further suggest that during the period of migrating out of the tse h lobatus but not h siamensis prefers moving to different habitats floodplain areas within the tsl where possible retreating along with the gradually decreased water levels besides the two species share similar movement patterns in the rivers that are characterised by a smaller passage and less variation in habitat characteristics therefore all these flow pulse related conditions play a key role in facilitating adult fish recruitment which can guarantee an increased abundance of fish species observed at 5 months after the in flow pulse begins as observed in our study and by poulsen 2003 4 3 monitoring and management perspectives understanding the occurrence synchronisation and movement patterns of fish species and the influence of water level variation on their spatial and temporal dynamics provides useful knowledge to better understand fish species migration and behavioural ecology løkkeborg et al 2002 mcgill et al 2006 peoples and frimpong 2016 pollock et al 2014 ruetz et al 2005 this knowledge can be used to support more effective monitoring management and conservation efforts at local and larger spatial and temporal scales for instance the timing of the retreat of the two species identified in this study delivers useful insights that can be used to support regulations and policy initiatives aiming for better management and conservation of the two species good initiatives will allow adult individuals to complete the next step of their life cycle i e to freely pass through the tsr during their peak abundance these individuals can consequently reach the refuge spawning rearing and feeding grounds in the upstream portions of the mekong river and its major tributaries and can thus sustain the annual production furthermore our findings can act as a fundamental baseline for investigations of other economically and ecologically important species in the case that further studies investigating different keystone species find similar synchronisation and peak abundance periods and similar movement patterns and timing in their retreats these results will together provide key knowledge to support better monitoring and management of fisheries resources in the tse also the spatial and temporal dynamics of fish are found to be fine turned with the natural flow pulse variation maintaining such conditions are therefore necessary for fish species to migrate to complete their life cycles human actions such as hydropower dams that alter natural flow pulses of the mekong i e change in flow seasonality and predictability is highly likely to also alter fish assemblage structure and their composition fish migration patterns and spawning decisions which consequently have severe implication on fish reproductive rearing and feeding successes ngor et al 2018b finally our study demonstrated that the cwt and ccf are useful time series modelling approaches for investigating the phase relationship joint periodicity and the time lagged relationship between environmental parameters e g water level and fish species in the flood pulse ecosystems 5 conclusions investigating the spatial and temporal dynamics of fish species enables ecologists and fisheries managers to better understand variation in their occurrence synchronisation peak abundance and movement patterns and the key factors driving such variation by using modern time series modelling approaches i e the cwt and ccfs to analyze high resolution time series data we found that for this study the two small mud carp species can co occur together but the synchronisation and movements of h lobatus always lead those of h siamensis the annual re occurrence a long periodicity of each species was detected in nl between october and december while their monthly re occurrence a short periodicity was mainly observed in or from december to february moreover after water recession in the tsl h lobatus individuals began to retreat earlier than h siamensis individuals however the former species retreats 2 3 km day slower than the latter species 7 9 km day but they retreated at similar speeds when they reached the outlet river tsr at 16 km day these patterns were found to correspond to the variation in water levels across the tse suggesting that the flow pulse is one of the main factors responsible for the spatial and temporal dynamics of the small mud carp species in the tse therefore the seasonality and predictability of the mekong river should be maintained to sustain the natural dynamics of fish species e g the periods of recruitment synchronisation peak abundance and movements that have long developed and adapted to such a flood pulse system the timing of migration and swimming speed of the two species identified in this study should be an important part of regulation or policy consideration to better manage and conserve the two species the ability of the cwt to analyze coherency enabled us to highlight the co occurrence and synchronisation periodicity of two species whereas the ccf allowed us to determine the link between the flow pulse and fish abundance and identify the lag between the peak water peak and fish synchronisation the ccf thus allows us to identify the role of flood pulse in the dynamics of fish species in the tse at spatial and temporal scales acknowledgements we would like to express our sincere gratitude to the erasmus mundus

25141,the urban heat island uhi effect is one of the main environmental impacts of urbanization affecting directly human health and well being of the city dwellers and also contributing to worsen environmental quality as a key strategy to address sustainable urban development the eu has advocated the development of nature based solutions such as the implementation of green infrastructure gi which can deliver a wide range of regulating ecosystem services es in this article the es of climate regulation provided by gi has been analyzed in the municipality of rome italy characterized by a complex territory and by a mediterranean climate the methodological approach allowed to characterize the uhi and to analyze its features in a spatially explicit way and on a seasonal basis through the land surface temperature lst derived from landsat 8 data the cooling capacity of different gi elements peri urban forest urban forest street trees as well as the effect of vegetation cover and tree diversity on the provision of this regulating es were assessed the results show that gi significantly mitigates the hot urban climate during summer with an effect that is dependent on the gi element and the environmental constrains to which it is exposed ndvi and tree cover resulted the main indicators of the provision of the es of climate regulation highlighting that gi elements such as urban and peri urban forests have the highest potential to provide this es in a mediterranean city in the context of the mapping and assessment of ecosystems and their services maes process our results lend support to claims that gi is important for an ecosystem based climate adaptation strategy in urban environments contributing to the definition of knowledge based criteria and indicators relevant for decision making in mediterranean cities keywords land surface temperature urban heat island urban and peri urban forests street trees climate regulation nature based solution 1 introduction urbanization has shown a rapid upward trend during the last sixty years the global urban population has grown from 751 million in 1950 to 4 2 billion in 2018 due to the overall population growth and to the mass movement of people from rural areas to cities it is projected to further increase by another 2 5 billion by 2050 in europe 74 of population currently lives in cities and towns making it the third most urbanized region of the world after north america and latin america koceva et al 2016 urban areas in the eu are characterized by high concentrations of economic activities employment and wealth but this is often accompanied by high pollution levels and other forms of environmental impact indeed rapid urbanization led to dramatic land consumption with the conversion of agricultural fields and natural green spaces into artificial surfaces a phenomenon known as soil sealing eea 2006 morabito et al 2017 in this regard the european commission has proposed the eu environment action programme to 2020 advocating new policies in place in order to halt anthropogenic soil sealing and to achieve no net land take by 2050 european commission 2016 by modifying land cover soil sealing affects matter and energy flow in urban ecosystems and it is recognized to be one of the main drivers of the urban heat island uhi effect uhi can be described as a distinct urban climate characterized by higher temperatures both daytime and night time in built up areas than in the surrounding natural environment oke 1982 measured uhi intensities for different cities around the world range from 4 c in athens and sidney up to 12 c in the megacity of tokyo phelan et al 2015 uhi is a complex phenomenon resulting from the different albedo thermal emissivity three dimensional configuration and heat capacity of the grey infrastructure e g streets and buildings in respect to natural and rural land cover schwarz et al 2012 as well as from heat released from anthropogenic sources i e vehicles residential air conditioners and industries di leo et al 2016 uhi can be quantified by measurements of air temperature tair at the urban canopy level i e from the ground up to building level however tair is not available in a spatially continuous way within a city but only in correspondence of a limited number of monitoring sites in order to analyze temperature distribution over larger areas an indirect but spatially explicit method for uhi estimation has been introduced based on remotely sensed land surface temperature lst lst is correlated to tair in the same sampling site and can be used for the calculation of the surface urban heat island suhi a uhi that is assessed through lst schwarz et al 2012 uhi can have many detrimental implications for the urban socio ecological system phelan et al 2015 since higher tair not only affects directly human health and well being of the city dwellers particularly during heat waves koppe et al 2004 but it also contributes to worsen environmental quality it has been found that uhi contributed to around 50 of the total heat related mortality during the 2003 heat wave in the west midlands uk heaviside et al 2016 while in rome italy a significant increase 16 9 in mortality of people older than 75 years was observed during the same heat wave conti et al 2005 furthermore uhi negatively affects air quality by favoring the formation of photochemical smog the accumulation of particulate matter due to poor horizontal air dispersion and subsidence lai 2018 increases energy consumption for summer building cooling santamouris et al 2018 and exacerbates heat stress on living organisms thus affecting biodiversity and ecosystem functioning grimm et al 2008 the european commission has recently identified the enhancement of sustainable urbanization as a priority target which can be achieved through the development within cities of nature based solutions i e living solutions inspired by continuously supported by and using nature european commission 2015 the concept of nature based solutions thus brings nature and natural processes into cities aiming to address environmental and socio ecological challenges through locally adapted resource efficient and systemic interventions maes and jacobs 2017 escobedo et al 2018 one of the most effective nature based solution for sustainable urban growth is the creation and enhancement of the urban green infrastructure gi defined as a network of natural semi natural and artificial green spaces delivering a wide range of ecosystem services es european commission 2013 tzoulas et al 2007 in european cities the main gi elements are represented by urban and peri urban forests i e woodlands located inside the city core and in its immediate surroundings respectively street trees i e stand alone trees on roadsides surrounded by paved ground and other green spaces such as lawns bolund and hunhammar 1999 besides improving air quality through the reduction of gaseous and particulate pollution fusaro et al 2017 manes et al 2012 marando et al 2016 gi provides significant mitigating effect on uhi and associated health risk coronel et al 2015 escobedo et al 2015 di leo et al 2016 norton et al 2015 this is known as the es of climate regulation cices code 2 2 6 2 haines young and potschin 2018 and depends on different processes the most important of which is evapotranspiration oke 1982 through evapotranspiration energy from solar radiation absorbed by leaves is converted into latent rather than sensible heat flux thus lowering canopy temperature as well as the surrounding air temperature bowler et al 2010 rahman et al 2017 gi and in particular urban forests and trees can also lower air temperature by intercepting solar radiation thus preventing the underlying surface to absorb shortwave radiation a process known as shading effect bowler et al 2010 based on these processes air temperature in urban green spaces can be from 1 3 c up to 5 7 c cooler than the nearby built up areas and this effect can also extend to the surroundings cohen et al 2012 feyisa et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 therefore the enhancement of gi represents an effective mitigation tool to reduce uhi particularly in hot summer conditions such as those typically occurring under mediterranean climate shashua bar et al 2010 zardo et al 2017 despite the large amount of literature promoting the benefits of gi for climate mitigation knowledge based criteria and indicators relevant for decision making at city specific scale need to be further implemented a key aspect is represented by the quantification of the mitigating role exerted by different gi elements on uhi particularly in mediterranean areas indeed most studies carried out in mediterranean cities have focused on the cooling effects of single gi elements such as small parks zoulia et al 2009 shashua bar et al 2010 oliveira et al 2011 skoulika et al 2014 while comprehensive analyses across rural urban transects at city wide scale are still scarce mariani et al 2016 furthermore in order to ensure consistency between gi planning and sustainable urban growth capotorti et al 2017 it is necessary to quantify the effect of vegetation structure and composition on the es of climate regulation provided urban and peri urban green areas in this context this work aims at i characterizing the uhi suhi phenomenon in the mediterranean city of rome italy ii assessing the mitigating role that different gi elements namely urban and peri urban forests and street trees exert on suhi iii quantifying the effect of vegetation cover and tree diversity on the provision of this regulating es the approach is based on the integration of analyses carried out at different spatial temporal scale allowed to assess the uhi suhi phenomenon as well as and the mitigating role of urban gi across the complex territory that characterizes the municipality of rome 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and vegetation characteristics the municipality of rome 41 53 35 n 12 28 58 e fig 1 is the capital of italy and lies over an area of 129 000 ha with a mean altitude of 20 m above sea level with around 2 872 800 inhabitants and a population density of approximately 2231 inhabitants km2 istat 2017 it is the most populated municipality of italy it is characterized by a heterogeneous territory due to its complex history and geomorphological features such as volcanic structures the tiber alluvial plain and a coastal plain it is surrounded by the tyrrhenian sea on the south west whereas the central apennine runs along its northern borders the climate is mediterranean the average temperature is around 15 c with an average annual rainfall of 839 mm blasi 2001 but extreme events such as heat waves and flooding are becoming more frequent and may also increase in the future world health organization and united nations 2018 the area has undergone intense landscape modifications over time the urban dispersion phenomenon contributed to a great extent to the decentralization of the city and to an increment in suburban infrastructure munafò et al 2010 currently the largest part of the city is covered by agricultural areas around 55 followed by sealed cover 22 but it is nevertheless rich in urban green areas such as historical villas urban and peri urban forests and natural reserves such as the castelporziano presidential estate 6000 ha the municipality of rome has an incidence of urban green and protected areas over 18 7 above the average if compared to the other italian cities furthermore in the 2011 2014 period rome has incremented the surface of urban green spaces by a total of 1 9 million m2 istat 2016 2 2 conceptual modeling approach fig 2 describes the flowchart of the methodology applied in this study firstly we characterized the uhi phenomenon in the municipality of rome on a diurnal and nocturnal basis by calculating uhi indicators from air temperatures data retrieved from available weather stations over the 2013 2017 period detailed under paragraph 2 3 in parallel different elaborations on spatially explicit data were performed the seasonal lst was estimated on the basis of 4 summer and 4 winter landsat 8 oli tirs images ranging from 2013 to 2017 table 1 and a land cover based emissivity map by means of a model paragraph 2 4 the spatial characteristics of the suhi phenomenon were then analyzed by computing four year average lst maps for summer and winter and analyzing lst variation between land uses green and urban as well as along a rural urban transect fig 1 paragraph 2 5 the cooling capacity of different gi elements urban and peri urban forests street trees was analyzed by means of a buffer analysis on lst paragraph 2 6 finally the role of land cover features and structural and functional characteristics of vegetation on the es of climate regulation was investigated by using a regression model whose independent variables were obtained from different data sources and ultimately integrated in the sampling paragraph 2 7 2 3 urban heat island estimation based on air temperatures following schwarz et al 2012 a land cover driven approach was used to calculate the uhi intensity from air temperature data this approach determines uhi indicators from air temperatures difference between urban and rural weather stations defining a priori urban i e built up surfaces and their surroundings and rural i e agricultural or natural stations by means of land cover data accordingly hourly air temperature data tair recoded from 01 01 2013 to 31 12 2017 were collected from 3 weather stations located within the municipality of rome in areas characterized by different land cover fig 1 via boncompagni al007 urban station is located in the city centre 35 km from the coast and castel di guido al004 rural station is located in a rural area 20 km w from the city centre 10 km from the shoreline and both belong to the micrometeorological network of the regional agency for environmental protection arpa lazio the third station castelporziano castello natural station is instead located around 20 km sw from the city centre 8 5 km from the shoreline within the castelporziano presidential estate a natural peri urban forest characterized by several ecosystems fares et al 2009 manes et al 1997 tair displayed a similar temporal trend dynamic in all sites showing peak values at the beginning of august around doy 216 220 and minimum values between mid december and early february around doy 350 40 see supplementary figure s1 in order to derive uhi intensity hourly tair differences δtair c between the urban and the rural weather station δtairu r as well as between the urban and the natural station δtairu n were computed for each year and then averaged on a daily and nightly basis over the 2013 2017 period 2 4 land surface temperature lst retrieval model eight landsat 8 oli tirs images for the area of the municipality of rome path row 191 31 wgs84 utm33 n reference system were downloaded from the united states geological survey usgs website cloud free images were acquired for a time period ranging from july 2013 to august 2017 in summer and winter months table 1 in order to investigate seasonal trends since suhi effect varies across seasons imhoff et al 2010 and to allow comparison amongst different years the elaborations were performed with different open source software qgis grass gis radiometric calibration and correction for atmospheric effects through dark object subtraction dos1 were performed through the semi automatic classification plugin implemented in qgis scp congedo and macchi 2015 in order to retrieve surface reflectance following the methodology developed by weng et al 2004 band 10 30 m spatial resolution was then converted to at satellite brightness temperature tb c following eq 1 usgs 2018 1 t b k 2 ln k 1 l λ 1 273 15 where k1 and k2 are band specific thermal conversion constants measured in w m2 sr μm and k respectively lλ is the spectral radiance at the sensor s aperture measured in w m2 sr μm and 273 15 is the conversion factor from k to c tb was then used for land surface temperature lst c retrieval according to eq 2 weng et al 2004 2 l s t t b 1 λ t b c 2 ln ε where λ is the wavelength of the emitted radiance c2 is the planck s second radiation constant 1 4388 10 2 mk and ε is the land surface emissivity the emissivity values for ε were retrieved from literature data li et al 2004 mallick et al 2012 and applied to different land cover classes weng et al 2004 sheng et al 2017 in particular 4 land cover classes were identified built up vegetation water bodies and bare soil areas built up areas were identified using the national soil consumption dataset developed by ispra for the year 2016 at a spatial resolution of 10 m such dataset is based on the copernicus high resolution layer for imperviousness and further improved in resolution and thematic accuracy including other elements of soil consumption through a combination of semi automatic high resolution satellite classification and local datasets copernicus 2018 ispra 2018 to identify the other land cover classes after conversion to surface reflectance bands 4 and 5 of two landsat 8 oli tirs images for summer and winter 2016 since no significant changes in land cover classes are expected in the period ranging from 2013 to 2017 were used to calculate ndvi as nir r nir r vegetated areas were located where a threshold value of 0 3 was exceeded this threshold was chosen following weier and herring 2011 esau et al 2016 and telesca and lasaponara 2006 accordingly areas with positive ndvi values lower than 0 3 were then assigned to the class of bare soil areas water bodies were identified for ndvi values below 0 2 5 spatial analysis of suhi to investigate the spatial characteristics of the suhi phenomenon average lst maps for the city of rome were computed for winter and summer for each season the four images listed in table 1 were considered to produce this map the average value for each pixel in summer and winter respectively was obtained furthermore in order to investigate the effect of vegetation on the suhi and its inter annual variability a stratified random sampling was applied to each image and lst for urban n 149 pixels and green n 149 pixels areas was collected these two land covers were identified by means of corine land cover year 2012 urban corresponds to class 1 1 urban fabric 1 2 industrial commercial and transport unit and 1 3 mine dump and construction sites whereas green corresponds to class 3 1 forests and 1 4 1 green urban areas finally the summer and the winter images for the year 2016 were used to analyze lst variation along a rural urban sw ne transect samples distance 60 m ranging from the coast to the northern part of the city fig 1 the sw ne direction was selected in order to take into account different gi elements i e the large peri urban forest of the castelporziano estate and a urban forest villa ada savoia as well as agricultural lands different urban textures and water bodies the year 2016 was chosen because on average its lst falls within a mean range for the study area 2 6 assessment of summer cooling capacity of different gi elements the mitigating role of different gi elements on summer lst was evaluated by mean of a buffer analysis three different gi elements were selected castelporziano presidential estate as peri urban forest a natural area of almost 6000 ha characterized by deciduous and evergreen mediterranean forests manes et al 1997 villa ada savoia as urban forest one of the largest urban park 180 ha in the highly urbanized rome city center including a fairly well preserved evergreen and deciduous urban forest that plays an important recreational role for dwellers fusaro et al 2015 viale mazzini as street trees 480 x 38 m a quercus ilex l tree lined avenue characterized by elevated vehicular traffic in a highly urbanized context consecutive buffers of 10 m width were used to analyze lst variation from the boundary of each gi element to a maximum distance of 300 m towards the built up area then the lst average difference between each buffer and the gi inner core δlst c was calculated for the four summer images years 2013 2017 table 1 the cooling capacity of each gi element was then evaluated both in terms of lst decrease c and maximum cooling distance from the boundary of the gi element by identifying the first turning point of the buffer temperature yu et al 2017 2 7 assessment of factors affecting the es of climate regulation provided by gi nine polygonal plots of 180 ha each characterized by different features in terms of land cover textures and position inside the metropolitan area were sampled across the municipality fig 1 five plots include mainly built up areas with different urbanization density salario and city centre are two dense built up areas located in the central part of the municipality termini is a highly urbanized neighborhood characterized by the presence of the main railway station of rome infernetto and olgiata are residential areas made up of detached and semi detached houses and small green areas the other four polygonal plots include vegetated and agricultural areas marcigliana is located in the north eastern sector of the city in a rural area including cultivated and uncultivated lands as well as patches of natural vegetation villa ada was chosen in correspondence of the villa ada savoia an urban forest surrounded by a deeply urbanized area that includes the salario urban plot other two plots named castelporziano 1 and castelporziano 2 are located inside the large castelporziano peri urban forest average summer and winter lst c in the different polygonal plots are reported in supplementary table 1 in order to identify the factors that explain lst variation by season a regular grid composed by cells of one hectare size each was used to sample different variables that affect lst in the nine plots the considered variables were

3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of uhi and suhi in the municipality of rome 3 1 1 uhi estimation through air temperatures the air circulation in the municipality of rome during high pressure summer conditions is dominated by the sea land breeze regime typical of mediterranean coastal areas fares et al 2009 which is known to interact with uhi in a complex way cenedese and monti 2003 nastran et al 2018 in spring and summer during the day tair of the urban station was on average around 1 c higher than the rural and natural ones fig 3 a c this uhi magnitude is in the range of what previously described for other coastal mediterranean cities in thessaloniki greece giannaros and melas 2012 reported that maximum uhi intensity ranged from 2 to 4 c during the warm part of the year while in barcelona spain salvati et al 2017 reported a maximum average uhi around 1 7 c in summer interestingly such uhi was even more evident by considering nighttime tair fig 3b d despite the nocturnal air movement of the study area is dominated by land sea breeze fares et al 2009 in particular average nocturnal tair recorded in the urban site were 1 85 and 2 15 c higher than that measured in the rural station in spring and summer respectively fig 3b and this difference was even higher considering the natural site of castelporziano 2 81 and 3 17 c in spring and summer respectively fig 3d the nocturnal uhi is known to exert a stronger detrimental effect on human wellbeing and building energy use than the diurnal one zhang et al 2017 fig 1 allows to highlight the different presence and extension of the peri urban forests between the site adjacent to the castel di guido weather station and that of castelporziano it is possible to hypothesize that the differences of temperature observed for these two sites with the urban station which are higher for the castelporziano site can be attributed to the regulating es of climate mitigation provided by vegetation mariani et al 2016 therefore the nocturnal cooling service provided by the large castelporziano peri urban forest during hot summer months particularly july and august appears of particular importance vaz monteiro et al 2016 as for winter months tair of the castel di guido rural site was on average similar or slightly higher than that of the urban site during both night and day average δtairu r 0 06 and 0 45 c for day and night respectively considering the natural site of castelporziano as reference instead the nighttime uhi was also evident during winter average δtair u n 0 13 and 1 08 c for day and night respectively coherently with what reported for thessaloniki greece giannaros and melas 2012 3 1 2 spatial characteristics of the suhi suhi is widely used as a proxy of uhi since although absolute values are not comparable due to the different data acquisition and information content of the two indicators satellite derived lst vs ground based tair respectively many studies have shown that suhi and uhi are significantly correlated chen et al 2012 feyisa et al 2014 schwarz et al 2012 suhi can therefore be used to analyze the spatial characteristics of urban heat island and the cooling capacity of gi within a city average summer lst values fig 4 a range from 27 5 to 50 2 c in correspondence of the most sealed surfaces in the city centre and in residential and industrial areas lst values range from around 39 to 43 c the highest values up to 50 2 c can be found for bare soils and uncultivated lands particularly present in the eastern part of the metropolitan area fig 1 previous studies have shown that in arid and semi arid cities bare soils i e agricultural soils and sandy surfaces with no vegetation cover around the urban area can show higher lst than the urban surface itself especially during the morning haashemi et al 2016 lazzarini et al 2013 this effect is due to the low heat capacity and conductivity of such soils which are heated more quickly by the morning sun than the artificial surfaces within the urban area we argue that this phenomenon has happened in our study too since landsat 8 images in the rome area are acquired around 10 00 am both during summer and winter therefore beyond land use types geographical location geomorphological features climatic situation seasons and times of day should be taken into account when performing satellite analysis of suhi on the other hand the lowest lst values are displayed by large green areas such as the peri urban forest of castelporziano presidential estate around 28 c and urban parks inside the city such as the urban forest of villa ada around 32 33 c as for average winter lst fig 4b it is interesting to highlight that no clear suhi effect was evident coherently with what observed using tair measured by weather stations fig 3 winter lst values range from around 5 to 17 c with most values ranging from around 8 5 to 11 c temperatures that are displayed by large areas of the urban texture values up to 15 17 c can again be found in correspondence of bare soils annual crops and coastal sandy dunes whereas values for urban and peri urban forests are generally lower ranging from 5 c in the northern part of the city to 8 9 c in natural areas such as castelporziano where the proximity of the sea can mitigate cold winter temperatures 3 2 land cover based analysis of lst 3 2 1 effect of vegetation on lst mean summer lst for green pixels table 2 a ranged from 32 36 2 21 c for the year 2013 to 33 43 2 60 c for the year 2015 with an average summer value of 33 10 2 99 whereas urban areas average summer lst ranged from 36 21 2 53 c for the year 2017 to 40 87 2 48 c for the year 2015 with an average summer value of 40 48 2 92 c as regards winter temperatures green areas mean lst range from 4 45 0 87 c for the year 2017 to 12 01 1 04 c for the year 2014 and an average winter lst equal to 9 08 3 10 c average winter lst for urban areas show a minimum of 5 64 1 40 c in the year 2017 and a maximum of 12 98 1 47 c in the year 2014 and an overall lst of 9 91 3 15 c for the winter season green areas display significantly lower temperatures than urban areas p 0 05 for all the considered years and for both the overall summer and winter seasons from the repeated measures anova table 2b a significant effect of the year and year land cover is also highlighted p 0 001 showing that lst values differ significantly in relation to different years and land cover this is in accordance to what pointed out previously by yuan and bauer 2007 who found that the percentage of impervious surface has a strong linear relation with lst for all the seasons while sheng et al 2015 reported that satellite based lst is significantly influenced by the presence of vegetation this result suggest the importance of the green areas in the mitigation of the urban climate and in a broader sense to improve environmental quality and human wellbeing particularly during hot summer conditions that are typical of mediterranean cities diffenbaugh et al 2007 3 2 2 rural urban transect fig 5 shows the lst along the rural urban transect 38 km see fig 1 for both summer in red left axis and winter in blue right axis such remotely sensed lst provided as spatially continuous data over a whole city or region allows highlighting the relations between the urban area and the surrounding landscape this is particularly important for studying the uhi since both the temperature drivers of the urban area and of the surrounding landscape must be taken into account heinl et al 2015 the summer transect clearly highlights the uhi phenomenon showing a progressive increase of lst from the sw natural and agricultural zones towards the city centre hidalgo et al 2008 lst values range from 26 to 32 c in correspondence of the castelporziano peri urban forest to 36 45 c in the built up area with a maximum difference of around 15 20 c in lst between peri urban and urban areas in the city centre between 30 35 km from the starting point of the transect large decreases in lst can be observed in correspondence to the villa ada urban forest as well as to water bodies as regards the winter transect no clear heat island effect is evident and temperature variations between rural and urban areas are less pronounced it is noteworthy that lst within the castelporziano presidential estate tends to increase from coastline towards inlands during summer while an opposite trend is observed in winter suggesting a mitigating role on cold air temperatures carried out by the sea sakakibara and owa 2005 more marked lst fluctuations along the transect during summer suggest that vegetation and in particular urban and peri urban forests exert a greater impact on suhi mitigation compared to winter as already shown in fig 4 bare soil areas located from 10 to 5 km sw and ne from the built up areas display higher lst than urban settlements for both seasons 3 3 summer cooling capacity of different gi elements the three considered gi elements namely peri urban forest castelporziano presidential estate urban forest villa ada savoia and street trees viale mazzini display a different cooling capacity during summer both in terms of temperature decrease of the surrounding urban area and of cooling distance from the boundary of the gi element fig 6 the large peri urban forest and the urban forest were in the considered years 2 5 3 1 c and 2 8 3 2 c cooler first 10 m buffer than their surroundings respectively this cooling intensity is in the range of what reported for other mediterranean cities such as tel aviv potchter et al 2006 cohen et al 2012 and athens zoulia et al 2009 skoulika et al 2014 thus supporting the conclusion that gi are highly efficient in mitigating summer urban heat island under mediterranean climatic conditions zardo et al 2017 the buffer analysis also highlights that for castelporziano the cooling effect on lst extends up to 170 m with no relevant differences between years fig 6a indicating a high functional stability of the large peri urban forest despite this is a relatively short distance effect coherent with previous works considering lst yu et al 2017 it must be underlined that the corresponding effect on air temperature could be higher indeed for a much smaller park 6 ha in athens skoulika et al 2014 reported a cooling effect on tair extending up to 300 m as for the villa ada urban forest the maximum cooling distance of this gi element shows noticeable inter annual differences it extends up to 100 m during 2013 2015 and 2016 while a turning point in the δlst is already evident 50 m away from the park boundaries during 2017 fig 6b this lower cooling effect can be explained by considering that during summer 2017 central italy has been affected by an intense drought and heat wave which caused diffuse damages to forest ecosystems i e early foliar shedding and desiccation of leaves and branches pollastrini et al 2018 besides the direct effects of severe drought on the evapotranspiration potential and on leaf area production i e reduced ndvi manes et al 1997 such damages reduce both the evaporative cooling and the canopy shading capacity of trees it can be argued that differently from what observed for the natural peri urban forest of castelporziano the stressful conditions of the urban environment i e higher tair and vpd presence of air pollutants shallow soils with lower water availability may have further reduced the functionality of the urban forest fusaro et al 2015 thus exacerbating the negative effects of the summer 2017 heat wave in this context management practices aimed at enhancing soil water availability for example by an appropriate irrigation schedule in urban parks or by the amelioration of soil structure and texture in newly planned gi mariani et al 2016 could substantially help in increasing the climate regulation potential of urban gi this is particularly relevant in mediterranean environments where during summer months water availability already represents a limiting factor for vegetation growth and functionality manes et al 1997 finally the street trees of viale mazzini avenue are around 1 3 c cooler than the first 10 m buffer of built up area and their influence is extended up to 30 m from the borders of this linear gi element with no difference between years fig 6c this lower cooling capacity in respect to that of urban and peri urban forests could be due to different factors such as the smaller size of the gi element or its lower canopy cover i e lower ndvi data not shown yu et al 2017 furthermore while urban and peri urban forests grow on unpaved soils street trees have most of their roots confined in a small planting pit surrounded by sealed soils indeed impermeable pavements reduce evaporative cooling from soil potentially decreasing also plant transpiration of adult trees fini et al 2017 thus directly affecting the cooling capacity of the gi element it is however worth to underline that the cooling effect of street trees although small is not negligible appearing important for improving local microclimate in highly urbanized neighborhoods within the city core shashua bar et al 2010 particularly during the hot mediterranean summer conditions 3 4 role of land cover features and vegetation characteristics on the es of climate mitigation stepwise multiple linear regression was applied to investigate how changes in land cover features obtained from the polygonal plots are able to describe the seasonal changes in lst observed in the municipality of rome in the 2013 2017 period the results show a high predictive capacity for the summer model with a determination coefficient scored at 0 75 p 0 01 table 3 a in this model ndvi owns the best predictive performance followed by the surface covered by trees m2 trees r2 stepwise increase 0 066 these two variables showed a negative relationship with lst indicating that the more trees with high canopy cover in a green area the more effective it will be in providing the es of climate regulation indeed previous studies have shown that lst is strongly correlated with ndvi as well as with other vegetation indices linked to canopy cover such as leaf area index hardin and jensen 2007 gi elements such as urban and peri urban forests have therefore the highest potential to provide the es of climate regulation in urban areas if compared to other vegetation types such as meadows or hedges skelhorn et al 2014 the distance from the city center c dist is another important factor showing a negative relationship with summer lst r2 stepwise increase 0 039 suggesting that due to the uhi phenomenon green areas closer to the urban core should be particularly efficient in order to provide the es of climate regulation since the demand for this es is higher in the city centre were both population and urbanization density are highest lafortezza and giannico 2017 this aspect is of particular policy relevance and should be taken into account for planning new gi elements targeted at mitigating uhi in the different sectors of the city of rome the distance from the tiber river r dist and the urban surface cover m2 urban have instead a very little influence on summer lst r2 increase 0 002 and 0 001 respectively while the number of tree functional groups fg in each cell is not significant at all r2 increase 0 this latter results is of some interest previous studies have in fact shown that the provision of several regulating es such as the air quality improvement by gi is positively affected by tree diversity particularly under mediterranean climatic conditions manes et al 2012 2016 although further studies are needed to better elucidate the relationship between diversity level and es mori et al 2017 our result seems to suggest that this relationship may not be so determinant for the provision of the es of climate regulation by urban gi at least in the city specific conditions of the studied area as for the winter model its predictive capacity on lst although significant p 0 01 was very low r2 0 091 table 3b this result confirms the absence of a daytime uhi in winter as already highlighted by the analysis of tair fig 3a c by the spatial analysis of lst fig 4b as well as by the rural urban transect fig 5 sheng et al 2017 have also found such a difference between summer and winter suggesting that the summer uhi suhi phenomenon may be predominant under several climatic conditions 4 conclusions in the context of the mapping and assessment of ecosystems and their services maes process maes et al 2016 this work has investigated the es of climate regulation cices code 2 2 6 2 haines young and potschin 2018 delivered by gi in the metropolitan area of rome italy our integrated approach has shown that a uhi phenomenon is evident in rome during the hot mediterranean summer conditions and such summer uhi can be mitigated by gi the cooling capacity differed between the considered gi elements with peri urban forest showing the highest temperature reduction and cooling distance followed by urban forest and street trees at this regard specific management policies appear necessary for a cost effective improvement of the cooling capacity of gi elements located closer to the urban core were the demand for the es of climate regulation is higher but plant functionality can be limited by environmental constraints fusaro et al 2015 these include appropriate irrigation schedules as well as the amelioration of soil structure and texture in the newly planned gi on the same time considering the continuous growth of urban areas towards their rural surroundings catalàn et al 2008 the importance of peri urban forests in terms of es provision should be also recognized preserving and expanding them as possible in view of a sustainable urban growth finally the multiple linear regression model have showed that firstly the ndvi and then the surface covered by trees that affect evapotranspiration and shading are the main indicators of the provision of the es of climate regulation by gi highlighting again that gi elements such as urban and peri urban forests have the highest potential to provide this es in a mediterranean city interestingly differently from what reported for other regulating es climate regulation resulted unaffected by tree diversity at least in the city specific conditions of the studied area during the summer season our results lend support to claims that gi is important for an ecosystem based climate adaptation strategy in urban environments contributing to the definition of knowledge based criteria and indicators relevant for decision making in mediterranean cities at this regard some limitation of this study have to be highlighted which need to be addressed in future researches the most important is the lack of identification of the minimum sized treed area that is needed to effectively reduce temperature to acceptable levels for human wellbeing in fact this quantification would have required the analysis of many different gi elements with different sizes from very small to very large that are not available in our study area due to the use of satellite derived lst in this study it has been also impossible to quantify the mitigating effect of gi on the nocturnal summer uhi which has resulted particularly important for the city of rome for this quantification tair data measured in a spatially continuous way are required thus highlighting the need to implement existing weather monitoring network within the city as well as in its surroundings finally the role of tree diversity in the provision of es of climate regulation

25141,the urban heat island uhi effect is one of the main environmental impacts of urbanization affecting directly human health and well being of the city dwellers and also contributing to worsen environmental quality as a key strategy to address sustainable urban development the eu has advocated the development of nature based solutions such as the implementation of green infrastructure gi which can deliver a wide range of regulating ecosystem services es in this article the es of climate regulation provided by gi has been analyzed in the municipality of rome italy characterized by a complex territory and by a mediterranean climate the methodological approach allowed to characterize the uhi and to analyze its features in a spatially explicit way and on a seasonal basis through the land surface temperature lst derived from landsat 8 data the cooling capacity of different gi elements peri urban forest urban forest street trees as well as the effect of vegetation cover and tree diversity on the provision of this regulating es were assessed the results show that gi significantly mitigates the hot urban climate during summer with an effect that is dependent on the gi element and the environmental constrains to which it is exposed ndvi and tree cover resulted the main indicators of the provision of the es of climate regulation highlighting that gi elements such as urban and peri urban forests have the highest potential to provide this es in a mediterranean city in the context of the mapping and assessment of ecosystems and their services maes process our results lend support to claims that gi is important for an ecosystem based climate adaptation strategy in urban environments contributing to the definition of knowledge based criteria and indicators relevant for decision making in mediterranean cities keywords land surface temperature urban heat island urban and peri urban forests street trees climate regulation nature based solution 1 introduction urbanization has shown a rapid upward trend during the last sixty years the global urban population has grown from 751 million in 1950 to 4 2 billion in 2018 due to the overall population growth and to the mass movement of people from rural areas to cities it is projected to further increase by another 2 5 billion by 2050 in europe 74 of population currently lives in cities and towns making it the third most urbanized region of the world after north america and latin america koceva et al 2016 urban areas in the eu are characterized by high concentrations of economic activities employment and wealth but this is often accompanied by high pollution levels and other forms of environmental impact indeed rapid urbanization led to dramatic land consumption with the conversion of agricultural fields and natural green spaces into artificial surfaces a phenomenon known as soil sealing eea 2006 morabito et al 2017 in this regard the european commission has proposed the eu environment action programme to 2020 advocating new policies in place in order to halt anthropogenic soil sealing and to achieve no net land take by 2050 european commission 2016 by modifying land cover soil sealing affects matter and energy flow in urban ecosystems and it is recognized to be one of the main drivers of the urban heat island uhi effect uhi can be described as a distinct urban climate characterized by higher temperatures both daytime and night time in built up areas than in the surrounding natural environment oke 1982 measured uhi intensities for different cities around the world range from 4 c in athens and sidney up to 12 c in the megacity of tokyo phelan et al 2015 uhi is a complex phenomenon resulting from the different albedo thermal emissivity three dimensional configuration and heat capacity of the grey infrastructure e g streets and buildings in respect to natural and rural land cover schwarz et al 2012 as well as from heat released from anthropogenic sources i e vehicles residential air conditioners and industries di leo et al 2016 uhi can be quantified by measurements of air temperature tair at the urban canopy level i e from the ground up to building level however tair is not available in a spatially continuous way within a city but only in correspondence of a limited number of monitoring sites in order to analyze temperature distribution over larger areas an indirect but spatially explicit method for uhi estimation has been introduced based on remotely sensed land surface temperature lst lst is correlated to tair in the same sampling site and can be used for the calculation of the surface urban heat island suhi a uhi that is assessed through lst schwarz et al 2012 uhi can have many detrimental implications for the urban socio ecological system phelan et al 2015 since higher tair not only affects directly human health and well being of the city dwellers particularly during heat waves koppe et al 2004 but it also contributes to worsen environmental quality it has been found that uhi contributed to around 50 of the total heat related mortality during the 2003 heat wave in the west midlands uk heaviside et al 2016 while in rome italy a significant increase 16 9 in mortality of people older than 75 years was observed during the same heat wave conti et al 2005 furthermore uhi negatively affects air quality by favoring the formation of photochemical smog the accumulation of particulate matter due to poor horizontal air dispersion and subsidence lai 2018 increases energy consumption for summer building cooling santamouris et al 2018 and exacerbates heat stress on living organisms thus affecting biodiversity and ecosystem functioning grimm et al 2008 the european commission has recently identified the enhancement of sustainable urbanization as a priority target which can be achieved through the development within cities of nature based solutions i e living solutions inspired by continuously supported by and using nature european commission 2015 the concept of nature based solutions thus brings nature and natural processes into cities aiming to address environmental and socio ecological challenges through locally adapted resource efficient and systemic interventions maes and jacobs 2017 escobedo et al 2018 one of the most effective nature based solution for sustainable urban growth is the creation and enhancement of the urban green infrastructure gi defined as a network of natural semi natural and artificial green spaces delivering a wide range of ecosystem services es european commission 2013 tzoulas et al 2007 in european cities the main gi elements are represented by urban and peri urban forests i e woodlands located inside the city core and in its immediate surroundings respectively street trees i e stand alone trees on roadsides surrounded by paved ground and other green spaces such as lawns bolund and hunhammar 1999 besides improving air quality through the reduction of gaseous and particulate pollution fusaro et al 2017 manes et al 2012 marando et al 2016 gi provides significant mitigating effect on uhi and associated health risk coronel et al 2015 escobedo et al 2015 di leo et al 2016 norton et al 2015 this is known as the es of climate regulation cices code 2 2 6 2 haines young and potschin 2018 and depends on different processes the most important of which is evapotranspiration oke 1982 through evapotranspiration energy from solar radiation absorbed by leaves is converted into latent rather than sensible heat flux thus lowering canopy temperature as well as the surrounding air temperature bowler et al 2010 rahman et al 2017 gi and in particular urban forests and trees can also lower air temperature by intercepting solar radiation thus preventing the underlying surface to absorb shortwave radiation a process known as shading effect bowler et al 2010 based on these processes air temperature in urban green spaces can be from 1 3 c up to 5 7 c cooler than the nearby built up areas and this effect can also extend to the surroundings cohen et al 2012 feyisa et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 therefore the enhancement of gi represents an effective mitigation tool to reduce uhi particularly in hot summer conditions such as those typically occurring under mediterranean climate shashua bar et al 2010 zardo et al 2017 despite the large amount of literature promoting the benefits of gi for climate mitigation knowledge based criteria and indicators relevant for decision making at city specific scale need to be further implemented a key aspect is represented by the quantification of the mitigating role exerted by different gi elements on uhi particularly in mediterranean areas indeed most studies carried out in mediterranean cities have focused on the cooling effects of single gi elements such as small parks zoulia et al 2009 shashua bar et al 2010 oliveira et al 2011 skoulika et al 2014 while comprehensive analyses across rural urban transects at city wide scale are still scarce mariani et al 2016 furthermore in order to ensure consistency between gi planning and sustainable urban growth capotorti et al 2017 it is necessary to quantify the effect of vegetation structure and composition on the es of climate regulation provided urban and peri urban green areas in this context this work aims at i characterizing the uhi suhi phenomenon in the mediterranean city of rome italy ii assessing the mitigating role that different gi elements namely urban and peri urban forests and street trees exert on suhi iii quantifying the effect of vegetation cover and tree diversity on the provision of this regulating es the approach is based on the integration of analyses carried out at different spatial temporal scale allowed to assess the uhi suhi phenomenon as well as and the mitigating role of urban gi across the complex territory that characterizes the municipality of rome 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and vegetation characteristics the municipality of rome 41 53 35 n 12 28 58 e fig 1 is the capital of italy and lies over an area of 129 000 ha with a mean altitude of 20 m above sea level with around 2 872 800 inhabitants and a population density of approximately 2231 inhabitants km2 istat 2017 it is the most populated municipality of italy it is characterized by a heterogeneous territory due to its complex history and geomorphological features such as volcanic structures the tiber alluvial plain and a coastal plain it is surrounded by the tyrrhenian sea on the south west whereas the central apennine runs along its northern borders the climate is mediterranean the average temperature is around 15 c with an average annual rainfall of 839 mm blasi 2001 but extreme events such as heat waves and flooding are becoming more frequent and may also increase in the future world health organization and united nations 2018 the area has undergone intense landscape modifications over time the urban dispersion phenomenon contributed to a great extent to the decentralization of the city and to an increment in suburban infrastructure munafò et al 2010 currently the largest part of the city is covered by agricultural areas around 55 followed by sealed cover 22 but it is nevertheless rich in urban green areas such as historical villas urban and peri urban forests and natural reserves such as the castelporziano presidential estate 6000 ha the municipality of rome has an incidence of urban green and protected areas over 18 7 above the average if compared to the other italian cities furthermore in the 2011 2014 period rome has incremented the surface of urban green spaces by a total of 1 9 million m2 istat 2016 2 2 conceptual modeling approach fig 2 describes the flowchart of the methodology applied in this study firstly we characterized the uhi phenomenon in the municipality of rome on a diurnal and nocturnal basis by calculating uhi indicators from air temperatures data retrieved from available weather stations over the 2013 2017 period detailed under paragraph 2 3 in parallel different elaborations on spatially explicit data were performed the seasonal lst was estimated on the basis of 4 summer and 4 winter landsat 8 oli tirs images ranging from 2013 to 2017 table 1 and a land cover based emissivity map by means of a model paragraph 2 4 the spatial characteristics of the suhi phenomenon were then analyzed by computing four year average lst maps for summer and winter and analyzing lst variation between land uses green and urban as well as along a rural urban transect fig 1 paragraph 2 5 the cooling capacity of different gi elements urban and peri urban forests street trees was analyzed by means of a buffer analysis on lst paragraph 2 6 finally the role of land cover features and structural and functional characteristics of vegetation on the es of climate regulation was investigated by using a regression model whose independent variables were obtained from different data sources and ultimately integrated in the sampling paragraph 2 7 2 3 urban heat island estimation based on air temperatures following schwarz et al 2012 a land cover driven approach was used to calculate the uhi intensity from air temperature data this approach determines uhi indicators from air temperatures difference between urban and rural weather stations defining a priori urban i e built up surfaces and their surroundings and rural i e agricultural or natural stations by means of land cover data accordingly hourly air temperature data tair recoded from 01 01 2013 to 31 12 2017 were collected from 3 weather stations located within the municipality of rome in areas characterized by different land cover fig 1 via boncompagni al007 urban station is located in the city centre 35 km from the coast and castel di guido al004 rural station is located in a rural area 20 km w from the city centre 10 km from the shoreline and both belong to the micrometeorological network of the regional agency for environmental protection arpa lazio the third station castelporziano castello natural station is instead located around 20 km sw from the city centre 8 5 km from the shoreline within the castelporziano presidential estate a natural peri urban forest characterized by several ecosystems fares et al 2009 manes et al 1997 tair displayed a similar temporal trend dynamic in all sites showing peak values at the beginning of august around doy 216 220 and minimum values between mid december and early february around doy 350 40 see supplementary figure s1 in order to derive uhi intensity hourly tair differences δtair c between the urban and the rural weather station δtairu r as well as between the urban and the natural station δtairu n were computed for each year and then averaged on a daily and nightly basis over the 2013 2017 period 2 4 land surface temperature lst retrieval model eight landsat 8 oli tirs images for the area of the municipality of rome path row 191 31 wgs84 utm33 n reference system were downloaded from the united states geological survey usgs website cloud free images were acquired for a time period ranging from july 2013 to august 2017 in summer and winter months table 1 in order to investigate seasonal trends since suhi effect varies across seasons imhoff et al 2010 and to allow comparison amongst different years the elaborations were performed with different open source software qgis grass gis radiometric calibration and correction for atmospheric effects through dark object subtraction dos1 were performed through the semi automatic classification plugin implemented in qgis scp congedo and macchi 2015 in order to retrieve surface reflectance following the methodology developed by weng et al 2004 band 10 30 m spatial resolution was then converted to at satellite brightness temperature tb c following eq 1 usgs 2018 1 t b k 2 ln k 1 l λ 1 273 15 where k1 and k2 are band specific thermal conversion constants measured in w m2 sr μm and k respectively lλ is the spectral radiance at the sensor s aperture measured in w m2 sr μm and 273 15 is the conversion factor from k to c tb was then used for land surface temperature lst c retrieval according to eq 2 weng et al 2004 2 l s t t b 1 λ t b c 2 ln ε where λ is the wavelength of the emitted radiance c2 is the planck s second radiation constant 1 4388 10 2 mk and ε is the land surface emissivity the emissivity values for ε were retrieved from literature data li et al 2004 mallick et al 2012 and applied to different land cover classes weng et al 2004 sheng et al 2017 in particular 4 land cover classes were identified built up vegetation water bodies and bare soil areas built up areas were identified using the national soil consumption dataset developed by ispra for the year 2016 at a spatial resolution of 10 m such dataset is based on the copernicus high resolution layer for imperviousness and further improved in resolution and thematic accuracy including other elements of soil consumption through a combination of semi automatic high resolution satellite classification and local datasets copernicus 2018 ispra 2018 to identify the other land cover classes after conversion to surface reflectance bands 4 and 5 of two landsat 8 oli tirs images for summer and winter 2016 since no significant changes in land cover classes are expected in the period ranging from 2013 to 2017 were used to calculate ndvi as nir r nir r vegetated areas were located where a threshold value of 0 3 was exceeded this threshold was chosen following weier and herring 2011 esau et al 2016 and telesca and lasaponara 2006 accordingly areas with positive ndvi values lower than 0 3 were then assigned to the class of bare soil areas water bodies were identified for ndvi values below 0 2 5 spatial analysis of suhi to investigate the spatial characteristics of the suhi phenomenon average lst maps for the city of rome were computed for winter and summer for each season the four images listed in table 1 were considered to produce this map the average value for each pixel in summer and winter respectively was obtained furthermore in order to investigate the effect of vegetation on the suhi and its inter annual variability a stratified random sampling was applied to each image and lst for urban n 149 pixels and green n 149 pixels areas was collected these two land covers were identified by means of corine land cover year 2012 urban corresponds to class 1 1 urban fabric 1 2 industrial commercial and transport unit and 1 3 mine dump and construction sites whereas green corresponds to class 3 1 forests and 1 4 1 green urban areas finally the summer and the winter images for the year 2016 were used to analyze lst variation along a rural urban sw ne transect samples distance 60 m ranging from the coast to the northern part of the city fig 1 the sw ne direction was selected in order to take into account different gi elements i e the large peri urban forest of the castelporziano estate and a urban forest villa ada savoia as well as agricultural lands different urban textures and water bodies the year 2016 was chosen because on average its lst falls within a mean range for the study area 2 6 assessment of summer cooling capacity of different gi elements the mitigating role of different gi elements on summer lst was evaluated by mean of a buffer analysis three different gi elements were selected castelporziano presidential estate as peri urban forest a natural area of almost 6000 ha characterized by deciduous and evergreen mediterranean forests manes et al 1997 villa ada savoia as urban forest one of the largest urban park 180 ha in the highly urbanized rome city center including a fairly well preserved evergreen and deciduous urban forest that plays an important recreational role for dwellers fusaro et al 2015 viale mazzini as street trees 480 x 38 m a quercus ilex l tree lined avenue characterized by elevated vehicular traffic in a highly urbanized context consecutive buffers of 10 m width were used to analyze lst variation from the boundary of each gi element to a maximum distance of 300 m towards the built up area then the lst average difference between each buffer and the gi inner core δlst c was calculated for the four summer images years 2013 2017 table 1 the cooling capacity of each gi element was then evaluated both in terms of lst decrease c and maximum cooling distance from the boundary of the gi element by identifying the first turning point of the buffer temperature yu et al 2017 2 7 assessment of factors affecting the es of climate regulation provided by gi nine polygonal plots of 180 ha each characterized by different features in terms of land cover textures and position inside the metropolitan area were sampled across the municipality fig 1 five plots include mainly built up areas with different urbanization density salario and city centre are two dense built up areas located in the central part of the municipality termini is a highly urbanized neighborhood characterized by the presence of the main railway station of rome infernetto and olgiata are residential areas made up of detached and semi detached houses and small green areas the other four polygonal plots include vegetated and agricultural areas marcigliana is located in the north eastern sector of the city in a rural area including cultivated and uncultivated lands as well as patches of natural vegetation villa ada was chosen in correspondence of the villa ada savoia an urban forest surrounded by a deeply urbanized area that includes the salario urban plot other two plots named castelporziano 1 and castelporziano 2 are located inside the large castelporziano peri urban forest average summer and winter lst c in the different polygonal plots are reported in supplementary table 1 in order to identify the factors that explain lst variation by season a regular grid composed by cells of one hectare size each was used to sample different variables that affect lst in the nine plots the considered variables were

3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of uhi and suhi in the municipality of rome 3 1 1 uhi estimation through air temperatures the air circulation in the municipality of rome during high pressure summer conditions is dominated by the sea land breeze regime typical of mediterranean coastal areas fares et al 2009 which is known to interact with uhi in a complex way cenedese and monti 2003 nastran et al 2018 in spring and summer during the day tair of the urban station was on average around 1 c higher than the rural and natural ones fig 3 a c this uhi magnitude is in the range of what previously described for other coastal mediterranean cities in thessaloniki greece giannaros and melas 2012 reported that maximum uhi intensity ranged from 2 to 4 c during the warm part of the year while in barcelona spain salvati et al 2017 reported a maximum average uhi around 1 7 c in summer interestingly such uhi was even more evident by considering nighttime tair fig 3b d despite the nocturnal air movement of the study area is dominated by land sea breeze fares et al 2009 in particular average nocturnal tair recorded in the urban site were 1 85 and 2 15 c higher than that measured in the rural station in spring and summer respectively fig 3b and this difference was even higher considering the natural site of castelporziano 2 81 and 3 17 c in spring and summer respectively fig 3d the nocturnal uhi is known to exert a stronger detrimental effect on human wellbeing and building energy use than the diurnal one zhang et al 2017 fig 1 allows to highlight the different presence and extension of the peri urban forests between the site adjacent to the castel di guido weather station and that of castelporziano it is possible to hypothesize that the differences of temperature observed for these two sites with the urban station which are higher for the castelporziano site can be attributed to the regulating es of climate mitigation provided by vegetation mariani et al 2016 therefore the nocturnal cooling service provided by the large castelporziano peri urban forest during hot summer months particularly july and august appears of particular importance vaz monteiro et al 2016 as for winter months tair of the castel di guido rural site was on average similar or slightly higher than that of the urban site during both night and day average δtairu r 0 06 and 0 45 c for day and night respectively considering the natural site of castelporziano as reference instead the nighttime uhi was also evident during winter average δtair u n 0 13 and 1 08 c for day and night respectively coherently with what reported for thessaloniki greece giannaros and melas 2012 3 1 2 spatial characteristics of the suhi suhi is widely used as a proxy of uhi since although absolute values are not comparable due to the different data acquisition and information content of the two indicators satellite derived lst vs ground based tair respectively many studies have shown that suhi and uhi are significantly correlated chen et al 2012 feyisa et al 2014 schwarz et al 2012 suhi can therefore be used to analyze the spatial characteristics of urban heat island and the cooling capacity of gi within a city average summer lst values fig 4 a range from 27 5 to 50 2 c in correspondence of the most sealed surfaces in the city centre and in residential and industrial areas lst values range from around 39 to 43 c the highest values up to 50 2 c can be found for bare soils and uncultivated lands particularly present in the eastern part of the metropolitan area fig 1 previous studies have shown that in arid and semi arid cities bare soils i e agricultural soils and sandy surfaces with no vegetation cover around the urban area can show higher lst than the urban surface itself especially during the morning haashemi et al 2016 lazzarini et al 2013 this effect is due to the low heat capacity and conductivity of such soils which are heated more quickly by the morning sun than the artificial surfaces within the urban area we argue that this phenomenon has happened in our study too since landsat 8 images in the rome area are acquired around 10 00 am both during summer and winter therefore beyond land use types geographical location geomorphological features climatic situation seasons and times of day should be taken into account when performing satellite analysis of suhi on the other hand the lowest lst values are displayed by large green areas such as the peri urban forest of castelporziano presidential estate around 28 c and urban parks inside the city such as the urban forest of villa ada around 32 33 c as for average winter lst fig 4b it is interesting to highlight that no clear suhi effect was evident coherently with what observed using tair measured by weather stations fig 3 winter lst values range from around 5 to 17 c with most values ranging from around 8 5 to 11 c temperatures that are displayed by large areas of the urban texture values up to 15 17 c can again be found in correspondence of bare soils annual crops and coastal sandy dunes whereas values for urban and peri urban forests are generally lower ranging from 5 c in the northern part of the city to 8 9 c in natural areas such as castelporziano where the proximity of the sea can mitigate cold winter temperatures 3 2 land cover based analysis of lst 3 2 1 effect of vegetation on lst mean summer lst for green pixels table 2 a ranged from 32 36 2 21 c for the year 2013 to 33 43 2 60 c for the year 2015 with an average summer value of 33 10 2 99 whereas urban areas average summer lst ranged from 36 21 2 53 c for the year 2017 to 40 87 2 48 c for the year 2015 with an average summer value of 40 48 2 92 c as regards winter temperatures green areas mean lst range from 4 45 0 87 c for the year 2017 to 12 01 1 04 c for the year 2014 and an average winter lst equal to 9 08 3 10 c average winter lst for urban areas show a minimum of 5 64 1 40 c in the year 2017 and a maximum of 12 98 1 47 c in the year 2014 and an overall lst of 9 91 3 15 c for the winter season green areas display significantly lower temperatures than urban areas p 0 05 for all the considered years and for both the overall summer and winter seasons from the repeated measures anova table 2b a significant effect of the year and year land cover is also highlighted p 0 001 showing that lst values differ significantly in relation to different years and land cover this is in accordance to what pointed out previously by yuan and bauer 2007 who found that the percentage of impervious surface has a strong linear relation with lst for all the seasons while sheng et al 2015 reported that satellite based lst is significantly influenced by the presence of vegetation this result suggest the importance of the green areas in the mitigation of the urban climate and in a broader sense to improve environmental quality and human wellbeing particularly during hot summer conditions that are typical of mediterranean cities diffenbaugh et al 2007 3 2 2 rural urban transect fig 5 shows the lst along the rural urban transect 38 km see fig 1 for both summer in red left axis and winter in blue right axis such remotely sensed lst provided as spatially continuous data over a whole city or region allows highlighting the relations between the urban area and the surrounding landscape this is particularly important for studying the uhi since both the temperature drivers of the urban area and of the surrounding landscape must be taken into account heinl et al 2015 the summer transect clearly highlights the uhi phenomenon showing a progressive increase of lst from the sw natural and agricultural zones towards the city centre hidalgo et al 2008 lst values range from 26 to 32 c in correspondence of the castelporziano peri urban forest to 36 45 c in the built up area with a maximum difference of around 15 20 c in lst between peri urban and urban areas in the city centre between 30 35 km from the starting point of the transect large decreases in lst can be observed in correspondence to the villa ada urban forest as well as to water bodies as regards the winter transect no clear heat island effect is evident and temperature variations between rural and urban areas are less pronounced it is noteworthy that lst within the castelporziano presidential estate tends to increase from coastline towards inlands during summer while an opposite trend is observed in winter suggesting a mitigating role on cold air temperatures carried out by the sea sakakibara and owa 2005 more marked lst fluctuations along the transect during summer suggest that vegetation and in particular urban and peri urban forests exert a greater impact on suhi mitigation compared to winter as already shown in fig 4 bare soil areas located from 10 to 5 km sw and ne from the built up areas display higher lst than urban settlements for both seasons 3 3 summer cooling capacity of different gi elements the three considered gi elements namely peri urban forest castelporziano presidential estate urban forest villa ada savoia and street trees viale mazzini display a different cooling capacity during summer both in terms of temperature decrease of the surrounding urban area and of cooling distance from the boundary of the gi element fig 6 the large peri urban forest and the urban forest were in the considered years 2 5 3 1 c and 2 8 3 2 c cooler first 10 m buffer than their surroundings respectively this cooling intensity is in the range of what reported for other mediterranean cities such as tel aviv potchter et al 2006 cohen et al 2012 and athens zoulia et al 2009 skoulika et al 2014 thus supporting the conclusion that gi are highly efficient in mitigating summer urban heat island under mediterranean climatic conditions zardo et al 2017 the buffer analysis also highlights that for castelporziano the cooling effect on lst extends up to 170 m with no relevant differences between years fig 6a indicating a high functional stability of the large peri urban forest despite this is a relatively short distance effect coherent with previous works considering lst yu et al 2017 it must be underlined that the corresponding effect on air temperature could be higher indeed for a much smaller park 6 ha in athens skoulika et al 2014 reported a cooling effect on tair extending up to 300 m as for the villa ada urban forest the maximum cooling distance of this gi element shows noticeable inter annual differences it extends up to 100 m during 2013 2015 and 2016 while a turning point in the δlst is already evident 50 m away from the park boundaries during 2017 fig 6b this lower cooling effect can be explained by considering that during summer 2017 central italy has been affected by an intense drought and heat wave which caused diffuse damages to forest ecosystems i e early foliar shedding and desiccation of leaves and branches pollastrini et al 2018 besides the direct effects of severe drought on the evapotranspiration potential and on leaf area production i e reduced ndvi manes et al 1997 such damages reduce both the evaporative cooling and the canopy shading capacity of trees it can be argued that differently from what observed for the natural peri urban forest of castelporziano the stressful conditions of the urban environment i e higher tair and vpd presence of air pollutants shallow soils with lower water availability may have further reduced the functionality of the urban forest fusaro et al 2015 thus exacerbating the negative effects of the summer 2017 heat wave in this context management practices aimed at enhancing soil water availability for example by an appropriate irrigation schedule in urban parks or by the amelioration of soil structure and texture in newly planned gi mariani et al 2016 could substantially help in increasing the climate regulation potential of urban gi this is particularly relevant in mediterranean environments where during summer months water availability already represents a limiting factor for vegetation growth and functionality manes et al 1997 finally the street trees of viale mazzini avenue are around 1 3 c cooler than the first 10 m buffer of built up area and their influence is extended up to 30 m from the borders of this linear gi element with no difference between years fig 6c this lower cooling capacity in respect to that of urban and peri urban forests could be due to different factors such as the smaller size of the gi element or its lower canopy cover i e lower ndvi data not shown yu et al 2017 furthermore while urban and peri urban forests grow on unpaved soils street trees have most of their roots confined in a small planting pit surrounded by sealed soils indeed impermeable pavements reduce evaporative cooling from soil potentially decreasing also plant transpiration of adult trees fini et al 2017 thus directly affecting the cooling capacity of the gi element it is however worth to underline that the cooling effect of street trees although small is not negligible appearing important for improving local microclimate in highly urbanized neighborhoods within the city core shashua bar et al 2010 particularly during the hot mediterranean summer conditions 3 4 role of land cover features and vegetation characteristics on the es of climate mitigation stepwise multiple linear regression was applied to investigate how changes in land cover features obtained from the polygonal plots are able to describe the seasonal changes in lst observed in the municipality of rome in the 2013 2017 period the results show a high predictive capacity for the summer model with a determination coefficient scored at 0 75 p 0 01 table 3 a in this model ndvi owns the best predictive performance followed by the surface covered by trees m2 trees r2 stepwise increase 0 066 these two variables showed a negative relationship with lst indicating that the more trees with high canopy cover in a green area the more effective it will be in providing the es of climate regulation indeed previous studies have shown that lst is strongly correlated with ndvi as well as with other vegetation indices linked to canopy cover such as leaf area index hardin and jensen 2007 gi elements such as urban and peri urban forests have therefore the highest potential to provide the es of climate regulation in urban areas if compared to other vegetation types such as meadows or hedges skelhorn et al 2014 the distance from the city center c dist is another important factor showing a negative relationship with summer lst r2 stepwise increase 0 039 suggesting that due to the uhi phenomenon green areas closer to the urban core should be particularly efficient in order to provide the es of climate regulation since the demand for this es is higher in the city centre were both population and urbanization density are highest lafortezza and giannico 2017 this aspect is of particular policy relevance and should be taken into account for planning new gi elements targeted at mitigating uhi in the different sectors of the city of rome the distance from the tiber river r dist and the urban surface cover m2 urban have instead a very little influence on summer lst r2 increase 0 002 and 0 001 respectively while the number of tree functional groups fg in each cell is not significant at all r2 increase 0 this latter results is of some interest previous studies have in fact shown that the provision of several regulating es such as the air quality improvement by gi is positively affected by tree diversity particularly under mediterranean climatic conditions manes et al 2012 2016 although further studies are needed to better elucidate the relationship between diversity level and es mori et al 2017 our result seems to suggest that this relationship may not be so determinant for the provision of the es of climate regulation by urban gi at least in the city specific conditions of the studied area as for the winter model its predictive capacity on lst although significant p 0 01 was very low r2 0 091 table 3b this result confirms the absence of a daytime uhi in winter as already highlighted by the analysis of tair fig 3a c by the spatial analysis of lst fig 4b as well as by the rural urban transect fig 5 sheng et al 2017 have also found such a difference between summer and winter suggesting that the summer uhi suhi phenomenon may be predominant under several climatic conditions 4 conclusions in the context of the mapping and assessment of ecosystems and their services maes process maes et al 2016 this work has investigated the es of climate regulation cices code 2 2 6 2 haines young and potschin 2018 delivered by gi in the metropolitan area of rome italy our integrated approach has shown that a uhi phenomenon is evident in rome during the hot mediterranean summer conditions and such summer uhi can be mitigated by gi the cooling capacity differed between the considered gi elements with peri urban forest showing the highest temperature reduction and cooling distance followed by urban forest and street trees at this regard specific management policies appear necessary for a cost effective improvement of the cooling capacity of gi elements located closer to the urban core were the demand for the es of climate regulation is higher but plant functionality can be limited by environmental constraints fusaro et al 2015 these include appropriate irrigation schedules as well as the amelioration of soil structure and texture in the newly planned gi on the same time considering the continuous growth of urban areas towards their rural surroundings catalàn et al 2008 the importance of peri urban forests in terms of es provision should be also recognized preserving and expanding them as possible in view of a sustainable urban growth finally the multiple linear regression model have showed that firstly the ndvi and then the surface covered by trees that affect evapotranspiration and shading are the main indicators of the provision of the es of climate regulation by gi highlighting again that gi elements such as urban and peri urban forests have the highest potential to provide this es in a mediterranean city interestingly differently from what reported for other regulating es climate regulation resulted unaffected by tree diversity at least in the city specific conditions of the studied area during the summer season our results lend support to claims that gi is important for an ecosystem based climate adaptation strategy in urban environments contributing to the definition of knowledge based criteria and indicators relevant for decision making in mediterranean cities at this regard some limitation of this study have to be highlighted which need to be addressed in future researches the most important is the lack of identification of the minimum sized treed area that is needed to effectively reduce temperature to acceptable levels for human wellbeing in fact this quantification would have required the analysis of many different gi elements with different sizes from very small to very large that are not available in our study area due to the use of satellite derived lst in this study it has been also impossible to quantify the mitigating effect of gi on the nocturnal summer uhi which has resulted particularly important for the city of rome for this quantification tair data measured in a spatially continuous way are required thus highlighting the need to implement existing weather monitoring network within the city as well as in its surroundings finally the role of tree diversity in the provision of es of climate regulation should be further investigated also considering other mediterranean cities as case study acknowledgments this research was supported by the following grants project global change and health in the

balbi et al 2009 or wildfire analyst wfa monedero et al 2017 ramírez et al 2011 wfa is a software that was developed aiming at providing real time analysis of wildfire behaviour and spread in order to support real time decision making whether through the desktop platform or web enabled applications it provides a comprehensive set of outputs time of arrival fire perimeters rate of spread flame length fireline intensity crown fire potential among others for each simulation that is tied directly to the time stamp of the weather conditions and data inputs for an incident accurately predicting fire spread and behaviour and potential changes in a specific time or place in a real time incident in the field is highly important in order to prevent the loss of human life improve the success of initial attack and minimize fire damage alexander et al 2015 thus many risks can be eliminated if firefighters know what to expect the fire to do barrows 1951 due to the lack of computer access on the fireline alexander et al 2015 fire agencies could not perform fire simulations and apply validated fire spread models with well known fire simulators such as behaveplus andrews 2014 in this sense several fire agencies created different guidelines to estimate fire behaviour in the field some examples are the incident response pocket guide national wildfire coordinating group 2014 fireline handbook appendix b national wildfire coordinating group 2006 and fire behaviour nomograms albini 1976a rothermel 1991 we present the wildfire analyst pocket edition application wfa pocket a mobile version of wfa aimed to be used by the wildland fire community to operationally estimate the fire progression and behaviour and their potential changes over time in an incident it is built to perform calculations in the field based on observed conditions providing the critical information necessary for decision making embodying well known fire spread models included in behaveplus andrews 2014 this paper describes the development design involved fire spread models and main features of wfa pocket we also evaluate its robustness of results with a well known fire simulator behaveplus and present a case study to test the potential use of this tool in the field limitations and assumptions in the use of the application are discussed as well as potential improvements for the future 2 background and model foundation wfa pocket uses well known mathematical models built by the scientific community for different purposes table 1 1 estimation of the surface and crown fire spread and behaviour 2 other complementary models to estimate dead fuel moisture ignition probability crown scorch height safety zone size and separation distance among others most of the mathematical models included in wfa pocket table 1 to perform fire behaviour calculations are included in behaveplus andrews 2014 and were developed by the us forest service missoula fire sciences lab wfa pocket compiles knowledge gained from the five plus decades of applied research on wildfire behaviour and it is intended to serve as a companion to the fire behaviour field reference guide pms 437 details on the specific mathematical models can be found in the referenced documents 3 system design and features wfa pocket has been developed to work across multiple devices both mobile and desktop wfa pocket is available for android ios windows mac and linux operating systems all versions are freely accessible from the wfa pocket website https pocket wildfireanalyst com accessed on august 2018 android and ios versions are also available in the google play and apple app stores the app works either connected or disconnected providing outputs and results in a form that is readily understood and usable wfa pocket provides instantaneous calculation for fire behaviour outputs based on the inputs and parameters selected by the user the application has four different sections in order to perform fire simulations fig 1 1 map viewer 2 results 3 charts 4 parameters 3 1 map viewer in this section wfa pocket shows the estimated fire progression in an intuitive 3d map interface allowing the user to interactively change parameters and see both numeric and graphic results on a 3d base map in real time the users can search specific geographic locations change base maps orient north the maps locate fire ignitions and interactively navigate through the maps also there is an input toolbar where the user can modify weather data wind speed and direction air temperature air relative humidity fuel type topography slope and aspect of the terrain and fuel moisture dead and live note that the fire progression on the map is estimated using constant input data across the landscape based on the input data selected by the user usually for the ignition point therefore the interpretation of the fire progression on the maps should be considered under homogeneous conditions in areas with low spatial input data variability thus there could be high discrepancies between the simulated fire progression and the real fire spread across a heterogeneous landscape in this sense the use of this tool is highly recommended to analyze punctual fire characteristics and specific fire runs 3 2 results in this section fire modelers can visualize fire behaviour outputs fig 1 there is a chart to analyze fire characteristics as a function of the rate of spread and intensity and characterize the potential fire behaviour into several categories on which different suppression maneuvers are usually applied also wfa pocket shows the expected surface fire behaviour residence time reaction intensity flame length rate of spread and fire intensity crown fire behaviour expected transition to crown rate of spread flame length and intensity the estimated fire perimeter and area of a fire spreading in a specific time interval under homogeneous conditions safe separation distance for firefighters ignition probability and scorch height 3 3 charts wfa pocket shows a dynamic chart where users can interactively observe how the fire behaviour changes with varying input data wind dead and live fuel moisture slope and canopy bulk density an approach that can be very useful to analyze the sensitivity of the fire spread models with different input data in terms of surface fire intensity rate of spread flame length and crown rate of spread and intensity 3 4 parameters users can configurate the application in this section information about the site and incident can be reported to wfa pocketdate time of day elevation difference shading and sheltering dead fuel moisture can be set by the user or estimated by wfa pocket using the rothermel and rinehart 1983 model based on the weather conditions wind speed can be set at mid flame or 20 feet height considering a wind adjustment factor depending on the fuel type there are two available fuel families anderson 1982 scott and burgan 2005 and crown fire behaviour can be activated in the fire simulations after setting canopy characteristics canopy height canopy base height canopy bulk density canopy cover and foliar moisture these characteristics can be set manually or using the inventory found in scott and burgan 2005 additionally in the united states of america wfa pocket can retrieve surface fuel and canopy data from landfire as well as weather data using the third party api synoptic for the fire selected and georeferenced ignition point 4 wfa pocket robustness we analyzed potential divergences between behaveplus and wfa pocket by using a paired t test and 1272 random combinations of input data including fuel type weather topography and fuel moisture these discrepancies were tested considering the following representative fire behaviour outputs rate of spread flame length and therefore fireline intensity crown fire activity and scorch height we did not find significant discrepancies between both simulators p value 0 80 in all paired t test ensuring the robustness of wfa pocket in relation to the well known fire simulator behaveplus andrews 2014 5 tubbs fire we used the tubbs fire as a case study to present wfa pocket the tubbs fire was a wind driven fire that started near tubbs lane in calistoga california usa fig 2 38 37 57 n 122 34 49 w on 8 october 2017 at 9 43 pm local time being one of the most destructive wildland fires in california history on october 31 the tubbs fire was fully contained having burned 14 895 ha 5636 structures destroyed including more than 2800 homes in the city of santa rosa calfire the tubbs fire lasted several days although most of the burned area occurred in the first 6 h see fire progression through viirs data fig 2a we simulated the fire spread with wildfire analyst desktop wfa behaveplus and wfa pocket fig 2b up to its impact with the edge of the wildland urban interface of santa rosa where the fire started destroying houses and infrastructures strong winds from the northeast supported very high rates of fire spread at the beginning of the fire with peak wind gusts of 90 km h low fuel moisture also influenced extreme fire behaviour with a 1 h dead fuel moisture content of 4 4 wfa uses well known mathematical models rothermel 1972 rothermel and rinehart 1983 van wagner 1977 to estimate both surface and crown fire behaviour by using gridded input data such as farsite and flammap finney 2006 1998 hourly weather data from santa rosa meteorological station located inside the fire perimeter was used as well as fuel data anderson 1982 and canopy characteristics canopy bulk density cbd canopy cover cc canopy height ch canopy base height cbh from landfire 2014 at 30 m pixel resolution to estimate fire spread and behaviour with wfa pocket and behaveplus we used constant input data throughout the fire duration considering flat terrain mean weather and fuel moisture conditions and the most relevant fuel model according to landfire 2014 fuel type 5 both wfa behaveplus and wfa pocket predicted a similar fire progression in relation to the real fire spread especially in the head of the fire fig 2 and both simulations showed that the tubbs fire could affect the urban area of santa rosa wfa pocket estimated a mean rate of spread of approximately 4 km h ranging between 0 1 and 17 km h depending on the fuel type similar values to the real fire spread 6 discussion fire modelling systems on the fireline can be very useful for predicting fire behaviour as well as providing multiple benefits as alexander et al 2015 suggested by using the 2013 yarnell fire as example also they are very useful for understanding complex ecological systems muzy et al 2008 by analyzing fire regime and the effects of spatial heterogeneity on fire behavior parsons et al 2011 management of fire dependent species habitats and optimization of fuel treatment allocation duncan et al 2015 wfa pocket can predict the estimated fire progression and behaviour in real time in the field providing reliable results given that it uses validated fire spread models internationally included in the well known fire simulator behaveplus andrews 2014 with a high robustness in fact wfa pocket adequately predicted both fire characteristics and progression in the wind driven tubbs fire using constant input data however varying input data across the landscape highly influence fire spread and behaviour finney 2002 1998 and it is evident that the real rate of spread progression was not constant throughout the fire duration due to changes in topography weather and fuel type among others as the fire simulation with wfa showed although wfa pocket can provide adjusted results to the real fire spread by using mean input conditions the use of the tool is recommended to simulate fire progression on areas with homogeneous conditions since high discrepancies between the simulated fire progression and the real fire spread could occur with significant changes in the inputs proper use of any fire modelling system depends on educated users with knowledge and expertise on fire simulation thus the degree of accuracy in model predictions of wildland fire behaviour characteristics with wfa pocket in real time should be linked to the consideration of the following factors 1 model limitations and assumptions of the fire spread models on which predictions are based an issue already discussed by several authors alexander and cruz 2013 jolly 2007 2 input data uncertainty especially when predicting fire behaviour with forecasted weather input data thompson and calkin 2011 3 spatial input data variability when estimating fire progression in a specific time interval although wfa pocket provides a means of modelling many aspects of wildfires table 1 new models and equations could be incorporated in the future in order to improve the accuracy of fire behaviour outputs also although wfa pocket is been designed to estimate punctual fire characteristics and progression at local scales it may be very useful to include dynamic fire modelling and consider gridded input data and spatial variability across the landscape to better estimate the fire progression however this would require higher computation requirements not available in most of the standard mobile devices wfa pocket can be used for a range of research and fire management applications playing an important role on the fireline in fire incidents and environmental analysis also the application is intended to be a global database of observations of fire behaviour made by users aimed to be used for research

25143,imperfect detection and misclassification errors are often ignored in the context of invasive species management here we present an approach that combines spatially explicit models and an optimization technique to design optimal search and destroy strategies based on noisy monitoring observations we focus on two invasive plants melaleuca melaleuca quinquenervia and old world climbing fern lygodium microphyllum which continue to cause important damages to the everglades ecosystem we present a methodological framework that combines hidden markov random field hmrf initially developed for image analysis and linear programming to optimally search for invasive species a benefit of this approach is that it accounts for the spatial structure of the system by using a spatially explicit modeling approach i e hmrf and does not require repeated visits to model the probability of occurrence of species we found on simulated cases that our approach can lead to substantial improvements in control efficiency when compared to state of the art model free approaches for example in the case of the old world fern simulations showed that the optimal strategy would allow managers to control up to 34 more sites than with model free approaches that ignored misclassification and imperfect detection for melaleuca it was possible to control up to 20 more sites the vast increase in imagery data obtained from different sources e g unmanned aerial systems and satellite provides great opportunities to improve management of natural resources by applying modern computational methods such as the one we present our approach can substantially increases the efficiency of invasive species control by accounting for imperfect detection misclassification error and the spatial structure of the system our approach is applicable to other systems and problems for example it could be applied to the control of plant pathogens or optimal extraction of resources e g minerals or biological resources keywords florida hidden markov random field invasive species linear programming melaleuca old world climbing fern 1 introduction invasive species have large impacts on ecosystem functions simberloff 2011 and services charles and dukes 2008 and may require intensive management to protect natural resources it has been estimated that the current damage cost in the u s alone is approximately 120 billion annually pimentel et al 2005 in addition environmental changes due to anthropogenic pressures may exacerbate this problem in the future e g shifts in niche distributions due to global climate change hellmann et al 2008 it is therefore not surprising that under such pressures invasive species management has become a priority for many natural resource management organizations these

mathematical modeling e g to model abundance and distribution of organisms and operation research to identify optimal decisions with respect to management objectives offer some exciting opportunities to improve management mackenzie 2006 royle and dorazio 2008 martin et al 2012 however one of the major challenges to manage invasive species is the absence of information about their population dynamic and distribution although detailed information about invasive species is often lacking natural resource managers have to make decisions in the face of uncertainty in order to limit the spread of invasive species those decisions generally translate into a resource allocation problem where and how much resources should be used given limited budgets and multiple objectives as described in horie et al 2013 the two primary approaches to solve this problem are simulations and optimizations the simulation approach consists of using a detailed model of the invasive spatial dynamic higgins et al 2000 grevstad 2005 provencher et al 2007 harwood et al 2011 frid et al 2013 bonneau et al 2016 model complexity is generally not a constraint and several aspects of the problems can be incorporated such that spatial correlation and heterogeneous habitats the model can then be used to simulate the effect of pre defined management strategies and to determine the most efficient one although simulation approach can be used to determine the best strategy among a set of alternative strategies there is no guarantee that the selected strategy is in fact optimal by contrast with an optimization approach the set of possible strategies is not restricted and the entire strategy space is searched to find the optimal one hauser and mccarthy 2009 haight and polasky 2010 blackwood et al 2010 baxter and possingham 2011 chadès et al 2015 baker 2017 but optimization has a cost and generally simplified models of the invasive species cannot be avoided as introduced in hof et al 2002 and later in epanchin niell and wilen 2012 linear programming is a powerful optimization framework allowing to account for uncertainty and some spatial aspects of the species dynamic in a simplified way when model parameters are uncertain a range of possible values can be considered and treated as scenarios all the scenarios are then used to define multiple optimization problems bonneau et al 2017 or they can also be mixed in the same utility function horie et al 2013 yemshanov et al 2017 here we provide an extension of these two later works in which we account for the spatial structure of the infestation the only required input to apply our method is the result of a first survey of the study area which provides imperfect observations of the presence absence of the species i e detection non detection data at the site scale uncertainty is not considered at the parameter level but rather directly on the observations from the initial survey which are considered non independent hence our method accounts for imperfect detection false negative and misclassification errors false positive which can substantially reduce the efficiency of monitoring and control of invasives mehta et al 2007 miller et al 2011 rout et al 2013 moore et al 2014 we based our framework on a classical probabilistic tool initially developed for image analysis the hidden markov random field hmrf brémaud 2013 hmrf is a powerful framework often used to perform segmentation or pixel classification autonomously an important application is the analysis of three dimensional medical images from magnetic resonance mr zhang et al 2001 the data from mr imaging are far too complex to be analyzed manually and automatic procedures are needed to produce a segmentation of the original image into different tissue classes such as gray or white matter and cerebrospinal fluid for brain imaging this image is then used for further analysis by the practitioner in practice electronic noises are among biases that justify the need for removing noise from the image to identify the classes in this context hmrf have been developed to compute the probability that a pixel originates from a given class based on the intensity distribution and spatial structure of the initial noisy image zhang et al 2001 the hmrf framework has been used in several other fields beyond medicine such as epidemiology and archeology besag et al 1991 genetic studies to investigate population structure françois et al 2006 and ecology for the monitoring of an invasive ant species in australia peyrard et al 2013 in many ecological applications the observations of a target species collected during surveys can be converted to a black and white image where black pixels correspond to sites in which the species was recorded whereas white pixels correspond to site with no detection similarly to the mr imaging example this black and white image is a noisy version of the true unknown spatial distribution of the species composed of two classes presence absence of the species while the noise correspond to misclassification and imperfect detection errors we extend previous work on invasive species mapping peyrard et al 2013 by combining hmrf with linear integer programming lip to optimally control invasive species in space specifically the presence absence observations from the initial survey are used to fit the hmrf model parameters the fitted model is then used to estimate the probability of species occurrence at each site the hmrf model accounts for spatial dependencies between observations and the computed probabilities account for the possible misclassification and imperfect detection finally the probabilities and heterogeneous visit and control costs form the input of the optimization problem which consists of identifying the set of locations to visit so as to maximize the removal of invasive for a fixed budget we apply a branch and bound algorithm wolsey and nemhauser 1999 to solve the lip optimization problem we illustrate the efficacy of the solution compared to model free monitoring strategies that do not take noise spatial correlation and visit plus control cost into account greedy strategy and modified adaptive cluster sampling on the management of two invasive species melaleuca melaleuca quinquenervia and old world climbing fern lygodium microphyllum in the arthur r marshall loxahatchee national wildlife refuge amlnwr palm beach county florida usa 2 materials and methods 2 1 hmrf how to compute posterior presence probabilities using noisy observations we assume that the study area is divided into n square sites on each site i 1 n a first random variable x i indicating the presence i e x i 1 or the absence i e x i 0 of the species is defined second we define an observation variable o i equals to 1 when the species has been detected during the initial survey and 0 otherwise then x x 1 x n is the vector of the true unknown occurrence of the species over the study area and o o 1 o n the vector of observations the possible observation error implies that x i and o i are not necessarily equal and we denote θ fn p o i 0 x i 1 the probability of false negative observation often referred in the ecological literature as imperfect detection see yoccoz et al 2001 in other words the species of interest is not detected when it is in fact present and θ fp p o i 1 x i 0 the probability of false positive observation this is a type of misclassification error in which the species is recorded as present when it is in fact absent this could result from the case where another species is confused with the target species see miller et al 2011 martin et al 2015 in the following p denotes a probability distribution p x o is the probability that x is the true occurrence vector given all the observations o and p x i 1 o is the conditional or posterior probability that the species is present in site i given the observations and p x i 0 o 1 p x i 1 o is the posterior probability that the species is not present the hidden markov random field hmrf framework is a particular family of probability distribution p which benefits from powerful algorithms allowing to estimate the parameter of the distribution and compute posterior probabilities given noisy observations we used a classical potts hmrf model potts 1952 where the probability of any occurrence vector is given by 1 p x x o o exp i 1 n α x i β i j e eq x i x j i 1 n log p o i x i where eq x i x j is equal to 1 if and only if variable x i and x j are equal i e if species is present both at sites i and j e is the set of pairs of sites corresponding to first order neighborhood sites i e all the pairs of sites that share an edge more precisely except on the border of the study area any site has four neighbors located north east south and west hmrf models are generally described using a graph where nodes represent the random variables x i and o i with an edge between x i o i and between x i and x j if i and j are neighbor sites this graph is useful for its easy visual interpretation an absence of edges between two variables indicates that these two variables are independent when all the other variables are known fig 1 shows examples of a graphical representation of a markov random field and a hidden markov random field each node of the graphs represents a random variable x i represents the presence x i 1 or absence x i 0 of the species at location i while o i represents the result of observation of site i o i 1 when the species is detected and o i 0 when the species was not detected at site i edges represent the dependence between variables mrf models is the two dimensional version of markov chain models where value of the process at one time step t only depends of the process at the previous time step t 1 in two dimensions the markov property translates into the value of x i only depends on its neighbors in this example and in the article we consider first order neighbors such that neighbors of variable x 5 are x 2 x 4 x 8 x 6 and of variable x 1 are x 2 x 6 to illustrate this property suppose that site 5 is not accessible and thus cannot be observed in order to estimate the value of x 5 observing sites 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 and 9 instead of only sites 2 4 8 and 6 does not provide any additional information finally a hmrf is an extension of markov random field mrf where the x layer represents the true value of the phenomenon that cannot be observed directly and the o layer represents the noisy observation of x an important property of hmrf models is that when the x layer is know all observation variables o are independent this is why on the graph there is no edge between the observation variables in b the x layer is drawn gray for illustrative purposes only a common interpretation of the potts model is that parameter α is responsible for the proportion of occupied sites and β is the correlation parameter responsible for the patchiness of the spatial distribution positive values of β generally lead to the posterior presence probability at a given site to increase with the number of neighbors where the species have been observed for more details about hmrf see brémaud 2013 finally the term i 1 n log p o i x i carries the information brought by the noisy observations in this article we used the following approach i use the observations to estimate the parameters of the hmrf model α β θ fn θ fp and ii use the estimated parameters to estimate the posterior probabilities at each site i e the probability that the species is present at each site given the observation as one can note the observation errors are not an input parameters and they need not to be estimated before using our approach in fact this can be a valuable output of the parameter estimation step another advantage of using the hmrf framework is that there is a common algorithms for parameters and posterior probability estimation to estimate the parameters we used the so called expectation maximisation e m bilmes et al 1998 algorithm the em algorithm is a classical algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation in presence of hidden data the algorithm starts with an initial value for the parameters then the parameters are iteratively updated by maximizing the expected loglikelihood of the complete data x o conditional on the observations o o and the current estimates the e step corresponds to the computation of this expectation and the m step to its maximization in practice for hmrf exact computation in the e step is out of reach and we have applied the approximation proposed in celeux et al 2003 to compute the posterior probabilities we used a belief propagation algorithm pearl 1988 see supplementary figure s1 for an illustration of parameters and posteriors estimation process 3 optimal search and destroy strategy the posterior presence probabilities p x i 1 o i 1 n are useful because they quantify the level of confidence about the presence of the species based on the observations intuitively the weight of evidence of the presence of the species increases as p x i 1 o gets closer to 1 so we should target sites with large posterior probability to visit in priority but the choice of the sites to survey is complicated by the fact that visit and removal cost further denoted c v i and c r i might be spatially heterogeneous therefore there is a trade off between monitoring many sites even if the presence probability is low and visiting fewer sites that have the greatest presence probabilities this optimization problem fits with on the class of linear integer programming lip problems as we will explain below let s denote d d 1 d n a binary decision vector where d i is equal to one if site i is visited and zeros otherwise a given value of d represents a given search and destroy strategy with associated expected cost cost d i 1 n c v i d i c r i d i p x i 1 o d c where c is a column vector of length n equals to the expected management cost value if the site is visited c i c v i c r i p x i 1 o it is important to note that the removal cost c r occurs only when the species is present which explains why it is multiplied by the posterior probability that the species is present we can also define ev d the expected number of visited sites where the species is present for a given search and destroy strategy d ev d i 1 n p x i 1 o d i d p where p is the column vector of length n containing all the posterior presence probabilities finally the optimal search and destroy strategy d is the strategy that maximizes the expected number of visited sites where the species is present while remaining below or equal to the budget b 2 d arg max d ev d such that cost d b the optimization problem 2 is a linear integer programming lip problem because both ev and cost are linear function of the binary decision vector d 4 model free search and destroy strategies solving the lip provides an optimal model based search and destroy strategy d this strategy uses posterior presence probabilities that are computed via the hmrf model therefore we refer to it as model based in contrast model free strategies use the noisy observations o to decide which sites to visit for removal it is convenient because no model must be specified and fitted however a major limitation is that these approaches do not account for observation error 4 1 greedy strategy in the case of the greedy strategy the sites where the species has been observed are searched first during the first step the sites where the species was observed are sorted by cost ascending order the site with the lowest cost visit plus removal is visited first the budget is updated each time a site is visited and the species is removed the algorithm then proceeds to the next cheapest site until the budget is exhausted when there is still some budget left but all the sites with positive observations have been searched sites where the species was not observed are then searched starting with the one with the lowest cost 4 2 adaptive cluster sampling acs the acs is a common sampling strategy which favors the observations of neighboring sites thompson 1990 it is based on the idea that the probability of a species being observed at a given site increases when the species has been observed at neighboring sites similarly to the greedy strategy sites where the species was observed are considered first sorted by cost with an ascending order the site selection process is as follows 0 sort the sites where the species has been observed according to their cost ascending order 1 visit the first site on the list and remove it from the list 2 if the species is found on the site then visit one of the neighboring sites giving priority to cheaper sites where the species was observed and remove it from the list created in 0 when the species was not observed on any of the neighboring sites i e no neighbors are in the list select a neighboring site anyway giving priority to cheaper sites repeat step 2 if there is enough budget or stop 3 if the species was not found at a site go back to step 1 if there is enough budget or stop note that this is an adaptation of the original acs from thompson 1990 in the original acs there is no budget constraint therefore all neighboring sites of an occupied site are visited 5 management of melaleuca and old world climbing fern in arthur marshall loxahatchee national wildlife refuge amlnwr 5 1 background melaleuca and old world climbing fern are among the most ecologically harmful invasive plant species in the florida everglades melaleuca is an australian evergreen tree reaching up to 33 m in height langeland et al 2008 that aggressively invades everglades marsh and cypress forest communities the plant was introduced into south florida in the early 1900 s meskimen 1962 and subsequently spread throughout south florida once established melaleuca forms dense single species stands which significantly changes plant species composition and structure rayamajhi et al 2006 2009 and reduces the carrying capacity for wildlife mazzotti et al 1981 the arthur r marshall loxahatchee national wildlife refuge amlnwr currently harbors the most significant melaleuca infestations in the everglades ecosystem old world climbing fern is a twining evergreen fern of asian origin individual fronds can reach up to 30 m langeland et al 2008 and can quickly form dense impenetrable mats of twining fronds this highly invasive fire adapted fern grows high into canopies of everglades tree islands small round shaped forested wetlands scattered throughout the open marsh resulting in the eventual collapse of the canopy and loss of this unique everglades plant community brandt and black 2001 aggressive control efforts are required to mitigate the negative impacts of these aggressive invasive species natural resource managers use combinations of herbicides mechanical controls e g shredding trees hand pulling and classical biological control i e importation of host specific natural enemies of the invasive species to reduce the populations to the lowest feasible level flint and van den bosch 2012 the judicial application of herbicides is the primary method of control in the amlnwr certified applicators are deployed on airboats to melaleuca infestation sites where they either move from plant to plant on the airboat or systematically wade through the marsh carrying machetes and herbicide sprayers old world climbing fern which is primarily found on tree islands is addressed by ferrying groups of applicators to each island where they systematically traverse the tree island and treat observed patches ground based herbicidal control is currently the most effective control tool available to natural resource managers but it is very costly and time consuming the remoteness of the amlnwr high levels of infestation and extreme difficulty perambulating deep peat marshes and dense tree island understories greatly increase the cost of treating these invasive plants contractual service costs for invasive plant management for old world climbing fern and melaleuca within the amlnwr are predicted to average 39 ha range 0 108 and 31 ha range 0 76 respectively sfwmd unpublished data for both plants the entire managed area is first surveyed by plane i e acquisition of the noisy observation o with subsequent ground based searches and treatments 5 2 data description we propose to compare the efficacy of the different search and destroy strategies on simulated examples inspired from the management of these two species to generate realistic spatial distributions i e vectors x we use observations of these species in the arthur marshall loxahatchee national wildlife refuge amlnwr collected on january 12 16 2012 see fig 2 a 1 km grid was generated for the study area resulting in 533 grid cells grid cell statistics based on canopy cover of the cell for each species were computed using arcgis zonal statistics tool both species are present in nearly all grid cells at amlnwr though many cells have very low levels of infestation regarding the aim of our study i e designing search and destroy strategies that maximize the number of visited sites that are occupied for a limited budget having the species present in all sites makes the problem trivial indeed with these data no matter the sites that are selected to be visited they will all be occupied by the species and thus no strategy would dominate for the purpose of illustration we thus selected an arbitrary threshold to convert abundance data into presence absence data such that not all sites were occupied and the map still exhibits a significant spatial structure as a result the estimated value of the hidden markov random field parameters have to be interpreted carefully as they are entirely dependent on the specification of the threshold t we converted the abundance data into presence absence by defining a threshold t 80 equivalent to 0 8 canopy cover within 1 km2 grid cell for old world climbing fern and t 10 equivalent to 0 1 canopy cover within 1 km2 grid cell for melaleuca a cell is then considered occupied unoccupied when the initial abundance is above below the threshold t 5 3 simulation of spatial distribution we use the observed maps for the two species see fig 2a and b to estimate the hidden markov random field parameters α m β m θ fn m θ fp m for melaleuca and α l β l θ fn l θ fp l for old world climbing fern we used α and β to simulate 500 possible occurrence maps for each species or in other words 500 possible values of the vector x for a given occurrence map x we then simulate an observation map o using two values 0 2 and 0 4 for the probability of false positive θ fp and false negative θ fn note that we did not used the estimated error rates θ fn m θ fp m and θ fn l θ fp l so as to compare the strategies in various situations 5 4 visit plus control costs we define the visit cost via a perambulation index see fig 2c based on the site s vegetation community and which reflects the difficulty of accessing the site to generate this index we used the vegetation classification for south florida rutchey et al 2006 the index was calculated by assigning vegetation types on an ordinal scale 1 5 based on professional judgment of effort required to walk through different vegetation types the easiest vegetation type to perambulate sawgrass marsh was assigned a value of 1 and other vegetation types were assigned larger scores based on the difficulty time to cross the area relative to sawgrass marsh for example large tree islands were estimated to take 4 times longer to perambulate than sawgrass marsh and were assigned a score of 4 in the two case studies at most one site is visited per day thus there is no need to incorporate a cost for movement from one site to the next one in the cost definition it means also that the sites selected for visit can be visited in any order we estimated that the visit cost for melaleuca is c v i 1 53 perambulation i and c v i 1 44 perambulation i for old world climbing fern perambulation i is the value of the perambulation index for site i we use the same fixed removal cost for every site based on herbicide and labor costs the removal cost for melaleuca is c r 8563us and c r 17 550us for old world climbing fern all the costs are given per km2 5 5 comparison process a schematic representation of the comparison process is available in fig 3 first a simulated true occurrence map x of the species is simulated using the estimated values of the hmrf parameters α m β m for melaleuca and α l β l for lygodium this map is then used to simulate the observations o using the desired value of the probability of having false positive and false negative observations more precisely for every site if the species is present it is detected with probability 1 θ fn when the species is not present it is mistakenly detected with probability θ fp the raw observations and the cost information are then directly used to determine which sites to visit in red on fig 3 for the greedy and adaptive cluster sampling strategy the random strategy only selects sites at random and thus doesn t use any prior information finally the observations map is used to estimate the hmrf parameters α β θ fn θ fp as well as the posterior presence probabilities these posterior probabilities and the cost are then used as input to the problem of optimal control strategy defined in equation 2 and d is computed this process is repeated 500 times and the number of visited occupied sites is recorded for all strategies the expected number of visited occupied sites ev is then approximated by the average number of visited occupied sites on the 500 simulated examples with a 3 1 ghz intel core i7 processor it takes around 62 s to execute one run of the comparison process i e true map and observations simulation estimate the hmrf parameters and posteriors and compute the optimal strategy for each simulated map the management budget is determined so that approximately 10 of the sites can be visited and the species removed when present 6 results the hmrf parameters obtained from the observed maps of the two species were α m β m θ fn m θ fp m 0 16943 1 2681 0 0 for melaleuca and α l β l θ fn l θ fp l 0 015706 0 90949 0 0 for old world climbing fern thus there was no evidence of detection or misclassification error for this data set which may be explained by the fact that we aggregated fine scale presence absence observation at 1 km2 scale nevertheless we evaluated the performance of our approach under various level of observation errors as described previously the estimated expected number of occupied sites visited for each species and strategy are available in fig 4 the optimal strategy d outperformed all the other strategies the performance of all the strategies decreased with an increase in the observation error the worst performance was achieved when θ fn θ fp 0 4 the model based strategy did not appear to be more affected by either error type in contrast the model free strategies were more sensitive to false positive errors this may be explained by the fact that model free strategies generally target sites where the species has been observed therefore an increase in the probability of false positive lead survey crews to visit sites that are in fact unoccupied for melaleuca the optimal strategy under our simulated scenarios would allow field crews to visit 20 more occupied sites than the best non probabilistic strategy in average over all the tested observation errors and 34 more for the old world climbing fern on the simulated maps melaleuca was generally present in greater proportion which implies that the model free strategies are more likely to visit occupied sites even the random strategy has a greater efficiency for melaleuca than for old world climbing fern presumably because of the differences in the proportion of sites occupied see figure 4 7 discussion we have proposed an approach to designing a search and destroy strategy for the spatial allocation of control actions based on noisy observations false negative i e imperfect detection and false positive observations i e misclassification and heterogeneous costs this approach consists of estimating the probability of the species presence at each site based on observations acquired during the surveys the probability of occurrence was estimated using hidden markov random field hmrf to model the spatial distribution of the species the probability of occurrence cost of visits and control are then used as input variables of a linear integer programming problem the sites to visit described by the optimal solution d represent the best trade off between the probability of finding the species if visited and visit plus control cost we compared our model based strategy to two model free strategies we found that there are several benefits to using the model based approach first the model free approach ignores important sources of uncertainty whereas the model based approach produces posterior probabilities of occurrence that account for misclassification error e g false positive thus the information during the survey is more nuanced and acknowledges the possibility that an observation is incorrect e g a site is classified as occupied when it is in fact empty this is in contrast with the model free approach which is only based on binary outcomes detection non detection of invasive at a site that ignore these errors another benefit of the model based approach is that it accounts for the spatial structure of the system by using a spatially explicit modeling approach i e hmrf which in turn allows us to better account for observation errors our simulations which were based on empirical data of old world climbing fern and melaleuca distributions showed that substantial improvements in efficiency up to 34 more sites in the old world climbing fern example could be gained by using the model based approach combined with an optimization routine note that our approach is not necessarily dependent on the hmrf model indeed other statistical approaches e g see diggle 2013 that model the occurrence probability and account for the spatial structure of the data can be used as an input of the optimization problem nonetheless the hmrf is a powerful framework because it provides ready to use algorithms that automatically fit the model parameters and compute the posterior probabilities by only providing a single map of observations i e with no need for repeated visits as is the case for most occupancy models mackenzie 2006 both the em algorithm and the belief propagation algorithm can deal with missing observations this is particularly useful when the study area can only be partially surveyed finally hmrf can also be applied to noisy abundance or counts observations and to more than two classes in the hidden real occurrence map instead of presence absence maps we could therefore estimate from observations a segmentation of the surveyed area into classes describing low intermediate and high density areas multistate occupancy models can also be used in this case if the appropriate survey design is implemented e g nichols et al 2007 the objective function of our optimization problem can be modified in this case for example one may want to optimize the number of visited sites where the species is present in high density there are a number of limitations to the process that we have proposed and which could be improved in the future for instance future development may consider the incorporation of spatial covariates e g water levels or other covariates that may affect plant distribution in some cases different type of observations are available such that information from the previous year or information provided by an external entity e g report from a citizen the hmrf framework can handle these types of information as in peyrard et al 2013 one limitation for the application of advanced computational methods for management and conservation is the lack of easy to use decision support tools in order to address this impediment we developed a matlab graphical user interface to simplify the use of our method the only input to implement our approach are the observations and costs for each site saved in an xlsx or csv file parameter estimation posterior estimation and optimization are then run automatically here we focused on invasive plant management in the everglades but of course our work is relevant to other systems it may be relevant for trap placement and removal of invasive animals other applications may include the control of plant pathogens e g phytophthora ramorum or sudden oak death haas et al 2011 or to the optimal extraction of resources in space e g minerals or biological resources in each of these applications the consideration of imperfect detection and misclassification errors could reduce cost and improve efficiency the vast increase in imagery data obtained from many new sources e g unmanned aerial systems and satellite provide great opportunities to improve management of natural resources by applying modern computational methods machine learning methods such as a convolutional neural network krizhevsky et al 2012 seem promising for the automatic classification of an invasive species over a landscape our results show that imperfect detection and misclassification errors can substantially reduce the efficiency of monitoring and control these sources of error are often ignored in the context of invasive species management and other natural resource management applications but our method offers a framework to address this problem 8 data accessibility the method is coded in matlab and all the codes are available on a public repository https github com mbonneau13 search n destroy strategy git for non matlab users we created a graphical user interface in order to upload the observation and costs data as a csv or xlsx file

25143,imperfect detection and misclassification errors are often ignored in the context of invasive species management here we present an approach that combines spatially explicit models and an optimization technique to design optimal search and destroy strategies based on noisy monitoring observations we focus on two invasive plants melaleuca melaleuca quinquenervia and old world climbing fern lygodium microphyllum which continue to cause important damages to the everglades ecosystem we present a methodological framework that combines hidden markov random field hmrf initially developed for image analysis and linear programming to optimally search for invasive species a benefit of this approach is that it accounts for the spatial structure of the system by using a spatially explicit modeling approach i e hmrf and does not require repeated visits to model the probability of occurrence of species we found on simulated cases that our approach can lead to substantial improvements in control efficiency when compared to state of the art model free approaches for example in the case of the old world fern simulations showed that the optimal strategy would allow managers to control up to 34 more sites than with model free approaches that ignored misclassification and imperfect detection for melaleuca it was possible to control up to 20 more sites the vast increase in imagery data obtained from different sources e g unmanned aerial systems and satellite provides great opportunities to improve management of natural resources by applying modern computational methods such as the one we present our approach can substantially increases the efficiency of invasive species control by accounting for imperfect detection misclassification error and the spatial structure of the system our approach is applicable to other systems and problems for example it could be applied to the control of plant pathogens or optimal extraction of resources e g minerals or biological resources

2011 and services charles and dukes 2008 and may require intensive management to protect natural resources it has been estimated that the current damage cost in the u s alone is approximately 120

method accounts for imperfect detection false negative and misclassification errors false positive which can substantially reduce the efficiency of monitoring and control of invasives mehta et al 2007 miller et al 2011 rout et al 2013 moore et al 2014 we based our framework on a classical probabilistic tool initially developed for image analysis the hidden markov random field hmrf brémaud 2013 hmrf is a powerful framework often used to perform segmentation or pixel classification autonomously an important application is the analysis of three dimensional medical images from magnetic resonance mr zhang et al 2001 the data from mr imaging are far too complex to be analyzed manually and automatic procedures are needed to produce a segmentation of the original image into different tissue classes such as gray or white matter and cerebrospinal fluid for brain imaging this image is then used for further analysis by the practitioner in practice electronic noises are among biases that justify the need for removing noise from the image to identify the classes in this context hmrf have been developed to compute the probability that a pixel originates from a given class based on the intensity distribution and spatial structure of the initial noisy image zhang et al 2001 the hmrf framework has been used in several other fields beyond medicine such as epidemiology and archeology besag et al 1991 genetic studies to investigate population structure françois et al 2006 and ecology for the monitoring of an invasive ant species in australia peyrard et al 2013 in many ecological applications the observations of a target species collected during surveys can be converted to a black and white image where black pixels correspond to sites in which the species was recorded whereas white pixels correspond to site with no detection similarly to the mr imaging example this black and white image is a noisy version of the true unknown spatial distribution of the species composed of two classes presence absence of the species while the noise correspond to misclassification and imperfect detection errors we extend previous work on invasive species mapping peyrard et al 2013 by combining hmrf with linear integer programming lip to optimally control invasive species in space specifically the presence absence observations from the initial survey are used to fit the hmrf model parameters the fitted model is then used to estimate the probability of species occurrence at each site the hmrf model accounts for spatial dependencies between observations and the computed probabilities account for the possible misclassification and imperfect detection finally the probabilities and heterogeneous visit and control costs form the input of the optimization problem which consists of identifying the set of locations to visit so as to maximize the removal of invasive for a fixed budget we apply a branch and bound algorithm wolsey and nemhauser 1999 to solve the lip optimization problem we illustrate the efficacy of the solution compared to model free monitoring strategies that do not take noise spatial correlation and visit plus control cost into account greedy strategy and modified

wildlife refuge amlnwr palm beach county florida usa 2 materials and methods 2 1 hmrf how to compute posterior presence probabilities using noisy observations we assume that the study area is divided into n square sites on each site i 1 n a first random variable x i indicating the presence i e x i 1 or the absence i e x i 0 of the species is defined second we define an observation variable o i equals to 1 when the species has been detected during the initial survey and 0 otherwise then x x 1 x n is the vector of the true unknown occurrence of the species over the study area and o o 1 o n the vector of observations the possible observation error implies that x i and o i are not necessarily equal and we denote θ fn p o i 0 x i 1 the probability of false negative observation often referred in the ecological literature as imperfect detection see yoccoz et al 2001 in other words the species of interest is not detected when it is in fact present and θ fp p o i 1 x i 0 the probability of false positive observation this is a type of misclassification error in which the species is recorded as present when it is in fact absent this could result from the case where another species is confused with the target species see miller et al 2011 martin et al 2015 in the following p denotes a probability distribution p x o is the probability that x is the true occurrence vector given all the observations o and p x i 1 o is the conditional or posterior probability that the species is present in site i given the observations and p x i 0 o 1 p x i 1 o is the posterior probability that the species is not present the hidden markov random field hmrf framework is a particular family of probability distribution p which benefits from powerful algorithms allowing to estimate the parameter of the distribution and compute posterior probabilities given noisy observations we used a classical potts hmrf model potts 1952 where the probability of any occurrence vector is given by 1 p x x o o exp i 1 n α x i β i j e eq x i x j i 1 n log p o i x i where eq x i x j is equal to 1 if and only if variable x i and x j are equal i e if species is present both at sites i and j e is the set of pairs of sites corresponding to first order neighborhood sites i e all the pairs of sites that share an edge more precisely except on the border of the study area any site has four neighbors located north east south and west hmrf models are generally described using a graph where nodes represent the random variables x i and o i with an edge between x i o i and between x i and x j if i and j are neighbor sites this graph is useful for its easy visual interpretation an absence of edges between two variables indicates that these two variables are independent when all the other variables are known fig 1 shows examples of a graphical representation of a markov random field and a hidden markov random field each node of the graphs represents a random variable x i represents the presence x i 1 or absence x i 0 of the species at location i while o i represents the result of observation of site i o i 1 when the species is detected and o i 0 when the species was not detected at site i edges represent the dependence between variables mrf models is the two dimensional version of markov chain models where value of the process at one time step t only depends of the process at the previous time step t 1 in two dimensions the markov property translates into the value of x i only depends on its neighbors in this example and in the article we consider first order neighbors such that neighbors of variable x 5 are x 2 x 4 x 8 x 6 and of variable x 1 are x 2 x 6 to illustrate this property suppose that site 5 is not accessible and thus cannot be observed in order to estimate the value of x 5 observing sites 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 and 9 instead of only sites 2 4 8 and 6 does not provide any additional information finally a hmrf is an extension of markov random field mrf where the x layer represents the true value of the phenomenon that cannot be observed directly and the o layer represents the noisy observation of x an important property of hmrf models is that when the x layer is know all observation variables o are independent this is why on the graph there is no edge between the observation variables in b the x layer is drawn gray for illustrative purposes only a common interpretation of the potts model is that parameter α is responsible for the proportion of occupied sites and β is the correlation parameter responsible for the patchiness of the spatial distribution positive values of β generally lead to the posterior presence probability at a given site to increase with the number of neighbors where the species have been observed for more details about hmrf see brémaud 2013 finally the term i 1 n log p o i x i carries the information brought by the noisy observations in this article we used the following approach i use the observations to estimate the parameters of the hmrf model α β θ fn θ fp and ii use the estimated parameters to estimate the posterior probabilities at each site i e the probability that the species is present at each site given the observation as one can note the observation errors are not an input parameters and they need not to be estimated before using our approach in fact this can be a valuable output of the parameter estimation step another advantage of using the hmrf framework is that there is a common algorithms for parameters and posterior probability estimation to estimate the parameters we used the so called expectation maximisation e m bilmes et al 1998 algorithm the em algorithm is a classical algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation in presence of hidden data the algorithm starts with an initial value for the parameters then the parameters are iteratively updated by maximizing the expected loglikelihood of the complete data x o conditional on the observations o o and the current estimates the e step corresponds to the computation of this expectation and the m step to its maximization in practice for hmrf exact computation in the e step is out of reach and we have applied the approximation proposed in celeux et al 2003 to compute the posterior probabilities we used a belief propagation algorithm pearl 1988 see supplementary figure s1 for an illustration of parameters and posteriors estimation process 3 optimal search and destroy strategy the posterior presence probabilities p x i 1 o i 1 n are useful because they quantify the level of confidence about the presence of the species based on the observations intuitively the weight of evidence of the presence of the species increases as p x i 1 o gets closer to 1 so we should target sites with large posterior probability to visit in priority but the choice of the sites to survey is complicated by the fact that visit and removal cost further denoted c v i and c r i might be spatially heterogeneous therefore there is a trade off between monitoring many sites even if the presence probability is low and visiting fewer sites that have the greatest presence probabilities this optimization problem fits with on the class of linear integer programming lip problems as we will explain below let s denote d d 1 d n a binary decision vector where d i is equal to one if site i is visited and zeros otherwise a given value of d represents a given search and destroy strategy with associated expected cost cost d i 1 n c v i d i c r i d i p x i 1 o d c where c is a column vector of length n equals to the expected management cost value if the site is visited c i c v i c r i p x i 1 o it is important to note that the removal cost c r occurs only when the species is present which explains why it is multiplied by the posterior probability that the species is present we can also define ev d the expected number of visited sites where the species is present for a given search and destroy strategy d ev d i 1 n p x i 1 o d i d p where p is the column vector of length n containing all the posterior presence probabilities finally the optimal search and destroy strategy d is the strategy that maximizes the expected number of visited sites where the species is present while remaining below or equal to the budget b 2 d arg max d ev d such that cost d b the optimization problem 2 is a linear integer programming lip problem because both ev and cost are linear function of the binary decision vector d 4 model free search and destroy strategies solving the lip provides an optimal model based search and destroy strategy d this strategy uses posterior presence probabilities that are computed via the hmrf model therefore we refer to it as model based in contrast model free strategies use the noisy observations o to decide which sites to visit for removal it is convenient because no model must be specified and fitted however a major limitation is that these approaches do not account for observation error 4 1 greedy strategy in the case of the greedy strategy the sites where the species has been observed are searched first during the first step the sites where the species was observed are sorted by cost ascending order the site with the lowest cost visit plus removal is visited first the budget is updated each time a site is visited and the species is removed the algorithm then proceeds to the next cheapest site until the budget is exhausted when there is still some budget left but all the sites with positive observations have been searched sites where the species was not observed are then searched starting with the one with the lowest cost 4 2 adaptive cluster sampling acs the acs is a common sampling strategy which favors the observations of neighboring sites thompson 1990 it is based on the idea that the probability of a species being observed at a given site increases when the species has been observed at neighboring sites similarly to the greedy strategy sites where the species was observed are considered first sorted by cost with an ascending order the site selection process is as follows 0 sort the sites where the species has been observed according to their cost ascending order 1 visit the first site on the list and remove it from the list 2 if the species is found on the site then visit one of the neighboring sites giving priority to cheaper sites where the species was observed and remove it from the list created in 0 when the species was not observed on any of the neighboring sites i e no neighbors are in the list select a neighboring site anyway giving priority to cheaper sites repeat step 2 if there is enough budget or stop 3 if the species was not found at a site go back to step 1 if there is enough budget or stop note that this is an adaptation of the original acs from thompson 1990 in the original acs there is no budget constraint therefore all neighboring sites of an occupied site are visited 5 management of melaleuca and old world climbing fern in arthur marshall loxahatchee national wildlife refuge amlnwr 5 1 background melaleuca and old world climbing fern are among the most ecologically harmful invasive plant species in the florida everglades melaleuca is an australian evergreen tree reaching up to 33 m in height langeland et al 2008 that aggressively invades everglades marsh and cypress forest communities the plant was introduced into south florida in the early 1900 s meskimen 1962 and subsequently spread throughout south florida once established melaleuca forms dense single species stands which significantly changes plant species composition and structure rayamajhi et al 2006 2009 and reduces the carrying capacity for wildlife mazzotti et al 1981 the arthur r marshall loxahatchee national wildlife refuge amlnwr currently harbors the most significant melaleuca infestations in the everglades ecosystem old world climbing fern is a twining evergreen fern of asian origin individual fronds can reach up to 30 m langeland et al 2008 and can quickly form dense impenetrable mats of twining fronds this highly invasive fire adapted fern grows high into canopies of everglades tree islands small round shaped forested wetlands scattered throughout the open marsh resulting in the eventual collapse of the canopy and loss of this unique everglades plant community brandt and black 2001 aggressive control efforts are required to mitigate the negative impacts of these aggressive invasive species natural resource managers use combinations of herbicides mechanical controls e g shredding trees hand pulling and classical biological control i e importation of host specific natural enemies of the invasive species to reduce the populations to the lowest feasible level flint and van den bosch 2012 the judicial application of herbicides is the primary method of control in the amlnwr certified applicators are deployed on airboats to melaleuca infestation sites where they either move from plant to plant on the airboat or systematically wade through the marsh carrying machetes and herbicide sprayers old world climbing fern which is primarily found on tree islands is addressed by ferrying groups of applicators to each island where they systematically traverse the tree island and treat observed patches ground based herbicidal control is currently the most effective control tool available to natural resource managers but it is very costly and time consuming the remoteness of the amlnwr high levels of infestation and extreme difficulty perambulating deep peat marshes and dense tree island understories greatly increase the cost of treating these invasive plants contractual service costs for invasive plant management for old world climbing fern and melaleuca within the amlnwr are predicted to average 39 ha range 0 108 and 31 ha range 0 76 respectively sfwmd unpublished data for both plants the entire managed area is first surveyed by plane i e acquisition of the noisy observation o with subsequent ground based searches and treatments 5 2 data description we propose to compare the efficacy of the different search and destroy strategies on simulated examples inspired from the management of these two species to generate realistic spatial distributions i e vectors x we use observations of these species in the arthur marshall loxahatchee national wildlife refuge amlnwr collected on january 12 16 2012 see fig 2 a 1 km grid was generated for the study area resulting in 533 grid cells grid cell statistics based on canopy cover of the cell for each species were computed using arcgis zonal statistics tool both species are present in nearly all grid cells at amlnwr though many cells have very low levels of infestation regarding the aim of our study i e designing search and destroy strategies that maximize the number of visited sites that are occupied for a limited budget having the species present in all sites makes the problem trivial indeed with these data no matter the sites that are selected to be visited they will all be occupied by the species and thus no strategy would dominate for the purpose of illustration we thus selected an arbitrary threshold to convert abundance data into presence absence data such that not all sites were occupied and the map still exhibits a significant spatial structure as a result the estimated value of the hidden markov random field parameters have to be interpreted carefully as they are entirely dependent on the specification of the threshold t we converted the abundance data into presence absence by defining a threshold t 80 equivalent to 0 8 canopy cover within 1 km2 grid cell for old world climbing fern and t 10 equivalent to 0 1 canopy cover within 1 km2 grid cell for melaleuca a cell is then considered occupied unoccupied when the initial abundance is above below the threshold t 5 3 simulation of spatial distribution we use the observed maps for the two species see fig 2a and b to estimate the hidden markov random field parameters α m β m θ fn m θ fp m for melaleuca and α l β l θ fn l θ fp l for old world climbing fern we used α and β to simulate 500 possible occurrence maps for each species or in other words 500 possible values of the vector x for a given occurrence map x we then simulate an observation map o using two values 0 2 and 0 4 for the probability of false positive θ fp and false negative θ fn note that we did not used the estimated error rates θ fn m θ fp m and θ fn l θ fp l so as to compare the strategies in various situations 5 4 visit plus control costs we define the visit cost via a perambulation index see fig 2c based on the site s vegetation community and which reflects the difficulty of accessing the site to generate this index we used the vegetation classification for south florida rutchey et al 2006 the index was calculated by assigning vegetation types on an ordinal scale 1 5 based on professional judgment of effort required to walk through different vegetation types the easiest vegetation type to perambulate sawgrass marsh was assigned a value of 1 and other vegetation types were assigned larger scores based on the difficulty time to cross the area relative to sawgrass marsh for example large tree islands were estimated to take 4 times longer to perambulate than sawgrass marsh and were assigned a score of 4 in the two case studies at most one site is visited per day thus there is no need to incorporate a cost for movement from one site to the next one in the cost definition it means also that the sites selected for visit can be visited in any order we estimated that the visit cost for melaleuca is c v i 1 53 perambulation i and c v i 1 44 perambulation i for old world climbing fern perambulation i is the value of the perambulation index for site i we use the same fixed removal cost for every site based on herbicide and labor costs the removal cost for melaleuca is c r 8563us and c r 17 550us for old world climbing fern all the costs are given per km2 5 5 comparison process a schematic representation of the comparison process is available in fig 3 first a simulated true occurrence map x of the species is simulated using the estimated values of the hmrf parameters α m β m for melaleuca and α l β l for lygodium this map is then used to simulate the observations o using the desired value of the probability of having false positive and false negative observations more precisely for every site if the species is present it is detected with probability 1 θ fn when the species is not present it is mistakenly detected with probability θ fp the raw observations and the cost information are then directly used to determine which sites to visit in red on fig 3 for the greedy and adaptive cluster sampling strategy the random strategy only selects sites at random and thus doesn t use any prior information finally the observations map is used to estimate the hmrf parameters α β θ fn θ fp as well as the posterior presence probabilities these posterior probabilities and the cost are then used as input to the problem of optimal control strategy defined in equation 2 and d is computed this process is repeated 500 times and the number of visited occupied sites is recorded for all strategies the expected number of visited occupied sites ev is then approximated by the average number of visited occupied sites on the 500 simulated examples with a 3 1 ghz intel core i7 processor it takes around 62 s to execute one run of the comparison process i e true map and observations simulation estimate the hmrf parameters and posteriors and compute the optimal strategy for each simulated map the management budget is determined so that approximately 10 of the sites can be visited and the species removed when present 6 results the hmrf parameters obtained from the observed maps of the two species were α m β m θ fn m θ fp m 0 16943 1 2681 0 0 for melaleuca and α l β l θ fn l θ fp l 0 015706 0 90949 0 0 for old world climbing fern thus there was no evidence of detection or misclassification error for this data set which may be explained by the fact that we aggregated fine scale presence absence observation at 1 km2 scale nevertheless we evaluated the performance of our approach under various level of observation errors as described previously the estimated expected number of occupied sites visited for each species and strategy are available in fig 4 the optimal strategy d outperformed all the other strategies the performance of all the strategies decreased with an increase in the observation error the worst performance was achieved when θ fn θ fp 0 4 the model based strategy did not appear to be more affected by either error type in contrast the model free strategies were more sensitive to false positive errors this may be explained by the fact that model free strategies generally target sites where the species has been observed therefore an increase in the probability of false positive lead survey crews to visit sites that are in fact unoccupied for melaleuca the optimal strategy under our simulated scenarios would allow field crews to visit 20 more occupied sites than the best non probabilistic strategy in average over all the tested observation errors and 34 more for the old world climbing fern on the simulated maps melaleuca was generally present in greater proportion which implies that the model free strategies are more likely to visit occupied sites even the random strategy has a greater efficiency for melaleuca than for old world climbing fern presumably because of the differences in the proportion of sites occupied see figure 4 7 discussion we have proposed an approach to designing a search and destroy strategy for the spatial allocation of control actions based on noisy observations false negative i e imperfect detection and false positive observations i e misclassification and heterogeneous costs this approach consists of estimating the probability of the species presence at each site based on observations acquired during the surveys the probability of occurrence was estimated using hidden markov random field hmrf to model the spatial distribution of the species the probability of occurrence cost of visits and control are then used as input variables of a linear integer programming problem the sites to visit described by the optimal solution d represent the best trade off between the probability of finding the species if visited and visit plus control cost we compared our model based strategy to two model free strategies we found that there are several benefits to using the model based approach first the model free approach ignores important sources of uncertainty whereas the model based approach produces posterior probabilities of occurrence that account for misclassification error e g false positive thus the information during the survey is more nuanced and acknowledges the possibility that an observation is incorrect e g a site is classified as occupied when it is in fact empty this is in contrast with the model free approach which is only based on binary outcomes detection non detection of invasive at a site that ignore these errors another benefit of the model based approach is that it accounts for the spatial structure of the system by using a spatially explicit modeling approach i e hmrf which in turn allows us to better account for observation errors our simulations which were based on empirical data of old world climbing fern and melaleuca distributions showed that substantial improvements in efficiency up to 34 more sites in the old world climbing fern example could be gained by using the model based approach combined with an optimization routine note that our approach is not necessarily dependent on the hmrf model indeed other statistical approaches e g see diggle 2013 that model the occurrence probability and account for the spatial structure of the data can be used as an input of the optimization problem nonetheless the hmrf is a powerful framework because it provides ready to use algorithms that automatically fit the model parameters and compute the posterior probabilities by only providing a single map of observations i e with no need for repeated visits as is the case for most occupancy models mackenzie 2006 both the em algorithm and the belief propagation algorithm can deal with missing observations this is particularly useful when the study area can only be partially surveyed finally hmrf can also be applied to noisy abundance or counts observations and to more than two classes in the hidden real occurrence map instead of presence absence maps we could therefore estimate from observations a segmentation of the surveyed area into classes describing low intermediate and high density areas multistate occupancy models can also be used in this case if the appropriate survey design is implemented e g nichols et al 2007 the objective function of our optimization problem can be modified in this case for example one may want to optimize the number of visited sites where the species is present in high density there are a number of limitations to the process that we have proposed and which could be improved in the future for instance future development may consider the incorporation of spatial covariates e g water levels or other covariates that may affect plant distribution in some cases different type of observations are available such that information from the previous year or information provided by an external entity e g report from a citizen the hmrf framework can handle these types of information as in peyrard et al 2013 one limitation for the application of advanced computational methods for management and conservation is the lack of easy to use decision support tools in order to address this impediment we developed a matlab graphical user interface to simplify the use of our method the only input to implement our approach are the observations and costs for each site saved in an xlsx or csv file parameter estimation posterior estimation and optimization are then run automatically here we focused on invasive plant management in the everglades but of course our work is relevant to other systems it may be relevant for trap placement and removal of invasive animals other applications may include the control of plant pathogens e g phytophthora ramorum or sudden oak death haas et al 2011 or to the optimal extraction of resources in space e g minerals or biological resources in each of these applications the consideration of imperfect detection and misclassification errors could reduce cost and improve efficiency the vast increase in imagery data obtained from many new sources e g unmanned aerial systems and satellite provide great opportunities to improve management of natural resources by applying modern computational methods machine learning methods such as a convolutional neural network krizhevsky et al 2012 seem promising for the automatic classification of an invasive species over a landscape our results show that imperfect detection and misclassification errors can substantially reduce the efficiency of monitoring and control these sources of error are often ignored in the context of invasive species management and other natural resource management applications but our method offers a framework to address this problem 8 data accessibility the method is coded in matlab and all the codes are available on a public repository https github com mbonneau13 search n destroy strategy git for non matlab users we created a graphical user interface in order to upload the observation and costs data as a csv or xlsx file

25144,it is known that financial insurance can address the economic impacts of a natural disaster but some ecological aspects can play a crucial role in mitigating the overall risks for socio ecological systems to better strengthen the study of these relations the aims of this paper are 1 to analyze the main research topics of the scientific literature on ecological and or financial economic insurance to face natural disasters through a co word network analysis 2 to analyze the temporal trends of the total gross insurance premium and meteorological and climatological extreme events in 29 oecd countries and 3 to carry out a principal component analysis pca of some selected variables in order to conceptualize a first empirical model combining financial economic and ecological insurance to face natural disasters the literature review has shown a predominance of topics related to financial insurance about 60 and the co word map of key words has highlighted a common space where economic and ecological insurances interact pca highlighted three major components explaining 90 6 of the overall variation and discriminating aspects more related to the financial insurance from those related to the ecological insurance more in detail pc1 which represents the financial insurance explains the 60 4 of variation pc2 and pc3 that represent surrogates of the ecological insurance explain respectively the 19 6 and the 10 6 of variation on the basis of the application of the proposed empirical model countries with high levels of financial and ecological preparedness have been identified the next steps of this research will be focused on a pilot study area where a quantitative assessment will be applied to better define the landscape contribution to

terrestrial protected areas financial ecological preparedness 1 introduction the limits of predictability of complex adaptive living systems need to be recognized and a pragmatic modeling philosophy of science needs to be adopted allowing new adaptive approaches to deal with natural disasters costanza and jørgensen 2002 the devastating effects of natural disasters e g earthquakes cyclones floods and droughts in their sudden and shocking occurrence are source of concern and alarm world bank 2017 in general a disaster or catastrophe is a typical unexpected event that causes negative effects in many areas of daily life communication supply of electricity and water etc but above all significant losses of goods and people swiss reinsurance institute swiss re 2017 although it is certainly true that these phenomena are merely outward manifestations of an inherent dynamism of our planet and that mankind has always been exposed to their destructive action it is equally true that we have been witnessing an intensification of calamitous events in recent years dankers et al 2014 hall et al 2014 this trend is confirmed also by the analysis of climate data indicating a substantial increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events ipcc 2014 from this perspective some recent years like 2011 have faced so many natural disasters that they have been defined as annus horribilis for natural catastrophes by insurance leaders courbage and stahel 2012 despite their high and growing frequency and intensity the enormous costs and the numerous casualties these disastrous events are still generally perceived as exceptional natural events that interrupt normal anthropic development and require humanitarian actions to mitigate losses bureau for crisis prevention and recovery bcpr undp 2004 furthermore despite the scientific interest in natural hazards has seen an increase in research and publications the governmental world is too often dormant up until the disaster has occurred cutter et al 2007 in the frame of the definition of disaster seen above natural disasters are catastrophic events caused by nature or by the natural processes of the earth the severity of a disaster is measured in lost lives economic loss and population capacity to rebuild earthquakes windstorms floods and diseases are extreme sudden events that hit everywhere on earth often without notice hoeppe 2016 they can also be defined as stochastic events such as weather extremes fires or pest outbreaks that can often directly affect the state of the system such as eliminating parts of populations scheffer et al 2001 when natural disasters occur social and economic activities and the well being of people are likely to be affected adeagbo et al 2016 according to the centre for research on the epidemiology of disasters cred 2014 five categories of natural disaster can be identified covering 16 disaster types table 1 catastrophic events link environmental risks to financial economic and social risks where the former are often characterized by high levels of uncertainty with far reaching consequences given that some of them even occur in distant places and are therefore sustained by others thus the perception of environmental hazards which significantly influences the responses to any risk may result in a discount of such risks tobin and montz 1997 tobin et al 2005 whiteford and tobin 2004 that is those risks are taken less seriously than the risks with negative results that occur for sure now here and for us gattig and hendrickx 2007 1 1 financial economic insurance and natural disasters the insurance sector is highly exposed to natural disasters and climate change because of more frequent and severe extreme weather events causing more claims which can lead to insurance market failure dlugolecki 2009 johannsdottir et al 2014 although recently the forecasting of extreme events and systems of disaster preparedness and response have improved significantly the rising prosperity and the associated increased density of human settlements and economic activities have resulted in proportionally more people and more capital being placed at risk when disasters strike adam 2013 barthel and neumayer 2012 the losses due to extreme natural disasters can have significant economic consequences for individual property owners and businesses especially when these effects exceed their current financial capacity in this context insurance is an instrument to tackle the economic impacts of natural disasters representing the natural counterpart of ex post or reactive disaster recovery funding adam 2013 through a pro active approach based on the payment of a premium however although the market for insurance instruments against natural disasters has developed significantly it remains small relative to the potential demand for insurance borensztein et al 2017 insurance companies traditionally used to work making each individual or business pay a premium to protect themselves against an uncertain loss in this sense insurance managing risks promotes recovery from disasters because insurance reduces financial risks for households by spreading risks over many policyholders and helps economically people after a disaster occurs benali and feki 2017 however the insurance industry could play a significant role in different directions not only insurance policies cover claims of third parties who allege injury or property damage but insurance can also be seen as a part of a risk management system that should include the identification assessment and understanding of a risk in order to minimize the potential harm of natural disasters by implementing strategies and actions to control and reduce risks on an economic point of view insurance enhances social welfare while at the same time inducing their holders to take reasonable i e cost effective precautions by internalising the damage furthermore insurance encourages the risk averse insured party to make investments because the pricing of risks generates a clear economic benefit from precautionary spending porrini and schwarze 2014 generally the challenge of reducing in the future the consequences of natural disasters is framed in terms of the potential strategy of mitigation disaster risk mitigation is one of the most important priorities for insurance companies and indicates any action taken to permanently eliminate or reduce the long term risk and hazards of climate change to human life benali and feki 2017 studies on risk reduction of the impact of natural catastrophes have focused on pérez maqueo et al 2007 a the analyses of social processes and possible underlying causes of the disaster event alexander 2000 holzmann and jørgensen 2004 b the economics and strategies for financing post disaster infrastructures able to support their recovery berz 2004 gollier 2005 c the role of the government private sector and ngos for disaster preparedness and risk prevention benson et al 2001 daniels et al 2006 and d a modeling approach to analyze the interplay between investment in mitigation and risk sharing measures amendola et al 2000 in the last case the premiums provide a clear signal and encourage insurers to engage in mitigation measures to reduce vulnerabilities to disasters in addition premiums allow insurers to offer discounts to owners and businesses that invest in preventive measures benali and feki 2017 a risk reduction strategy should sustain the mitigation of the impacts of natural disasters with less risks for economic systems therefore the target could be to tackle the consequences of natural disasters by the promotion of ways to support an effective limitation of economic losses and the management of risks from extreme hazards if and how insurance plays a role in a country is influenced by local traditions cultural factors experience with disasters availability of data as well as the engagement of the public and private sectors porrini and schwarze 2014 in any case the time taken to recover from the impact of disasters natural or man made is a function of preparedness in fact individuals and households with some form of contingency plan in place are likely to recover more quickly than those without any such plans in this perspective insurance policies and or other savings schemes formal or informal will prove to be useful for quick recovery and reconstruction adeagbo et al 2016 finally it is crucial to consider how resilient robust are the insurance arrangements otherwise insurance companies will fail if there are multiple claims as in the case of the united states of america in the 1920s when youthful companies have incurred substantial losses in paying out large claims before they had built up reserves gonzález dávila et al 2014 however if individuals are risk averse and insurance against a risk is offered at an actuarially fair price expected utility theory predicts that individuals would buy it in the same way when the perception of natural risk increases the insurance penetration increases as well breckner et al 2016 and the demand for innovative insurance solutions are expected to grow and to develop 1 2 ecological insurance and natural disasters rarely the role of natural and man made ecosystems and the ecosystem services provided to human societies are considered in the programs of development and reduction of risks related to natural disasters pérez maqueo et al 2007 in this context the ecosystem service of disturbance regulation provided by some natural semi natural or man managed ecosystems like forests is identified as a priority for hazard mitigation and risk reduction bronstert 2003 hook 2000 kreimer and arnold 2000 forests provide ecological economic social and aesthetic services to natural systems and humankind bonan 2008 well managed forest protection for example can be effective in protecting against rock fall and reducing the risk of avalanches bebi et al 2009 the growing awareness of the roles that forests play in climate change mitigation has raised global interest in understanding the processes that lead to deforestation and forest restoration chazdon 2008 foley et al 2005 harris et al 2012 and multiple factors from natural and human systems are drivers of the processes geist and lambin 2002 hansen et al 2013 meyfroidt and lambin 2011 miyamoto et al 2014 it is important that the policy makers and the masses are aware of the significance of forests in preventing and mitigating natural disasters zhang et al 2017 in view of these considerations in the context of natural disasters the term ecological insurance can be adopted which includes the three main concepts relating to a set of mechanisms capable of stimulating intrinsic characteristics of self determination of nature the defining elements of ecological insurance include the concepts of resilience carpenter et al 2001 holling 1973 adaptive capacity deutsch et al 2003 and biodiversity in terms of functional diversity baumgärtner 2007 swanson 1992 yachi and loreau 1999 which all act as insurance against an undesirable change of the system ecological insurance will allow for new adaptive approaches to environmental management and better links with social decision making these linkages are particularly important in the real ever changing world so that biodiversity as a manifestation of functional diversity and diversity across scales has a definite value in insuring society against the loss of ecosystem services through the maintenance of the adaptive capacity of socio ecological systems to adjust to biotic and abiotic stresses and to prevent systems shifting to another undesirable state scheffer et al 2001 admiraal et al 2013 adger et al 2005 müller et al 2017 ecosystem services are the direct and indirect contributions of ecosystems to human well being and they support our survival and quality of life millennium ecosystem assessment mea 2005 constituting the base of human needs mäler 2008 the ecosystems which represent the providers of services may exhibit multiple stability domains basins of attraction that differ in fundamental system structure and behavior baumgärtner and strunz 2014 quaas and baumgärtner 2008 the maximum amount that a system can absorb while maintaining its stability domain without flipping into a different one is called resilience holling 1973 1996 resilience is the ability of a system whether it is an individual a forest a city or an economy to face changes and disturbances and continue to develop in addition resilience may also concern the degree to which the system is capable of self organization and its capacity to learn and adapt gunderson and holling 2002 since different stability domains exist in nature any system can experience the so called thresholds dasgupta and mäler 2003 holling 1973 mäler 2008 which the system does not usually cross thanks to its buffering capacity mäler 2008 the buffer concept is explained in relation to the fact that a slightly disturbed system is characterized by a high resilience avoiding the thresholds when disturbance continues to increase the resilience decreases and the threshold limit approaches a point where it is overcome mäler 2008 therefore resilience can be considered as a capital stock or rather a kind of insurance against reaching an undesirable state mäler and li 2010 perrings 1995 by keeping an ecosystem in a desirable domain baumgärtner and strunz 2014 trærup 2012 ensuring that the flow of ecosystem services is not reduced by unforeseen and catastrophic events resilience and adaptive capacity of a system are strongly interconnected so that the higher its ability to adapt the higher its resilience in addition to resilience adaptive capacity is related to a series of concepts such as adaptability coping ability management capacity stability robustness and flexibility adger and kelly 1999 brooks 2003 fraser et al 2003 füssel and klein 2006 jones 2001 smit et al 1999 smithers and smit 1997 tompkins and adger 2004 the key concept of adaptation today is of vital importance to address how the human population can face changes müller and li 2004 adaptive capacity should be conceptualized in terms of the capacity of the social actors in integrated systems to recover from disaster losses this state can be achieved through the adoption of alternative livelihood and construction strategies for the future despite the losses and the stress imposed by disastrous events choudhury and haque 2016 resilience and adaptive capacity are backed by biodiversity which is a form of natural insurance due to functional diversity because it is the basis that supports the supply of ecosystem services from natural and man managed systems such as biomass production pollination nitrogen fixation soil regeneration etc costanza et al 1997 daily 1997 millennium ecosystem assessment mea 2005 the biodiversity in essence constitutes a form of insurance as it ensures a functional complementarity in space and time loreau et al 2003 system protection from environmental risks is directly related to the most species in terms of functional redundancy that can be considered an effective defense against the unpredictability of dangerous events gonzalez et al 2009 loreau et al 2003 norberg et al 2001 yachi and loreau 1999 the presence of the best species performer in different environments promotes greater insurance because it stabilizes the ecosystem and maximizes productivity loreau et al 2003 yachi and loreau 1999 2 aims of the paper given the above mentioned considerations the aims of this paper are 1 to analyze the main research topics coming from the scientific literature focused on ecological and or financial economic insurance to face natural disasters through a co word network analysis 2 to analyze the temporal trends of the total gross insurance premium and meteorological and climatological extreme events in 29 oecd countries given data availability and that meteorological events flood droughts and wind storms typically represent the majority of reported disasters guha sapir et al 2011 rodriguez et al 2009 scheuren et al 2008 and 3 to carry out a principal component analysis pca of some selected variables in order to conceptualize a first empirical model combining financial economic and ecological insurance to implement the preparedness for facing natural disasters 3 materials and methods 3 1 systematic review the first step in this research was a literature survey conducted through academic library databases sciencedirect and google scholar the screening of all titles abstracts and keywords was done by searching and combining the terms ecological insurance economic insurance and natural disasters in this review only works published in english and in scientific journals have been included excluding gray literature such as reports books and lectures although this review did not include any single article focusing on how economic and environmental health insurance can address natural disasters it can represent a significant sample of the most relevant scientific literature on these topics some basic variables have been collected from each article table 2 to assure the scientific relevance of selected papers in analyzing the main findings on the relations between the different forms of ecological and financial insurance and natural disasters the established guidelines for systematic review pullin and stewart 2006 were applied then to better verify the accuracy and reliability of the screening process another reviewer analyzed the first filter of titles and abstracts on a random subsample of 10 of the references finally the level of agreement among the reviewers was measured through cohen s kappa analysis cohen 1960 given a kappa value of 0 803 p 0 001 according to landis and koch 1977 there is a substantial strength of agreement of the screening process among the reviewers in addition to the descriptive statistical analysis a co word analysis ding et al 2001 was carried out through r venables et al 2018 this technique is useful to explore the conceptual network and the development tendency in different fields and is based on the principle that when two or more keywords representing specific research topics appear in the same article it is assumed that they have a relationship the more the co occurrence between the two keywords the closer their relationship is yang et al 2012 given the literature collected the co word analysis is based on the following steps 1 the data extraction of the high frequency keywords 2 the data processing by building the high frequency keywords matrix 3 data analysis based on multivariate analysis methods to find the composition similarity and relationship among keywords and 4 the visualization of the results to determine the cut off point of high low frequency words the high low frequency words boundary fraction proposed by donohue 1973 was applied t 1 0 5 1 8 i where i is the total number of keywords t which is the lowest frequency among the high frequency keywords assumes the value of 37 according to the number of keywords resulting from the literature review however only two keywords overcome this frequency for this reason this study selected the keywords with frequency higher than or equal to 10 forming a similarity matrix 9 9 in particular the calculation method of similarity matrix is conducted through the ochiai coefficient formula o c h i a i c o e f f i c i e n t c a b a b where a and b are respectively the number of keywords a and keywords b and c a b is the number of keywords a and keywords b appearing together 3 2 data acquisition and multivariate analysis table 3 reports the list of acquired data for twenty nine oecd countries fig 1 for which the oecd insurance statistics provide reliable financial data together with information about the temporal range 1993 2015 and their sources these data have been used in the following trend and multivariate analyses therefore in each country the gross insurance premiums which represent the total insurance premiums and the gross claims payments which cover all gross payments made during each financial year have been acquired from oecd insurance statistics in particular data about the catastrophic events for the same time frame and countries of financial data have been acquired from em dat a database launched in 1988 by the centre for research on the epidemiology of disasters cred with the initial support of the world health organization who and the belgian government this database integrates several sources of data including un agencies ngos insurance companies research institutes and press agencies and it makes the data available online detailed data about climatological and meteorological disasters were acquired from this database table 3 data about gdp per capita extracted from world bank database refer to gross domestic product divided by midyear population gdp is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products it is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources data are in constant 2010 u s dollars table 3 average life expectancy data which is positively related to insurance premiums and claims payments johannesson and johansson 1997 represent the average number of years an individual in a country is expected to live the expected inflation rates in line with choate and archer 1975 are established by the inflation rate in previous years extracted from the world bank database for this reason in this study the average inflation rate over the previous eight years is used as a proxy for the expected rate of inflation in each country forested area forest rents and terrestrial protected areas are the last variables included in the analysis acquired from the world bank database the forested area represents the percentage of the area covered by forests in each of the 29 oecd countries in a given year the forest rents represents a percentage of gdp and terrestrial protected areas represent the percentage of the area covered by terrestrial protected areas in each of the 29 oecd countries in a given year at present economic insurance does not consider the role played by ecosystem services in risk mitigation of natural disasters effects which remains economically uninvestigated and unknown hook 2000 pérez maqueo et al 2007 however there are some studies on the role of natural ecosystems such as forests coastal mangroves coral reefs riparian habitats and protected areas in risk reduction programs bronstert 2003 danielsen et al 2005 deboudt 2010 hiraishi and harada 2003 hook 2000 kreimer and arnold 2000 mouillot et al 2008 as well as a more complex and integrated approach shown by pérez maqueo et al 2007 the extent of forests for instance could provide a more effective natural insurance against climatic variability particularly against extreme weather events providing an added value to the conventional more extensively studied economic one figueroa and pasten 2015 therefore a pca was performed on these variables to check any existing correlation among the economic variables typical of the traditional context of financial insurance and some available ecological variables that can represent a surrogate of some regulation service useful to face natural disasters like meteorological extreme events 4 results and discussion 4 1 results of the review the literature review was based on 174 scientific papers focused on financial ecological insurances and natural disasters covering a period from 1983 to january 2018 although there was only one paper published in 1983 followed by an absence of publications till 1993 1995 after a limited research interest from 1983 to 2006 it was possible to highlight a first peak of number of papers in 2007 then it was possible to notice an increasing trend until 2014 when the number of papers showed an outbreak exceeding 30 published articles fig 2 articles were classified on the basis of the types of insurance financial economic and or ecological they are focused on the results highlighted that only 18 of the papers dealt with the integration between financial economic and ecological insurances 62 was focused only on financial economic insurance given the economic origin of the concept and 20 was focused only on ecological insurance fig 3 however there was an increase in the percentage of papers based on an integrated approach between financial economic and ecological insurance from 2007 to 2016 the modeling approach was used in 72 of articles dealing with financial economic and or ecological insurances of which 69 used mathematical statistical models 22 conceptual models and only 9 used the two models in an integrated way fig 4 the temporal trend showed that the integration of models was rather recent as well as the integration between financial economic and ecological insurances figs 3 and 4 as a first indication papers dealing with only ecological insurance were usually based on conceptual models while the financial economic insurance seemed to be addressed through mathematical statistical models the results of co word similarity matrix based on ochiai coefficients and combined with keywords frequency higher than or equal to 10 are shown in fig 5 the size and color of dots reflect the number of papers associated with each keyword while the line width of the links is the density of linkages between two different keywords the wider the line the more significant the link between the keywords risk resulted the most frequent and predominant keyword reflecting the strength of its associations with the other keywords included in the co word analysis this frequency is justified by its use both in ecological and economic papers insurance resulted very strongly related to economic development and growth given the economic connotation of this topic in addition to a close connection with natural disasters which represents a new challenge for the insurance world low levels of association characterized the interplay between insurance and the typically ecological concepts such as resilience ecosystem services and climate change surprisingly there were no significant connections between insurance and vulnerability although vulnerability represents the risk susceptibility to natural disasters in general distinct domains of ecological and economic interest were identified as well as an overlap of keywords characterizing both topics given these common keywords it was possible to argue some links among the basic concepts of financial economic and ecological insurances mainly related to the risks of natural disasters and socio ecological management and vulnerability however aspects related to the resilience of socio ecological systems and the possible role of ecosystem services in facing the effects of climate change are topics still far away from the focus of current financial insurances 4 2 trends and multivariate analysis there was an increasing trend of the total gross insurance premium of the 29 oecd countries under study with its doubling from 2001 to 2015 fig 6 a at the same time there was an increasing trend of the total meteorological and climatological disasters from 1993 to 2015 in the 29 oecd countries fig 6b the pca extracted eight principal components pc with the first three components explaining 90 6 of the overall variation fig 7 in particular pc1 was mainly represented by indices typical of financial insurance like gross insurance premium and gross claims payments explaining the 60 4 of variation pc2 was represented by forested areas and forest rents both surrogates of the ecological insurance explaining 19 6 of variation pc3 was mainly represented by terrestrial protected areas explaining the 10 6 of the overall variation therefore on the basis of the results of the temporal trends where it is evident an increase both in the gross insurance premium and in the total meteorological and climatological disasters and the results of pca demonstrating how current financial economic insurances do not yet take into account the ecological components a new perspective for insurance predictive model is proposed disaster risk mitigation is one of the most important priorities for insurance companies but this task is not easy so that several large insurance companies do not invest in high risk or high exposure areas benali and feki 2017 or propose very high insurance premiums which could lead to significant levels of under and self insurance mcaneney et al 2016 the results of this research tend to highlight how some ecological components can mitigate the possible risks of negative consequences of natural disasters in socio ecological systems in other words they can enhance system resilience which could represent the overall ecological insurance the presence of forests and terrestrial protected areas can contribute to keep low the risk of damages in the case of climatological and meteorological disasters and sustain the resilience with positive effects on local socio economic financial ecological preparedness to face natural disasters on the basis of these considerations a first empirical model has been proposed as follows f e p f i e i where fep represents the financial ecological preparedness index fi is the financial insurance given by the gross insurance premium and the gross claims payments which can be a surrogate of the financial economic preparedeness to natural disasters and ei is the ecological insurance given by the amount of forests and natural protected areas which can represent the ecological preparedness to natural disasters the results of the application of the present model to the oecd countries under study show that countries like usa japan germany united kingdom korea france and italy have a high fep index given their high ecological insurance in terms of ecological preparedness to natural disasters fig 8 therefore countries with the same investments in the financial insurance sector can be differentiated for their ecological potential to properly mitigate the risks associated to natural disasters 5 conclusions despite the growing evidence of the influence of land cover pattern on local regional and global climate in the last decade few insurance and environmental economic studies have investigated its role in providing ecosystem services which could represent an insurance against catastrophic meteorological events the traditional concept of risk mitigation in the field of financial insurance can be innovated by recognizing the role played by the ecological insurance that in the case of meteorological disasters can be mainly represented by the ecosystem services provided by forests and natural protected areas as highlighted by the results however the coarseness of the present approach taking into account only the amount of forested area the forest rents and the amount of terrestrial protected areas in each country should be implemented by adopting a landscape perspective with the spatial composition which kind of forests the configuration how they are spatially arranged and the state of health of the forests when analyzing the role of ecological insurance in mitigating the risk of meteorological disasters economic insurance is one tool among many in a portfolio of strategies to manage and reduce risks and uncertainties ecological insurance the assessment of economic and ecological vulnerability and or resilience and the adaptive management of socio ecological systems can represent key and interacting elements able to mitigate risk of damages due to meteorological disasters on the basis of these considerations a crucial attribute of resilience thinking is however the focus on the coupling of social and ecological systems as proposed in the empirical model therefore this paper proposes to rid the concept of insurance of its purely economic connotation integrating it with ecological insurance given by the flow of ecosystem services however this model did not consider in its current form the social insurance represented by the risk perception and supported by the so called risk sharing informal networks that can be seen as a form of social capital in this context the traditional economic insurance should base the payouts on a socio ecological index instead of measured losses trying to quantify the effects of both natural and social capitals on natural disaster risk mitigation the next steps of this research will be focused on a pilot study area where a landscape approach will be applied in terms of forest spatial composition and configuration in order to better define the landscape contribution to natural disaster risk mitigation the analysis of the role of social capital through a cross scales approach in terms of policies and management strategies and the investigation of innovative economic tools to take into account the payment for ecosystem services in the context of natural disasters aknowledgements we strongly thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful and targeted comments and for their precious contribution in improving the original version of the manuscript 
25144,it is known that financial insurance can address the economic impacts of a natural disaster but some ecological aspects can play a crucial role in mitigating the overall risks for socio ecological systems to better strengthen the study of these relations the aims of this paper are 1 to analyze the main research topics of the scientific literature on ecological and or financial economic insurance to face natural disasters through a co word network analysis 2 to analyze the temporal trends of the total gross insurance premium and meteorological and climatological extreme events in 29 oecd countries and 3 to carry out a principal component analysis pca of some selected variables in order to conceptualize a first empirical model combining financial economic and ecological insurance to face natural disasters the literature review has shown a predominance of topics related to financial insurance about 60 and the co word map of key words has highlighted a common space where economic and ecological insurances interact pca highlighted three major components explaining 90 6 of the overall variation and discriminating aspects more related to the financial insurance from those related to the ecological insurance more in detail pc1 which represents the financial insurance explains the 60 4 of variation pc2 and pc3 that represent surrogates of the ecological insurance explain respectively the 19 6 and the 10 6 of variation on the basis of the application of the proposed empirical model countries with high levels of financial and ecological preparedness have been identified the next steps of this research will be focused on a pilot study area where a quantitative assessment will be applied to better define the landscape contribution to natural disaster risk mitigation the analysis of the role of social capital through a cross scales approach in terms of policies and management strategies and the investigation of innovative economic tools to take into account specific payment for ecosystem services in the context of natural disasters keywords gross insurance premiums gross claims payments resilience ecosystem services forests terrestrial protected areas financial ecological preparedness 1 introduction the limits of predictability of complex adaptive living systems need to be recognized and a pragmatic modeling philosophy of science needs to be adopted allowing new adaptive approaches to deal with natural disasters costanza and jørgensen 2002 the devastating effects of natural disasters e g earthquakes cyclones floods and droughts in their sudden and shocking occurrence are source of concern and alarm world bank 2017 in general a disaster or catastrophe is a typical unexpected event that causes negative effects in many areas of daily life communication supply of electricity and water etc but above all significant losses of goods and people swiss reinsurance institute swiss re 2017 although it is certainly true that these phenomena are merely outward manifestations of an inherent dynamism of our planet and that mankind has always been exposed to their destructive action it is equally true that we have been witnessing an intensification of calamitous events in recent years dankers et al 2014 hall et al 2014 this trend is confirmed also by the analysis of climate data indicating a substantial increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events ipcc 2014 from this perspective some recent years like 2011 have faced so many natural disasters that they have been defined as annus horribilis for natural catastrophes by insurance leaders courbage and stahel 2012 despite their high and growing frequency and intensity the enormous costs and the numerous casualties these disastrous events are still generally perceived as exceptional natural events that interrupt normal anthropic development and require humanitarian actions to mitigate losses bureau for crisis prevention and recovery bcpr undp 2004 furthermore despite the scientific interest in natural hazards has seen an increase in research and publications the governmental world is too often dormant up until the disaster has occurred cutter et al 2007 in the frame of the definition of disaster seen above natural disasters are catastrophic events caused by nature or by the natural processes of the earth the severity of a disaster is measured in lost lives economic loss and population capacity to rebuild earthquakes windstorms floods and diseases are extreme sudden events that hit everywhere on earth often without notice hoeppe 2016 they can also be defined as stochastic events such as weather extremes fires or pest outbreaks that can often directly affect the state of the system such as eliminating parts of populations scheffer et al 2001 when natural disasters occur social and economic activities and the well being of people are likely to be affected adeagbo et al 2016 according to the centre for research on the epidemiology of disasters cred 2014 five categories of natural disaster can be identified covering 16 disaster types table 1 catastrophic events link environmental risks to financial economic and social risks where the former are often characterized by high levels of uncertainty with far reaching consequences given that some of them even occur in distant places and are therefore sustained by others thus the perception of environmental hazards which significantly influences the responses to any risk may result in a discount of such risks tobin and montz 1997 tobin et al 2005 whiteford and tobin 2004 that is those risks are taken less seriously than the risks with negative results that occur for sure now here and for us gattig and hendrickx 2007 1 1 financial economic insurance and natural disasters the insurance sector is highly exposed to natural disasters and climate change because of more frequent and severe extreme weather events causing more claims which can lead to insurance market failure dlugolecki 2009 johannsdottir et al 2014 although recently the forecasting of extreme events and systems of disaster preparedness and response have improved significantly the rising prosperity and the associated increased density of human settlements and economic activities have resulted in proportionally more people and more capital being placed at risk when disasters strike adam 2013 barthel and neumayer 2012 the losses due to extreme natural disasters can have significant economic consequences for individual property owners and businesses especially when these effects exceed their current financial capacity in this context insurance is an instrument to tackle the economic impacts of natural disasters representing the natural counterpart of ex post or reactive disaster recovery funding adam 2013 through a pro active approach based on the payment of a premium however although the market for insurance instruments against natural disasters has developed significantly it remains small relative to the potential demand for insurance borensztein et al 2017 insurance companies traditionally used to work making each individual or business pay a premium to protect themselves against an uncertain loss in this sense insurance managing risks promotes recovery from disasters because insurance reduces financial risks for households by spreading risks over many policyholders and helps economically people after a disaster occurs benali and feki 2017 however the insurance industry could play a significant role in different directions not only insurance policies cover claims of third parties who allege injury or property damage but insurance can also be seen as a part of a risk management system that should include the identification assessment and understanding of a risk in order to minimize the potential harm of natural disasters by implementing strategies and actions to control and reduce risks on an economic point of view insurance enhances social welfare while at the same time inducing their holders to take reasonable i e cost effective precautions by internalising the damage furthermore insurance encourages the risk averse insured party to make investments because the pricing of risks generates a clear economic benefit from precautionary spending porrini and schwarze 2014 generally the challenge of reducing in the future the consequences of natural disasters is framed in terms of the potential strategy of mitigation disaster risk mitigation is one of the most important priorities for insurance companies and indicates any action taken to permanently eliminate or reduce the long term risk and hazards of climate change to human life benali and feki 2017 studies on risk reduction of the impact of natural catastrophes have focused on pérez maqueo et al 2007 a the analyses of social processes and possible underlying causes of the disaster event alexander 2000 holzmann and jørgensen 2004 b the economics and strategies for financing post disaster infrastructures able to support their recovery berz 2004 gollier 2005 c the role of the government private sector and ngos for disaster preparedness and risk prevention benson et al 2001 daniels et al 2006 and d a modeling approach to analyze the interplay between investment in mitigation and risk sharing measures amendola et al 2000 in the last case the premiums provide a clear signal and encourage insurers to engage in mitigation measures to reduce vulnerabilities to disasters in addition premiums allow insurers to offer discounts to owners and businesses that invest in preventive measures benali and feki 2017 a risk reduction strategy should sustain the mitigation of the impacts of natural disasters with less risks for economic systems therefore the target could be to tackle the consequences of natural disasters by the promotion of ways to support an effective limitation of economic losses and the management of risks from extreme hazards if and how insurance plays a role in a country is influenced by local traditions cultural factors experience with disasters availability of data as well as the engagement of the public and private sectors porrini and schwarze 2014 in any case the time taken to recover from the impact of disasters natural or man made is a function of preparedness in fact individuals and households with some form of contingency plan in place are likely to recover more quickly than those without any such plans in this perspective insurance policies and or other savings schemes formal or informal will prove to be useful for quick recovery and reconstruction adeagbo et al 2016 finally it is crucial to consider how resilient robust are the insurance arrangements otherwise insurance companies will fail if there are multiple claims as in the case of the united states of america in the 1920s when youthful companies have incurred substantial losses in paying out large claims before they had built up reserves gonzález dávila et al 2014 however if individuals are risk averse and insurance against a risk is offered at an actuarially fair price expected utility

maintaining its stability domain without flipping into a different one is called resilience holling 1973 1996 resilience is the ability of a system whether it is an individual a forest a city or an economy to face changes and disturbances and continue to develop in addition resilience may also concern the degree to which the system is capable of self organization and its capacity to learn and adapt gunderson and holling 2002 since different stability domains exist in nature any system can experience the so called thresholds dasgupta and mäler 2003 holling 1973 mäler 2008 which the system does not usually cross thanks to its buffering capacity mäler 2008 the buffer concept is explained in relation to the fact that a slightly disturbed system is characterized by a high resilience avoiding the thresholds when disturbance continues to increase the resilience decreases and the threshold limit approaches a point where it is overcome mäler 2008 therefore resilience can be considered as a capital stock or rather a kind of insurance against reaching an undesirable state mäler and li 2010 perrings 1995 by keeping an ecosystem in a desirable domain baumgärtner and strunz 2014 trærup 2012 ensuring that the flow of ecosystem services is not reduced by unforeseen and catastrophic events resilience and adaptive capacity of a system are strongly interconnected so that the higher its ability to adapt the higher its resilience in addition to resilience adaptive capacity is related to a series of concepts such as adaptability coping ability management capacity stability robustness and flexibility adger and kelly 1999 brooks 2003 fraser et al 2003 füssel and klein 2006 jones 2001 smit et al 1999 smithers and smit 1997 tompkins and adger 2004 the key concept of adaptation today is of vital importance to address how the human population can face changes müller and li 2004 adaptive capacity should be conceptualized in terms of the capacity of the social actors in integrated systems to recover from disaster losses this state can be achieved through the adoption of alternative livelihood and construction strategies for the future despite the losses and the stress imposed by disastrous events choudhury and haque 2016 resilience and adaptive capacity are backed by biodiversity which is a form of natural insurance due to functional diversity because it is the basis that supports the supply of ecosystem services from natural and man managed systems such as biomass production pollination nitrogen fixation soil regeneration etc costanza et al 1997 daily 1997 millennium ecosystem assessment mea 2005 the biodiversity in essence constitutes a form of insurance as it ensures a functional complementarity in space and time loreau et al 2003 system protection from environmental risks is directly related to the most species in terms of functional redundancy that can be considered an effective defense against the unpredictability of dangerous events gonzalez et al 2009 loreau et al 2003 norberg et al 2001 yachi and loreau 1999 the presence of the best species performer in different environments promotes greater insurance because it stabilizes the ecosystem and maximizes productivity loreau et al 2003 yachi and loreau 1999 2 aims of the paper given the above mentioned considerations the aims of this paper are 1 to analyze the main research topics coming from the scientific literature focused on ecological and or financial economic insurance to face natural disasters through a co word network analysis 2 to analyze the temporal trends of the total gross insurance premium and meteorological and climatological extreme events in 29 oecd countries given data availability and that meteorological events flood droughts and wind storms typically represent the majority of reported disasters guha sapir et al 2011 rodriguez et al 2009 scheuren et al 2008 and 3 to carry out a principal component analysis pca of some selected variables in order to conceptualize a first empirical model combining financial economic and ecological insurance to implement the preparedness for facing natural disasters 3 materials and methods 3 1 systematic review the first step in this research was a literature survey conducted through academic library databases sciencedirect and google scholar the screening of all titles abstracts and keywords was done by searching and combining the terms ecological insurance economic insurance and natural disasters in this review only works published in english and in scientific journals have been included excluding gray literature such as reports books and lectures although this review did not include any single article focusing on how economic and environmental health insurance can address natural disasters it can represent a significant sample of the most relevant scientific literature on these topics some basic variables have been collected from each article table 2 to assure the scientific relevance of selected papers in analyzing the main findings on the relations between the different forms of ecological and financial insurance and natural disasters the established guidelines for systematic review pullin and stewart 2006 were applied then to better verify the accuracy and reliability of the screening process another reviewer analyzed the first filter of titles and abstracts on a random subsample of 10 of the references finally the level of agreement among the reviewers was measured through cohen s kappa analysis cohen 1960 given a kappa value of 0 803 p 0 001 according to landis and koch 1977 there is a substantial strength of agreement of the screening process among the reviewers in addition to the descriptive statistical analysis a co word analysis ding et al 2001 was carried out through r venables et al 2018 this technique is useful to explore the conceptual network and the development tendency in different fields and is based on the principle that when two or more keywords representing specific research topics appear in the same article it is assumed that they have a relationship the more the co occurrence between the two keywords the closer their relationship is yang et al 2012 given the literature collected the co word analysis is based on the following steps 1 the data extraction of the high frequency keywords 2 the data processing by building the high frequency keywords matrix 3 data analysis based on multivariate analysis methods to find the composition similarity and relationship among keywords and 4 the visualization of the results to determine the cut off point of high low frequency words the high low frequency words boundary fraction proposed by donohue 1973 was applied t 1 0 5 1 8 i where i is the total number of keywords t which is the lowest frequency among the high frequency keywords assumes the value of 37 according to the number of keywords resulting from the literature review however only two keywords overcome this frequency for this reason this study selected the keywords with frequency higher than or equal to 10 forming a similarity matrix 9 9 in particular the calculation method of similarity matrix is conducted through the ochiai coefficient formula o c h i a i c o e f f i c i e n t c a b a b where a and b are respectively the number of keywords a and keywords b and c a b is the number of keywords a and keywords b appearing together 3 2 data acquisition and multivariate analysis table 3 reports the list of acquired data for twenty nine oecd countries fig 1 for which the oecd insurance statistics provide reliable financial data together with information about the temporal range 1993 2015 and their sources these data have been used in the following trend and multivariate analyses therefore in each country the gross insurance premiums which represent the total insurance premiums and the gross claims payments which cover all gross payments made during each financial year have been acquired from oecd insurance statistics in particular data about the catastrophic events for the same time frame and countries of financial data have been acquired from em dat a database launched in 1988 by the centre for research on the epidemiology of disasters cred with the initial support of the world health organization who and the belgian government this database integrates several sources of data including un agencies ngos insurance companies research institutes and press agencies and it makes the data available online detailed data about climatological and meteorological disasters were acquired from this database table 3 data about gdp per capita extracted from world bank database refer to gross domestic product divided by midyear population gdp is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products it is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources data are in constant 2010 u s dollars table 3 average life expectancy data which is positively related to insurance premiums and claims payments johannesson and johansson 1997 represent the average number of years an individual in a country is expected to live the expected inflation rates in line with choate and archer 1975 are established by the inflation rate in previous years extracted from the world bank database for this reason in this study the average inflation rate over the previous eight years is used as a proxy for the expected rate of inflation in each country forested area forest rents and terrestrial protected areas are the last variables included in the analysis acquired from the world bank database the forested area represents the percentage of the area covered by forests in each of the 29 oecd countries in a given year the forest rents represents a percentage of gdp and terrestrial protected areas represent the percentage of the area covered by terrestrial protected areas in each of the 29 oecd countries in a given year at present economic insurance does not consider the role played by ecosystem services in risk mitigation of natural disasters effects which remains economically uninvestigated and unknown hook 2000 pérez maqueo et al 2007 however there are some studies on the role of natural ecosystems such as forests coastal mangroves coral reefs riparian habitats and protected areas in risk reduction programs bronstert 2003 danielsen et al 2005 deboudt 2010 hiraishi and harada 2003 hook 2000 kreimer and arnold 2000 mouillot et al 2008 as well as a more complex and integrated approach shown by pérez maqueo et al 2007 the extent of forests for instance could provide a more effective natural insurance against climatic variability particularly against extreme weather events providing an added value to the conventional more extensively studied economic one figueroa and pasten 2015 therefore a pca was performed on these variables to check any existing correlation among the economic variables typical of the traditional context of financial insurance and some available ecological variables that can represent a surrogate of some regulation service useful to face natural disasters like meteorological extreme events 4 results and discussion 4 1 results of the review the literature review was based on 174 scientific papers focused on financial ecological insurances and natural disasters covering a period from 1983 to january 2018 although there was only one paper published in 1983 followed by an absence of publications till 1993 1995 after a limited research interest from 1983 to 2006 it was possible to highlight a first peak of number of papers in 2007 then it was possible to notice an increasing trend until 2014 when the number of papers showed an outbreak exceeding 30 published articles fig 2 articles were classified on the basis of the types of insurance financial economic and or ecological they are focused on the results highlighted that only 18 of the papers dealt with the integration between financial economic and ecological insurances 62 was focused only on financial economic insurance given the economic origin of the concept and 20 was focused only on ecological insurance fig 3 however there was an increase in the percentage of papers based on an integrated approach between financial economic and ecological insurance from 2007 to 2016 the modeling approach was used in 72 of articles dealing with financial economic and or ecological insurances of which 69 used mathematical statistical models 22 conceptual models and only 9 used the two models in an integrated way fig 4 the temporal trend showed that the integration of models was rather recent as well as the integration between financial economic and ecological insurances figs 3 and 4 as a first indication papers dealing with only ecological insurance were usually based on conceptual models while the financial economic insurance seemed to be addressed through mathematical statistical models the results of co word similarity matrix based on ochiai coefficients and combined with keywords frequency higher than or equal to 10 are shown in fig 5 the size and color of dots reflect the number of papers associated with each keyword while the line width of the links is the density of linkages between two different keywords the wider the line the more significant the link between the keywords risk resulted the most frequent and predominant keyword reflecting the strength of its associations with the other keywords included in the co word analysis this frequency is justified by its use both in ecological and economic papers insurance resulted very strongly related to economic development and growth given the economic connotation of this topic in addition to a close connection with natural disasters which represents a new challenge for the insurance world low levels of association characterized the interplay between insurance and the typically ecological concepts such as resilience ecosystem services and climate change surprisingly there were no significant connections between insurance and vulnerability although vulnerability represents the risk susceptibility to natural disasters in general distinct domains of ecological and economic interest were identified as well as an overlap of keywords characterizing both topics given these common keywords it was possible to argue some links among the basic concepts of financial economic and ecological insurances mainly related to the risks of natural disasters and socio ecological management and vulnerability however aspects related to the resilience of socio ecological systems and the possible role of ecosystem services in facing the effects of climate change are topics still far away from the focus of current financial insurances 4 2 trends and multivariate analysis there was an increasing trend of the total gross insurance premium of the 29 oecd countries under study with its doubling from 2001 to 2015 fig 6 a at the same time there was an increasing trend of the total meteorological and climatological disasters from 1993 to 2015 in the 29 oecd countries fig 6b the pca extracted eight principal components pc with the first three components explaining 90 6 of the overall variation fig 7 in particular pc1 was mainly represented by indices typical of financial insurance like gross insurance premium and gross claims payments explaining the 60 4 of variation pc2 was represented by forested areas and forest rents both surrogates of the ecological insurance explaining 19 6 of variation pc3 was mainly represented by terrestrial protected areas explaining the 10 6 of the overall variation therefore on the basis of the results of the temporal trends where it is evident an increase both in the gross insurance premium and in the total meteorological and climatological disasters and the results of pca demonstrating how current financial economic insurances do not yet take into account the ecological components a new perspective for insurance predictive model is proposed disaster risk mitigation is one of the most important priorities for insurance companies but this task is not easy so that several large insurance companies do not invest in high risk or high exposure areas benali and feki 2017 or propose very high insurance premiums which could lead to significant levels of under and self insurance mcaneney et al 2016 the results of this research tend to highlight how some ecological components can mitigate the possible risks of negative consequences of natural disasters in socio ecological systems in other words they can enhance system resilience which could represent the overall ecological insurance the presence of forests and terrestrial protected areas can contribute to keep low the risk of damages in the case of climatological and meteorological disasters and sustain the resilience with positive effects on local socio economic financial ecological preparedness to face natural disasters on the basis of these considerations a first empirical model has been proposed as follows f e p f i e i where fep represents the financial ecological preparedness index fi is the financial insurance given by the gross insurance premium and the gross claims payments which can be a surrogate of the financial economic preparedeness to natural disasters and ei is the ecological insurance given by the amount of forests and natural protected areas which can represent the ecological preparedness to natural disasters the results of the application of the present model to the oecd countries under study show that countries like usa japan germany united kingdom korea france and italy have a high fep index given their high ecological insurance in terms of ecological preparedness to natural disasters fig 8 therefore countries with the same investments in the financial insurance sector can be differentiated for their ecological potential to properly mitigate the risks associated to natural disasters 5 conclusions despite the growing evidence of the influence of land cover pattern on local regional and global climate in the last decade few insurance and environmental economic studies have investigated its role in providing ecosystem services which could represent an insurance against catastrophic meteorological events the traditional concept of risk mitigation in the field of financial insurance can be innovated by recognizing the role played by the ecological insurance that in the case of meteorological disasters can be mainly represented by the ecosystem services provided by forests and natural protected areas as highlighted by the results however the coarseness of the present approach taking into account only the amount of forested area the forest rents and the amount of terrestrial protected areas in each country should be implemented by adopting a landscape perspective with the spatial composition which kind of forests the configuration how they are spatially arranged and the state of health of the forests when analyzing the role of ecological insurance in mitigating the risk of meteorological disasters economic insurance is one tool among many in a portfolio of strategies to manage and reduce risks and uncertainties ecological insurance the assessment of economic and ecological vulnerability and or resilience and the adaptive management of socio ecological systems can represent key and interacting elements able to mitigate risk of damages due to meteorological disasters on the basis of these considerations a crucial attribute of resilience thinking is however the focus on the coupling of social and ecological systems as proposed in the empirical model therefore this paper proposes to rid the concept of insurance of its purely economic connotation integrating it with ecological insurance given by the flow of ecosystem services however this model did not consider in its current form the social insurance represented by the risk perception and supported by the so called risk sharing informal networks that can be seen as a form of social capital in this context the traditional economic insurance should base the payouts on a socio ecological index instead of measured losses trying to quantify the effects of both natural and social capitals on natural disaster risk mitigation the next steps of this research will be focused on a pilot study area where a landscape approach will be applied in terms of forest spatial composition and configuration in order to better define the landscape contribution to natural disaster risk mitigation the analysis of the role of social capital through a cross scales approach in terms of policies and management strategies and the investigation of innovative economic tools to take into account the payment for ecosystem services in the context of natural disasters aknowledgements we strongly thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful and targeted comments and for their precious contribution in improving the original version of the manuscript
