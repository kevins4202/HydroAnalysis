cost of production are the main reasons for using tio2 in the photocatalytic reactions 14 16 tio2 usually utilize in suspension form for higher photocatalytic activity but the separation of tio2 in suspension form is challenging 1 17 20 hence the immobilization of tio2 is a suitable way for the conquest of this problem several methods such as physical vapor deposition pvd chemical vapor deposition cvd or magnetron sputtering have been implemented to immobilize tio2 on a suitable substrate but these methods due to complex system and high production costs are not ideal for large scale films 21 22 the sol gel is regarded for the production of tio2 films as a cost effective and involving simple process steps pure tio2 thin film does not exhibit suitable features due to low film durability so it may be necessary to improve its characteristics by the addition of some dopants such as sio2 sio2 would lead to enhancing the mechanical and thermal stability of the films by making the more stick tight film 23 in this paper an annular photoreactor manufactured with a multilayer dip coating of tio2 sio2 thin film on the inner wall of the reactor the prepared tubular photoreactor

parameters a single annular photoreactor was used to analysis of transport phenomenon over the photoreactor only half of the annular photoreactor has been used as the modeling domain due to symmetry 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the film fig 2 shows the xrd result of tio2 sio2 thin film coated on the inner wall of the shell of tubular photoreactor at 400 c in the range of 20 80 degrees xrd pattern revealed main peaks at about 26 37 48 54 56 and 63 degrees indicate that there is nanocrystalline of tio2 doped by amorphous sio2 according to xrd results and scherrer equation average grain size of tio2 crystalline is 38 nm and also the crystalline phase of tio2 is anatase eds result of tio2 sio2 thin film has shown in fig 3 accordingly there are ti si o elements in the film and also eds results indicate the presence of a small amount of na ca and mg that probably belong to diffuse of x ray over the film and detect such elements in the glass substrate 3 2 film surface morphology fig 4 shows fesem micrographs of tio2 sio2 thin film fesem image shows fractured morphology of thin film that was prepared with the dip coating method in fact because of thermal treatment during drying and calcination micro cracks form on the thin film while micro cracks may reduce durability but will result in better diffusion and may contribute to a higher surface area according to fesem images the crystalline size of tio2 doped by sio2 is 32 nm that is in good agreement with xrd results afm results shown in fig 5 afm image shows grown tio2 in contact with sio2 according to afm result average roughness of tio2 sio2 thin film is 16 nm that belongs to grown nanocrystalline of tio2 3 3 determination of photocatalytic of annular photoreactor 3 3 1 effect of initial concentration to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of annular coated by tio2 sio2 thin film various contact time and ph were selected and all experiments were carried out at a flow rate of 2 5 l min fig 6 a illustrates the effect of contact time on annular photoreactor performance at ph 5 and several starting normal paraffin concentrations 500 300 and 150 ppm accordingly the same manner has observed at all starting concentrations where pollutant concentration was decreased with longer contact time sharper pollutant decline was observed at higher starting concentrations furthermore the rate of photocatalytic reaction has illustrated in fig 6 b in which figures indicate a higher rate at the beginning of the reaction accordingly the rate of reaction started to decline by the time as a result of the degradation of normal paraffin and hence lower concentration also a higher rate of reaction was observed at a higher concentration of contamination while figures indicate the highest rate for 500 ppm starting concentration the photocatalytic mechanism can be proposed as follow 10 7 t i o 2 t i o 2 e h 8 o 2 a d s e o 2 a d s 9 h 2 o a d s h o h h according to the proposed mechanism the photocatalytic reaction is based on the presence of electron holes and the generation of oxidant group at constant uv irradiation the production of the oxidation agent will be unchanged in this situation the higher concentration would lead to higher decomposition rate of pollution due to more available chemical bonds as discussed above the increase in pollution concentration would lead to more adsorbed compounds on the photocatalyst surface which increases the reactive material required for the degradation process however the degradation rate of the photocatalyst may decrease in the case of the surface active sites occupied by high pollutant range 3 3 2 effect of ph the solution ph would affect the photocatalyst surface charge while during the photocatalytic oxidation strong electrostatic interaction is formed between the solvent molecule radicals and substrate furthermore the solution ph may affect the organic pollutant protonation and deprotonation as shown in the eq s 10 11 the surface ionization state of the photocatalyst would be protonated and deprotonated under acidic or basic conditions 10 p h p z c t i o h h t i o h 2 11 p h p z c t i o h o h t i o h 2 o ph 6 25 is widely reported as the zero point charge pzc of tio2 photocatalyst in which the positive charge of tio2 increased under acidic conditions the major oxidation step may happen at low ph generated by positive holes 25 26 effect of ph on the photocatalytic activity of annular photoreactor coated by tio2 sio2 thin film for degradation of oily contamination normal paraffin was investigated at ph 5 7 and 9 fig 7 a shows the degradation of normal paraffin started with 500 ppm concentration as a function of time at three different ph 5 7 and 9 results indicate that the best degradation of pollution was achieved at ph 5 where higher photocatalytic activity and higher degradation rate were observed with ease of electron hole generation at the acidic condition the same manner was observed based on fig 7 b for 150 and 300 ppm starting concentrations of the pollutant in which best results were achieved at acidic conditions with higher than 85 conversion on the other hand according to fig 7 b the lowest conversion is at basic conditions with about 70 degradation of normal paraffin among all of the initial concentrations the same results previously reported on photocatalysts such as tio2 or zno for degradation of organic pollutions at acidic conditions where a wide range of ph was investigated 27 30 parameter estimation of proposed simple kinetic carried out by using eq 3 and least square method estimated kinetic parameters are tabulated in table 2 according to the table 2 highest rate of reaction with kr 6 78 attributed to ph 5 and the lowest rate of degradation of contamination was observed at ph 9 with kr 2 54 r2 0 98 0 99 indicate good agreement of proposed kinetic model eq 3 with experimental data accordingly a higher oxidation rate at lower ph indicate best contamination degradation at acidic condition while with ph rise up the kinetic rate of reaction started to decrease on the other hand another factor that influences the photocatalytic activity of tubular photoreactor is the regeneration of photocatalyst at different ph where resulted in the rate of generation of radicals with regenerated surface area in an acidic condition in comparison to basic condition 3 4 photocatalytic process modeling mathematical modeling of annular photoreactor implemented using comsol software to investigate various parameters such as

discharge of the photoreactor at the same conditions experimental results indicate 86 conversion of normal paraffin shows a close agreement of the proposed model by experimental results a volume plot of concentration of normal paraffin contamination is shown in fig 8 b the convective flux and diffusive flux along the length of photoreactor have been shown in fig 9 the axial diffusive and convective fluxes are calulated using the following equations c o n v e c t i v e f l u x u z c p z d i f f u s i v e f l u x d a b 2 c p z 2 diffusive flux with an order of 10 6 fig 9 b from 100 to 180 min by 20 min interval indicating the smaller effects on the transport of contamination while convective flux fig 9 a reveals the higher impact on normal paraffin passing the photoreactor this can be interpreted that the inlet velocity of reactant gains a higher impact on the contact time meanwhile both diffusive and convective fluxes have been decreased due to higher conversion of normal paraffin downside the photoreactor 3 4 1 effect of inlet velocity the effect of feed inlect velocity on the photoreactor performance is shown in fig 10 accordingly the highest conversion of normal paraffin is seen at the lowest inlet velocity of 0 02 mm s while with increased inlet velocity the normal paraffin conversion has declined however conversion has increased at all of the inlet velocity along the photoreactor withthe highest conversion for 0 02 mm s feed inlet velocity for the practical application where it is desired to operate at the highest possible inlet velocity but this may result in lower conversion of contaminant one solution is to use more photoreactor systems in series arrangement indeed in order of almost full conversion of such normal paraffin contamination at a speed of 0 04 mm s two photoreactors in series mode are required as one photoreactor only gives 60 conversion table 3 shows some general information about the number of annular photoreactors according to injection velocity and conversion for instance about ten photoreactors with 10 conversion of normal paraffin at each system are required at the inlet velocity of 0 06 mm s howevere the selection of final photoreactor layout and the number of them depends on the various operation conditions and economics these results indicate a parallel scale up 4 conclusion tio2 sio2 thin film was coated on the inner wall of the shell of an annular photoreactor xrd result indicated that thin film only contains tio2 nanocrystalline doped by amorphous sio2 fesem images show that thin film has a micro fractured structure and according to afm results this film has about 16 nm roughness belong to grown tio2 on the glass substrate the annular photoreactor was used for degradation of oily contamination normal

process conditions and effect of transport phenomena on the photocatalytic process simulation results indicate the best performance is at lower inlet velocity of fluid 0 02 0 03 mm s while with higher inlet velocity more photoreactor with current geometry are required to full degradation of contamination from aqueous solution on the other hand mathematical modeling revealed convective flux dominant with an order of 10 5 compared to diffusive flux with an order of 10 6 declaration of competing interest none acknowledgment the authors would like to acknowledge assistance of central and analytical

13856,in this study a quaternary nitrogen grafted activated carbon snq was synthesized to remove perfluorooctanoate pfoa from a groundwater source batch isotherm tests and rapid small scale column tests rsscts were used to evaluated the performance of these variants in removing pfoa from groundwater when processing groundwater that had been spiked with 200 ng l pfoa the snq exhibited 201 000 bv to 60 breakthrough this was 1 6 times higher than for the pristine sac 128 000 bv the longer bed life was attributed to the tailored carbon s enhanced positively charged surface properties which were monitored for this snq adsorbent by means of x ray photoelectron spectrometer scanning electron microscopy and incremental surface charge titration analysis kinetics and isotherm tests show that the snq exhibited higher adsorption rate and adsorption capacity than the pristine subbituminous coal based activated carbon sac and this was attributed to snq s retained pore structure high quaternary nitrogen ratio 0 89 and positive charge 0 47 meq g moreover the positively charged quaternary nitrogen groups onto the snq strongly attracted pfoa and lead to higher effective diffusion rates 12 6 10 10 m2 s in order to test the nature of pfoa sorption the authors employed a dynamic regeneration protocol using ethanol as an organic solvent and this protocol restored 73 pfoa adsorption capacity of the snq in light of this tailored snq carbon s high pfoa adsorption capacity and regenerability we anticipated this quaternary nitrogen grafted activated carbon could serve as an excellent adsorbent for pfoa removal from groundwater keywords perfluorooctanoate quaternary nitrogen adsorption molecular diffusion 1 introduction the family of perfluorocarboxylic acid pfcas and perfluorosulfonic acids pfsas comprise a large group of chemicals that are both chemically and thermally stable and are widely used in the polymers industry recently these chemicals had been frequently detected worldwide in the aquatic environment where they could affect wildlife and human life perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa is one of the most studied pfca compounds and it has been proved to have multi organ toxicity and potential health risk to humans 1 3 there is growing concern regarding the toxicity of pfoa towards animals and humans and the us government is embarking on considerable research funding to discern its prevalence health concerns and removal protocols once in the human body pfoa can bind to aminated proteins but there is no evidence that it can be degraded by metabolism conjugation or defluorination pfoa has a relatively long half life in humans in the range of 2 13 years 4 it could bio accumulate become concentrated inside the body and bio magnify through the ecosystem 5 7 the usepa has found sufficient evidence of carcinogenic potential for pfoa in humans and has established a health advisory level at 70 ppt 8 therefore it is critical to find a reliable and effective method for removing pfoa from water solutions not only is pfoa a health concern itself it also represents a useful surrogate for many other similarly structured pfcas and pfsas each with their characteristic tail of an alkyl like carbon fluorine chain and their head of a carboxyl or sulfonate group that is electronegative numerous treatment protocols have been tested for removing pfoa from drinking water sources some research has shown that pfoa is resistant to advanced oxidation or electrochemical degradation 9 10 this is mainly because the pfoa molecule is very stable advanced oxidation and electrochemical techniques also posed economic and technical restrictions during full scale runs moreover even when intense oxidation was applied it merely partially oxidized the pfoa into byproducts that could in turn pose adverse health risk to humans and animals 11 membrane separation technically will retain pfoa with 90 efficiency since pfoa is a relatively high molecular weight compound however the membrane separation systems such as reverse osmosis may suffer from low permeability and severe flux decline 75 80 in the treatment process 12 in comparison to other methods adsorption techniques are considered as effective and economic method for removing pollutants from water several adsorbents such as activated carbon ion exchange media alumina kaolinite chars ash zeolite and ammoniated magnetic particle have been employed for pfoa removal 13 14 amongst all these adsorbents mentioned above activated carbon is often found to be the most commonly used and most cost effective for removing trace organic compounds from water several researchers have used simulated wastewater for pfoa adsorption experiments and obtained a range of adsorption capacities 15 16 in our previous work we have introduced positively charged nitrogen functionality into granular activated carbon which dramatically enhanced their anions perchlorate sulfate and nitrate adsorption capacity 17 18 similarly since pfoa has a negatively charged carboxyl group and the fluorine render pfoa electronegative we anticipated that such positively charged nitrogen functionality would also enhance pfoa adsorption we also anticipated that the pi bonds in the activated carbon s graphene planes could also offer favorable adsorption effects with the pfoa tail thus pfoa sorption could be achieved by both ion exchange mechanisms with its head plus physisorption mechanisms with its tail in this study a quaternary nitrogen grafted activated carbon was synthesized based on our previous work 19 the activated carbon that was tailored according to this protocol had proved more favorable than the pristine carbon for trifluoroacetate adsorption from a groundwater source the main objectives of this work have been to a evaluate whether grafting activated carbons with nitrogen functionality could better remove pfoa from groundwater b investigate the diffusion and adsorption mechanism for pfoa removal onto the grafted activated carbon c explore effective regeneration methods for grafted activated carbon that had been spent with adsorbed pfoa 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the carbon matrix used in this study was a commercial subbituminous coal based activated carbon aquacarb 1240aw sac which was supplied by evoqua water technology u s prior to the preparation process the carbon was ground and sieved to a us mesh size of 170 200 90 75 μm in order to be the appropriate size for constant diffusivity similitude in rapid small scale column tests rsscts after rinsing with deionized water ph 6 6 and drying the carbon samples were stored in a vacuum desiccator for future use the groundwater was sampled from a state college municipal well prior to chlorination this was employed as the test water for the batch adsorption tests and rsscts this water sample contained 25 0 mg l chloride 242 3 mg l hardness as caco3 12 3 mg l sulfate 10 5 mg l nitrate as no3 0 32 mg l toc and it had a ph of 7 1 a 14c isotope labeled perfluorooctanoate acid sodium salt pfoa na molecular weight of 436 05 99 purity was purchased from the american radiolabeled chemicals inc u s to prepare the pfoa contaminated water the liquid scintillation counting solution ecolume liquid scintillation cocktail was purchased from mp biomedicals u s the ammonia anhydrous 99 99 was ordered from the pennsylvania state local general stores the nitric acid 68 0 70 0 and methyl iodide 99 0 were purchased from alfa aesar fisher scientific us 2 2 quaternary nitrogen grafting the prepared pristine subbituminous activated carbon designated as sac was first oxidized using a hot hno3 treatment process for this 1 g sac was mixed with 10 ml of 2 mol l hno3 solution then incubated for 8 h at 80 while mixing prior experiments had shown that this hno3 dose and exposure time achieved favorable oxidation of the surface while minimizing collapse of the pore structure 19 after the oxidization the product was filled in a plastic column and rinsed with deionized water until the effluent ph reached 5 6 0 4 these oxidized carbons have been designated as so herein during this step a large amount of oxygen containing functional groups phenol hydroxyl group lactone group carboxyl group were introduced to the carbon surface as we show below next to achieve the nitrogen loading on the carbon surface the oxidized carbons were thermally treated in an ammonia gas environment initially 1 g oxidized carbon was added into a glass tube and thermally treated in a furnace ats applied test 3210 using a program as we previously developed 19 it was anticipated that this ammonia thermal treatment created pyridine nitrogen and possibly amine functionality on the carbon edge sites the ammonia treated carbon has been designated as sn after the ammonia treatment the menschutkin reaction was employed to complete the nitrogen quaternarization 20 in this reaction we anticipated that by adding an alkyl halide the pyridine functionality could be converted to quaternary ammonium functionality the latter are considerably more electrophilic than the former and thus more likely to sorb pfoa to this end rudine et al 21 had reacted pyridine functionality with alkyl halide at room temperature over a period of several days to give bis pyridinium methane salts for the work herein methyl iodide was selected as the electrophile because it is the simplest organic iodide and its methyl group hosts low steric hindrance which thus offers the highest reaction activity 22 during this step 1 g sn and 3 ml methyl iodide were mixed for 7 days at 5 in a glass vial then the product carbon was dried and filled in a column afterwards 2 mol l nacl solution was employed to rinse the carbon for 8 h so as to replace the iodide by chloride then the residual sodium salt on the carbon surface was removed by an overnight rinse with deionized water this quaternary nitrogen grafted carbon was designated as snq 2 3 adsorption tests and pfoa detection 2 3 1 isotherm and kinetic tests batch adsorption isotherm tests were conducted to evaluate pfoa uptake from groundwater that had been spiked with various high levels of pfoa while holding the carbon mass constant specifically 10 mg of activated carbon variant was added into 10 ml of groundwater that had been spiked with 0 2 0 8 1 25 12 5 25 0 50 0 87 5 or 100 mg l pfoa and mixed in polyethylene bottles the small mass of carbon was maintained so as to preserve the limited carbon sample source these high concentrations were selected for these isotherm tests so as to discern isotherm adsorption parameters then these mixtures were shaken in polyethylene bottles on a tumbler for 48 h at 25 2 0 so as to achieve adsorption pseudo equilibrium after 48 h the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm and the residual pfoa level in the supernatant was discerned by liquid scintillation for the sorption kinetics studies 100 mg l of pfoa was spiked into 10 ml groundwater and mixed with 10 mg of the activated carbon variants then the sample solutions were continuously mixed for 48 h on a shaker that operated at 150 rpm sample vials were withdrawn from the shaker at 60 min then every 3 h thereafter to investigate the sorption kinetics one sample vial per time the pfoa level was also monitored using the same protocol as described in the isotherm tests each isotherm or kinetic test was repeated three times and these triplicates for pfoa varied by less than 3 5 from one another 2 3 2 rapid small scale column tests and ethanol regeneration rapid small scale column tests rsscts were employed to evaluate the dynamic pfoa adsorptive performance of granular activated carbon a 40 l container was filled with the groundwater and spiked with 200 ppt pfoa this pfoa level was perceived to be slightly on the high side of pfoa polluted sites 23 the pfoa containing water was pumped with a flow rate of 5 99 ml min through a 0 36 ml plastic column that had been packed with 0 16 g activated carbon us mesh 170 200 using a waters 510 hplc pump this protocol simulated a full scale empty bed contact time ebct of 10 min when constant diffusivity model applies see table s1 24 it was found that the rssct breakthrough curve according to constant diffusivity model exhibited high similarity with that of the full scale fixed bed test additionally in order to discern the extent to which pfoa could be extracted from activated carbon with an organic solvent the authors employed ethanol regeneration in order to proceed with ethanol chemical regeneration the spent carbon was unloaded from the column and rescreened to its initial mesh us 170 200 this re screening procedure was included to avoid the effect of high carbon bed pressure on pfoa adsorption next the spent carbon from the above pfoa adsorption experiments were re packed in a column and rinsed using prepared ethanol solutions 10 100 ethanol and balance di water at 1 ml min flow rate for 8 h 1300 bv the pfoa levels from the effluent were also monitored so as to discern the pfoa s desorption behavior following this the solvent regeneration efficiency was evaluated by again employing the regenerated carbon in a yet a second round of an rssct experiment see fig s1 in which groundwater spiked with 200 ng l pfoa was again passed through the regenerated carbon 2 3 3 pfoa analysis pfoa analysis employed liquid scintillation 2 5 ml of water sample that contained 14c labelled pfoa was spiked with 18 ml of liquid scintillation counting solution and mixed into a glass vial then the radioactive levels of these samples were detected using a liquid scintillation analyzer models 4810tr perkinelmer u s the pfoa levels were finally computed based on the 14c isotope level using the following formula 25 1 c 1 55 r 25 1 3 7 1 0 10 1 60 m pfoa 1 2 5 where c ng l is the pfoa level of the sample the radioactive concentration of the purchased pfoa solution is 55 mci mol r disintegrations per minute is the tested radioactivity the background groundwater radioactivity is 25 disintegrations per minute 1 ci equals to 3 7 1010 disintegrations per second mpfoa 414 g mol is the molar mass of pfoa this method offered a detection limit of 0 2 ng l 2 4 characterization the pore structure parameters of the carbons were tested using an automated pore volume and specific surface area analyzer belsorp max microtracbel japan the microtopographies of the carbons were obtained by means of a scanning electron microscopy sem that was equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer quantatm 250 fei usa furthermore the surface elemental compositions of the carbon variants were monitored using an x ray photoelectron spectrometer escalab 250xi thermo fisher usa the point of zero charge phpzc was discerned by incremental titration according to a method reported by chen 26 also boehm titration tests were conducted to detect the surface oxygen groups content 27 for these characterizations each test was repeated two times and these duplicates varied by less than 3 from one another 3 results and discussion 3 1 pore volume distributions and surface areas the pore volume distributions fig s2 and surface areas for these four subbituminous variants are listed in table 1 as shown both the micropore diameter 20 å volume and surface area increased following both the hno3 oxidition step and the ammonia thermal treatment the micropores increased from 0 381 cm3 g for the as received sac to 0 413 cm3 g following ammonia sn moreover following the methyl iodide menschutkin reaction the micropore volume and surface area remained higher than the as received sac although the methyl loading diminished partial pore volume notably snq hosted 0 398 cm3 g micropores these results highlighted how well these tailoring steps preserved the pore space and indeed enhanced the pfoa adsorption capacity the micropores and surface areas are viewed as so important in sorbing a long skinny molecule like pfoa 3 2 surface chemical composition table 1 also summarized the physicochemical characteristics of the subbituminous carbon variants as discerned by several characterization techniques per boehm titrations the largest proportions of oxygen groups had formed on the so carbon as incurred via the oxidation effect of hot hno3 treatment indeed in each of the three categories carboxyl lactone phenolic the oxygen functionality had more than doubled total oxygen functionality increased from 0 61 mmol g for sac to 1 32 mmol g for so then during the following thermal ammonia treatment the oxygen element was replaced by nitrogen as shown by the significant decrease of total oxygen groups dropping from 1 32 mmol g for so to 0 65 mmol g for sn next during the quaternarization step there was no further significant change in the oxygen groups content the surface elemental composition was also monitored by xps and the n1s spectra were also analyzed by means of xps peak fitting analysis using casa xps software see fig s3 28 29 it is noted that for sn nitrogen had been considerably and successfully loaded on the carbon skeleton with elemental n increasing 0 78 at for sac to 3 02 at for sn the sn also hosted elevated quaternized nitrogen nr4 at 0 59 at compared to 0 25 at for sac then the quaternization step greatly enhanced this to 0 86 at for snq the point of zero charge also showed the same trend the snq hosted the highest phpzc of 9 61 this meant also that at ph 7 1 the snq was more positively charged than the other three carbon variants when processing the pfoa contaminated water that hosted a ph 7 1 fig s4 according to our previous research these surface properties have improved ion exchange capacity and enhanced the anion capture from aqueous solutions 19 3 3 scanning electron microscopy analysis scanning electron microscopy sem images in fig 1 a and b reveal the micromorphology of the as received sac and the quaternary nitrogen grafted carbon snq the sac particle shows a coarse surface property and some embedded pores fig 1a following the three step modification the quaternized snq exhibited a somewhat cellular like structure with 1 5 μm pock marks covering the surface such 1 5 μm pits pores could readily facilitate molecular diffusion into interior micropores 30 thus we anticipated that this structural feature was favorably conducive to pfoa diffusion during the adsorption process fig 1c and d show the nitrogen elemental mappings for these two adsorbents per energy dispersive spectrometer eds notably the quaternized snq exhibited about 4 times as many elemental n sites as did sac this indicated that considerably more nitrogen was embedded on the carbon matrix through the quaternization process the eds results also revealed that elemental nitrogen had become non uniformly distributed onto the snq 3 4 isotherm tests the adsorption equilibrium data show increased pfoa uptake with each additional modification step the isotherm results were fitted to both the langmuir and freundlich models and the freundlich model see fig s5 better characterized performance table 2 31 32 while 100 mg l pfoa was dosed the quaternized snq sorbed 45 3 mg g pfoa and this compared to merely 22 8 mg g for sac the 45 3 mg g is perceived as a relatively high sorption capacity and it indicates that this snq hosted useful physicalchemical characteristics for sorbing the fluorinated hydrocarbons this pfoa adsorption capacity was also considerably higher than several other reported granular activated carbon adsorbents 33 34 these results highlighted the importance of the quaternary nitrogen tailoring for adsorbing pfoa when fitted to the freundlich curve the r2 fitting of the sac so and sn variants was 0 98 and the r2 was 0 93 for snq these r2 values were all higher than for the langmuir curve fitting r2 values table 2 this greater freundlich curve fitting inferred that pfoa sorbed into the carbon variants via mechanisms that involve a range of sorption energies and propensities including both ion exchange and hydrophobic physisorption for pfoa adsorption the ion exchange mechanism onto quaternary ammonium resins and hydrophobic physisorption mechanism onto carbonaceous adsorbents were also reported by other researches 13 14 in contrast trifluoroacetate was shown to be loaded onto these quaternary nitrogen grafted carbons via ion exchange 19 these distinctions were mainly attributed to the length of hydrophobic tails in the molecular structure of trifluoroacetate versus perfluorooctanoate so for these pfcas adsorption it is inferred that the longer the tail the greater the hydrophobic contribution and the relatively lesser the ion exchange contribution 3 5 rapid small scale column tests rapid small scale column tests rsscts were employed to simulate fixed bed pfoa removal performance for the sac variants when treating the groundwater that had been spiked with 200 ng l pfoa the snq offered the longest bed life of 150 000 bed volumes bv to 70 ng l breakthrough which was 1 5 times longer than for the pristine sac 101 000 bv under the same conditions fig 2 we used 70 ng l for the performance basis since this is a recommended pfoa limit by usepa the pfoa loading to 60 breakthrough on the adsorbents were calculated by integrating the breakthrough curves table 3 for the snq a 61 3 μg g of sorption capacity was achieved when 60 breakthrough was reached after 201 000 bv this is about 1 5 times higher than for the pristine sac exhibited 40 4 μg g the 201 000 bv corresponded to 8 3 days rssct operation in the lab when operating full scale activated carbon beds in series each with a 10 min empty bed contact time 201000 bv would correspond to 3 8 years of bed life before change out of a bed we also note that in the rsscts so broke through considerably sooner than sac in contrast in the isotherm tests so exhibited higher adsorption capacity than sac this distinction pertains to the groundwater s ph that was experienced during the tests for the rsscts large volume of groundwater 30 70 l passed through a small 0 16 g bed of activated carbon and so the effluent groundwater ph remained virtually the same as the influent groundwater 7 1 at near neutral ph the so carbon was negatively charged which repelled the negatively charged pfoa however the isotherm tests employed only 10 ml groundwater with 0 01 g activated carbon the activated carbon significantly decreased the ph to 3 8 where the pfoa s carboxyl groups with pka of 2 8 were 9 10 protonated in which state they were not negatively charged fig s6 also this low ph for the isotherms rendered the so with less negative charge than it hosted for the rsscts and the lower ph was more conductive for sorbing pfoa 3 6 pfoa diffusion kinetics into fixed bed as indicated above the rssct test of snq operated for 8 3 days before 60 breakthrough and full scale packed beds could last 3 8 years before change out based on this similitude assumption these long bed lives invoke rapid molecular diffusion to the grain s exteriors and through mesopores and also surface diffusion into the micropores moreover as bed life proceeds pfoa that had reached an exterior region will continue migrating toward the carbon grains center while new pfoa can then diffuse in the exterior region where it takes the place of the prior pfoa molecule that has diffused toward the grains center we can better understand these variously rated diffusion mechanisms by conducting batch adsorption tests while monitoring pfoa that remains in solution as a function of time such tests were conducted for the four sub bituminous variants with results monitored at 60 2880 min as shown in fig s7 the kinetics data was fitted to the transport equation for diffusion into a spherical adsorbent grain which was shown as 35 2 δc δt d 1 r δ 2 c δ r 2 2 r δc δr where c mg l is the solute concentration in the fluid phase t s is the contact time de m2 s is the effective diffusivity of solute r is the equilibrium partition coefficient derived from kf and pore volume and r m is the radial distance from the center of an activated carbon the r is derived from pore volume and the freundlich kf while forcing 1 n to be 1 00 by the following computation 3 k f q e c e c n 4 r k f 1000 ρ g ε where ρg g cm3 is the apparent grain density in the rssct beds 0 444 g cm3 and ε is the internal void fraction of the grain herein ε is taken as the pore volume of micropores plus mesopores cm3 g multiplied by the ρg g cm3 apparent grain density in the rssct beds the values used in these computations have been presented in table s2 the differential eq 2 can be solved as follows 5 c 0 c f c 0 c f 1 α 1 γ 1 γ 1 γ 2 e erfc 3 γ 1 α τ 0 5 γ 1 γ 1 γ 2 e erfc 3 γ 2 α τ 0 5 6 τ d t 1 r a 2 in which f is the fractional approach to equilibrium dimensionless τ is the dimensionless time a m is the average characteristic radius taken herein as the grain radius of activated carbon and α is the factor of 1 f f in which f is the equilibrium fractional adsorption of solute dimensionless calculated by c0 c c0 cn where c0 ct and c mg l are the solute concentrations under the initial condition at time t and at equilibrium respectively the term cn mg l represented the un adsorbable solute in the solution and we noted that pfoa was entirely adsorbable in solutions so cn was discerned as 0 in this research an important assumption was implicated in eq 5 that the rate of adsorption is much faster than the rate of diffusion so that the local equilibrium between the fluid phase in the pores and the adsorbed phase exists at all locations within the grain to compare the model with the kinetics data fig s7 for the four carbon variants the effective diffusion coefficient de was computed by employing eq 2 for each data point for these kinetic experiments the median of the individual values of computed d was chosen as the best estimate of the effective diffusivity de from this median effective diffusivity de was computed as a function of τ a corresponding dimensionless time using eq 6 and this τ was used as the independent variable in the plot of observed values of logf versus logτ in fig 3 r2 0 98 for pfoa diffusion onto the sac grains the de value was 4 87 10 10 m2 s which is slightly lower than the molecular diffusion constant 5 29 10 10 m2 s as interpolated from perry et al 36 for a generic organic molecule with molecular weight of 413 this slight distinction was mainly due to the deviation of the pores from the ideal model of straight cylindrical tubes with no tortuosity and this deviation in effective diffusivity could be defined as 37 7 d e d mol χ where χ is the tortuosity factor dimensionless which accounts for irregularities in pore shape de m2 s is effective diffusivity for pore diffusion tortuosity values of 1 3 have been reported for activated carbons and 2 10 have been reported for other porous solids such as catalyst solids 38 the relative contributions of pore and surface diffusions can be further determined according to the formula proposed by neretnieks ivars 37 8 d e d mol ε χ d s r where ds m2 s is the surface diffusion coefficient for distinguishing between dmol and ds we assumed that for pfoa herein dmol 5 29 10 10 m2 s perry and chilton 1973 and χ 2 with this assumption the relative contributions were calculated as dmol χde pore diffusion and l dmol χde surface diffusion as computed in table 4 after the quaternization the de value soared to 12 6 10 10 m2 s for snq which was about 3 times higher than for sac the relative contribution of surface diffusion also soared to 0 78 for snq which was much higher than for sac 0 44 we perceived that the positively charged quaternary nitrogen group strongly attracted the pfoa molecules and thus greatly promoted the diffusion rate of pfoa along the surface of the grains and or from solution to snq grains the effective diffusivities of pfoa on these tailored sub bituminous variants have also been compared to the effective diffusivities of wastewater secondary effluent natural organic matter onto prune pit activated carbon 60 m and bituminous activated carbons in table 4 this latter appraisal used the same diffusion computations and similar parameter characterizations as used herein for wastewater nom effective diffusivities ranged from 1 3 to 2 9 10 10 m2 s which was only slightly lower than for the subbituminous variants diffusing pfoa herein perhaps a slightly higher diffusivity could be anticipated for a stream lined long and skinny molecule such as pfoa as compared to balled up natural organic molecules of various dimensions 3 7 ethanol regeneration in this study an organic solvent regeneration protocol was used so as to infer the extent that pfoa had been reversibly physisorbed onto the tailored activated carbon surfaces specifically an ethanol solution was utilized to desorb the loaded pfoa due to ethanol s excellent solvency of pfoa as fig s8a shows the extent of pfoa desorption increased with increasing ethanol concentration it is noted that as regeneration proceeded with time the pfoa level in the effluent first increased and then decreased moreover the loaded pfoa was still desorbing via this regenerant even after 8 h based on the variously rated diffusion mechanism for pfoa adsorption see section 3 6 we anticipated that the pfoa desorption in the ethanol solution was governed by two mechanisms first abundant pfoa desorbed from the entire external and macropore snq surfaces as manifest by molecular diffusion and this process exhibited the higher desorption rate with yet longer times residual pfoa that yet remained was also desorbed from the micropores as governed significantly by surface diffusion and this process exhibited the lower desorption rate these results indicate that pfoa in the μg g loading level on snq exhibited slower desorption rates than others have noted when using ethanol to desorb perfluorinated compounds from non tailored activated carbons hydrotalcite and porous silica following pfoa loading to the mg g level 39 40 in these latter cases molecular diffusion could be expected to predominate throughout the experiments this again highlights the importance of conducting rssct experiments so as to better represent full scale operations after ethanol extraction the regenerated snq was again employed for a second cycle of rssct which again processed groundwater that had been spiked with 200 ng l pfoa the rsscts breakthrough curves of the regenerated snqs had been shown in fig s8b when 100 ethanol was employed the regenerated snq exhibited 107 600 bv to 70 ng l breakthrough and this was about 71 7 of the bed life that the fresh snq carbon had achieved table 3 also the regenerated carbon had achieved 44 5 μg g pfoa loading when 60 breakthrough was reached and this corresponded to a 72 6 regeneration rate thus this ethanol regeneration restored most but not all of the initial cycle s pfoa sorption capacity furthermore it should be noted that the effluents could be separated by a fractionation process based on the boiling points difference of ethanol 78 water 100 and pfoa 190 the eluted pfoa will remain in the water solution and the extracted ethanol could be recycled 4 conclusions a quaternary nitrogen grafted carbon snq was synthesized and characterized and its performance in removing pfoa was investigated when operating rapid small scale column tests 60 breakthrough occurred at 201 000 bed volumes with groundwater that had been spiked with 200 ng l pfoa when considering constant diffusivity similitude this would correspond to a full scale bed with 10 min ebct lasting for 3 8 years before changeout compared with the pristine granular activated carbon sac snq hosted considerably more positive charge on the surface which was attributed to fewer oxygen functional groups and more quaternary nitrogen sites isotherm tests show that both of the counter ion attraction of quaternary nitrogen groups and reversible hydrophobic physisorption interaction contributed to the snq s outstanding pfoa removal performance kinetics studies showed that pfoa could diffuse to snq s interior surface at a rapid effective diffusion rate of 12 6 10 10 m2 s which was about 3 times faster than for the pristine sac 4 87 10 10 m2 s this was also reflected by the slow pfoa desorption behaviors during the ethanol regeneration process in all snq carbon could be a technically promising adsorbent for removing pfoa removal from groundwater declaration of

13856,in this study a quaternary nitrogen grafted activated carbon snq was synthesized to remove perfluorooctanoate pfoa from a groundwater source batch isotherm tests and rapid small scale column tests rsscts were used to evaluated the performance of these variants in removing pfoa from groundwater when processing groundwater that had been spiked with 200 ng l pfoa the snq exhibited 201 000 bv to 60 breakthrough this was 1 6 times higher than for the pristine sac 128 000 bv the longer bed life was attributed to the tailored carbon s enhanced positively charged surface properties which were monitored for this snq adsorbent by means of x ray photoelectron spectrometer scanning electron microscopy and incremental surface charge titration analysis kinetics and isotherm tests show that the snq exhibited higher adsorption rate and adsorption capacity than the pristine subbituminous coal based activated carbon sac and this was attributed to snq s retained pore structure high quaternary nitrogen ratio 0 89 and positive charge 0 47 meq g moreover the positively charged quaternary nitrogen groups onto the snq strongly attracted pfoa and lead to higher effective diffusion rates 12 6 10 10 m2 s in order to test the nature of pfoa sorption the authors employed a dynamic regeneration protocol using ethanol as an organic solvent and this protocol restored 73 pfoa adsorption capacity of the snq in light of this tailored snq carbon s high pfoa adsorption capacity and regenerability we anticipated this quaternary nitrogen grafted activated carbon could serve as an excellent adsorbent

its prevalence health concerns and removal protocols once in the human body pfoa can bind to aminated proteins but there is no evidence that it can be degraded by metabolism conjugation or defluorination pfoa has a relatively long half life in humans in the range of 2 13 years 4 it could bio accumulate become concentrated inside the body and bio magnify through the ecosystem 5 7 the usepa has found sufficient evidence of carcinogenic potential for pfoa in humans and has established a health advisory level at 70 ppt 8 therefore it is critical to find a reliable and effective method for removing pfoa from water solutions not only is pfoa a health concern itself it also represents a useful surrogate for many other similarly structured pfcas and pfsas each with their characteristic tail of an alkyl like carbon fluorine chain and their head of a carboxyl or sulfonate group that is electronegative numerous treatment protocols have been tested for removing pfoa from drinking water sources some research has shown that pfoa is resistant to advanced oxidation or electrochemical degradation 9 10 this is mainly because the pfoa molecule is very stable advanced oxidation and electrochemical techniques also posed economic and technical restrictions during full scale runs moreover even when intense oxidation was applied it merely partially oxidized the pfoa into byproducts that could in turn pose adverse health risk to humans and animals 11 membrane separation technically will retain pfoa with 90 efficiency since pfoa is a relatively high molecular weight compound however the membrane separation systems such as reverse osmosis may suffer from low permeability and severe flux decline 75 80 in the treatment process 12 in comparison to other methods adsorption techniques are considered as effective and economic method for removing pollutants from water several adsorbents such as activated carbon ion exchange media alumina kaolinite chars ash zeolite and ammoniated magnetic particle have been employed for pfoa removal 13 14 amongst all these adsorbents mentioned above activated carbon is often found to be the most commonly used and most cost effective for removing trace organic compounds from water several researchers have used simulated wastewater for pfoa adsorption experiments and obtained a range of adsorption capacities 15 16 in our previous work we have introduced positively charged nitrogen functionality into granular activated carbon which dramatically enhanced their anions perchlorate sulfate and nitrate adsorption capacity 17 18 similarly since pfoa has a negatively charged carboxyl group and the fluorine render pfoa electronegative we anticipated that such positively charged nitrogen functionality would also enhance pfoa adsorption we also anticipated that the pi bonds in the activated carbon s graphene planes could also offer favorable adsorption effects with the pfoa tail thus pfoa sorption could be achieved by both ion exchange mechanisms with its head plus physisorption mechanisms with its tail in this study a quaternary nitrogen grafted activated carbon was synthesized based on our previous work 19 the activated carbon that was tailored according to this protocol had proved more favorable than the pristine carbon for trifluoroacetate adsorption from a groundwater source the main objectives of this work have been to a evaluate whether grafting activated carbons with nitrogen functionality could better remove pfoa from groundwater b investigate the diffusion and adsorption mechanism for pfoa removal onto the grafted activated carbon c explore effective regeneration methods for grafted activated carbon that had been spent with adsorbed pfoa 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the carbon matrix used in this study was a commercial subbituminous coal based activated carbon aquacarb 1240aw sac which was supplied by evoqua water technology u s prior to the preparation process the carbon was ground and sieved to a us mesh size of 170 200 90 75 μm in order to be the appropriate size for constant diffusivity similitude in rapid small scale column tests rsscts after rinsing with deionized water ph 6 6 and drying the carbon samples were stored in a vacuum desiccator for future use the groundwater was sampled from a state college municipal well prior to chlorination this was employed as the test water for the batch adsorption tests and rsscts this water sample contained 25 0 mg l chloride 242 3 mg l hardness as caco3 12 3 mg l sulfate 10 5 mg l nitrate as no3 0 32 mg l toc and it had a ph of 7 1 a 14c isotope labeled perfluorooctanoate acid sodium salt pfoa na molecular weight of 436 05 99 purity was purchased from the american radiolabeled chemicals inc u s to prepare the pfoa contaminated water the liquid scintillation counting solution ecolume liquid scintillation cocktail was purchased from mp biomedicals u s the ammonia anhydrous 99 99 was ordered from the pennsylvania state local general stores the nitric acid 68 0 70 0 and methyl iodide 99 0 were purchased from alfa aesar fisher scientific us 2 2 quaternary nitrogen grafting the prepared pristine subbituminous activated carbon designated as sac was first oxidized using a hot hno3 treatment process for this 1 g sac was mixed with 10 ml of 2 mol l hno3 solution then incubated for 8 h at 80 while mixing prior experiments had shown that this hno3 dose and exposure time achieved favorable oxidation of the surface while minimizing collapse of the pore structure 19 after the oxidization the product was filled in a plastic column and rinsed with deionized water until the effluent ph reached 5 6 0 4 these oxidized carbons have been designated as so herein during this step a large amount of oxygen containing functional groups phenol hydroxyl group lactone group carboxyl group were introduced to the carbon surface as we show below next to achieve the nitrogen loading on the carbon surface the oxidized carbons were thermally treated in an ammonia gas environment initially 1 g oxidized carbon was added into a glass tube and thermally treated in a furnace ats applied test 3210 using a program as we previously developed 19 it was anticipated that this ammonia thermal treatment created pyridine nitrogen and possibly amine functionality on the carbon edge sites the ammonia treated carbon has been designated as sn after the ammonia treatment the menschutkin reaction was employed to complete the nitrogen quaternarization 20 in this reaction we anticipated that by adding an alkyl halide the pyridine functionality could be converted to quaternary ammonium functionality the latter are considerably more electrophilic than the former and thus more likely to sorb pfoa to this end rudine et al 21 had reacted pyridine functionality with alkyl halide at room temperature over a period of several days to give bis pyridinium methane salts for the work herein methyl iodide was selected as the electrophile because it is the simplest organic iodide and its methyl group hosts low steric hindrance which thus offers the highest reaction activity 22 during this step 1 g sn and 3 ml methyl iodide were mixed for 7 days at 5 in a glass vial then the product carbon was dried and filled in a column afterwards 2 mol l nacl solution was employed to rinse the carbon for 8 h so as to replace the iodide by chloride then the residual sodium salt on the carbon surface was removed by an overnight rinse with deionized water this quaternary nitrogen grafted carbon was designated as snq 2 3 adsorption tests and pfoa detection 2 3 1 isotherm and kinetic tests batch adsorption isotherm tests were conducted to evaluate pfoa uptake from groundwater that had been spiked with various high levels of pfoa while holding the carbon mass constant specifically 10 mg of activated carbon variant was added into 10 ml of groundwater that had been spiked with 0 2 0 8 1 25 12 5 25 0 50 0 87 5 or 100 mg l pfoa and mixed in polyethylene bottles the small mass of carbon was maintained so as to preserve the limited carbon sample source these high concentrations were selected for these isotherm tests so as to discern isotherm adsorption parameters then these mixtures were shaken in polyethylene bottles on a tumbler for 48 h at 25 2 0 so as to achieve adsorption pseudo equilibrium after 48 h the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm and the residual pfoa level in the supernatant was discerned by liquid scintillation for the sorption kinetics studies 100 mg l of pfoa was spiked into 10 ml groundwater and mixed with 10 mg of the activated carbon variants then the sample solutions were continuously mixed for 48 h on a shaker that operated at 150 rpm sample vials were withdrawn from the shaker at 60 min then every 3 h thereafter to investigate the sorption kinetics one sample vial per time the pfoa level was also monitored using the same protocol as described in the isotherm tests each isotherm or kinetic test was repeated three times and these triplicates for pfoa varied by less than 3 5 from one another 2 3 2 rapid small scale column tests and ethanol regeneration rapid small scale column tests rsscts were employed to evaluate the dynamic pfoa adsorptive performance of granular activated carbon a 40 l container was filled with the groundwater and spiked with 200 ppt pfoa this pfoa level was perceived to be slightly on the high side of pfoa polluted sites 23 the pfoa containing water was pumped with a flow rate of 5 99 ml min through a 0 36 ml plastic column that had been packed with 0 16 g activated carbon us mesh 170 200 using a waters 510 hplc pump this protocol simulated a full scale empty bed contact time ebct of 10 min when constant diffusivity model applies see table s1 24 it was found that the rssct breakthrough curve according to constant diffusivity model exhibited high similarity with that of the full scale fixed bed test additionally in order to discern the extent to which pfoa could be extracted from activated carbon with an organic solvent the authors employed ethanol regeneration in order to proceed with ethanol chemical regeneration the spent carbon was unloaded from the column and rescreened to its initial mesh us 170 200 this re screening procedure was included to avoid the effect of high carbon bed pressure on pfoa adsorption next the spent carbon from the above pfoa adsorption experiments were re packed in a column and rinsed using prepared ethanol solutions 10 100 ethanol and balance di water at 1 ml min flow rate for 8 h 1300 bv the pfoa levels from the effluent were also monitored so as to discern the pfoa s desorption behavior following this the solvent regeneration efficiency was evaluated by again employing the regenerated carbon in a yet a second round of an rssct experiment see fig s1 in which groundwater spiked with 200 ng l pfoa was again passed through the regenerated carbon 2 3 3 pfoa analysis pfoa analysis employed liquid scintillation 2 5 ml of water sample that contained 14c labelled pfoa was spiked with 18 ml of liquid scintillation counting solution and mixed into a glass vial then the radioactive levels of these samples were detected using a liquid scintillation analyzer models 4810tr perkinelmer u s the pfoa levels were finally computed based on the 14c isotope level using the following formula 25 1 c 1 55 r 25 1 3 7 1 0 10 1 60 m pfoa 1 2 5 where c ng l is the pfoa level of the sample the radioactive concentration of the purchased pfoa solution is 55 mci mol r disintegrations per minute is the tested radioactivity the background groundwater radioactivity is 25 disintegrations per minute 1 ci equals to 3 7 1010 disintegrations per second mpfoa 414 g mol is the molar mass of pfoa this method offered a detection limit of 0 2 ng l 2 4 characterization the pore structure parameters of the carbons were tested using an automated pore volume and specific surface area analyzer belsorp max microtracbel japan the microtopographies of the carbons were obtained by means of a scanning electron microscopy sem that was equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer quantatm 250 fei usa furthermore the surface elemental compositions of the carbon variants were monitored using an x ray photoelectron spectrometer escalab 250xi thermo fisher usa the point of zero charge phpzc was discerned by incremental titration according to a method reported by chen 26 also boehm titration tests were conducted to detect the surface oxygen groups content 27 for these characterizations each test was repeated two times and these duplicates varied by less than 3 from one another 3 results and discussion 3 1 pore volume distributions and surface areas the pore volume distributions fig s2 and surface areas for these four subbituminous variants are listed in table 1 as shown both the micropore diameter 20 å volume and surface area increased following both the hno3 oxidition step and the ammonia thermal treatment the micropores increased from 0 381 cm3 g for the as received sac to 0 413 cm3 g following ammonia sn moreover following the methyl iodide menschutkin reaction the micropore volume and surface area remained higher than the as received sac although the methyl loading diminished partial pore volume notably snq hosted 0 398 cm3 g micropores these results highlighted how well these tailoring steps preserved the pore space and indeed enhanced the pfoa adsorption capacity the micropores and surface areas are viewed as so important in sorbing a long skinny molecule like pfoa 3 2 surface chemical composition table 1 also summarized the physicochemical characteristics of the subbituminous carbon variants as discerned by several characterization techniques per boehm titrations the largest proportions of oxygen groups had formed on the so carbon as incurred via the oxidation effect of hot hno3 treatment indeed in each of the three categories carboxyl lactone phenolic the oxygen functionality had more than doubled total oxygen functionality increased from 0 61 mmol g for sac to 1 32 mmol g for so then during the following thermal ammonia treatment the oxygen element was replaced by nitrogen as shown by the significant decrease of total oxygen groups dropping from 1 32 mmol g for so to 0 65 mmol g for sn next during the quaternarization step there was no further significant change in the oxygen groups content the surface elemental composition was also monitored by xps and the n1s spectra were also analyzed by means of xps peak fitting analysis using casa xps software see fig s3 28 29 it is noted that for sn nitrogen had been considerably and successfully loaded on the carbon skeleton with elemental n increasing 0 78 at for sac to 3 02 at for sn the sn also hosted elevated quaternized nitrogen nr4 at 0 59 at compared to 0 25 at for sac then the quaternization step greatly enhanced this to 0 86 at for snq the point of zero charge also showed the same trend the snq hosted the highest phpzc of 9 61 this meant also that at ph 7 1 the snq was more positively charged than the other three carbon variants when processing the pfoa contaminated water that hosted a ph 7 1 fig s4 according to our previous research these surface properties have improved ion exchange capacity and enhanced the anion capture from aqueous solutions 19 3 3 scanning electron microscopy analysis scanning electron microscopy sem images in fig 1 a and b reveal the micromorphology of the as received sac and the quaternary nitrogen grafted carbon snq the sac particle shows a coarse surface property and some embedded pores fig 1a following the three step modification the quaternized snq exhibited a somewhat cellular like structure with 1 5 μm pock marks covering the surface such 1 5 μm pits pores could readily facilitate molecular diffusion into interior micropores 30 thus we anticipated that this structural feature was favorably conducive to pfoa diffusion during the adsorption process fig 1c and d show the nitrogen elemental mappings for these two adsorbents per energy dispersive spectrometer eds notably the quaternized snq exhibited about 4 times as many elemental n sites as did sac this indicated that considerably more nitrogen was embedded on the carbon matrix through the quaternization process the eds results also revealed that elemental nitrogen had become non uniformly distributed onto the snq 3 4 isotherm tests the adsorption equilibrium data show increased pfoa uptake with each additional modification step the isotherm results were fitted to both the langmuir and freundlich models and the freundlich model see fig s5 better characterized performance table 2 31 32 while 100 mg l pfoa was dosed the quaternized snq sorbed 45 3 mg g pfoa and this compared to merely 22 8 mg g for sac the 45 3 mg g is perceived as a relatively high sorption capacity and it indicates that this snq hosted useful physicalchemical characteristics for sorbing the fluorinated hydrocarbons this pfoa adsorption capacity was also considerably higher than several other reported granular activated carbon adsorbents 33 34 these results highlighted the importance of the quaternary nitrogen tailoring for adsorbing pfoa when fitted to the freundlich curve the r2 fitting of the sac so and sn variants was 0 98 and the r2 was 0 93 for snq these r2 values were all higher than for the langmuir curve fitting r2 values table 2 this greater freundlich curve fitting inferred that pfoa sorbed into the carbon variants via mechanisms that involve a range of sorption energies and propensities including both ion exchange and hydrophobic physisorption for pfoa adsorption the ion exchange mechanism onto quaternary ammonium resins and hydrophobic physisorption mechanism onto carbonaceous adsorbents were also reported by other researches 13 14 in contrast trifluoroacetate was shown to be loaded onto these quaternary nitrogen grafted carbons via ion exchange 19 these distinctions were mainly attributed to the length of hydrophobic tails in the molecular structure of trifluoroacetate versus perfluorooctanoate so for these pfcas adsorption it is inferred that the longer the tail the greater the hydrophobic contribution and the relatively lesser the ion exchange contribution 3 5 rapid small scale column tests rapid small scale column tests rsscts were employed to simulate fixed bed pfoa removal performance for the sac variants when treating the groundwater that had been spiked with 200 ng l pfoa the snq offered the longest bed life of 150 000 bed volumes bv to 70 ng l breakthrough which was 1 5 times longer than for the pristine sac 101 000 bv under the same conditions fig 2 we used 70 ng l for the performance basis since this is a recommended pfoa limit by usepa the pfoa loading to 60 breakthrough on the adsorbents were calculated by integrating the breakthrough curves table 3 for the snq a 61 3 μg g of sorption capacity was achieved when 60 breakthrough was reached after 201 000 bv this is about 1 5 times higher than for the pristine sac exhibited 40 4 μg g the 201 000 bv corresponded to 8 3 days rssct operation in the lab when operating full scale activated carbon beds in series each with a 10 min empty bed contact time 201000 bv would correspond to 3 8 years of bed life before change out of a bed we also note that in the rsscts so broke through considerably sooner than sac in contrast in the isotherm tests so exhibited higher adsorption capacity than sac this distinction pertains to the groundwater s ph that was experienced during the tests for the rsscts large volume of groundwater 30 70 l passed through a small 0 16 g bed of activated carbon and so the effluent groundwater ph remained virtually the same as the influent groundwater 7 1 at near neutral ph the so carbon was negatively charged which repelled the negatively charged pfoa however the isotherm tests employed only 10 ml groundwater with 0 01 g activated carbon the activated carbon significantly decreased the ph to 3 8 where the pfoa s carboxyl groups with pka of 2 8 were 9 10 protonated in which state they were not negatively charged fig s6 also this low ph for the isotherms rendered the so with less negative charge than it hosted for the rsscts and the lower ph was more conductive for sorbing pfoa 3 6 pfoa diffusion kinetics into fixed bed as indicated above the rssct test of snq operated for 8 3 days before 60 breakthrough and full scale packed beds could last 3 8 years before change out based on this similitude assumption these long bed lives invoke rapid molecular diffusion to the grain s exteriors and through mesopores and also surface diffusion into the micropores moreover as bed life proceeds pfoa that had reached an exterior region will continue migrating toward the carbon grains center while new pfoa can then diffuse in the exterior region where it takes the place of the prior pfoa molecule that has diffused toward the grains center we can better understand these variously rated diffusion mechanisms by conducting batch adsorption tests while monitoring pfoa that remains in solution as a function of time such tests were conducted for the four sub bituminous variants with results monitored at 60 2880 min as shown in fig s7 the kinetics data was fitted to the transport equation for diffusion into a spherical adsorbent grain which was shown as 35 2 δc δt d 1 r δ 2 c δ r 2 2 r δc δr where c mg l is the solute concentration in the fluid phase t s is the contact time de m2 s is the effective diffusivity of solute r is the equilibrium partition coefficient derived from kf and pore volume and r m is the radial distance from the center of an activated carbon the r is derived from pore volume and the freundlich kf while forcing 1 n to be 1 00 by the following computation 3 k f q e c e c n 4 r k f 1000 ρ g ε where ρg g cm3 is the apparent grain density in the rssct beds 0 444 g cm3 and ε is the internal void fraction of the grain herein ε is taken as the pore volume of micropores plus mesopores cm3 g multiplied by the ρg g cm3 apparent grain density in the rssct beds the values used in these computations have been presented in table s2 the differential eq 2 can be solved as follows 5 c 0 c f c 0 c f 1 α 1 γ 1 γ 1 γ 2 e erfc 3 γ 1 α τ 0 5 γ 1 γ 1 γ 2 e erfc 3 γ 2 α τ 0 5 6 τ d t 1 r a 2 in which f is the fractional approach to equilibrium dimensionless τ is the dimensionless time a m is the average characteristic radius taken herein as the grain radius of activated carbon and α is the factor of 1 f f in which f is the equilibrium fractional adsorption of solute dimensionless calculated by c0 c c0 cn where c0 ct and c mg l are the solute concentrations under the initial condition at time t and at equilibrium respectively the term cn mg l represented the un adsorbable solute in the solution and we noted that pfoa was entirely adsorbable in solutions so cn was discerned as 0 in this research an important assumption was implicated in eq 5 that the rate of adsorption is much faster than the rate of diffusion so that the local equilibrium between the fluid phase in the pores and the adsorbed phase exists at all locations within the grain to compare the model with the kinetics data fig s7 for the four carbon variants the effective diffusion coefficient de was computed by employing eq 2 for each data point for these kinetic experiments the median of the individual values of computed d was chosen as the best estimate of the effective diffusivity de from this median effective diffusivity de was computed as a function of τ a corresponding dimensionless time using eq 6 and this τ was used as the independent variable in the plot of observed values of logf versus logτ in fig 3 r2 0 98 for pfoa diffusion onto the sac grains the de value was 4 87 10 10 m2 s which is slightly lower than the molecular diffusion constant 5 29 10 10 m2 s as interpolated from perry et al 36 for a generic organic molecule with molecular weight of 413 this slight distinction was mainly due to the deviation of the pores from the ideal model of straight cylindrical tubes with no tortuosity and this deviation in effective diffusivity could be defined as 37 7 d e d mol χ where χ is the tortuosity factor dimensionless which accounts for irregularities in pore shape de m2 s is effective diffusivity for pore diffusion tortuosity values of 1 3 have been reported for activated carbons and 2 10 have been reported for other porous solids such as catalyst solids 38 the relative contributions of pore and surface diffusions can be further determined according to the formula proposed by neretnieks ivars 37 8 d e d mol ε χ d s r where ds m2 s is the surface diffusion coefficient for distinguishing between dmol and ds we assumed that for pfoa herein dmol 5 29 10 10 m2 s perry and chilton 1973 and χ 2 with this assumption the relative contributions were calculated as dmol χde pore diffusion and l dmol χde surface diffusion as computed in table 4 after the quaternization the de value soared to 12 6 10 10 m2 s for snq which was about 3 times higher than for sac the relative contribution of surface diffusion also soared to 0 78 for snq which was much higher than for sac 0 44 we perceived that the positively charged quaternary nitrogen group strongly attracted the pfoa molecules and thus greatly promoted the diffusion rate of pfoa along the surface of the grains and or from solution to snq grains the effective diffusivities of pfoa on these tailored sub bituminous variants have also been compared to the effective diffusivities of wastewater secondary effluent natural organic matter onto prune pit activated carbon 60 m and bituminous activated carbons in table 4 this latter appraisal used the same diffusion computations and similar parameter characterizations as used herein for wastewater nom effective diffusivities ranged from 1 3 to 2 9 10 10 m2 s which was only slightly lower than for the subbituminous variants diffusing pfoa herein perhaps a slightly higher diffusivity could be anticipated for a stream lined long and skinny molecule such as pfoa as compared to balled up natural organic molecules of various dimensions 3 7 ethanol regeneration in this study an organic solvent regeneration protocol was used so as to infer the extent that pfoa had been reversibly physisorbed onto the tailored activated carbon surfaces specifically an ethanol solution was utilized to desorb the loaded pfoa due to ethanol s excellent solvency of pfoa as fig s8a shows the extent of pfoa desorption increased with increasing ethanol concentration it is noted that as regeneration proceeded with time the pfoa level in the effluent first increased and then decreased moreover the loaded pfoa was still desorbing via this regenerant even after 8 h based on the variously rated diffusion mechanism for pfoa adsorption see section 3 6 we anticipated that the pfoa desorption in the ethanol solution was governed by two mechanisms first abundant pfoa desorbed from the entire external and macropore snq surfaces as manifest by molecular diffusion and this process exhibited the higher desorption rate with yet longer times residual pfoa that yet remained was also desorbed from the micropores as governed significantly by surface diffusion and this process exhibited the lower desorption rate these results indicate that pfoa in the μg g loading level on snq exhibited slower desorption rates than others have noted when using ethanol to desorb perfluorinated compounds from non tailored activated carbons hydrotalcite and porous silica following pfoa loading to the mg g level 39 40 in these latter cases molecular diffusion could be expected to predominate throughout the experiments this again highlights the importance of conducting rssct experiments so as to better represent full scale operations after ethanol extraction the regenerated snq was again employed for a second cycle of rssct which again processed groundwater that had been spiked with 200 ng l pfoa the rsscts breakthrough curves of the regenerated snqs had been shown in fig s8b when 100 ethanol was employed the regenerated snq exhibited 107 600 bv to 70 ng l breakthrough and this was about 71 7 of the bed life that the fresh snq carbon had achieved table 3 also the regenerated carbon had achieved 44 5 μg g pfoa loading when 60 breakthrough was reached and this corresponded to a 72 6 regeneration rate thus this ethanol regeneration restored most but not all of the initial cycle s pfoa sorption capacity furthermore it should be noted that the effluents could be separated by a fractionation process based on the boiling points difference of ethanol 78 water 100 and pfoa 190 the eluted pfoa will remain in the water solution and the extracted ethanol could be recycled 4 conclusions a quaternary nitrogen grafted carbon snq was synthesized and characterized and its performance in removing pfoa was investigated when operating rapid small scale column tests 60 breakthrough occurred at 201 000 bed volumes with groundwater that had been spiked with 200 ng l pfoa when considering constant diffusivity similitude this would correspond to a full scale bed with 10 min ebct lasting for 3 8 years before changeout compared with the pristine granular activated carbon sac snq hosted considerably more positive charge on the surface which was attributed to fewer oxygen functional groups and more quaternary nitrogen sites isotherm tests show that both of the counter ion attraction of quaternary nitrogen groups and reversible hydrophobic physisorption interaction contributed to the snq s outstanding pfoa removal performance kinetics studies showed that pfoa could diffuse to snq s interior surface at a rapid effective diffusion rate of 12 6 10 10 m2 s which was about 3 times faster than for the pristine sac 4 87 10 10 m2 s this was also reflected by the slow pfoa desorption behaviors during the ethanol regeneration process in all snq carbon could be a technically promising adsorbent for removing pfoa removal from groundwater declaration of

13857,tubular membranes with fly ash as the primary precursor have been fabricated via extrusion process which not only addresses the disposal issue of fly ash generated by thermal power plants but also aids in poultry slaughterhouse wastewater treatment the fabricated membranes were characterized and an optimum composition of 75 fly ash 20 quartz and 5 calcium carbonate membrane k3 was fixed for the membranes to be used for separation processes membrane with the optimized composition has a pore size of 0 133 μm and porosity of 40 17 and offers outstanding chemical and mechanical stability this membrane was further used for the treatment of poultry slaughterhouse wastewater which is known to have high chemical oxygen demand cod and total suspended solids tss content the membrane successfully separated the organic matters present in the wastewater and the permeate water collected from the process satisfied the necessary environment protection norms regarding discharge and reusability hence the inference can be drawn that the produced permeate water is completely reusable in poultry processing industries which will help in mitigating the water scarcity problem

put an end to the practices causing the degradation of water quality polluted water is not only harmful to human beings consuming it but is equally poisonous for the aquatic flora and fauna according to a report released by the world health organization who it has been found that 844 million people across the world are deprived of a basic drinking water service where 159 million of them are entirely dependent on surface water it has also been reported that the diseases caused by contaminated water are the prime reason for almost 502 000 deaths across the world every year it has been estimated that nearly half of the world s population will have to live in water stressed areas by 2025 1 looking at the urgent need for clean and safe drinking water and to meet the daily water requirements in water stressed situations through reuse of wastewater it has been decided to opt membrane filtration technology as a cost effective alternative for the treatment of wastewater being a clean and simple process membrane filtration is gaining enormous popularity nowadays moreover lower energy requirements and higher product recovery are the two other parameters that had contributed to the growing importance of membrane filtration 2 the extensive study of the prior art reveals that enough attention has already been paid on the polymeric membrane separation because of its lower operating cost as compared to ceramic membranes many research groups across the world are constantly trying to minimize the cost of ceramic membranes owing to the enormous benefits offered by the ceramic membranes to its users in terms of properties like chemical stability mechanical strength longer lifetime just to name a few 3 substantial search for low cost ceramic membrane precursors led the researchers to consider materials like fly ash kaolin moroccan clay etc as some of the preferable alternatives for membrane fabrication 4 8 membranes prepared using kaolin as the base material resulted in mean pore size of 1 3 μm with a porosity value of 30 the fabricated membrane showed quite satisfactory performance in the removal of bacteria as well as oil from their respective aqueous solutions 4 likewise another article reported the use of mixtures of moroccan red clay and natural phosphates for the fabrication of flat sheet membranes which were further applied in the treatment of tannery wastewater 5 similar works have been carried out for the preparation of disk filters to be employed in the wastewater treatment of the moroccan textile industry and the results indicated that the membranes could be used in the treatment of dye water as a pre clarification step 7 another low cost material lithium aluminosilicate was utilized by simonis et al 8 to prepare membranes for purification of water laden with microorganisms the membranes exhibited a very high porosity value of 64 and could successfully remove the e coli cells from its aqueous solution 8 despite the excellent service provided by the above mentioned low cost membranes the use of fly ash as a precursor for membrane fabrication is gaining acclamation among the researchers as use of fly ash not only provides a membrane with lower cost but also puts a step towards providing a solution for the fly ash disposal issue it is worth to mention that vast quantities of fly ash are being generated from the thermal power plants across the globe that are not being utilized or dumped correctly in india the coal used for generating power is of inferior quality with ash content of almost 30 45 fly ash having a very low market value finds its use only in some specific industries like the brick and cement industries hence the disposal of the enormous quantity of unutilized fly ash is becoming an issue for the companies in the year 2017 a study conducted on the fly ash generation and utilization of india by the ministry of power india revealed that india produces 180 mt of fly ash and almost 40 of this remains unused 9 improper dumping of fly ash is not only a potential source of water pollution but its subsequent inhalation can also be proved lethal to various organs such as heart lung brain and so on 10 with the two fold benefits of using fly ash as membrane precursor few literatures have reported the fabrication of fly ash based ceramic membranes flat ceramic membranes with a pore size range of 1 30 1 44 μm were fabricated for the treatment of oil and water emulsion the fabricated membranes well served its purpose by achieving rejection up to 97 6 a similar study carried out by another group of scientists reported the preparation of the disk type membrane using fly ash for oil water separation where a rejection of 99 2 was observed with a membrane pore diameter of 1 2 μm 11 a mixture of fly ash and kaolin was also used for the preparation of circular ceramic membranes the fabricated membranes were found very useful in separating humic acid from water with a rejection value of 98 46 12 another article reported the addition of dolomite to fly ash and kaolin mixture to prepare flat ceramic membranes for oily wastewater treatment the prepared membrane with a pore size of 0 62 μm had very less amount of fly ash with kaolin as a primary precursor 13 an effort was also made to fabricate a composite ceramic membrane where a solution of fly ash polyvinyl alcohol and water was slip casted on a fly ash support fabricated membrane with a mean pore size of 0 25 μm was able to achieve cod reduction of textile dye water up to 75 however most of the literature available on membrane fabricated using fly ash as raw material reported about circular shaped membranes the use of tubular membranes on the other hand can be beneficial in many ways the comparatively larger feed flow channel and capability of such membranes to withstand high cross flow velocity reduces the membrane fouling and makes them a potential applicant for purification of solutions laden with a large amount of suspended solids the surface area offered by such membranes is way higher than the circular ones which is one of the most crucial factors for obtaining high flux in membrane filtration based on the limited literature available regarding the fabrication of tubular membrane with fly ash as the base material this work focuses on the preparation of such membranes 14 15 as the issue of population explosion is covering up almost all the countries of the world the generation of wastewater and subsequent environmental degradation is also aggravating day by day starting from effluents from refineries to food processing industries a huge quantity of wastewater is being generated which is dumped in the areas near human habitats without following proper environmental norms one such industry that needs a massive quantity of water for its processing is the poultry slaughterhouse industry from slaughtering and scalding to the evisceration of the birds a huge amount of water is needed a survey conducted on the generation of wastewater by poultry industries reported that almost 26 5 l of water are required for processing one broiler thus one can have an idea about the amount of wastewater generated by those industries across the world the wastewater generated is highly rich in protein fat bod cod as well as total solids content the total solids content in such water ranges from 600 800 mg l at the same time bods and cods can be as high as 2000 and 9000 mg l respectively which makes them inappropriate for disposing directly to the environment 16 the conventional treatment methods found in literature used for treating poultry processing water are gradually diminishing with the upliftment of membrane filtration technology conventional processes such as dissolved air flotation activated sludge process electro coagulation nullify the chances of potential recovery of nutrient proteins that are available in such water as these processes turn all the valuable nutrients into sludge thus reducing their reusability moreover methods like electro coagulation flocculation may allow the residual iron or other toxic components to combine with precipitated protein thus decreasing their usability in biological applications 17 membrane filtration being a zero chemical technology helps to overcome these disadvantages keeping in mind the numerous advantages offered by membrane filtration various research groups have reported the use of this technology for the treatment of poultry slaughterhouse wastewater 18 21 the history of using membranes for treating poultry wastewater started back in the late 80 s when jason and co workers attempted to treat poultry processing wastewater with a purpose to recover nutritional by products commercial non cellulosic tubular membrane with mwco of 50 kda was used for this purpose and the membrane significantly reduced the total solids nitrogen protein as well as cod content of the feed water along with recovering 24 45 of fat and 30 35 of protein as the by product 18 commercial membranes made up of polyethersulfone and regenerated cellulose having molecular weights in the range of 10 300 kda were also used to purify bird washer and chiller water generated in the poultry industry those membranes were also capable of achieving bod and cod reductions above 90 along with complete removal of total suspended solids and fats oil and grease present in the feed water 17 to address the issue of membrane fouling by poultry slaughterhouse water a hybrid process consisting of electro coagulation followed by membrane separation was adopted the combined process effectively reduced almost 85 of total suspended solids and fats oil and grease from the raw water sample 19 an integrated process consisting of microfiltration ultrafiltration and vacuum distillation was also carried out to recover protein and water from the poultry processing wastewater 20 this process resulted in more than 99 reduction of cod and total suspended solids along with the recovery of 84 protein and 70 water microfiltration aided in removing suspensions from water while the ultrafiltration helped in separating the proteins from the raw water finally the use of vacuum distillation delivered highly purified water 20 basitere et al 21 made an effort to couple static granular bed reactor sgbr with a 40 nm pore sized ceramic α alumina membrane to separate the suspended solids fats oils etc present in poultry water though this hybrid technology offered very high removal efficiencies the system could not be operated for a very long duration as it can cause deposition of the suspended solids on the bed of the reactor thus hampering the distribution and flow of feed water within the reactor 21 the available literature on the application of membrane filtration in purifying poultry slaughterhouse wastewater reveals mainly the use of polymeric membranes in a few cases the membrane filtration is combined with processes like electro coagulation flocculation reverse osmosis etc in order to reduce fouling and obtain high quality permeate however the use of these hybrid processes cannot be the best alternative ever in operations like coagulation the residual mineral from coagulants if present in the filtrate can be proved detrimental to human health as mentioned earlier processes like vacuum distillation reverse osmosis though produce high quality permeate are highly expensive and cannot be affordable for all classes of people in the society article mentioning the use of ceramic membrane for the treatment of poultry slaughterhouse wastewater is mostly made up of α alumina which is way too costly 5 21 hence this research work focuses on finding a low cost alternative in terms of membrane filtration which will not only give highly pure water but also is affordable for all sections of the society the benefits obtained by fabrication of fly ash based tubular membranes can be considered two folded fabrication of membranes using waste fly ash will not only put its contribution towards wastewater treatment but will also help in addressing the pollution issue created by fly ash generated in thermal powerplants the average pore size of the fabricated membrane is 0 133 μm which is the least pore size obtained in case of membranes prepared using fly ash as the primary precursor as far as the authors are concerned this will ultimately enhance the utility value of the fabricated membranes by making them applicable in a great variety of wastewater treatment processes where the use of a smaller pore sized membrane is appreciated however it should be mentioned that everything comes at a cost the weight of ceramic membranes is higher as compared to the polymeric ones which may limit the use of fabricated membranes for industrial purposes 22 moreover the packing density of hollow fibre as well as capillary membranes is higher than the tubular membranes thus reducing the space and energy requirement of a process along with providing a compact structure 23 this in turn can decrease the economic viability of the tubular membranes prepared in this work however keeping in mind the significant advantages offered by the fabricated membranes in terms of process performance as well as environmental sustainability the use of these membranes should be highly encouraged and works on further modifications of the membranes need to be carried out to make them equally compatible with the above mentioned configurations 2 materials and methods fly ash the key precursor for membrane fabrication was collected from guwahati assam merck i ltd supplied other ingredients such as calcium carbonate caco3 sodium salt of carboxymethylcellulose na cmc hydrochloric acid hcl sodium hydroxide naoh quartz was collected from kanpur uttar pradesh poultry wastewater was supplied by a local vendor from ganeshguri assam 2 1 fabrication of tubular membrane the first part of this article discusses about optimizing the membrane composition to be used for poultry wastewater treatment the different raw material compositions mentioned in table 1 are mixed with two mass percent aqueous solution of sodium salt of carboxymethyl cellulose na cmc and kneaded to get a uniform paste the paste thus obtained was forced to pass through a horizontal extruder m s vb ceramic consultants chennai india having moulds of inner diameter 5 5 mm and outer diameter 11 5 mm to get the desired shape of the membranes fig 1 the green membranes thus obtained from the extruder are kept at room temperature for a day and then allowed to dry at 100 c for 24 h in a hot air oven this was followed by drying the membranes at 200 c for 24 h and finally sintering of the dried membranes was done in a box furnace m s vb ceramic consultants chennai india at 1100 c for a duration of 6 h drying at 200 c and further sintering of the membranes were done at a heating rate of 2 c min to avoid any bending or deformation in membrane structure both the ends of the sintered membranes were then smoothened by abrasive paper no c 220 to get membranes of 10 cm length finally the membranes were cleaned via ultra sonication to remove any loose particles attached to its surface the cleaned membranes were further dried at 110 c to get the membranes to be used for filtration experiments 2 2 characterization of raw materials and fabricated membranes 2 2 1 characterization of raw materials the raw materials used in the membrane fabrication process were characterized through various tests in order to validate their usefulness in the membrane manufacturing process the thermal stability of the raw materials was evaluated using a thermogravimetric analyzer make netzsch model sta449f3a00 up to 1100 c at a heating rate of 10 c min in argon ar environment x ray diffraction analysis of the raw materials mixtures before and after calcination was carried out using advanced x ray diffractometer model axs d8 advance manufacturer bruker germany at a scanning rate of 0 05 s within a 2θ range of 5 90 using cu kα radiation of wavelength 1 5406 å 2 2 2 characterization of fabricated membranes the fabricated membranes were analyzed through various experiments to test the authenticity of the membrane manufacturing process and the performance of the fabricated membranes archimedes principle is usually employed to evaluate the porosity of the membranes this method requires dipping the membrane for 48 h in millipore water the difference in weight of the membrane before and after dipping is the volume of water absorbed by the membranes which corresponds to the pore volume of the membrane and when it is divided by the total membrane volume porosity can be obtained by eq 1 1 porosity w w e t w d r y v ρ 100 where w w e t is the weight of the wet membrane and w d r y is the weight of the dry membrane v is the total volume of the membrane and ρ is the density of water 24 four membranes from two different batches two membranes from each batch were used to evaluate the average porosity of membranes of that particular composition the mechanical strength of the prepared membrane samples was evaluated using astm d695 standard in an electromechanical universal testing machine make zwick roell z005tn with a load cell of 5 kn and a crosshead speed of 2 mm min to evaluate the chemical stability the membranes after taking their dry weights were dipped into strong acid hydrochloric acid ph 1 and alkali sodium hydroxide ph 13 solutions separately after a week the membranes were taken out washed and ultra sonicated for 15 min to remove any precipitate deposited on their surfaces as a result of the chemical treatment this was followed by drying the samples at 100 c and measuring their weight again 6 25 the resultant weight loss is considered to be the consequence of the corrosion resistance test and is calculated using eq 2 2 weight loss w i n i t i a l w f i n a l w i n i t i a l 100 where winitial is the dry weight of the sample before chemical treatment and wfinal is the dry weight of the sample after chemical treatment four membranes from two different batches two membranes from each batch were tested for chemical stability and mechanical strength measurements and the average value is being reported the morphological analysis of the membranes was carried out using a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem make zeiss model gemini the membrane samples were coated with a layer of gold before analysis 2 2 3 water permeability and pore size evaluation the experimental setup shown in fig 2 was used to measure pure water permeability and treatment of poultry wastewater before evaluating the water permeability the membrane was compacted using millipore water millipore elix 3 instrument at a high pressure to remove any loose particles present in the membrane there are two valves in the whole setup one valve 3 known as the bypass valve is used to maintain the pressure at the inlet of the membrane module while the other valve 7 known as retentate valve controls the cross flow velocity the rotameter 8 fixed in the experimental setup is used to monitor the cross flow velocity the pressure gauge 4 was used to measure the pressure at the inlet of the membrane module the water from the feed tank 1 was pumped to the membrane module 5 and the resulting permeate was collected in the permeate tank 6 the retentate stream was sent back to the feed tank after compaction the pure water flux was measured at five applied pressures 69 138 207 276 and 345 kpa eq 3 is used to calculate the water flux for each pressure from the volume of water collected 15 3 j w v w a t where jw stands for water flux v w is the volume of water collected t is the time and a is the area of the membrane used for filtration from the water flux data obtained after running the experiments for all the five pressures the graph is plotted between pure water flux and applied pressure and the corresponding slope of the graph gives the water permeability value l h which is in accordance with the darcy s law of convection as depicted in eq 4 26 4 j w l h δ p the l h value obtained is further used to calculate the pore size of the membrane using hagen poiseuille equation equation 5 27 5 r 8 μ τ l l h ε 1 2 where r is the pore radius μ is the viscosity of pure water at 25 c l is the pore length assuming the pores are present throughout the membrane thickness l 0 003 m ε is membrane porosity l h is the pure water permeability and τ is the tortuosity of the membrane the tortuosity of the membranes can be evaluated using eq 6 28 6 τ 2 1 2 ln ε the average pore size of the membrane samples was also evaluated from fesem images using imagej software where a total number of hundred pores from three different images were considered for each membrane composition the equation used for evaluating the average pore size of the membranes is given below 7 29 7 d p i 1 n n i d i 2 i 1 n n i where dp is the average pore diameter n is the total number of pores considered and ni is the number of pores having diameter di 2 3 treatment of poultry slaughterhouse wastewater poultry slaughterhouse wastewater contains a higher level of impurities which leads to higher chemical oxygen demand cod turbidity as well as total suspended solids tss hence it is of utmost importance to evaluate the characteristics of feed water before sending it through the filtration apparatus the ph of the feed sample was evaluated using ph meter eutech instruments model ph 700 and the turbidity was evaluated using a turbidity meter hintron instruments model hi 142 cod and tss of feed and permeate samples were calculated using standard apha protocols 30 once the membrane composition is optimized based on the results obtained via characterization the performance of the optimized membrane in treating poultry wastewater was evaluated using the same experimental setup as shown in fig 2 with raw poultry wastewater the filtration tests were conducted at pressures 207 276 345 414 and 483 kpa with a constant cross flow rate of 40 lph for three hours the performance of the membrane was evaluated in terms of reduction in the concentration of chemical oxygen demand cod turbidity as well as total suspended solids tss in the permeate eq 8 is used for the calculation of the rejection performance of the membrane 27 8 rejection efficiency 1 c p c f 100 where cf and cp are the concentration of parameters under consideration in the feed and permeate respectively after performing the filtration experiment at a specific pressure the membrane was first cleaned with millipore water for 30 min followed by cleaning with a detergent solution 1 g l surf excel solution for the duration of 1 h it was well documented in the literature that the detergent treatment is one of the most effective methods to solubilize the components present in poultry processing wastewater as the majority of these components are fats oil and grease 31 after detergent cleaning the membrane was ultra sonicated for 15 min to remove any pore blocking material present in it the ultrasonic cleaning process uses the principle of cavitation to remove the contaminants present not only in the membrane surface but also in the pores of the membrane 32 the setup along with the membrane was once again cleaned by passing millipore water for 30 min to remove residual soap in it then the water permeability tests were conducted before running filtration experiments for next pressure to ensure whether the membrane regains its original water flux value it needs to mention that the regenerated membrane shows water permeability values within 5 of its initial value it clearly signifies that the membrane got cleaned all the above mentioned experiments were conducted at room temperature the various parameters maintained for the filtration experiment and subsequent cleaning are presented in table 2 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of raw materials in the tga results of the raw material mixture with na cmc fig 3 the first minimal weight loss is noticed around 110 130 c owing to the evaporation of physisorbed moisture present in the sample 15 the second peak in the dtg curve occurs at a temperature of 280 c which may be attributed to the thermal decomposition of sodium salt of carboxymethyl cellulose na cmc the binder used in the membrane fabrication process at this temperature the thermal oxidative degradation of na cmc causes different reactions to take place thus changing the composition of the sample during thermal degradation process the fragments obtained from na cmc molecular chain undergo rearrangement that leads to the formation of some polyunsaturated chain products these materials may get oxidized at a higher temperature leading to the creation of co2 and minor weight loss 33 in the tga inset and dtg graphs of the raw material mixture without additive the absence of second peak at around 280 c temperature also confirms that this particular peak corresponds to decomposition of na cmc the similarity of both the graphs except that particular peak reveals the decomposition of na cmc at that specific temperature the significant weight loss observed around 710 730 c is owing to the thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate caco3 yielding calcium oxide cao and carbon dioxide co2 as products according to the reaction mentioned in eq 9 9 c a c o 3 c a o c o 2 the carbon dioxide formed as a result of this process is considered responsible for the formation of pores in the membrane 14 it is also observed that weight loss after 1000 c is minimal moreover for fly ash based membranes the mechanical strength of the membrane increases with increasing sintering temperature reports have mentioned that only a 50 c increase in temperature leads to an enormous rise in the membrane strength 34 hence looking at the above two perspectives it can be concluded that fixing the sintering temperature of the membrane as 1100 c is quite justifiable fig 4 portrays the x ray diffraction analysis of raw material mixtures used for membrane k1 k4 fabrication before and after calcination process it has been observed that the raw material mixtures showed the presence of peaks at 2 θ angles of 20 85 26 7 29 35 50 2 60 and 68 4 the peak appearing at a 2 θ value of 29 35 corresponds to calcium carbonate while all other peaks present in the diffractogram correspond to quartz thus also confirming that quartz is the main constituent of fly ash in the case of sintered mixtures the appearance of new peaks at 2 θ values of 21 95 and 28 was observed owing to the phase change of quartz and decomposition of calcium carbonate at higher temperatures the peak at 2 θ value of 21 95 signifies the phase transformation of quartz to β crystoballite 35 it needs to mention that quartz is a quite stable compound hence only a smaller fraction of it gets transformed into β crystoballite at temperatures above 850 c leaving most of it as it is even after high temperature sintering conversely calcium carbonate in the raw material decomposes around 720 c evident in the results of tga and forms cao 14 the peak corresponding to cao is noticed at a 2 θ value of 28 36 since the membrane k4 is fabricated using quartz and fly ash only no peaks corresponding to calcium carbonate as well as calcium oxide are observed in the xrd profile of raw material mixture k4 and calcined sample k4 3 2 characterization of fabricated membranes experiments conducted to evaluate the porosity of the fabricated membranes reveal that with increasing concentration of calcium carbonate the porosity of the membrane increases table 3 an increase in the concentration of pore former caco3 leads to increased production of carbon dioxide owing to its thermal decomposition at a higher temperature resulting in enhancement of the porosity of the membranes 37 a similar kind of trend regarding the change in membrane porosity with changing concentrations of caco3 has also been reported by kaur et al 38 where membranes fabricated with kaolin as the main precursor showed increased porosity values at higher caco3 concentrations 38 as evident from table 3 one can see a sharp increase in the mechanical strength of the membranes with decreasing the quantity of calcium carbonate from 15 to 5 wt this is attributed to the decrease in porosity of the membranes as a consequence of decreasing caco3 concentration the obtained results are in good agreement with the results reported by liu 39 they also observed that increasing concentration of pore former polyvinyl butyral in the hydroxyapatite ceramics resulted in decreased compressive strength owing to the increased pore volume 39 the decrease in porosity values implies that voids in the membrane are less thus making the membrane more rigid however a reverse scenario is observed for the membrane having no caco3 where the compressive strength of the membrane drastically reduces to 8 75 mpa macroporous ceramic supports fabricated using mixtures of quartz and silica also displayed a similar trend where supports with zero pore former had the lowest strength 40 with increasing the concentration of pore former material mechanical strength starts increasing up to a certain extent after which it starts following a decreasing pattern this sharp decrease in compressive strength of the membrane is because of the absence of effective sintering aid i e caco3 which enhances membrane densification and its subsequent mechanical strength by bringing the clay particles together during the time of sintering 40 41 the results of corrosion resistance of the membranes table 3 elucidate that the weight loss of the membrane in the alkaline environment is very minimal 5 indicating the membranes can be applicable in harsh alkaline conditions however the weight loss in the acidic environment is somewhat higher and also increases with increasing concentration of caco3 the probable reason is that the precipitation reaction takes place between the hydrochloric acid hcl and calcium oxide cao present in the sample resulting in the formation of calcium chloride cacl2 as shown in eq 10 6 a precisely similar trend of chemical stability of the membrane in acid with changing the concentration of caco3 was observed in the research work carried out by vasanth et al 42 where the reduction in caco3 quantity in the raw material mixture from 25 to 15 resulted in a decrease in corrosion resistance value from 6 to 1 42 as membrane k4 is fabricated without using calcium carbonate the weight loss in hydrochloric acid is very less for that membrane hence it is advisable not to use the membranes in strong acidic environments 10 c a o h c l c a c l 2 h 2 o the structural uniformity of the fabricated membranes is confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscope fesem images of inner and outer surfaces of the membranes k1 k4 are portrayed in fig 5 and fig 6 the darker portion in the images represents pores present in the membrane while the lighter portion depicts clay all the images show homogeneity in the membrane surface with numerous pores in it one can clearly see from the images that the membranes are completely crack free the images of inner as well as the outer sections of the membranes are almost similar 3 3 water permeability and pore size evaluation the pure water flux experiments were conducted with four membrane compositions for the duration of 40 min at pressures 69 138 207 276 and 345 kpa fig 7 represents the pure water flux data collected for all four membranes at different pressures while fig 8 represents the graph for the evaluation of water permeability of all the membranes compaction at high pressure makes the membrane saturated by filling the pores with water hence after saturation the flux was constant during the whole experiment it is observed that pure water flux increases with an increase in the applied pressure owing to the increased driving force 43 the pure water permeability values obtained from fig 8 tortuosity values calculated using eq 6 and the corresponding pore size evaluated using eq 5 are listed in table 3 it needs to mention that the pore sizes of the membranes are also assessed from fesem images using imagej software it is found that the pore sizes determined using fesem images of the membranes follow a similar trend as that of the ones evaluated using pure water permeability however the average pore diameter calculated using fesem images is somewhat higher than the ones calculated using hydraulic flux for instance the mean pore size of k1 k2 k3 k4 membranes is 0 144 0 103 0 133 0 151 μm respectively when measured using the hydraulic flux values on the contrary the average pore diameter estimated from fesem images is found to be 0 915 0 714 0 818 and 0 983 μm respectively for k1 k2 k3 and k4 membranes the reason for the variation is that the fesem technique captures only the surface pores of the membrane which may become narrower throughout the membrane thickness moreover pores considered in fesem images may contain dead end pores and also the membrane tortuosity cannot be taken into consideration in this technique it is to be noted that the mean pore size determined using water permeation data takes into account the entire permeation pathway through which water molecule travels hence the pore sizes obtained through water permeability values are considered for further separation work as they seem to be more realistic this result is in agreement with the results obtained by sinha and purkait 44 and suresh and pugazhenthi 45 it is observed from table 3 that except membrane k1 the mean pore size of the membrane increases with decreasing content of caco3 this may be due to the weak binding between clay particles because of the availability of a lesser amount of sintering aid caco3 41 even though k1 membrane has a smaller pore size than the k4 membrane the exceptionally high water permeability is attributed to the very high porosity of k1 membrane almost 46 which ultimately surpassed the effect of sintering aid 3 4 optimization of membrane composition the results obtained from various characterizations are summarized in table 3 it is evident that the pore sizes of the membranes are almost in the similar range however in terms of mechanical strength membrane k3 performs the best and chemical stability of this membrane is also comparatively good over k1 and k2 though membrane k4 has the best chemical stability among all four membranes its mechanical strength is lowest of all the porosity of k1 and k2 is higher as compared to k3 however the lower mechanical strength of these membranes k1 and k2 puts restrictions on their use moreover a membrane porosity value within 30 40 is quite acceptable and k3 satisfies this criterion hence looking at all the above mentioned features membrane k3 is finalized to use in the treatment of poultry wastewater 3 5 treatment of poultry slaughterhouse wastewater poultry processing wastewater is highly laden with organic matters among the various contaminants present in poultry water almost 35 corresponds to the large floating debris resulting from the agglomeration of grease and fat while the major fraction around 55 corresponds to suspended solids containing lipids proteins pathogenic microbes etc these suspended solids are the prime reason for the formation of opaque haze in poultry wastewater the rest 5 10 of contaminants are contributed by particles sticking to the emulsified globules present in the wastewater 17 hence the characteristics of the poultry wastewater collected for testing the filtration performance of the membrane were also evaluated and the results are presented in table 4 it needs to mention that the bod5 value of the raw wastewater mentioned in table 4 was calculated using the ratio bod5 cod 0 6 this ratio has been extensively used in many research works related to poultry slaughterhouse wastewater to calculate the bod5 values from the experimentally obtained cod values 18 46 the poultry wastewater was passed through the membrane module at five different pressures keeping all the other parameters constant as mentioned in table 2 it is evident from fig 9 that the permeate flux increases with an increase in the applied pressure the pressure being the driving force in this membrane separation process its increasing value causes increased driving force thus leading to a higher flow of permeate 47 however the flux declines with time which may be due to the resistance offered by pore blocking and formation of the cake layer in the initial period of filtration a rapid decrease in the flux is noticed due to pore blocking of foulant particles however the fouling caused by the formation of cake layer on the membrane surface due to the deposition of foulants makes the decline of the permeate flux gradual the fouling occurred due to cake layer formation over the membrane surface is regarded as the reversible form of membrane fouling 48 it was reported in the literature that the proteins present in poultry wastewater do not possess a fixed conformation and hence they get destabilized on the application of high shear leading to membrane fouling and subsequent flux decline 49 as evidenced the flux decline is faster and more pronounced at higher pressures as a higher shear rate breaks down the organic matters and leads to enhanced pore blocking 27 at lower pressures insufficient shear rate makes the breaking of foulant particles quite difficult thus resisting pore blocking hence the decline in flux at 207 kpa is quite insignificant as compared to other pressures 50 it can be said that the fouling at higher pressures is attributed to the combined effect of cake formation as well as pore blocking while the impact of pore blocking gets diminished at lower pressures if the question comes for choosing an optimum pressure at which the system needs to be operated 414 kpa can be considered as it not only gives 100 rejection but also gives high flux with lesser flux decline pressure 483 kpa cannot be taken as the optimum operating pressure albeit providing a higher flux owing to its higher flux decline during the operation time the obtained permeate is clear in colour with zero turbidity value for all five pressures as depicted in fig 10 as evident from fig 11 complete removal of cod and tss is achieved through this membrane the larger size of the particulate matters present in the poultry slaughterhouse wastewater is the prime reason for achieving 100 reduction in cod tss and turbidity of the processed water the major contaminants of poultry slaughterhouse wastewater are the suspended solids having the size in the range of 20 50 μm as we mentioned earlier that the fats and globules present in the wastewater are in the form of large agglomerates and debris that float on the water surface and hence these can be easily removable the rest of the contaminants which are found to be bound with emulsified globules have sizes of around 5 mm 17 it is noteworthy to mention that the pore size of the membrane 0 133 μm is lower than the sizes of the above mentioned organic matters present in poultry wastewater which generally contribute to cod and tss content hence the membrane could achieve the complete removal of them via size exclusion principle it is worth mentioning that the permeate water collected through the process satisfies the cod and tss norms provided by central pollution control board india for its reuse as well as discharge into the environment it also justifies the regulation given by the world health organisation in terms of turbidity value that can even be accepted for drinking purposes 51 52 looking at the high quality of permeate produced it can be inferred that the water is safe to discharge into the environment and can also be reused in the poultry industry itself to tackle the stringent water demand 3 6 contrast over prior arts prior arts regarding the fabrication of fly ash based tubular membranes and treatments of poultry slaughterhouse wastewater are very limited few of the available literature on the manufacturing of fly ash based tubular membranes are portrayed in table 5 it is observed from table 5 that the membrane prepared in this work has the least pore size of all the mentioned literature in the work carried out by malik et al 13 the quantity of fly ash used for the membrane was very less only 17 5 wt which needs to be increased to address the fly ash disposal concern 13 few cases reported the use of higher sintering temperature such as 1380 c as well as wide varieties of raw materials which add to the fabrication cost of the membrane though the fabrication of flat membranes serves the purpose of small scale operations it cannot be considered a wise option to be used industrially because flat membranes are poor in handling feeds with higher solid content along with its disadvantage of having lower filtration area in certain cases the reported porosity such as 29 9 and mechanical strength 6 99 mpa values are also not very satisfactory thus restricting their use industrially works of rawat and bulasara 12 as well as dong et al 53 reported the use of a large variety of raw materials along with fly ash which will increase the cost of the fabrication process 12 53 hence it has been noticed that membranes prepared using fly ash as base material with a good combination of physical as well as mechanical properties available at an affordable cost are yet to be fabricated membranes prepared in this work along with addressing the issue of environmental sustainability possess very high mechanical strength and outstanding chemical stability being tubular in nature the surface area available for filtration will also be more in these membranes as compared to the flat ones another advantage of the prepared membranes is that the membranes are made using only those materials that are utmost essential for membranes integrity and performance thus limiting the use of a large number of different precursors moreover the capacity of tubular membranes to withstand higher cross flow velocity makes the fabricated membranes useful for processes where a large amount of suspended solids are there as contamination 54 hence it can be concluded that the prepared membranes meet all the necessary criteria to make them applicable in industrial processes and can be regarded as the best one available till date to the best of our knowledge literature available regarding the use of membrane filtration in the treatment of poultry processing wastewater mostly talks about commercial polymeric membranes table 6 which are not only expensive but are also very brittle in nature even though the flux obtained by using polymeric membranes is higher than that of the membrane used in this work the use of polymeric membranes cannot be considered as a potential solution for long term separation processes owing to their very poor chemical as well as mechanical strength 16 56 38 48 basitere et al 21 though reported the use of ceramic membranes the raw materials used in its fabrication make it very expensive certain cases also mentioned about the use of hybrid processes such as static granular bed reactor 21 which again makes the whole process a big budgeted one membrane k3 overcomes all the above mentioned disadvantages and offers complete rejection without even compromising with the permeate flux which contemplates its superiority over the other membranes used earlier for purification of poultry slaughterhouse wastewater 4 conclusions membranes with fly ash as the base material and minor quantities of quartz as well as calcium carbonate were fabricated and characterized emphasis was given on the utilization of the maximum amount of fly ash in the membrane fabrication process to address the growing concern over the improper disposal of fly ash by various power plants directly into the soil water environment and the hazardous consequences associated with it the fabricated membranes showed wide variation in their mechanical as well as physical properties the membranes had pore sizes in the range of 0 103 0 151 μm which can be considered as the least possible pore size obtained with fly ash based tubular membranes however among the various compositions membrane k3 with a composition of 75 fly ash 20 quartz and 5 calcium carbonate offered best of the properties thus making us convinced to optimize this composition for poultry wastewater purification the membrane was capable of achieving complete removal of cod tss and turbidity from the raw wastewater thereby providing a clue towards reducing the water consumption in poultry processing industries through efficient reuse of the treated water the treated water is even dischargeable to surface water without the risk of any danger associated with the lives of aquatic flora and fauna hence it can be concluded that the membranes with this composition can be incorporated industrially to treat the enormous amount of wastewater generated in the poultry industries situated

machine 
13857,tubular membranes with fly ash as the primary precursor have been fabricated via extrusion process which not only addresses the disposal issue of fly ash generated by thermal power plants but also aids in poultry slaughterhouse wastewater treatment the fabricated membranes were characterized and an optimum composition of 75 fly ash 20 quartz and 5 calcium carbonate membrane k3 was fixed for the membranes to be used for separation processes membrane with the optimized composition has a pore size of 0 133 μm and porosity of 40 17 and offers outstanding chemical and mechanical stability this membrane was further used for the treatment of poultry slaughterhouse wastewater which is known to have high chemical oxygen demand cod and total suspended solids tss content the membrane successfully separated the organic matters present in the wastewater and the permeate water collected from the process satisfied the necessary environment protection norms regarding discharge and reusability hence the inference can be drawn that the produced permeate water is completely reusable in poultry processing industries which will help in mitigating the water scarcity problem

put an end to the practices causing the degradation of water quality polluted water is not only harmful to human beings consuming it but is equally poisonous for the aquatic flora and fauna according to a report released by the world health organization who it has been found that 844 million people across the world are deprived of a basic drinking water service where 159 million of them are entirely dependent on surface water it has also been reported that the diseases caused by contaminated water are the prime reason for almost 502 000 deaths across the world every year it has been estimated that nearly half of the world s population will have to live in water stressed areas by 2025 1 looking at the urgent need for clean and safe drinking water and to meet the daily water requirements in water stressed situations through reuse of wastewater it has been decided to opt membrane filtration technology as a cost effective alternative for the treatment of wastewater being a clean and simple process membrane filtration is gaining enormous popularity nowadays moreover lower energy requirements and higher product recovery are the two other parameters that had contributed to the growing importance of membrane filtration 2 the extensive study of the prior art reveals that enough attention has already been paid on the polymeric membrane separation because of its lower operating cost as compared to ceramic membranes many research groups across the world are constantly trying to minimize the cost of ceramic membranes owing to the enormous benefits offered by the ceramic membranes to its users in terms of properties like chemical stability mechanical strength longer lifetime just to name a few 3 substantial search for low cost ceramic membrane precursors led the researchers to consider materials like fly ash kaolin moroccan clay etc as some of the preferable alternatives for membrane fabrication 4 8 membranes prepared using kaolin as the base material resulted in mean pore size of 1 3 μm with a porosity value of 30 the fabricated membrane showed quite satisfactory performance in the removal of bacteria as well as oil from their respective aqueous solutions 4 likewise another article reported the use of mixtures of moroccan red clay and natural phosphates for the fabrication of flat sheet membranes which were further applied in the treatment of tannery wastewater 5 similar works have been carried out for the preparation of disk filters to be employed in the wastewater treatment of the moroccan textile industry and the results indicated that the membranes could be used in the treatment of dye water as a pre clarification step 7 another low cost material lithium aluminosilicate was utilized by simonis et al 8 to prepare membranes for purification of water laden with microorganisms the membranes exhibited a very high porosity value of 64 and could successfully remove the e coli cells from its aqueous solution 8 despite the excellent service provided by the above mentioned low cost membranes the use of fly ash as a precursor for membrane fabrication is gaining acclamation among the researchers as use of fly ash not only provides a membrane with lower cost but also puts a step towards providing a solution for the fly ash disposal issue it is worth to mention that vast quantities of fly ash are being generated from the thermal power plants across the globe that are not being utilized or dumped correctly in india the coal used for generating power is of inferior quality with ash content of almost 30 45 fly ash having a very low market value finds its use only in some specific industries like the brick and cement industries hence the disposal of the enormous quantity of unutilized fly ash is becoming an issue for the companies in the year 2017 a study conducted on the fly ash generation and utilization of india by the ministry of power india revealed that india produces 180 mt of fly ash and almost 40 of this remains unused 9 improper dumping of fly ash is not only a potential source of water pollution but its subsequent inhalation can also be proved lethal to various organs such as heart lung brain and so on 10 with the two fold benefits of using fly ash as membrane precursor few literatures have reported the fabrication of fly ash based ceramic membranes flat ceramic membranes with a pore size range of 1 30 1 44 μm were fabricated for the treatment of oil and water emulsion the fabricated membranes well served its purpose by achieving rejection up to 97 6 a similar study carried out by another group of scientists reported the preparation of the disk type membrane using fly ash for oil water separation where a rejection of 99 2 was observed with a membrane pore diameter of 1 2 μm 11 a mixture of fly ash and kaolin was also used for the preparation of circular ceramic membranes the fabricated membranes were found very useful in separating humic acid from water with a rejection value of 98 46 12 another article reported the addition of dolomite to fly ash and kaolin mixture to prepare flat ceramic membranes for oily wastewater treatment the prepared membrane with a pore size of 0 62 μm had very less amount of fly ash with kaolin as a primary precursor 13 an effort was also made to fabricate a composite ceramic membrane where a solution of fly ash polyvinyl alcohol and water was slip casted on a fly ash support fabricated membrane with a mean pore size of 0 25 μm was able to achieve cod reduction of textile dye water up to 75 however most of the literature available on membrane fabricated using fly ash as raw material reported about circular shaped membranes the use of tubular membranes on the other hand can be beneficial in many ways the comparatively larger feed flow channel and capability of such membranes to withstand high cross flow velocity reduces the membrane fouling and makes them a potential applicant for purification of solutions laden with a large amount of suspended solids the surface area offered by such membranes is way higher than the circular ones which is one of the most crucial factors for obtaining high flux in membrane filtration based on the limited literature available regarding the fabrication of tubular membrane with fly ash as the base material this work focuses on the preparation of such membranes 14 15 as the issue of population explosion is covering up almost all the countries of the world the generation of wastewater and subsequent environmental degradation is also aggravating day by day starting from effluents from refineries to food processing industries a huge quantity of wastewater is being generated which is dumped in the areas near human habitats without following proper environmental norms one such industry that needs a massive quantity of water for its processing is the poultry slaughterhouse industry from slaughtering and scalding to the evisceration of the birds a huge amount of water is needed a survey conducted on the generation of wastewater by poultry industries reported that almost 26 5 l of water are required for processing one broiler thus one can have an idea about the amount of wastewater generated by those industries across the world the wastewater generated is highly rich in protein fat bod cod as well as total solids content the total solids content in such water ranges from 600 800 mg l at the same time bods and cods can be as high as 2000 and 9000 mg l respectively which makes them inappropriate for disposing directly to the environment 16 the conventional treatment methods found in literature used for treating poultry processing water are gradually diminishing with the upliftment of membrane filtration technology conventional processes such as dissolved air flotation activated sludge process electro coagulation nullify the chances of potential recovery of nutrient proteins that are available in such water as these processes turn all the valuable nutrients into sludge thus reducing their reusability moreover methods like electro coagulation flocculation may allow the residual iron or other toxic components to combine with precipitated protein thus decreasing their usability in biological applications 17 membrane filtration being a zero chemical technology helps to overcome these disadvantages keeping in mind the numerous advantages offered by membrane filtration various research groups have reported the use of this technology for the treatment of poultry slaughterhouse wastewater 18 21 the history of using membranes for treating poultry wastewater started back in the late 80 s when jason and co workers attempted to treat poultry processing wastewater with a purpose to recover nutritional by products commercial non cellulosic tubular membrane with mwco of 50 kda was used for this purpose and the membrane significantly reduced the total solids nitrogen protein as well as cod content of the feed water along with recovering 24 45 of fat and 30 35 of protein as the by product 18 commercial membranes made up of polyethersulfone and regenerated cellulose having molecular weights in the range of 10 300 kda were also used to purify bird washer and chiller water generated in the poultry industry those membranes were also capable of achieving bod and cod reductions above 90 along with complete removal of total suspended solids and fats oil and grease present in the feed water 17 to address the issue of membrane fouling by poultry slaughterhouse water a hybrid process consisting of electro coagulation followed by membrane separation was adopted the combined process effectively reduced almost 85 of total suspended solids and fats oil and grease from the raw water sample 19 an integrated process consisting of microfiltration ultrafiltration and vacuum distillation was also carried out to recover protein and water from the poultry processing wastewater 20 this process resulted in more than 99 reduction of cod and total suspended solids along with the recovery of 84 protein and 70 water microfiltration aided in removing suspensions from water while the ultrafiltration helped in separating the proteins from the raw water finally the use of vacuum distillation delivered highly purified water 20 basitere et al 21 made an effort to couple static granular bed reactor sgbr with a 40 nm pore sized ceramic α alumina membrane to separate the suspended solids fats oils etc present in poultry water though this hybrid technology offered very high removal efficiencies the system could not be operated for a very long duration as it can cause deposition of the suspended solids on the bed of the reactor thus hampering the distribution and flow of feed water within the reactor 21 the available literature on the application of membrane filtration in purifying poultry slaughterhouse wastewater reveals mainly the use of polymeric membranes in a few cases the membrane filtration is combined with processes like electro coagulation flocculation reverse osmosis etc in order to reduce fouling and obtain high quality permeate however the use of these hybrid processes cannot be the best alternative ever in operations like coagulation the residual mineral from coagulants if present in the filtrate can be proved detrimental to human health as mentioned earlier processes like vacuum distillation reverse osmosis though produce high quality permeate are highly expensive and cannot be affordable for all classes of people in the society article mentioning the use of ceramic membrane for the treatment of poultry slaughterhouse wastewater is mostly made up of α alumina which is way too costly 5 21 hence this research work focuses on finding a low cost alternative in terms of membrane filtration which will not only give highly pure water but also is affordable for all sections of the society the benefits obtained by fabrication of fly ash based tubular membranes can be considered two folded fabrication of membranes using waste fly ash will not only put its contribution towards wastewater treatment but will also help in addressing the pollution issue created by fly ash generated in thermal powerplants the average pore size of the fabricated membrane is 0 133 μm which is the least pore size obtained in case of membranes prepared using fly ash as the primary precursor as far as the authors are concerned this will ultimately enhance the utility value of the fabricated membranes by making them applicable in a great variety of wastewater treatment processes where the use of a smaller pore sized membrane is appreciated however it should be mentioned that everything comes at a cost the weight of ceramic membranes is higher as compared to the polymeric ones which may limit the use of fabricated membranes for industrial purposes 22 moreover the packing density of hollow fibre as well as capillary membranes is higher than the tubular membranes thus reducing the space and energy requirement of a process along with providing a compact structure 23 this in turn can decrease the economic viability of the tubular membranes prepared in this work however keeping in mind the significant advantages offered by the fabricated membranes in terms of process performance as well as environmental sustainability the use of these membranes should be highly encouraged and works on further modifications of the membranes need to be carried out to make them equally compatible with the above mentioned configurations 2 materials and methods fly ash the key precursor for membrane fabrication was collected from guwahati assam merck i ltd supplied other ingredients such as calcium carbonate caco3 sodium salt of carboxymethylcellulose na cmc hydrochloric acid hcl sodium hydroxide naoh quartz was collected from kanpur uttar pradesh poultry wastewater was supplied by a local vendor from ganeshguri assam 2 1 fabrication of tubular membrane the first part of this article discusses about optimizing the membrane composition to be used for poultry wastewater treatment the different raw material compositions mentioned in table 1 are mixed with two mass percent aqueous solution of sodium salt of carboxymethyl cellulose na cmc and kneaded to get a uniform paste the paste thus obtained was forced to pass through a horizontal extruder m s vb ceramic consultants chennai india having moulds of inner diameter 5 5 mm and outer diameter 11 5 mm to get the desired shape of the membranes fig 1 the green membranes thus obtained from the extruder are kept at room temperature for a day and then allowed to dry at 100 c for 24 h in a hot air oven this was followed by drying the membranes at 200 c for 24 h and finally sintering of the dried membranes was done in a box furnace m s vb ceramic consultants chennai india at 1100 c for a duration of 6 h drying at 200 c and further sintering of the membranes were done at a heating rate of 2 c min to avoid any bending or deformation in membrane structure both the ends of the sintered membranes were then smoothened by abrasive paper no c 220 to get membranes of 10 cm length finally the membranes were cleaned via ultra sonication to remove any loose particles attached to its surface the cleaned membranes were further dried at 110 c to get the membranes to be used for filtration experiments 2 2 characterization of raw materials and fabricated membranes 2 2 1 characterization of raw materials the raw materials used in the membrane fabrication process were characterized through various tests in order to validate their usefulness in the membrane manufacturing process the thermal stability of the raw materials was evaluated using a thermogravimetric analyzer make netzsch model sta449f3a00 up to 1100 c at a heating rate of 10 c min in argon ar environment x ray diffraction analysis of the raw materials mixtures before and after calcination was carried out using advanced x ray diffractometer model axs d8 advance manufacturer bruker germany at a scanning rate of 0 05 s within a 2θ range of 5 90 using cu kα radiation of wavelength 1 5406 å 2 2 2 characterization of fabricated membranes the fabricated membranes were analyzed through various experiments to test the authenticity of the membrane manufacturing process and the performance of the fabricated membranes archimedes principle is usually employed to evaluate the porosity of the membranes this method requires dipping the membrane for 48 h in millipore water the difference in weight of the membrane before and after dipping is the volume of water absorbed by the membranes which corresponds to the pore volume of the membrane and when it is divided by the total membrane volume porosity can be obtained by eq 1 1 porosity w w e t w d r y v ρ 100 where w w e t is the weight of the wet membrane and w d r y is the weight of the dry membrane v is the total volume of the membrane and ρ is the density of water 24 four membranes from two different batches two membranes from each batch were used to evaluate the average porosity of membranes of that particular composition the mechanical strength of the prepared membrane samples was evaluated using astm d695 standard in an electromechanical universal testing machine make zwick roell z005tn with a load cell of 5 kn and a crosshead speed of 2 mm min to evaluate the chemical stability the membranes after taking their dry weights were dipped into strong acid hydrochloric acid ph 1 and alkali sodium hydroxide ph 13 solutions separately after a week the membranes were taken out washed and ultra sonicated for 15 min to remove any precipitate deposited on their surfaces as a result of the chemical treatment this was followed by drying the samples at 100 c and measuring their weight again 6 25 the resultant weight loss is considered to be the consequence of the corrosion resistance test and is calculated using eq 2 2 weight loss w i n i t i a l w f i n a l w i n i t i a l 100 where winitial is the dry weight of the sample before chemical treatment and wfinal is the dry weight of the sample after chemical treatment four membranes from two different batches two membranes from each batch were tested for chemical stability and mechanical strength measurements and the average value is being reported the morphological analysis of the membranes was carried out using a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem make zeiss model gemini the membrane samples were coated with a layer of gold before analysis 2 2 3 water permeability and pore size evaluation the experimental setup shown in fig 2 was used to measure pure water permeability and treatment of poultry wastewater before evaluating the water permeability the membrane was compacted using millipore water millipore elix 3 instrument at a high pressure to remove any loose particles present in the membrane there are two valves in the whole setup one valve 3 known as the bypass valve is used to maintain the pressure at the inlet of the membrane module while the other valve 7 known as retentate valve controls the cross flow velocity the rotameter 8 fixed in the experimental setup is used to monitor the cross flow velocity the pressure gauge 4 was used to measure the pressure at the inlet of the membrane module the water from the feed tank 1 was pumped to the membrane module 5 and the resulting permeate was collected in the permeate tank 6 the retentate stream was sent back to the feed tank after compaction the pure water flux was measured at five applied pressures 69 138 207 276 and 345 kpa eq 3 is used to calculate the water flux for each pressure from the volume of water collected 15 3 j w v w a t where jw stands for water flux v w is the volume of water collected t is the time and a is the area of the membrane used for filtration from the water flux data obtained after running the experiments for all the five pressures the graph is plotted between pure water flux and applied pressure and the corresponding slope of the graph gives the water permeability value l h which is in accordance with the darcy s law of convection as depicted in eq 4 26 4 j w l h δ p the l h value obtained is further used to calculate the pore size of the membrane using hagen poiseuille equation equation 5 27 5 r 8 μ τ l l h ε 1 2 where r is the pore radius μ is the viscosity of pure water at 25 c l is the pore length assuming the pores are present throughout the membrane thickness l 0 003 m ε is membrane porosity l h is the pure water permeability and τ is the tortuosity of the membrane the tortuosity of the membranes can be evaluated using eq 6 28 6 τ 2 1 2 ln ε the average pore size of the membrane samples was also evaluated from fesem images using imagej software where a total number of hundred pores from three different images were considered for each membrane composition the equation used for evaluating the average pore size of the membranes is given below 7 29 7 d p i 1 n n i d i 2 i 1 n n i where dp is the average pore diameter n is the total number of pores considered and ni is the number of pores having diameter di 2 3 treatment of poultry slaughterhouse wastewater poultry slaughterhouse wastewater contains a higher level of impurities which leads to higher chemical oxygen demand cod turbidity as well as total suspended solids tss hence it is of utmost importance to evaluate the characteristics of feed water before sending it through the filtration apparatus the ph of the feed sample was evaluated using ph meter eutech instruments model ph 700 and the turbidity was evaluated using a turbidity meter hintron instruments model hi 142 cod and tss of feed and permeate samples were calculated using standard apha protocols 30 once the membrane composition is optimized based on the results obtained via characterization the performance of the optimized membrane in treating poultry wastewater was evaluated using the same experimental setup as shown in fig 2 with raw poultry wastewater the filtration tests were conducted at pressures 207 276 345 414 and 483 kpa with a constant cross flow rate of 40 lph for three hours the performance of the membrane was evaluated in terms of reduction in the concentration of chemical oxygen demand cod turbidity as well as total suspended solids tss in the permeate eq 8 is used for the calculation of the rejection performance of the membrane 27 8 rejection efficiency 1 c p c f 100 where cf and cp are the concentration of parameters under consideration in the feed and permeate respectively after performing the filtration experiment at a specific pressure the membrane was first cleaned with millipore water for 30 min followed by cleaning with a detergent solution 1 g l surf excel solution for the duration of 1 h it was well documented in the literature that the detergent treatment is one of the most effective methods to solubilize the components present in poultry processing wastewater as the majority of these components are fats oil and grease 31 after detergent cleaning the membrane was ultra sonicated for 15 min to remove any pore blocking material present in it the ultrasonic cleaning process uses the principle of cavitation to remove the contaminants present not only in the membrane surface but also in the pores of the membrane 32 the setup along with the membrane was once again cleaned by passing millipore water for 30 min to remove residual soap in it then the water permeability tests were conducted before running filtration experiments for next pressure to ensure whether the membrane regains its original water flux value it needs to mention that the regenerated membrane shows water permeability values within 5 of its initial value it clearly signifies that the membrane got cleaned all the above mentioned experiments were conducted at room temperature the various parameters maintained for the filtration experiment and subsequent cleaning are presented in table 2 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of raw materials in the tga results of the raw material mixture with na cmc fig 3 the first minimal weight loss is noticed around 110 130 c owing to the evaporation of physisorbed moisture present in the sample 15 the second peak in the dtg curve occurs at a temperature of 280 c which may be attributed to the thermal decomposition of sodium salt of carboxymethyl cellulose na cmc the binder used in the membrane fabrication process at this temperature the thermal oxidative degradation of na cmc causes different reactions to take place thus changing the composition of the sample during thermal degradation process the fragments obtained from na cmc molecular chain undergo rearrangement that leads to the formation of some polyunsaturated chain products these materials may get oxidized at a higher temperature leading to the creation of co2 and minor weight loss 33 in the tga inset and dtg graphs of the raw material mixture without additive the absence of second peak at around 280 c temperature also confirms that this particular peak corresponds to decomposition of na cmc the similarity of both the graphs except that particular peak reveals the decomposition of na cmc at that specific temperature the significant weight loss observed around 710 730 c is owing to the thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate caco3 yielding calcium oxide cao and carbon dioxide co2 as products according to the reaction mentioned in eq 9 9 c a c o 3 c a o c o 2 the carbon dioxide formed as a result of this process is considered responsible for the formation of pores in the membrane 14 it is also observed that weight loss after 1000 c is minimal moreover for fly ash based membranes the mechanical strength of the membrane increases with increasing sintering temperature reports have mentioned that only a 50 c increase in temperature leads to an enormous rise in the membrane strength 34 hence looking at the above two perspectives it can be concluded that fixing the sintering temperature of the membrane as 1100 c is quite justifiable fig 4 portrays the x ray diffraction analysis of raw material mixtures used for membrane k1 k4 fabrication before and after calcination process it has been observed that the raw material mixtures showed the presence of peaks at 2 θ angles of 20 85 26 7 29 35 50 2 60 and 68 4 the peak appearing at a 2 θ value of 29 35 corresponds to calcium carbonate while all other peaks present in the diffractogram correspond to quartz thus also confirming that quartz is the main constituent of fly ash in the case of sintered mixtures the appearance of new peaks at 2 θ values of 21 95 and 28 was observed owing to the phase change of quartz and decomposition of calcium carbonate at higher temperatures the peak at 2 θ value of 21 95 signifies the phase transformation of quartz to β crystoballite 35 it needs to mention that quartz is a quite stable compound hence only a smaller fraction of it gets transformed into β crystoballite at temperatures above 850 c leaving most of it as it is even after high temperature sintering conversely calcium carbonate in the raw material decomposes around 720 c evident in the results of tga and forms cao 14 the peak corresponding to cao is noticed at a 2 θ value of 28 36 since the membrane k4 is fabricated using quartz and fly ash only no peaks corresponding to calcium carbonate as well as calcium oxide are observed in the xrd profile of raw material mixture k4 and calcined sample k4 3 2 characterization of fabricated membranes experiments conducted to evaluate the porosity of the fabricated membranes reveal that with increasing concentration of calcium carbonate the porosity of the membrane increases table 3 an increase in the concentration of pore former caco3 leads to increased production of carbon dioxide owing to its thermal decomposition at a higher temperature resulting in enhancement of the porosity of the membranes 37 a similar kind of trend regarding the change in membrane porosity with changing concentrations of caco3 has also been reported by kaur et al 38 where membranes fabricated with kaolin as the main precursor showed increased porosity values at higher caco3 concentrations 38 as evident from table 3 one can see a sharp increase in the mechanical strength of the membranes with decreasing the quantity of calcium carbonate from 15 to 5 wt this is attributed to the decrease in porosity of the membranes as a consequence of decreasing caco3 concentration the obtained results are in good agreement with the results reported by liu 39 they also observed that increasing concentration of pore former polyvinyl butyral in the hydroxyapatite ceramics resulted in decreased compressive strength owing to the increased pore volume 39 the decrease in porosity values implies that voids in the membrane are less thus making the membrane more rigid however a reverse scenario is observed for the membrane having no caco3 where the compressive strength of the membrane drastically reduces to 8 75 mpa macroporous ceramic supports fabricated using mixtures of quartz and silica also displayed a similar trend where supports with zero pore former had the lowest strength 40 with increasing the concentration of pore former material mechanical strength starts increasing up to a certain extent after which it starts following a decreasing pattern this sharp decrease in compressive strength of the membrane is because of the absence of effective sintering aid i e caco3 which enhances membrane densification and its subsequent mechanical strength by bringing the clay particles together during the time of sintering 40 41 the results of corrosion resistance of the membranes table 3 elucidate that the weight loss of the membrane in the alkaline environment is very minimal 5 indicating the membranes can be applicable in harsh alkaline conditions however the weight loss in the acidic environment is somewhat higher and also increases with increasing concentration of caco3 the probable reason is that the precipitation reaction takes place between the hydrochloric acid hcl and calcium oxide cao present in the sample resulting in the formation of calcium chloride cacl2 as shown in eq 10 6 a precisely similar trend of chemical stability of the membrane in acid with changing the concentration of caco3 was observed in the research work carried out by vasanth et al 42 where the reduction in caco3 quantity in the raw material mixture from 25 to 15 resulted in a decrease in corrosion resistance value from 6 to 1 42 as membrane k4 is fabricated without using calcium carbonate the weight loss in hydrochloric acid is very less for that membrane hence it is advisable not to use the membranes in strong acidic environments 10 c a o h c l c a c l 2 h 2 o the structural uniformity of the fabricated membranes is confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscope fesem images of inner and outer surfaces of the membranes k1 k4 are portrayed in fig 5 and fig 6 the darker portion in the images represents pores present in the membrane while the lighter portion depicts clay all the images show homogeneity in the membrane surface with numerous pores in it one can clearly see from the images that the membranes are completely crack free the images of inner as well as the outer sections of the membranes are almost similar 3 3 water permeability and pore size evaluation the pure water flux experiments were conducted with four membrane compositions for the duration of 40 min at pressures 69 138 207 276 and 345 kpa fig 7 represents the pure water flux data collected for all four membranes at different pressures while fig 8 represents the graph for the evaluation of water permeability of all the membranes compaction at high pressure makes the membrane saturated by filling the pores with water hence after saturation the flux was constant during the whole experiment it is observed that pure water flux increases with an increase in the applied pressure owing to the increased driving force 43 the pure water permeability values obtained from fig 8 tortuosity values calculated using eq 6 and the corresponding pore size evaluated using eq 5 are listed in table 3 it needs to mention that the pore sizes of the membranes are also assessed from fesem images using imagej software it is found that the pore sizes determined using fesem images of the membranes follow a similar trend as that of the ones evaluated using pure water permeability however the average pore diameter calculated using fesem images is somewhat higher than the ones calculated using hydraulic flux for instance the mean pore size of k1 k2 k3 k4 membranes is 0 144 0 103 0 133 0 151 μm respectively when measured using the hydraulic flux values on the contrary the average pore diameter estimated from fesem images is found to be 0 915 0 714 0 818 and 0 983 μm respectively for k1 k2 k3 and k4 membranes the reason for the variation is that the fesem technique captures only the surface pores of the membrane which may become narrower throughout the membrane thickness moreover pores considered in fesem images may contain dead end pores and also the membrane tortuosity cannot be taken into consideration in this technique it is to be noted that the mean pore size determined using water permeation data takes into account the entire permeation pathway through which water molecule travels hence the pore sizes obtained through water permeability values are considered for further separation work as they seem to be more realistic this result is in agreement with the results obtained by sinha and purkait 44 and suresh and pugazhenthi 45 it is observed from table 3 that except membrane k1 the mean pore size of the membrane increases with decreasing content of caco3 this may be due to the weak binding between clay particles because of the availability of a lesser amount of sintering aid caco3 41 even though k1 membrane has a smaller pore size than the k4 membrane the exceptionally high water permeability is attributed to the very high porosity of k1 membrane almost 46 which ultimately surpassed the effect of sintering aid 3 4 optimization of membrane composition the results obtained from various characterizations are summarized in table 3 it is evident that the pore sizes of the membranes are almost in the similar range however in terms of mechanical strength membrane k3 performs the best and chemical stability of this membrane is also comparatively good over k1 and k2 though membrane k4 has the best chemical stability among all four membranes its mechanical strength is lowest of all the porosity of k1 and k2 is higher as compared to k3 however the lower mechanical strength of these membranes k1 and k2 puts restrictions on their use moreover a membrane porosity value within 30 40 is quite acceptable and k3 satisfies this criterion hence looking at all the above mentioned features membrane k3 is finalized to use in the treatment of poultry wastewater 3 5 treatment of poultry slaughterhouse wastewater poultry processing wastewater is highly laden with organic matters among the various contaminants present in poultry water almost 35 corresponds to the large floating debris resulting from the agglomeration of grease and fat while the major fraction around 55 corresponds to suspended solids containing lipids proteins pathogenic microbes etc these suspended solids are the prime reason for the formation of opaque haze in poultry wastewater the rest 5 10 of contaminants are contributed by particles sticking to the emulsified globules present in the wastewater 17 hence the characteristics of the poultry wastewater collected for testing the filtration performance of the membrane were also evaluated and the results are presented in table 4 it needs to mention that the bod5 value of the raw wastewater mentioned in table 4 was calculated using the ratio bod5 cod 0 6 this ratio has been extensively used in many research works related to poultry slaughterhouse wastewater to calculate the bod5 values from the experimentally obtained cod values 18 46 the poultry wastewater was passed through the membrane module at five different pressures keeping all the other parameters constant as mentioned in table 2 it is evident from fig 9 that the permeate flux increases with an increase in the applied pressure the pressure being the driving force in this membrane separation process its increasing value causes increased driving force thus leading to a higher flow of permeate 47 however the flux declines with time which may be due to the resistance offered by pore blocking and formation of the cake layer in the initial period of filtration a rapid decrease in the flux is noticed due to pore blocking of foulant particles however the fouling caused by the formation of cake layer on the membrane surface due to the deposition of foulants makes the decline of the permeate flux gradual the fouling occurred due to cake layer formation over the membrane surface is regarded as the reversible form of membrane fouling 48 it was reported in the literature that the proteins present in poultry wastewater do not possess a fixed conformation and hence they get destabilized on the application of high shear leading to membrane fouling and subsequent flux decline 49 as evidenced the flux decline is faster and more pronounced at higher pressures as a higher shear rate breaks down the organic matters and leads to enhanced pore blocking 27 at lower pressures insufficient shear rate makes the breaking of foulant particles quite difficult thus resisting pore blocking hence the decline in flux at 207 kpa is quite insignificant as compared to other pressures 50 it can be said that the fouling at higher pressures is attributed to the combined effect of cake formation as well as pore blocking while the impact of pore blocking gets diminished at lower pressures if the question comes for choosing an optimum pressure at which the system needs to be operated 414 kpa can be considered as it not only gives 100 rejection but also gives high flux with lesser flux decline pressure 483 kpa cannot be taken as the optimum operating pressure albeit providing a higher flux owing to its higher flux decline during the operation time the obtained permeate is clear in colour with zero turbidity value for all five pressures as depicted in fig 10 as evident from fig 11 complete removal of cod and tss is achieved through this membrane the larger size of the particulate matters present in the poultry slaughterhouse wastewater is the prime reason for achieving 100 reduction in cod tss and turbidity of the processed water the major contaminants of poultry slaughterhouse wastewater are the suspended solids having the size in the range of 20 50 μm as we mentioned earlier that the fats and globules present in the wastewater are in the form of large agglomerates and debris that float on the water surface and hence these can be easily removable the rest of the contaminants which are found to be bound with emulsified globules have sizes of around 5 mm 17 it is noteworthy to mention that the pore size of the membrane 0 133 μm is lower than the sizes of the above mentioned organic matters present in poultry wastewater which generally contribute to cod and tss content hence the membrane could achieve the complete removal of them via size exclusion principle it is worth mentioning that the permeate water collected through the process satisfies the cod and tss norms provided by central pollution control board india for its reuse as well as discharge into the environment it also justifies the regulation given by the world health organisation in terms of turbidity value that can even be accepted for drinking purposes 51 52 looking at the high quality of permeate produced it can be inferred that the water is safe to discharge into the environment and can also be reused in the poultry industry itself to tackle the stringent water demand 3 6 contrast over prior arts prior arts regarding the fabrication of fly ash based tubular membranes and treatments of poultry slaughterhouse wastewater are very limited few of the available literature on the manufacturing of fly ash based tubular membranes are portrayed in table 5 it is observed from table 5 that the membrane prepared in this work has the least pore size of all the mentioned literature in the work carried out by malik et al 13 the quantity of fly ash used for the membrane was very less only 17 5 wt which needs to be increased to address the fly ash disposal concern 13 few cases reported the use of higher sintering temperature such as 1380 c as well as wide varieties of raw materials which add to the fabrication cost of the membrane though the fabrication of flat membranes serves the purpose of small scale operations it cannot be considered a wise option to be used industrially because flat membranes are poor in handling feeds with higher solid content along with its disadvantage of having lower filtration area in certain cases the reported porosity such as 29 9 and mechanical strength 6 99 mpa values are also not very satisfactory thus restricting their use industrially works of rawat and bulasara 12 as well as dong et al 53 reported the use of a large variety of raw materials along with fly ash which will increase the cost of the fabrication process 12 53 hence it has been noticed that membranes prepared using fly ash as base material with a good combination of physical as well as mechanical properties available at an affordable cost are yet to be fabricated membranes prepared in this work along with addressing the issue of environmental sustainability possess very high mechanical strength and outstanding chemical stability being tubular in nature the surface area available for filtration will also be more in these membranes as compared to the flat ones another advantage of the prepared membranes is that the membranes are made using only those materials that are utmost essential for membranes integrity and performance thus limiting the use of a large number of different precursors moreover the capacity of tubular membranes to withstand higher cross flow velocity makes the fabricated membranes useful for processes where a large amount of suspended solids are there as contamination 54 hence it can be concluded that the prepared membranes meet all the necessary criteria to make them applicable in industrial processes and can be regarded as the best one available till date to the best of our knowledge literature available regarding the use of membrane filtration in the treatment of poultry processing wastewater mostly talks about commercial polymeric membranes table 6 which are not only expensive but are also very brittle in nature even though the flux obtained by using polymeric membranes is higher than that of the membrane used in this work the use of polymeric membranes cannot be considered as a potential solution for long term separation processes owing to their very poor chemical as well as mechanical strength 16 56 38 48 basitere et al 21 though reported the use of ceramic membranes the raw materials used in its fabrication make it very expensive certain cases also mentioned about the use of hybrid processes such as static granular bed reactor 21 which again makes the whole process a big budgeted one membrane k3 overcomes all the above mentioned disadvantages and offers complete rejection without even compromising with the permeate flux which contemplates its superiority over the other membranes used earlier for purification of poultry slaughterhouse wastewater 4 conclusions membranes with fly ash as the base material and minor quantities of quartz as well as calcium carbonate were fabricated and characterized emphasis was given on the utilization of the maximum amount of fly ash in the membrane fabrication process to address the growing concern over the improper disposal of fly ash by various power plants directly into the soil water environment and the hazardous consequences associated with it the fabricated membranes showed wide variation in their mechanical as well as physical properties the membranes had pore sizes in the range of 0 103 0 151 μm which can be considered as the least possible pore size obtained with fly ash based tubular membranes however among the various compositions membrane k3 with a composition of 75 fly ash 20 quartz and 5 calcium carbonate offered best of the properties thus making us convinced to optimize this composition for poultry wastewater purification the membrane was capable of achieving complete removal of cod tss and turbidity from the raw wastewater thereby providing a clue towards reducing the water consumption in poultry processing industries through efficient reuse of the treated water the treated water is even dischargeable to surface water without the risk of any danger associated with the lives of aquatic flora and fauna hence it can be concluded that the membranes with this composition can be incorporated industrially to treat the enormous amount of wastewater generated in the poultry industries situated

occur including ion dissociation tada et al 12 performed mesophilic anaerobic sludge digestion and analyzed the cation concentrations before and after treatment increases in nh4 ca2 na and k were reported following digestion 12 which can potentially be picked up by conductivity measurements uv vis absorbance was previously used as an indirect measure of organic matter in monitoring freshwater wwtps and sewers 13 since the majority of bod is attributed to suspended organic matter a fair relationship was found to exist between the two parameters specifically when absorption is measured at 254 nm 6 14 possessing similar advantages as fluorescence techniques uv vis absorbance has great potential as an in line real time wastewater characterization technique the inherent absorbance of organic molecules is due to superposition of the optical properties of individual compounds and the intermolecular interactions 14 15 some of the previous studies examined changes in surrogate and conventional parameters between treatment units i e varying geographical sample locations within the wastewater treatment train and identified existing relationships between the two parameter sets 16 17 this work focused on trends observed in conventional and surrogate parameters within a single treatment process anaerobic digestion over the full treatment period and aimed to constrain relationships for the purpose of real time process control specifically the objectives of this research were to employ new methods for monitoring of treatment performance by surrogate parameters fi conductivity and uv vis absorbance during anaerobic sludge digestion and test these surrogate parameters suitability as process control tools through correlation to cod and vs measurements 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and reactor set up primary sludge ps waste activated sludge was and digested sludge ds samples 15 l were collected from robert o pickard environmental centre wwtp in ottawa canada which has a capacity of 545 millions of litres day samples were transported to the laboratory where the anaerobic digestion reactor was immediately started a 10 l nalgene high density polyethylene container was used as the lab scale reactor vessel fig 1 the reactor contents were made up with 4 5 l ps and 4 5 l was to mimic full scale sludge digesters and 1 l ds was used as inoculum 18 a feed port top was utilized for feeding sample to digester and a sample port bottom was utilized to withdraw sample the reactor was supplied with constant agitation by placement on a shaker table and the combined system was placed in a mesophilic incubator calibrated to 37 c a gas outlet top was fit with a bag to trap biogas and to also maintain anaerobic conditions during sample withdrawals 2 2 feeding and sampling procedures the reactor was operated for a 28 day solids retention time each day 400 ml of reactor sludge were withdrawn and 400 ml 200 ml ps and 200 ml was were fed to the reactor analyses were performed according to a designed schedule of sampling days over the treatment period sampling occurred on treatment day 0 1 2 5 6 7 8 12 14 16 19 22 26 28 after withdrawing 400 ml of sludge sample from the reactor 100 ml were used for analysis of digested sludge characteristics the remaining 300 ml were separated for centrifugation at 7500 rpm for 10 min in order to obtain and analyze the sludge supernatant hereinafter called effluent half the effluent volume produced was then filtered through a 0 45 μm filter using a vacuum pump to obtain the soluble sludge supernatant hereinafter termed filtered effluent 2 3 conventional parameter analyses 2 3 1 total solids ts and volatile solids vs sludge samples were analyzed for ts in 3 replicate practice the standard methods 2540 b were followed for the determination of ts 19 the same replicate samples were then analyzed using the standard methods 2540 e for determination of vs 19 2 3 2 cod sludge effluent and filtered effluent samples were subjected to routine cod hereinafter effluent cod ecod soluble cod scod testing using 3 replicate practice and the hach method 8000 high range plus 200 15 000 mg l cod 19 to be within the detectable range sludge effluent and filtered effluent samples were diluted 1 25 1 5 and 1 10 respectively 2 4 surrogate parameter analyses 2 4 1 conductivity and ph effluent and filtered effluent samples were subjected to conductivity and ph probe measurements all conductivity and ph measurements were conducted on the thermo fisher scientific orion 5 star plus meter using the orion duraprobe 4 electrode conductivity cells and orion triode 3 in 1 ph atc probe respectively the conductivity probe was calibrated once a week using the 1413 μs cm standard solution according to the calibration method chapter x in the meter manual 20 the triode probe was calibrated once a week using 3 standard buffer solutions ph 4 7 and 10 according to the calibration method chapter vi in the meter manual 20 conductivity and ph measurements were taken for the effluent and filtered effluent samples following the measurement methods in chapters x and vi respectively outlined in the meter manual 20 2 4 2 fluorescence intensity all fluorescence measurements were taken on the varian cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer two excitation wavelengths were used 230 nm 275 nm to capture peaks t1 and t2 based on typical values used in literature and preliminary testing emission was scanned at wavelengths 240 285 500 nm depending on excitation wavelength using 5 nm intervals 5 nm slit width and slow scan control a deionized water sample was used to zero the machine and 3 replicates of filtered effluent samples at room temperature and diluted 1 10 to reduce scattering and inner filter effects were read in a quartz cuvette fluorescence intensity scans in fluorescence units afu were recorded for each excitation wavelength over the corresponding emission wavelength range 230 285 500 nm throughout the treatment period recurrent peaks in fi at specific emission wavelengths were observed and fis at these wavelengths were subsequently targeted for quantitative and statistical analyses 2 4 3 uv vis absorbance all uv vis absorbance measurements were carried out on the cary 100 bio uv vis spectrophotometer using a scan rate of 600 nm min 1 nm resolution double beam configuration and a quartz cuvette the absorbance between 190 900 nm was read two deionized water samples were placed in both cells to zero the machine and one deionized water sample was maintained in the back cell for constant baseline correction throughout measurement two effluent sample dilutions 1 50 1 100 and two filtered effluent sample dilutions 1 10 1 50 were prepared and scanned using 3 replicate practice and absorbance measurements were recorded absorbance scans for each sampling day were investigated for trends and variations wavelengths of interest and corresponding absorbance values were targeted for qualitative and statistical analyses to observe trends over the treatment period 2 5 replicates and statistical analyses two complete runs of the experimental design detailed above were carried out with three sample replicates in each run the experimental set up of these two separate runs were identical and differed in treatment days sampled and with some variations in reactor feeding the overall trends for each parameter studied were in agreement in both runs and the results from the second run are presented in the results and discussion section linear regression analyses were carried out using a conventional parameter ecod scod or vs concentration as the independent predictor variable and a surrogate parameter fi conductivity or uv vis absorbance as the dependent predicted variable coefficient of determination r2 values were assessed to establish the suitability of each surrogate parameter for real time digestion monitoring due to the experimental nature of this study an r2 value of 0 6 or greater was considered to represent a strong relationship between two parameters 3 results and discussion table 1 provides a summary of the relationships investigated between surrogate parameters and ecod scod or vs and the associated r2 3 1 ts vs sludge sample was analyzed for ts vs 14 times throughout the digestion period ts and vs concentrations decreased gradually until day 12 and leveled off after that lowest observed solids reductions of 37 and 42 in total and volatile solids respectively were found on day 19 signalling the consumption of digestible organic matter fig 2 displays the trends in ts and vs over treatment showcasing a slight increase in both parameters beyond day 19 this was attributed to evaporative processes within the incubator which likely caused a decrease in water content and an apparent increase in solids concentration treatment was considered to be complete at day 19 3 2 cod 14 samples of effluent and filtered effluent were subjected to cod testing over the 28 days concentrations of ecod and scod are shown in fig 3 where an overall increase in cod is seen in both samples until day 12 during this time the first three microbial steps in anaerobic digestion occurred hydrolysis of complex organics released monomers for further bacterial degradation during acidogenesis and acetogenesis wherein h2 is a mutual product 21 gradual decreases in cod concentrations are exhibited beyond day 12 indicating some methanogenesis and thus consumption of cod over accumulation of h2 has been found to partially inhibit the conversion of volatile fatty acids to acetic acid during acetogenesis 21 acetotrophic methanogens require acetic acid for cod consumption and would thus be limited in substrate availability during methanogenesis furthermore as cells die this cell debris contributes to soluble cod concentrations anaerobic digestion reactors are sensitive systems that are easily upset by toxic materials and instability this sensitivity is partially attributed to methanogens as these bacteria are easily distressed by operational changes in particular methanogens are most effective at producing methane from acetic acid h2 or co2 within a ph range of 6 8 7 2 as seen in fig 7 the reactor sludge ph was close to 5 after day 12 similar to total solids concentrations evaporative effects could have contributed to an increased apparent cod as water content dropped 3 3 fluorescence intensity fluorescence spectrometry operates by exciting om with wavelengths in the ultraviolet uv and visible vis light ranges causing the natural compounds to fluoresce and emit fluorophores in an intensity that is read by simultaneous fluorophore emission scanning there are multiple merits in the use of fluorescence it is highly sensitive to variations adaptable and it offers an inexpensive rapid reagentless method of wastewater characterization without laborious sample preparation 17 in this study fi scans were conducted using two excitation wavelengths 230 nm 275 nm on each sampling day and are shown in fig 4 a and b a common peak in fi at emission wavelength 365 nm was observed comparable to tryptophan like fluorescence peak t reported by hudson et al 7 the peak emission wavelength was targeted to observe the trends in fi over the treatment and is shown in fig 5 where the darker line represents peak t1 275 ex 365 em and the lighter line represents peak t2 230 ex 365 em it was expected that fi would decrease as treatment progressed but a second rise in fi was seen beyond day 12 former studies suggest peaks in peak t fluorescence are likely due to the by products of active microbial growth in this case during acidogenic and methanogenic phases 22 23 peak t1 and t2 trends from fig 5 were analyzed with vs through linear regression and no observable relationship was found to exist table 1 likewise peak t1 and t2 were analyzed with scod measurements producing coefficients of determination of 0 72 and 0 61 respectively the linear regressions of peak t1 and peak t2 versus scod are shown in fig 6 a and b respectively where strong relationships can be seen demonstrating a link between filtered effluent quality as it relates to organic parameters and peak t fluorescence both analyses in fig 6 showcase the inversely proportionate nature of the relationship indicating that high measurements of fi occur at low scod concentrations this is dissimilar to results found in studies sampling between treatment units bridgeman et al 16 who sampled for cod and fi at varying geographical locations within a wastewater treatment train over a month found a strong positive relationship indicating similar trends exist between the two parameters moving through the treatment train however in a study aimed at relating peak t fi and bacterial metabolism cammack et al 23 found strong evidence that peak t fluorescent substances those which contain amino acids are a by product of active microbial growth during which the peak t fi substance production exceeds its degradation this suggests that peak t fi indicates biological abundance and largely represents dissolved substances biogenically produced in microbial activity metabolism 23 furthermore during culture growth trials cammack et al 23 found that fi decreased corresponding to stationary microbial growth this result suggests the protein like substances first secreted by bacteria are then consumed by the bacteria as substrate when primary nutrients are depleted in relation to the present study the aforementioned study results indicate two distinct phases of bacterial activity over the treatment period as represented by fi the first growth stage day 0 7 represents highly active microbial populations and exceeding production of amino acid containing substances during the hydrolysis and acidogenesis phases as solubilization and metabolism of the om derived from sludge slowed the bacteria switched to endogenous peak t substances as substrate consequently decreasing fi day 7 12 the second stage of active microbial growth day 12 19 indicates the onset of methanogenesis wherein the methanogens secrete peak t substances while consuming cod the strong relationship exhibited between cod and fi emphasizes the potential for peak t fluorescence as a surrogate monitoring parameter 3 4 conductivity and ph in situ probes are easily installed in line within the treatment process and offer inexpensive and rapid measurements of parameters of interest auxiliary parameters such as conductivity turbidity and ph have been used individually to identify changes in influent water and in combination for estimates of organic process parameters bod cod using complex signal processing systems 2 24 25 conductivity and ph of filtered effluent and effluent samples were analyzed each sampling day and are shown in fig 7 the ph of the reactor sludge ranged from 5 to 8 and a ph of near 5 was sustained beyond day 12 indicating previous active acidogenesis and acetogenesis the conductivity data shows a large increase from day 8 to 12 and remains elevated beyond day 12 clearly displaying increased ion content from degradation of complex organics and monomers similar to fi the relationships between conductivity filtered effluent and effluent versus cod or vs were constrained through linear regression and are plotted in fig 8 vs and cod were found to hold strong relationships with conductivity for both filtered effluent and effluent samples as listed in table 1 although relationships between conductivity and cod were stronger than relationships between conductivity and vs fig 8a and b demonstrate that cod concentrations increased whilst conductivity increased the opposite was observed in fig 8c and d with increased solids removal and degradation conductive strength increases this is expected as cod is measured in the effluent and vs is measured in sludge including solids sludge is naturally conductive as it contains main ionic contributors such as calcium potassium sodium and ammonium 26 as anaerobic digestion proceeds and proteins are degraded weak acids and ammonia are formed and build up in solution 27 acids experience partial dissociation into ions and contribute to a higher conductivity 26 likewise ammonia produced during digestion exists primarily as ammonium ion in anaerobic digesters owing to the low ph and increases the liquid phase electrical conductivity 27 3 5 uv vis absorbance previous studies focused on absorbance measured at 254 nm for indirect measurement of cod in wastewater through the use of partial least squares regression models but issues surrounding interference from turbidity particles persist at this wavelength 28 the present work investigated multiple wavelengths over the uv vis spectrum for the assessment of relationships with conventional parameters 28 samples 14 at 1 10 dilution 14 at 1 50 dilution of filtered effluent sample and 28 samples 14 at 1 50 dilution 14 at 1 100 dilution of effluent sample were analyzed for absorbance fig 9 a d shows the resultant absorbance scans from 190 nm to 500 nm after which absorbance was near 0 absorbance scans were assessed and 9 wavelengths of interest 290 270 260 254 245 240 220 195 and 190 nm for each filtered effluent and effluent sample dilution were focused on to observe the trend in absorbance over treatment these wavelengths were chosen to cover the absorbance spectra where organic matter proteins biopolymers and nucleic acids are known to absorb light strongly 29 filtered effluent sample dilutions 1 10 1 50 were analyzed with scod and vs through linear regression similarly the relationships between effluent sample dilutions 1 50 1 100 and ecod and vs were analyzed the regression results are shown in table 1 the relationships which yielded a strong r2 are plotted in fig 10 a h in each plot shown in fig 10 one point appears far from the fitted line in each case this point represents day 0 prior to digestion when this point was discounted in analyses every linear regression model resulted in a greater coefficient of determination with the exception of the relationship shown in fig 10d involving filtered effluent interestingly the wavelengths possessing strong relationships to cod or vs were limited to 195 nm and 190 nm it was anticipated that a strong relationship would exist between absorbance at 254 nm and cod 30 however r2 results from table 1 confirm poor relationships for both filtered effluent r2 0 1 and effluent r2 0 5 samples fig 10a d show strong positive relationships between absorbance and cod whereas fig 10f h show strong negative relationships between absorbance and vs absorbance and cod relationships at 195 nm and 190 nm for the effluent sample proved to be stronger and more robust than for filtered effluent sample which yielded just one r2 value greater than 0 6 out of 18 relationships analyzed fig 11 displays the absorbance at 190 and 195 nm over treatment period with associated sample type and dilution factor which yielded strong relationships to cod or vs conventional parameters such as ts vs and cod are currently the standard methods for sludge characterization monitoring and determining the progression of treatment during anaerobic digestion a 40 decrease in vs is typically achieved which also signals the end of treatment beyond this point increasing the digestion time does not lead to significant decreases in vs content in our experiments there was a steady decrease in vs until day 12 and beyond that there was no significant change in vs until the end of the experiment on day 28 fig 2 similarly an increase in effluent cod was observed until day 12 which leveled off afterwards fig 3 day 12 could also be detected by the changes in the trends of the fluorescence conductivity and ph data figs 4 5 and 7 in addition regression analyses yielded strong correlations between cod and conductivity fluorescence intensity and uv vis absorbance r2 values of 0 84 0 72 0 74 respectively and between vs versus conductivity and uv vis absorbance r2 values of 0 68 0 73 respectively illustrating their potential as real time monitoring tools the current reliance on conventional time intensive laboratory based chemical and physical tests as monitoring tools for wastewater and sludge treatment limits the ability to rapidly assess treatment systems for real time process control and optimization the findings reported in this study merit further research with different types of sludges and biological treatment processes and testing of these parameters at full scale wastewater treatment plants 4 conclusions the results presented in this paper highlight the potential for surrogate parameters fluorescence intensity conductivity and uv vis absorbance to be used as alternative sludge treatment monitoring techniques to cod and vs these parameters are suitable for in line and real time monitoring of sludge treatment and can potentially be used for process optimization strong correlations between filtered effluent fluorescence intensity and scod r2 0 72 at ex em 275 365 r2 0 61 at ex em 230 365 were found during anaerobic digestion of sludge fluorescence peak t protein like substances was observed to be linked to microbial activity during acidogenesis and methanogenesis phases of anaerobic digestion strong correlations were also found between filtered effluent conductivity versus scod r2 0 84 effluent conductivity versus ecod r2 0 76 filtered effluent conductivity versus vs r2 0 68 and effluent conductivity versus vs r2 0 62 this was likely due to ion dissociation and release into the supernatant during anaerobic digestion of sludge furthermore strong correlations were observed between effluent absorbance at 190 nm and 195 nm versus ecod r2 0 74 and 0 62 respectively and vs r2 0 7 and 0 6 respectively correlations between effluent absorbance and ecod or vs were stronger and than those between filtered effluent absorbance and scod or vs organic compounds without double bonds tend to absorb light at lower wavelengths and biopolymers were also reported to absorb light at these wavelengths it was also possible to evaluate the progression of treatment by monitoring the point of changes in the trends of the fluorescence conductivity and ph data which coincided with the point of changes in the trends of the ts vs and effluent cod data declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement this research was funded by the natural sciences and

reported following digestion 12 which can potentially be picked up by conductivity measurements uv vis absorbance was previously used as an indirect measure of organic matter in monitoring freshwater wwtps and sewers 13 since the majority of bod is attributed to suspended organic matter a fair relationship was found to exist between the two parameters specifically when absorption is measured at 254 nm 6 14 possessing similar advantages as fluorescence techniques uv vis absorbance has great potential as an in line real time wastewater characterization technique the inherent absorbance of organic molecules is due to superposition of the optical properties of individual compounds and the intermolecular interactions 14 15 some of the previous studies examined changes in surrogate and conventional parameters between treatment units i e varying geographical sample locations within the wastewater treatment train and identified existing relationships between the two parameter sets 16 17 this work focused on trends observed in conventional and surrogate parameters within a single treatment process anaerobic digestion over the full treatment period and aimed to constrain relationships for the purpose of real time process control specifically the objectives of this research were to employ new methods for monitoring of treatment performance by surrogate parameters fi conductivity and uv vis absorbance during anaerobic sludge digestion and test these surrogate parameters suitability as process control tools through correlation to cod and vs measurements 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and reactor set up primary sludge ps waste activated sludge was and digested sludge ds samples 15 l were collected from robert o pickard environmental centre wwtp in ottawa canada which has a capacity of 545 millions of litres day samples were transported to the laboratory where the anaerobic digestion reactor was immediately started a 10 l nalgene high density polyethylene container was used as the lab scale reactor vessel fig 1 the reactor contents were made up with 4 5 l ps and 4 5 l was to mimic full scale sludge digesters and 1 l ds was used as inoculum 18 a feed port top was utilized for feeding sample to digester and a sample port bottom was utilized to withdraw sample the reactor was supplied with constant agitation by placement on a shaker table and the combined system was placed in a mesophilic incubator calibrated to 37 c a gas outlet top was fit with a bag to trap biogas and to also maintain anaerobic conditions during sample withdrawals 2 2 feeding and sampling procedures the reactor was operated for a 28 day solids retention time each day 400 ml of reactor sludge were withdrawn and 400 ml 200 ml ps and 200 ml was were fed to the reactor analyses were performed according to a designed schedule of sampling days over the treatment period sampling occurred on treatment day 0 1 2 5 6 7 8 12 14 16 19 22 26 28 after withdrawing 400 ml of sludge sample from the reactor 100 ml were used for analysis of digested sludge characteristics the remaining 300 ml were separated for centrifugation at 7500 rpm for 10 min in order to obtain and analyze the sludge supernatant hereinafter called effluent half the effluent volume produced was then filtered through a 0 45 μm filter using a vacuum pump to obtain the soluble sludge supernatant hereinafter termed filtered effluent 2 3 conventional parameter analyses 2 3 1 total solids ts and volatile solids vs sludge samples were analyzed for ts in 3 replicate practice the standard methods 2540 b were followed for the determination of ts 19 the same replicate samples were then analyzed using the standard methods 2540 e for determination of vs 19 2 3 2 cod sludge effluent and filtered effluent samples were subjected to routine cod hereinafter effluent cod ecod soluble cod scod testing using 3 replicate practice and the hach method 8000 high range plus 200 15 000 mg l cod 19 to be within the detectable range sludge effluent and filtered effluent samples were diluted 1 25 1 5 and 1 10 respectively 2 4 surrogate parameter analyses 2 4 1 conductivity and ph effluent and filtered effluent samples were subjected to conductivity and ph probe measurements all conductivity and ph measurements were conducted on the thermo fisher scientific orion 5 star plus meter using the orion duraprobe 4 electrode conductivity cells and orion triode 3 in 1 ph atc probe respectively the conductivity probe was calibrated once a week using the 1413 μs cm standard solution according to the calibration method chapter x in the meter manual 20 the triode probe was calibrated once a week using 3 standard buffer solutions ph 4 7 and 10 according to the calibration method chapter vi in the meter manual 20 conductivity and ph measurements were taken for the effluent and filtered effluent samples following the measurement methods in chapters x and vi respectively outlined in the meter manual 20 2 4 2 fluorescence intensity all fluorescence measurements were taken on the varian cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer two excitation wavelengths were used 230 nm 275 nm to capture peaks t1 and t2 based on typical values used in literature and preliminary testing emission was scanned at wavelengths 240 285 500 nm depending on excitation wavelength using 5 nm intervals 5 nm slit width and slow scan control a deionized water sample was used to zero the machine and 3 replicates of filtered effluent samples at room temperature and diluted 1 10 to reduce scattering and inner filter effects were read in a quartz cuvette fluorescence intensity scans in fluorescence units afu were recorded for each excitation wavelength over the corresponding emission wavelength range 230 285 500 nm throughout the treatment period recurrent peaks in fi at specific emission wavelengths were observed and fis at these wavelengths were subsequently targeted for quantitative and statistical analyses 2 4 3 uv vis absorbance all uv vis absorbance measurements were carried out on the cary 100 bio uv vis spectrophotometer using a scan rate of 600 nm min 1 nm resolution double beam configuration and a quartz cuvette the absorbance between 190 900 nm was read two deionized water samples were placed in both cells to zero the machine and one deionized water sample was maintained in the back cell for constant baseline correction throughout measurement two effluent sample dilutions 1 50 1 100 and two filtered effluent sample dilutions 1 10 1 50 were prepared and scanned using 3 replicate practice and absorbance measurements were recorded absorbance scans for each sampling day were investigated for trends and variations wavelengths of interest and corresponding absorbance values were targeted for qualitative and statistical analyses to observe trends over the treatment period 2 5 replicates and statistical analyses two complete runs of the experimental design detailed above were carried out with three sample replicates in each run the experimental set up of these two separate runs were identical and differed in treatment days sampled and with some variations in reactor feeding the overall trends for each parameter studied were in agreement in both runs and the results from the second run are presented in the results and discussion section linear regression analyses were carried out using a conventional parameter ecod scod or vs concentration as the independent predictor variable and a surrogate parameter fi conductivity or uv vis absorbance as the dependent predicted variable coefficient of determination r2 values were assessed to establish the suitability of each surrogate parameter for real time digestion monitoring due to the experimental nature of this study an r2 value of 0 6 or greater was considered to represent a strong relationship between two parameters 3 results and discussion table 1 provides a summary of the relationships investigated between surrogate parameters and ecod scod or vs and the associated r2 3 1 ts vs sludge sample was analyzed for ts vs 14 times throughout the digestion period ts and vs concentrations decreased gradually until day 12 and leveled off after that lowest observed solids reductions of 37 and 42 in total and volatile solids respectively were found on day 19 signalling the consumption of digestible organic matter fig 2 displays the trends in ts and vs over treatment showcasing a slight increase in both parameters beyond day 19 this was attributed to evaporative processes within the incubator which likely caused a decrease in water content and an apparent increase in solids concentration treatment was considered to be complete at day 19 3 2 cod 14 samples of effluent and filtered effluent were subjected to cod testing over the 28 days concentrations of ecod and scod are shown in fig 3 where an overall increase in cod is seen in both samples until day 12 during this time the first three microbial steps in anaerobic digestion occurred hydrolysis of complex organics released monomers for further bacterial degradation during acidogenesis and acetogenesis wherein h2 is a mutual product 21 gradual decreases in cod concentrations are exhibited beyond day 12 indicating some methanogenesis and thus consumption of cod over accumulation of h2 has been found to partially inhibit the conversion of volatile fatty acids to acetic acid during acetogenesis 21 acetotrophic methanogens require acetic acid for cod consumption and would thus be limited in substrate availability during methanogenesis furthermore as cells die this cell debris contributes to soluble cod concentrations anaerobic digestion reactors are sensitive systems that are easily upset by toxic materials and instability this sensitivity is partially attributed to methanogens as these bacteria are easily distressed by operational changes in particular methanogens are most effective at producing methane from acetic acid h2 or co2 within a ph range of 6 8 7 2 as seen in fig 7 the reactor sludge ph was close to 5 after day 12 similar to total solids concentrations evaporative effects could have contributed to an increased apparent cod as water content dropped 3 3 fluorescence intensity fluorescence spectrometry operates by exciting om with wavelengths in the ultraviolet uv and visible vis light ranges causing the natural compounds to fluoresce and emit fluorophores in an intensity that is read by simultaneous fluorophore emission scanning there are multiple merits in the use of fluorescence it is highly sensitive to variations adaptable and it offers an inexpensive rapid reagentless method of wastewater characterization without laborious sample preparation 17 in this study fi scans were conducted using two excitation wavelengths 230 nm 275 nm on each sampling day and are shown in fig 4 a and b a common peak in fi at emission wavelength 365 nm was observed comparable to tryptophan like fluorescence peak t reported by hudson et al 7 the peak emission wavelength was targeted to observe the trends in fi over the treatment and is shown in fig 5 where the darker line represents peak t1 275 ex 365 em and the lighter line represents peak t2 230 ex 365 em it was expected that fi would decrease as treatment progressed but a second rise in fi was seen beyond day 12 former studies suggest peaks in peak t fluorescence are likely due to the by products of active microbial growth in this case during acidogenic and methanogenic phases 22 23 peak t1 and t2 trends from fig 5 were analyzed with vs through linear regression and no observable relationship was found to exist table 1 likewise peak t1 and t2 were analyzed with scod measurements producing coefficients of determination of 0 72 and 0 61 respectively the linear regressions of peak t1 and peak t2 versus scod are shown in fig 6 a and b respectively where strong relationships can be seen demonstrating a link between filtered effluent quality as it relates to organic parameters and peak t fluorescence both analyses in fig 6 showcase the inversely proportionate nature of the relationship indicating that high measurements of fi occur at low scod concentrations this is dissimilar to results found in studies sampling between treatment units bridgeman et al 16 who sampled for cod and fi at varying geographical locations within a wastewater treatment train over a month found a strong positive relationship indicating similar trends exist between the two parameters moving through the treatment train however in a study aimed at relating peak t fi and bacterial metabolism cammack et al 23 found strong evidence that peak t fluorescent substances those which contain amino acids are a by product of active microbial growth during which the peak t fi substance production exceeds its degradation this suggests that peak t fi indicates biological abundance and largely represents dissolved substances biogenically produced in microbial activity metabolism 23 furthermore during culture growth trials cammack et al 23 found that fi decreased corresponding to stationary microbial growth this result suggests the protein like substances first secreted by bacteria are then consumed by the bacteria as substrate when primary nutrients are depleted in relation to the present study the aforementioned study results indicate two distinct phases of bacterial activity over the treatment period as represented by fi the first growth stage day 0 7 represents highly active microbial populations and exceeding production of amino acid containing substances during the hydrolysis and acidogenesis phases as solubilization and metabolism of the om derived from sludge slowed the bacteria switched to endogenous peak t substances as substrate consequently decreasing fi day 7 12 the second stage of active microbial growth day 12 19 indicates the onset of methanogenesis wherein the methanogens secrete peak t substances while consuming cod the strong relationship exhibited between cod and fi emphasizes the potential for peak t fluorescence as a surrogate monitoring parameter 3 4 conductivity and ph in situ probes are easily installed in line within the treatment process and offer inexpensive and rapid measurements of parameters of interest auxiliary parameters such as conductivity turbidity and ph have been used individually to identify changes in influent water and in combination for estimates of organic process parameters bod cod using complex signal processing systems 2 24 25 conductivity and ph of filtered effluent and effluent samples were analyzed each sampling day and are shown in fig 7 the ph of the reactor sludge ranged from 5 to 8 and a ph of near 5 was sustained beyond day 12 indicating previous active acidogenesis and acetogenesis the conductivity data shows a large increase from day 8 to 12 and remains elevated beyond day 12 clearly displaying increased ion content from degradation of complex organics and monomers similar to fi the relationships between conductivity filtered effluent and effluent versus cod or vs were constrained through linear regression and are plotted in fig 8 vs and cod were found to hold strong relationships with conductivity for both filtered effluent and effluent samples as listed in table 1 although relationships between conductivity and cod were stronger than relationships between conductivity and vs fig 8a and b demonstrate that cod concentrations increased whilst conductivity increased the opposite was observed in fig 8c and d with increased solids removal and degradation conductive strength increases this is expected as cod is measured in the effluent and vs is measured in sludge including solids sludge is naturally conductive as it contains main ionic contributors such as calcium potassium sodium and ammonium 26 as anaerobic digestion proceeds and proteins are degraded weak acids and ammonia are formed and build up in solution 27 acids experience partial dissociation into ions and contribute to a higher conductivity 26 likewise ammonia produced during digestion exists primarily as ammonium ion in anaerobic digesters owing to the low ph and increases the liquid phase electrical conductivity 27 3 5 uv vis absorbance previous studies focused on absorbance measured at 254 nm for indirect measurement of cod in wastewater through the use of partial least squares regression models but issues surrounding interference from turbidity particles persist at this wavelength 28 the present work investigated multiple wavelengths over the uv vis spectrum for the assessment of relationships with conventional parameters 28 samples 14 at 1 10 dilution 14 at 1 50 dilution of filtered effluent sample and 28 samples 14 at 1 50 dilution 14 at 1 100 dilution of effluent sample were analyzed for absorbance fig 9 a d shows the resultant absorbance scans from 190 nm to 500 nm after which absorbance was near 0 absorbance scans were assessed and 9 wavelengths of interest 290 270 260 254 245 240 220 195 and 190 nm for each filtered effluent and effluent sample dilution were focused on to observe the trend in absorbance over treatment these wavelengths were chosen to cover the absorbance spectra where organic matter proteins biopolymers and nucleic acids are known to absorb light strongly 29 filtered effluent sample dilutions 1 10 1 50 were analyzed with scod and vs through linear regression similarly the relationships between effluent sample dilutions 1 50 1 100 and ecod and vs were analyzed the regression results are shown in table 1 the relationships which yielded a strong r2 are plotted in fig 10 a h in each plot shown in fig 10 one point appears far from the fitted line in each case this point represents day 0 prior to digestion when this point was discounted in analyses every linear regression model resulted in a greater coefficient of determination with the exception of the relationship shown in fig 10d involving filtered effluent interestingly the wavelengths possessing strong relationships to cod or vs were limited to 195 nm and 190 nm it was anticipated that a strong relationship would exist between absorbance at 254 nm and cod 30 however r2 results from table 1 confirm poor relationships for both filtered effluent r2 0 1 and effluent r2 0 5 samples fig 10a d show strong positive relationships between absorbance and cod whereas fig 10f h show strong negative relationships between absorbance and vs absorbance and cod relationships at 195 nm and 190 nm for the effluent sample proved to be stronger and more robust than for filtered effluent sample which yielded just one r2 value greater than 0 6 out of 18 relationships analyzed fig 11 displays the absorbance at 190 and 195 nm over treatment period with associated sample type and dilution factor which yielded strong relationships to cod or vs conventional parameters such as ts vs and cod are currently the standard methods for sludge characterization monitoring and determining the progression of treatment during anaerobic digestion a 40 decrease in vs is typically achieved which also signals the end of treatment beyond this point increasing the digestion time does not lead to significant decreases in vs content in our experiments there was a steady decrease in vs until day 12 and beyond that there was no significant change in vs until the end of the experiment on day 28 fig 2 similarly an increase in effluent cod was observed until day 12 which leveled off afterwards fig 3 day 12 could also be detected by the changes in the trends of the fluorescence conductivity and ph data figs 4 5 and 7 in addition regression analyses yielded strong correlations between cod and conductivity fluorescence intensity and uv vis absorbance r2 values of 0 84 0 72 0 74 respectively and between vs versus conductivity and uv vis absorbance r2 values of 0 68 0 73 respectively illustrating their potential as real time monitoring tools the current reliance on conventional time intensive laboratory based chemical and physical tests as monitoring tools for wastewater and sludge treatment limits the ability to rapidly assess treatment systems for real time process control and optimization the findings reported in this study merit further research with different types of sludges and biological treatment processes and testing of these parameters at full scale wastewater treatment plants 4 conclusions the results presented in this paper highlight the potential for surrogate parameters fluorescence intensity conductivity and uv vis absorbance to be used as alternative sludge treatment monitoring techniques to cod and vs these parameters are suitable for in line and real time monitoring of sludge treatment and can potentially be used for process optimization strong correlations between filtered effluent fluorescence intensity and scod r2 0 72 at ex em 275 365 r2 0 61 at ex em 230 365 were found during anaerobic digestion of sludge fluorescence peak t protein like substances was observed to be linked to microbial activity during acidogenesis and methanogenesis phases of anaerobic digestion strong correlations were also found between filtered effluent conductivity versus scod r2 0 84 effluent conductivity versus ecod r2 0 76 filtered effluent conductivity versus vs r2 0 68 and effluent conductivity versus vs r2 0 62 this was likely due to ion dissociation and release into the supernatant during anaerobic digestion of sludge furthermore strong correlations were observed between effluent absorbance at 190 nm and 195 nm versus ecod r2 0 74 and 0 62 respectively and vs r2 0 7 and 0 6 respectively correlations between effluent absorbance and ecod or vs were stronger and than those between filtered effluent absorbance and scod or vs organic compounds without double bonds tend to absorb light at lower wavelengths and biopolymers were also reported to absorb light at these wavelengths it was also possible to evaluate the progression of treatment by monitoring the point of changes in the trends of the fluorescence conductivity and ph data which coincided with the point of changes in the trends of the ts vs and effluent cod data declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement this research was funded by the natural sciences and

13859,the current study deals with fe iii and zr iv incorporated titanate nanotubes fztnt for efficient removal of fluoride from potable water the surface modification of hydrogen titanate nanotubes htnt with fe and zr ions not only transformed the adsorbent surface suitable for fluoride adsorption at neutral ph but also enhanced its fluoride adsorption capacity the surface charge of the adsorbent was estimated by zeta potential measurements the other physical and chemical properties of the fztnt were examined using bet ftir and xps fztnt had specific surface area of 245 m2 g the crystal structure morphology and chemical characterizations were carried out using the xrd tem and sem edx respectively the fluoride adsorption data followed the langmuir isotherm and the langmuir adsorption capacity was estimated to be 229 3 mg g at neutral ph contact time of 2 h and adsorbent dosage of 1 g l fztnt exhibited superior adsorption properties compared to htnt which had negligible adsorption at ph 7 0 01 adsorption of fluoride followed ion exchange mechanism in addition fztnt possessed good adsorption kinetics and could be reused for three cycles without significant drop in its adsorption capacity which allowed fztnt to be used for defluoridating groundwater to who limits 1 5 mg l keywords fztnt adsorption surface modification surface charge iep neutral ph defluoridation 1 introduction presence of contaminants in water is a global problem fluoride is one such hazardous contaminant serious environmental issues and undesirable impacts on human health caused by high levels of fluoride in water necessitates defluoridation of water according to who 1 presence of fluoride in water in concentration above 1 5 mg l and as per bureau of indian standards bis 2 concentrations of fluoride above 1 mg l is hazardous for the human health in multiple ways 3 4 hence its removal from water is the need of the hour among the various techniques of fluoride removal reported in literature adsorption is one of the efficient ways of defluoridation 5 6 many researchers have also used different absorbents for removal of other contaminants such as heavy metal ions dyes organic pollutants etc 7 10 the effectiveness of the technique purely depends on the adsorbent properties in the recent years tio2 and its derivative titanates have emerged as potential materials they have found remarkable applications in varied fields of photocatalysis 11 solar cells 12 water splitting 13 14 lithium ion batteries 15 dye degradation 16 17 sensing applications 18 and many more in addition using these materials for water remediation became research interest of many researchers adsorption being a surface phenomenon the surface area of the adsorbents highly influences the adsorption process surface area is affected not only by the size of the particles but also by their shape therefore nanoparticles with different morphologies and hence the surface area tunable pore size and surface chemistry show better adsorption properties compared to their bulk counterparts 19 in our previous work titanate nanotubes h2ti3o7 were synthesized and studied for their fluoride adsorption capacities 20 it has been reported that the hydrogen titanate nanotube htnt had higher defluoridating capacity compared to the other titanate morphologies thus making it a potential defluoridating agent though the adsorbent htnt exhibited a very high fluoride adsorption capacity its high sensitivity to ph of water limited its efficiency to acidic medium hence it could not be used for removing fluoride from groundwater samples at neutral ph in the current work the authors have tried to modify the surface of htnt in order to ensure efficient removal of fluoride at neutral ph so that the material can be used for treating groundwater it has been reported that cations like la iii zr iv ce iv fe iii have high affinity for fluoride ions 21 therefore surface modification was carried out by functionalizing htnt with these cations of higher valancies in varied concentrations and combinations upon investigation of their adsorption capacities it was observed that fztnt an interesting combination of fe and zr ions loaded on the surface of htnt showed enhanced adsorption at neutral ph conditions 2 materials and method 2 1 materials used titanium dioxide anatase t i o 2 99 from alfa aesar zirconyl oxychloride octahydrate z r o c l 2 8 h 2 o and anhydrous sodium fluoride n a f from sigma aldrich ferric nitrate nonahydrate f e n o 3 3 9 h 2 o sodium hydroxide n a o h and hydrochloric acid h c l 37 were of analytical grade from merck these chemicals were used without further purification total ionic strength adjustment buffer tisab ii from thermo fisher scientific usa was used for various adsorption related experiments all the experiments were carried out using milli q water 2 2 synthesis of fztnt as reported in our earlier work 20 h 2 t i 3 o 7 nanotubes htnt were synthesized by the alkaline hydrothermal method wet chemical method was used for the surface modification of the as synthesized htnt htnt was functionalized with three different molar ratios of fe and zr fe zr 2 1 1 1 1 2 and the obtained product was termed as fztnt in a typical synthesis procedure f e n o 3 3 9 h 2 o and z r o c l 2 8 h 2 o were taken in appropriate quantity and dissolved in 100 ml of milli q water both the solutions were mixed and the net 200 ml solution was stirred magnetically for 15 min at 70 c 1 g of hydrothermally synthesized htnt was added to this solution this reaction mixture was maintained at 400 rpm and 70 c for 12 h the mixture was then filtered and washed with milli q water and dried at 80 c for 14 h the brownish yellow powder thus obtained was crushed and used for all the experiments 2 3 material characterization the x ray diffraction study was carried out using panalytical x pert pro system with copper kα as source λ 1 5406 å at room temperature the surface morphology and composition of the as synthesized sample was investigated through scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy using jeol it 300 sem edx the transmission electron microscopy tem images were obtained from hr tem 200 kv jem 2100 plus the specific surface area of the samples was measured using quantachrome autosorb iq the fourier transform infra red ftir spectra was recorded using the perkin elmer spectrum two with incident wavelengths ranging from 450cm 1 to 4000 cm 1 the zeta potential measurements were carried out using the anton paar litesizer 500 the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis was conducted using s probe tm 2803 fisons instrument with a monochromatic al kα x ray source 2 4 defluoridation studies the concentration of fluoride ions in water was measured by potentiometric method using the thermo fisher scientific make orion star a214 ion selective electrode the effect of presence of other ion in the water sample was suppressed by adding tisab ii in the ratio 1 1 v v before carrying out the measurement the optimization of the parameters majorly influencing the fluoride adsorption process were carried out through batch adsorption studies at room temperature a stock solution of 100 mg l of fluoride ions was prepared by dissolving naf in milli q water this stock solution was used for making dilute solutions of required concentrations as part of batch adsorption studies a fixed dosage of the nanoadsorbent was added to the known concentration of fluoride water the fluoride containing water along with the adsorbent was then agitated at 300 rpm on an orbital shaker for fixed period of time after which the adsorbent was separated from water through filtration and the residual fluoride concentrations were measured all the experiments were conducted in triplicates and the average value of the same has been reported the adsorption capacity of an adsorbent was expressed as the amount of fluoride adsorbed per gram of adsorbent mg g and is calculated as shown in e1 22 e1 q e c o c e v m where c o and c e are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of fluoride mg l respectively v is the volume of the solution l and m is mass of the adsorbent g the percentage adsorption of fluoride was calculated as shown in e2 22 e2 a d s o r p t i o n c o c e c o x 100 where c o and c e are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of fluoride in solution mg l respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of fztnt the x ray diffraction patterns of htnt and fztnt are shown in fig 1 a the diffraction pattern consists of peaks at 2θ degrees 9 83 24 3 28 6 48 3 which correspond to the crystallographic planes 001 110 310 and 020 respectively the most intense peak at 9 97 001 represented the layered structure of the fztnt and htnt the peaks at 24 3 28 6 and 48 3 are characteristic peaks of monoclinic structure of h2ti3o7 icsd 98 023 2518 the results are in correspondence with the earlier reports 16 18 23 24 the similar nature of the xrd patterns of the samples pre and post surface modification implies that the process of surface modification did not alter the crystal structure in fztnt the xrd patterns of the pure and the fluoride adsorbed fztnt had identical peaks fig 1b indicating that there were no structural changes in fztnt due to adsorption of fluoride icsd 98 023 2518 further the morphology of the pristine and fluoride adsorbed fztnt was investigated using sem the sem images of fztnt indicated the fibrous nature of the material the elemental composition of the sample was analyzed using the energy dispersive x ray edx spectra obtained by scanning the sample the spectra showed peaks pertaining to zr fe ti and o thus confirming elements pertaining only to fztnt the atomic percentage of each element present in the as synthesized sample was obtained by mapping the sample at five different positions the edx analysis confirmed that fztnt was composed of fe 2 09 and zr 1 86 the sem edx images of fluoride adsorbed fztnt is shown in fig 2 b it can be observed that post fluoride adsorption the peak corresponding to fluoride appears in the edx spectra thus confirming the uptake of fluoride ion by the fztnt sample the edx analysis of post fluoride adsorbed fztnt also showed that it was composed of fe 2 09 zr 1 80 and f 7 19 as the elemental composition of fztnt before and after fluoride adsorption is same it could be confirmed that there was no leaching of the metal ion from the adsorbent into the aqueous media 25 it further confirms the stability of the adsorbent the morphologies of the fztnt and htnt were further confirmed by transmission electron microscopy tem fztnt contained bundles of randomly aligned nanotubes open at both the ends as shown in the tem image fig 3 a further fig 3b illustrates the hollow nature of the multi walled nanotubes with length in the range 80 to 180 nm and average outer diameter of 9 8 nm the tem images of the parent material htnt is shown in fig 3c the nanotubular nature of fztnt indicated that the process of surface modification did not alter the morphology of the material further surface area measurements were carried out in order to check if there was any effect of surface modification on the surface area of the nanotubes the surface area of the fztnt was determined using the brunner emmett teller method of n2 adsorption the nitrogen adsorption desorption studies were carried out at 77 3 k and is shown in fig 4 a and b the n2 adsorption and desorption isotherm of both htnt and fztnt shows hysteresis loop confirming the mesoporous nature of the pores both htnt and fztnt showed type iv isotherm with specific surface area of 235 m2 g and 245 m2 g respectively therefore the process of surface modification retained not only the nanotubular morphology but also the surface area 3 2 zeta potential measurements zeta potential is a measure of the effective charge on the surface of nanoparticles this measurement was done in order to evaluate the isoelectric point iep of each of the sample the iep is the point at which the value of zeta potential is zero 20 at ph iep the surface of nanoparticles is negative whereas at ph iep the surface is positive surface modification of htnt was carried out in order to make its surface less negative more positive thereby shift the iep towards higher ph so that the material exhibits its efficiency at neutral ph enabling it to be used for defluoridation of ground water samples this was carried out using fe iii and zr iv ions in three different molar ratios of 1 2 1 1 and 2 1 respectively the zeta potential of the pre and post surface modified samples at ph ranging from 2 to 8 were measured the samples were prepared by suspending the nanoparticles in milli q water pre adjusted to ph ranging from 2 to 8 the iep of the samples were evaluated from the ph at which the zeta potential value was zero it was observed from the fig 5 a that the iep of all the three surface modified samples were higher than that of parent htnt the iep values and their shift δiep with respect to htnt are tabulated in table 1 the modified htnt with fe and zr ions in the molar ratio of 2 1 had the maximum iep shift from htnt compared to other two ratios it can also be seen in fig 5a that the zeta potential and hence the surface charge of the sample with this ratio at all ph is less negative more positive when compared to the other combinations and htnt in addition as observed from the zeta potential data table 1 the surface modified htnt with fe zr in the ratio 2 1 had the maximum shift in zeta potential values at neutral ph δzp as well therefore combination of fe and zr in molar ratio of 2 1 was expected to have a better fluoride adsorption at neutral ph 3 3 batch adsorption studies the efficiency of any adsorbent depends on its sensitivity to ph ability to quickly remove maximum fluoride ions from water with the use of minimum adsorbent it further depends on the adsorption of fluoride ion in presence of other anions and the number of times the adsorbent can be reused for the uptake of fluoride 3 3 1 effect of ph adsorption is a phenomenon which is highly sensitive to the solution ph a wide ph window is an essential characteristic of a good adsorbent the ph dependence of surface modified samples were studied by subjecting them to fluoride solutions adjusted to different ph and by measuring the corresponding adsorption capacities at each ph as expected from the zeta potential results the surface modified samples had the maximum adsorption capacity at ph less than their respective ieps fig 5b shows that the sample with fe zr in the ratio 2 1 had the higher fluoride adsorption capacity at neutral ph compared to other modified samples this could be because of the less negative surface charge of fztnt at neutral ph compared to the others table 1 thus the surface modification technique not only resulted in shifting the iep but also made the surface less negative more positive favouring fluoride adsorption towards higher ph values hence the rest of the adsorption studies were carried out with this combination further adsorption capacity of fztnt as a function of ph with two different initial fluoride concentrations 5 mg l and 10 mg l was carried out fig 6 the study indicated that fztnt had a considerable adsorption at all ph hence this material was considered to have a large ph window for fluoride adsorption 3 3 2 effect of contact time and initial fluoride ion concentration contact time is the minimum time for which the adsorbent should be in contact with fluoride water in order to obtain maximum fluoride uptake the faster the adsorbent takes up fluoride from water the more efficient the adsorbent is as shown in fig 7 a the adsorption was rapid in the initial 15 min and it equilibrated at 20 min as the adsorbent fztnt had nanotubular structure with high surface area most of the adsorption sites were readily available on the surface of the adsorbent hence within a short span of 20 min fztnt could successfully remove most of the fluoride ions from water in case of the traditional fluoride adsorbents a contact time of few to several hours are required to attain saturation adsorption 25 the fluoride adsorption capacity of any adsorbent varies with the initial fluoride ion concentration this study indicated the maximum amount of fluoride that the adsorbent would be capable of removing from water under the given conditions the variation in adsorption capacity is shown in fig 7b it was observed that with the increase in initial fluoride concentration the corresponding adsorption capacity increased without saturation this could be explained on the basis of the availability of large number of adsorption sites on fztnt for higher fluoride ion concentrations as well therefore the fztnt showed good fluoride adsorbent characteristics at both low and high concentrations of fluoride the variation of adsorption capacity as a function of initial fluoride concentration and contact time were further analysed using adsorption isotherm and kinetics models to estimate nature of adsorption and to quantify the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent 3 3 3 adsorption isotherm adsorption isotherm indicates how the adsorbed molecules atoms distribute between solid and liquid phase when the adsorption process reaches equilibrium state the adsorption data in this study was fit to two models langmuir and freundlich isotherms the langmuir adsorption isotherm is a semi empirical correlation for adsorption modelling it assumes the adsorption to be monolayer in nature and adsorbate molecule do not interact with each other 6 the linear form of the isotherm is as follows 6 e3 1 q e 1 c e q m k l 1 q m where q e is the equilibrium adsorption capacity c e is the equilibrium fluoride ion concentration q m stands for the maximum adsorption capacity and k l is the langmuir isotherm constant the value of langmuir constant and maximum adsorption capacity qm was calculated from the slope and intercept of the graph the linear plot of the adsorption data fit with langmuir model is represented in fig 8 a the maximum langmuir adsorption capacity was calculated to be 229 35 mg g at neutral ph thus the process of surface modification not only resulted in the material to possess enhanced adsorption capacity at neutral ph but also led to 4 times enhancement of the langmuir adsorption capacity compared to that of htnt this value is much higher compared to the other reported ti o based materials in defluoridation table 5 the second model was the freundlich adsorption isotherm which assumes that the surface of the adsorbent is heterogeneous and active sites and their energies distribute exponentially this isotherm can be linearly expressed as 6 e4 log q e log k f 1 n f log c e here k f mg g is the freundlich isotherm constant representing the adhesion ability of adsorbate onto the adsorbent nf represents the adsorption intensity the linear plot of the adsorption data fit with freundlich isotherm is shown in fig 8b the parameters evaluated from both the models are tabulated in table 2 since the correlation coefficient r2 of both the models was 1 χ2 test was used to identify the better model for describing the adsorption process the χ2 value was calculated as follows 6 e5 χ 2 q e e x p q e m o d e l 2 q e m o d e l according to this test the calculated value of χ2 for langmuir is 0 033 and that for freundlich isotherm is 0 142 the lower the value the better is the fit hence as the value for langmuir adsorption isotherm is lower it is considered to be the better fit therefore the adsorption is assumed to follow monolayer adsorption process as per the langmuir assumption 3 3 4 adsorption kinetics the time dependent study was analysed further with the help of adsorption kinetics models the adsorption data was tested with two adsorption kinetic models namely pseudo first order and pseudo second order model the linear form of the first order reaction is given below 6 e6 ln q e q t l n q e k 1 t where q e m g g is the equilibrium adsorption capacity and q t m g g is the adsorption capacity at time t min k1 was evaluated from the slope of the graph the plot of ln q e q t vs t is shown in fig 9 a the linear form of the pseudo second order reaction is as follows 22 e7 t q t 1 q e 2 k 2 t q e where q t m g g is the fluoride adsorption capacity of the adsorbent at any time t q e mg g is the equilibrium adsorption capacity and k2 g mg min is the second order constant the plot of t q t vs t is shown in fig 9b q e was determined experimentally from the slope of the graph and k2 was determined from the intercept of the graph it was observed that the pseudo second order model with the correlation coefficient r2 of 0 999 fitted the data well compared to the first order model the parameters calculated from both the models are tabulated in table 3 3 3 5 effect of competing ions and adsorbent dosage the adsorption of fluoride by an adsorbent is strongly effected by presence of other anions in water therefore it is necessary to evaluate the efficiency of fztnt in presence of other anions the study was conducted considering some of the common anions present in water namely cl no3 so4 2 co3 2 hco3 and hpo4 2 it was observed from fig 10 a that the presence of chloride nitrate and sulphate ions did not affect the fluoride adsorption efficiency of fztnt however the adsorption was greatly influenced by co presence of ions like co3 2 hco3 and hpo4 2 ions these ions undergo hydrolysis in aqueous solution causing increase in the concentration of oh ions in water and hence the solution ph these hydroxyl ions compete with the fluoride ions thus decreasing the adsorption capacity 21 22 26 therefore these are the major competing ions for fluoride adsorption on the surface of fztnt the optimum amount of fztnt required to bring down the fluoride levels to meet the who limit was estimated by subjecting different dosage of fztnt to fixed concentration of fluoride containing water increasing the adsorbent dosage implies the increase in the number of adsorption sites available for fluoride and hence the increase in the adsorption capacity was observed as shown in fig 10b it was interesting to observe that fztnt dosage as low as 3 g l was enough to bring down 10 mg l of fluoride to who limits 3 3 6 reusability of the adsorbent an adsorbent is cost effective and can be commercialized only if it can be reused the reusability of the exhausted adsorbent depends primarily on the ease with which the adsorption sites are regenerated the regeneration of fztnt was performed by treating the exhausted adsorbent with 0 1 m alkaline solution for 24 h followed by washing the same with 0 1 m hcl solution this regenerated adsorbent was used for the next cycle of defluoridation the procedure was repeated for four cycles the results as shown in fig 11 concluded that fztnt could be reused with 87 81 79 and 59 of fluoride removal in 0th 1st 2nd and 3rd cycle respectively 3 4 adsorption mechanism the mechanism for fluoride adsorption was proposed based on the abundant availability of mo h m ti fe zr ions on the fztnt surface the hydrolysis reactions between the mo and water results in number of hydroxyl ions on the adsorbent surface 27 these hydroxyl ions serve as the active sites for fluoride adsorption the ionic radii of f and oh ions being similar it is possible that the fluoride ions from the aqueous media are adsorbed on the surface via ion exchange process with surface oh ions 6 ion exchange is a stoichiometric process where any counter ion leaving the ion exchanger surface is replaced by an equivalent number of moles of another counter ion to maintain electro neutrality of the ion exchanger 3 in order to get an insight of fluoride adsorption mechanisms pure and fluoride adsorbed fztnt was characterized by xps and ftir the results obtained from the analysis of these two spectra were the experimental evidences of the proposed mechanism 3 4 1 xps the xps spectra of the elements present in pure and fluoride loaded fztnt are depicted in fig 12 analysis of xps spectra of pure fztnt confirmed the presence of ti fe zr and o on its surface which was indicative of the purity of fztnt the xps analysis of fluoride adsorbed fztnt helped to understand fluoride adsorption mechanism in addition to the peaks corresponding to ti fe zr and o the fluoride adsorbed fztnt showed one new peak around 686 2 ev corresponding to f1s photoelectrons proving successful uptake of fluoride ions by the adsorbent 28 the high resolution spectra of f1s are shown in fig 12e this further confirmed the results obtained from the sem edx analysis fig 2 the high resolution spectra of zr3d are shown in fig 12a the zr3d5 2 and zr3d3 2 peaks located at 184 06ev and 186 6 ev of pure fztnt corresponded to the 4 oxidation state of zr similar results were also reported by earlier researchers 28 29 post fluoride adsorption these peaks shifted to 184 31 ev and 186 48 ev respectively further the zr3d5 2 peak at 180 5 ev which indicated the presence of 2 oxidation state of zr shifted to 182 15 ev the positive shift in peaks towards higher binding energies was probably because of the formation of new zirconium based species zrf4 and zr based oxy fluorides further the effective bonding of fluoride ions with zr would cause decrease of electron density of zr leading to positive shift in binding energies of zr3d5 2 and zr3d3 2 peaks similar results were reported for various other zr based fluoride adsorbents 28 30 fig 12b reveals that fe was present in its 3 oxidation state in pure fztnt as shown by the fe2p3 2 peak positioned at 711 5 ev this was in agreement with the previously reported data 31 32 this fe2p3 2 peak underwent a positive shift in binding energy by a value of 0 34 ev post fluoride adsorption this positive shift in the fe peak suggested the successful binding of fluoride ions of with fe as shown in fig 12c the deconvolution of the high resolution spectra of ti of pure fztnt consisted of 2p3 2 peaks at 459 2 ev and 460 2 ev which corresponded to the 4 and 3 oxidation states of ti respectively similar data were reported for other ti based materials 33 35 these ti2p3 2 peaks shifted to the binding energies of 459 67 ev and 461 48 ev respectively after adsorption with 100 mg l of fluoride ions in addition there exists a ti 2p1 2 peak at 465 3 ev in pure fztnt corresponded to the 4 oxidation state of ti which shifted to 466 03 ev post fluoride adsorption the positive shifts in the binding energy of the peaks of ti confirmed its effective uptake of fluoride ions by exchanging with the hydroxyl ions the 3 oxidation state of ti further indicated the presence of oxygen vacancies in the fztnt which can also serve as active adsorption sites when an oxygen atom is lost from the surface 2e remains trapped in the vacant site vo as reported earlier 36 the ti4 ions present near the vacancy accepts one electron from the vo to form ti3 similarly zr4 transforms to zr2 the scheme of formation of ti3 is as shown below t i 4 e t i 3 fig 12d represents the deconvoluted peaks of oxygen the o1s peak was deconvoluted to two peaks at 530 65 ev and 532 8 ev which correspond to the hydroxide bonds m oh m zr fe and ti and h2o molecules respectively 33 37 27 30 post fluoride adsorption a significant decrease in intensity of these two peaks was observed the decrease in intensity was possibly due to exchange of the hydroxyl ions m oh of the absorbent surface with the fluoride ions this confirmed the fluoride adsorption by fztnt to be through ion exchange mechanism the results are in concurrence with previous reports 27 30 38 3 4 2 ftir ftir spectra of pure and fluoride adsorbed fztnt are shown in fig 13 the peaks at 3445 cm 1 and 1642 cm 1 can be attributed to the oh stretch of the hydroxyl groups adsorbed on active sites of fztnt surface and bending vibrations of hoh bond respectively 39 further the peaks around 1347 and 1563 cm 1 could be attributed to zr oh 40 vibrations the ti o and ti oh vibrations were confirmed by the presence of peaks at 928 cm 1 and 1415 cm 1 respectively 20 39 41 the peaks at 655 cm 1 and 876 cm 1 could be ascribed to the fe o and fe oh vibrations respectively 42 43 it was observed that the intensities of the m oh m fe ti zr peaks of the fluoride adsorbed fztnt were much lesser than the pure fztnt this could be due to the replacement of the surface hydroxyl groups by fluoride ions which resulted in the weakening of the m oh peaks 28 30 27 these results are thus in agreement with the xps analysis therefore combining the results of xps and ftir studies ion exchange between the oh ions and the f ions is proposed to be the most probable route for fluoride uptake by fztnt at neutral ph as shown in the equation below m o h f m f h 2 o the xps analysis of pure fztnt confirmed the presence of multivalent cations ti4 ti3 fe3 zr4 and zr3 the presence of these multivalent ions increased the number of surface hydroxyl ions on the fztnt surface which further resulted in enhanced fluoride uptake capacity by fztnt compared to htnt at neutral ph the similar xrd pattern of pure and fluoride adsorbed fztnt fig 1a b indicated that there was no change in the crystal structure of the adsorbent due to fluoride adsorption which further confirmed the ion exchange mechanism therefore the high adsorption capacity of fztnt at neutral ph was a result of the synergic effect of its tubular morphology and surface modification 3 5 practical application of fztnt in defluoridating groundwater samples anantapur district of andhra pradesh where the authors university is located has been reported to have high levels of fluoride in groundwater 20 groundwater samples were collected from areas around the university the characteristics of groundwater samples collected are shown in table 4 44 46 the fluoride ion concentration of the water samples ranged from 1 8 mg l 3 8 mg l fztnt was used to defluoridate the collected samples and a maximum of 70 fluoride removal was observed as seen in fig 14 further it can be observed that the final fluoride concentration of all the collected ground water samples could be brought down to less than 1 5 mg l which is the who standard for drinking water this was possible with the use of 0 3 g of fztnt per 100 ml of groundwater sample higher adsorbent dosage is required considering the effect of competing ions on fluoride adsorption by fztnt carbonate and bicarbonate are major competing ions for fztnt as shown in fig 11a as the concentration of carbonate and bicarbonate ions are high in the groundwater samples they compete with fluoride ions for the available adsorbent sites on fztnt thus requiring an adsorbent dosage of 3 g l for groundwater samples it is noteworthy that the parent material htnt had zero fluoride adsorption towards neutral ph and hence could not be used for groundwater sample whereas fztnt proved to be a potential material for defluoridating ground water samples 3 6 comparison of fztnt with other ti o based adsorbents the langmuir adsorption capacity of fztnt was compared with the other ti o based adsorbents reported in literature so far table 5 the attractive advantages of fztnt over the other ti o based materials reported till date are i higher adsorption capacity at neutral ph ii applicability to ground water samples iii rapid adsorption and iv reusability 4 conclusion fztnt a product of surface modification of htnt with fe iii and zr iv ions was a potential defluoridating agent compared to htnt the process of surface functionalization transformed htnt into a remarkable fluoride adsorbent fztnt by shifting its surface charge to less negative more positive while retaining the positive traits of htnt that is the nanotubular morphology and the high surface area moreover it has increased the availability of oh ions on the surface of fztnt as a result fztnt exhibited high fluoride adsorption capability of 229 35 mg g which was 4 times higher than that of htnt this adsorption capacity was possessed by fztnt at neutral ph at which htnt had negligible adsorption this made fztnt a superior adsorbent compared to htnt and other reported ti o based materials not only did it work with synthetic water samples but also with groundwater samples collected from villages of anantapur district of andhra pradesh where the university is situated fztnt dosage as low as 3 g l was able to reduce the high fluoride concentrations to who limits within a short span of time thus the results of the present study concluded that fztnt was a potential adsorbent for removing hazardous contaminant fluoride from potable

13859,the current study deals with fe iii and zr iv incorporated titanate nanotubes fztnt for efficient removal of fluoride from potable water the surface modification of hydrogen titanate nanotubes htnt with fe and zr ions not only transformed the adsorbent surface suitable for fluoride adsorption at neutral ph but also enhanced its fluoride adsorption capacity the surface charge of the adsorbent was estimated by zeta potential measurements the other physical and chemical properties of the fztnt were examined using bet ftir and xps fztnt had specific surface area of 245 m2 g the crystal structure morphology and chemical characterizations were carried out using the xrd tem and sem edx respectively the fluoride adsorption data followed the langmuir isotherm and the langmuir adsorption capacity was estimated to be 229 3 mg g at neutral ph contact time of 2 h and adsorbent dosage of 1 g l fztnt exhibited superior adsorption properties compared to htnt which had negligible adsorption at ph 7 0 01 adsorption of fluoride followed ion exchange mechanism in addition fztnt possessed good adsorption kinetics and could be reused for three cycles without significant drop in its adsorption capacity which allowed fztnt to be used for defluoridating groundwater to who limits 1 5 mg l keywords fztnt adsorption surface modification surface charge iep neutral ph defluoridation 1 introduction presence of contaminants in water is a global problem fluoride is one such hazardous contaminant serious environmental issues and undesirable impacts on human health caused by high levels of fluoride in water necessitates defluoridation of water according to who 1 presence of fluoride in water in concentration above 1 5 mg l and as per bureau of indian standards bis 2 concentrations of fluoride above 1 mg l is hazardous for the human health in multiple ways 3 4 hence its removal from water is the need of the hour among the various techniques of fluoride removal reported in literature adsorption is one of the efficient ways of defluoridation 5 6 many researchers have also used different absorbents for removal of other contaminants such as heavy metal ions dyes organic pollutants etc 7 10 the effectiveness of the technique purely depends on the adsorbent properties in the recent years tio2 and its derivative titanates have emerged as potential materials they have found remarkable applications in varied fields of photocatalysis 11 solar cells 12 water splitting 13 14 lithium ion batteries 15 dye degradation 16 17 sensing applications 18 and many more in addition using these materials for water remediation became research interest of many researchers adsorption being a surface phenomenon the surface area of the adsorbents highly influences the adsorption process surface area is affected not only by the size of the particles but also by their shape therefore nanoparticles with different morphologies and hence the surface area tunable pore size and surface chemistry show better adsorption properties compared to their bulk counterparts 19 in our previous work titanate nanotubes h2ti3o7 were synthesized and studied for their fluoride adsorption capacities 20 it has been reported that the hydrogen titanate nanotube htnt had higher defluoridating capacity compared to the other titanate morphologies thus making it a potential defluoridating agent though the adsorbent htnt exhibited a very high fluoride adsorption capacity its high sensitivity to ph of water limited its efficiency to acidic medium hence it could not be used for removing fluoride from groundwater samples at neutral ph in the current work the authors have tried to modify the surface of htnt in order to ensure efficient removal of fluoride at neutral ph so that the material can be used for treating groundwater it has been reported that cations like la iii zr iv ce iv fe iii have high affinity for fluoride ions 21 therefore surface modification was carried out by functionalizing htnt with these cations of higher valancies in varied concentrations and combinations upon investigation of their adsorption capacities it was observed that fztnt an interesting combination of fe and zr ions loaded on the surface of htnt showed enhanced adsorption at neutral ph conditions 2 materials and method 2 1 materials used titanium dioxide anatase t i o 2 99 from alfa aesar zirconyl oxychloride octahydrate z r o c l 2 8 h 2 o and anhydrous sodium fluoride n a f from sigma aldrich ferric nitrate nonahydrate f e n o 3 3 9 h 2 o sodium hydroxide n a o h and hydrochloric acid h c l 37 were of analytical grade from merck these chemicals were used without further purification total ionic strength adjustment buffer tisab ii from thermo fisher scientific usa was used for various adsorption related experiments all the experiments were carried out using milli q water 2 2 synthesis of fztnt as reported in our earlier work 20 h 2 t i 3 o 7 nanotubes htnt were synthesized by the alkaline hydrothermal method wet chemical method was used for the surface modification of the as synthesized htnt htnt was functionalized with three different molar ratios of fe and zr fe zr 2 1 1 1 1 2 and the obtained product was termed as fztnt in a typical synthesis procedure f e n o 3 3 9 h 2 o and z r o c l 2 8 h 2 o were taken in appropriate quantity and dissolved in 100 ml of milli q water both the solutions were mixed and the net 200 ml solution was stirred magnetically for 15 min at 70 c 1 g of hydrothermally synthesized htnt was added to this solution this reaction mixture was maintained at 400 rpm and 70 c for 12 h the mixture was then filtered and washed with milli q water and dried at 80 c for 14 h the brownish yellow powder thus obtained was crushed and used for all the experiments 2 3 material characterization the x ray diffraction study was carried out using panalytical x pert pro system with copper kα as source λ 1 5406 å at room temperature the surface morphology and composition of the as synthesized sample was investigated through scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy using jeol it 300 sem edx the transmission electron microscopy tem images were obtained from hr tem 200 kv jem 2100 plus the specific surface area of the samples was measured using quantachrome autosorb iq the fourier transform infra red ftir spectra was recorded using the perkin elmer spectrum two with incident wavelengths ranging from 450cm 1 to 4000 cm 1 the zeta potential measurements were carried out using the anton paar litesizer 500 the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis was conducted using s probe tm 2803 fisons instrument with a monochromatic al kα x ray source 2 4 defluoridation studies the concentration of fluoride ions in water was measured by potentiometric method using the thermo fisher scientific make orion star a214 ion selective electrode the effect of presence of other ion in the water sample was suppressed by adding tisab ii in the ratio 1 1 v v before carrying out the measurement the optimization of the parameters majorly influencing the fluoride adsorption process were carried out through batch adsorption studies at room temperature a stock solution of 100 mg l of fluoride ions was prepared by dissolving naf in milli q water this stock solution was used for making dilute solutions of required concentrations as part of batch adsorption studies a fixed dosage of the nanoadsorbent was added to the known concentration of fluoride water the fluoride containing water along with the adsorbent was then agitated at 300 rpm on an orbital shaker for fixed period of time after which the adsorbent was separated from water through filtration and the residual fluoride concentrations were measured all the experiments were conducted in triplicates and the average value of the same has been reported the adsorption capacity of an adsorbent was expressed as the amount of fluoride adsorbed per gram of adsorbent mg g and is calculated as shown in e1 22 e1 q e c o c e v m where c o and c e are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of fluoride mg l respectively v is the volume of the solution l and m is mass of the adsorbent g the percentage adsorption of fluoride was calculated as shown in e2 22 e2 a d s o r p t i o n c o c e c o x 100 where c o and c e are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of fluoride in solution mg l respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of fztnt the x ray diffraction patterns of htnt and fztnt are shown in fig 1 a the diffraction pattern consists of peaks at 2θ degrees 9 83 24 3 28 6 48 3 which correspond to the crystallographic planes 001 110 310 and 020 respectively the most intense peak at 9 97 001 represented the layered structure of the fztnt and htnt the peaks at 24 3 28 6 and 48 3 are characteristic peaks of monoclinic structure of h2ti3o7 icsd 98 023 2518 the results are in correspondence with the earlier reports 16 18 23 24 the similar nature of the xrd patterns of the samples pre and post surface modification implies that the process of surface modification did not alter the crystal structure in fztnt the xrd patterns of the pure and the fluoride adsorbed fztnt had identical peaks fig 1b indicating that there were no structural changes in fztnt due to adsorption of fluoride icsd 98 023 2518 further the morphology of the pristine and fluoride adsorbed fztnt was investigated using sem the sem images of fztnt indicated the fibrous nature of the material the elemental composition of the sample was analyzed using the energy dispersive x ray edx spectra obtained by scanning the sample the spectra showed peaks pertaining to zr fe ti and o thus confirming elements pertaining only to fztnt the atomic percentage of each element present in the as synthesized sample was obtained by mapping the sample at five different positions the edx analysis confirmed that fztnt was composed of fe 2 09 and zr 1 86 the sem edx images of fluoride adsorbed fztnt is shown in fig 2 b it can be observed that post fluoride adsorption the peak corresponding to fluoride appears in the edx spectra thus confirming the uptake of fluoride ion by the fztnt sample the edx analysis of post fluoride adsorbed fztnt also showed that it was composed of fe 2 09 zr 1 80 and f 7 19 as the elemental composition of fztnt before and after fluoride adsorption is same it could be confirmed that there was no leaching of the metal ion from the adsorbent into the aqueous media 25 it further confirms the stability of the adsorbent the morphologies of the fztnt and htnt were further confirmed by transmission electron microscopy tem fztnt contained bundles of randomly aligned nanotubes open at both the ends as shown in the tem image fig 3 a further fig 3b illustrates the hollow nature of the multi walled nanotubes with length in the range 80 to 180 nm and average outer diameter of 9 8 nm the tem images of the parent material htnt is shown in fig 3c the nanotubular nature of fztnt indicated that the process of surface modification did not alter the morphology of the material further surface area measurements were carried out in order to check if there was any effect of surface modification on the surface area of the nanotubes the surface area of the fztnt was determined using the brunner emmett teller method of n2 adsorption the nitrogen adsorption desorption studies were carried out at 77 3 k and is shown in fig 4 a and b the n2 adsorption and desorption isotherm of both htnt and fztnt shows hysteresis loop confirming the mesoporous nature of the pores both htnt and fztnt showed type iv isotherm with specific surface area of 235 m2 g and 245 m2 g respectively therefore the process of surface modification retained not only the nanotubular morphology but also the surface area 3 2 zeta potential measurements zeta potential is a measure of the effective charge on the surface of nanoparticles this measurement was done in order to evaluate the isoelectric point iep of each of the sample the iep is the point at which the value of zeta potential is zero 20 at ph iep the surface of nanoparticles is negative whereas at ph iep the surface is positive surface modification of htnt was carried out in order to make its surface less negative more positive thereby shift the iep towards higher ph so that the material exhibits its efficiency at neutral ph enabling it to be used for defluoridation of ground water samples this was carried out using fe iii and zr iv ions in three different molar ratios of 1 2 1 1 and 2 1 respectively the zeta potential of the pre and post surface modified samples at ph ranging from 2 to 8 were measured the samples were prepared by suspending the nanoparticles in milli q water pre adjusted to ph ranging from 2 to 8 the iep of the samples were evaluated from the ph at which the zeta potential value was zero it was observed from the fig 5 a that the iep of all the three surface modified samples were higher than that of parent htnt the iep values and their shift δiep with respect to htnt are tabulated in table 1 the modified htnt with fe and zr ions in the molar ratio of 2 1 had the maximum iep shift from htnt compared to other two ratios it can also be seen in fig 5a that the zeta potential and hence the surface charge of the sample with this ratio at all ph is less negative more positive when compared to the other combinations and htnt in addition as observed from the zeta potential data table 1 the surface modified htnt with fe zr in the ratio 2 1 had the maximum shift in zeta potential values at neutral ph δzp as well therefore combination of fe and zr in molar ratio of 2 1 was expected to have a better fluoride adsorption at neutral ph 3 3 batch adsorption studies the efficiency of any adsorbent depends on its sensitivity to ph ability to quickly remove maximum fluoride ions from water with the use of minimum adsorbent it further depends on the adsorption of fluoride ion in presence of other anions and the number of times the adsorbent can be reused for the uptake of fluoride 3 3 1 effect of ph adsorption is a phenomenon which is highly sensitive to the solution ph a wide ph window is an essential characteristic of a good adsorbent the ph dependence of surface modified samples were studied by subjecting them to fluoride solutions adjusted to different ph and by measuring the corresponding adsorption capacities at each ph as expected from the zeta potential results the surface modified samples had the maximum adsorption capacity at ph less than their respective ieps fig 5b shows that the sample with fe zr in the ratio 2 1 had the higher fluoride adsorption capacity at neutral ph compared to other modified samples this could be because of the less negative surface charge of fztnt at neutral ph compared to the others table 1 thus the surface modification technique not only resulted in shifting the iep but also made the surface less negative more positive favouring fluoride adsorption towards higher ph values hence the rest of the adsorption studies were carried out with this combination further adsorption capacity of fztnt as a function of ph with two different initial fluoride concentrations 5 mg l and 10 mg l was carried out fig 6 the study indicated that fztnt had a considerable adsorption at all ph hence this material was considered to have a large ph window for fluoride adsorption 3 3 2 effect of contact time and initial fluoride ion concentration contact time is the minimum time for which the adsorbent should be in contact with fluoride water in order to obtain maximum fluoride uptake the faster the adsorbent takes up fluoride from water the more efficient the adsorbent is as shown in fig 7 a the adsorption was rapid in the initial 15 min and it equilibrated at 20 min as the adsorbent fztnt had nanotubular structure with high surface area most of the adsorption sites were readily available on the surface of the adsorbent hence within a short span of 20 min fztnt could successfully remove most of the fluoride ions from water in case of the traditional fluoride adsorbents a contact time of few to several hours are required to attain saturation adsorption 25 the fluoride adsorption capacity of any adsorbent varies with the initial fluoride ion concentration this study indicated the maximum amount of fluoride that the adsorbent would be capable of removing from water under the given conditions the variation in adsorption capacity is shown in fig 7b it was observed that with the increase in initial fluoride concentration the corresponding adsorption capacity increased without saturation this could be explained on the basis of the availability of large number of adsorption sites on fztnt for higher fluoride ion concentrations as well therefore the fztnt showed good fluoride adsorbent characteristics at both low and high concentrations of fluoride the variation of adsorption capacity as a function of initial fluoride concentration and contact time were further analysed using adsorption isotherm and kinetics models to estimate nature of adsorption and to quantify the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent 3 3 3 adsorption isotherm adsorption isotherm indicates how the adsorbed molecules atoms distribute between solid and liquid phase when the adsorption process reaches equilibrium state the adsorption data in this study was fit to two models langmuir and freundlich isotherms the langmuir adsorption isotherm is a semi empirical correlation for adsorption modelling it assumes the adsorption to be monolayer in nature and adsorbate molecule do not interact with each other 6 the linear form of the isotherm is as follows 6 e3 1 q e 1 c e q m k l 1 q m where q e is the equilibrium adsorption capacity c e is the equilibrium fluoride ion concentration q m stands for the maximum adsorption capacity and k l is the langmuir isotherm constant the value of langmuir constant and maximum adsorption capacity qm was calculated from the slope and intercept of the graph the linear plot of the adsorption data fit with langmuir model is represented in fig 8 a the maximum langmuir adsorption capacity was calculated to be 229 35 mg g at neutral ph thus the process of surface modification not only resulted in the material to possess enhanced adsorption capacity at neutral ph but also led to 4 times enhancement of the langmuir adsorption capacity compared to that of htnt this value is much higher compared to the other reported ti o based materials in defluoridation table 5 the second model was the freundlich adsorption isotherm which assumes that the surface of the adsorbent is heterogeneous and active sites and their energies distribute exponentially this isotherm can be linearly expressed as 6 e4 log q e log k f 1 n f log c e here k f mg g is the freundlich isotherm constant representing the adhesion ability of adsorbate onto the adsorbent nf represents the adsorption intensity the linear plot of the adsorption data fit with freundlich isotherm is shown in fig 8b the parameters evaluated from both the models are tabulated in table 2 since the correlation coefficient r2 of both the models was 1 χ2 test was used to identify the better model for describing the adsorption process the χ2 value was calculated as follows 6 e5 χ 2 q e e x p q e m o d e l 2 q e m o d e l according to this test the calculated value of χ2 for langmuir is 0 033 and that for freundlich isotherm is 0 142 the lower the value the better is the fit hence as the value for langmuir adsorption isotherm is lower it is considered to be the better fit therefore the adsorption is assumed to follow monolayer adsorption process as per the langmuir assumption 3 3 4 adsorption kinetics the time dependent study was analysed further with the help of adsorption kinetics models the adsorption data was tested with two adsorption kinetic models namely pseudo first order and pseudo second order model the linear form of the first order reaction is given below 6 e6 ln q e q t l n q e k 1 t where q e m g g is the equilibrium adsorption capacity and q t m g g is the adsorption capacity at time t min k1 was evaluated from the slope of the graph the plot of ln q e q t vs t is shown in fig 9 a the linear form of the pseudo second order reaction is as follows 22 e7 t q t 1 q e 2 k 2 t q e where q t m g g is the fluoride adsorption capacity of the adsorbent at any time t q e mg g is the equilibrium adsorption capacity and k2 g mg min is the second order constant the plot of t q t vs t is shown in fig 9b q e was determined experimentally from the slope of the graph and k2 was determined from the intercept of the graph it was observed that the pseudo second order model with the correlation coefficient r2 of 0 999 fitted the data well compared to the first order model the parameters calculated from both the models are tabulated in table 3 3 3 5 effect of competing ions and adsorbent dosage the adsorption of fluoride by an adsorbent is strongly effected by presence of other anions in water therefore it is necessary to evaluate the efficiency of fztnt in presence of other anions the study was conducted considering some of the common anions present in water namely cl no3 so4 2 co3 2 hco3 and hpo4 2 it was observed from fig 10 a that the presence of chloride nitrate and sulphate ions did not affect the fluoride adsorption efficiency of fztnt however the adsorption was greatly influenced by co presence of ions like co3 2 hco3 and hpo4 2 ions these ions undergo hydrolysis in aqueous solution causing increase in the concentration of oh ions in water and hence the solution ph these hydroxyl ions compete with the fluoride ions thus decreasing the adsorption capacity 21 22 26 therefore these are the major competing ions for fluoride adsorption on the surface of fztnt the optimum amount of fztnt required to bring down the fluoride levels to meet the who limit was estimated by subjecting different dosage of fztnt to fixed concentration of fluoride containing water increasing the adsorbent dosage implies the increase in the number of adsorption sites available for fluoride and hence the increase in the adsorption capacity was observed as shown in fig 10b it was interesting to observe that fztnt dosage as low as 3 g l was enough to bring down 10 mg l of fluoride to who limits 3 3 6 reusability of the adsorbent an adsorbent is cost effective and can be commercialized only if it can be reused the reusability of the exhausted adsorbent depends primarily on the ease with which the adsorption sites are regenerated the regeneration of fztnt was performed by treating the exhausted adsorbent with 0 1 m alkaline solution for 24 h followed by washing the same with 0 1 m hcl solution this regenerated adsorbent was used for the next cycle of defluoridation the procedure was repeated for four cycles the results as shown in fig 11 concluded that fztnt could be reused with 87 81 79 and 59 of fluoride removal in 0th 1st 2nd and 3rd cycle respectively 3 4 adsorption mechanism the mechanism for fluoride adsorption was proposed based on the abundant availability of mo h m ti fe zr ions on the fztnt surface the hydrolysis reactions between the mo and water results in number of hydroxyl ions on the adsorbent surface 27 these hydroxyl ions serve as the active sites for fluoride adsorption the ionic radii of f and oh ions being similar it is possible that the fluoride ions from the aqueous media are adsorbed on the surface via ion exchange process with surface oh ions 6 ion exchange is a stoichiometric process where any counter ion leaving the ion exchanger surface is replaced by an equivalent number of moles of another counter ion to maintain electro neutrality of the ion exchanger 3 in order to get an insight of fluoride adsorption mechanisms pure and fluoride adsorbed fztnt was characterized by xps and ftir the results obtained from the analysis of these two spectra were the experimental evidences of the proposed mechanism 3 4 1 xps the xps spectra of the elements present in pure and fluoride loaded fztnt are depicted in fig 12 analysis of xps spectra of pure fztnt confirmed the presence of ti fe zr and o on its surface which was indicative of the purity of fztnt the xps analysis of fluoride adsorbed fztnt helped to understand fluoride adsorption mechanism in addition to the peaks corresponding to ti fe zr and o the fluoride adsorbed fztnt showed one new peak around 686 2 ev corresponding to f1s photoelectrons proving successful uptake of fluoride ions by the adsorbent 28 the high resolution spectra of f1s are shown in fig 12e this further confirmed the results obtained from the sem edx analysis fig 2 the high resolution spectra of zr3d are shown in fig 12a the zr3d5 2 and zr3d3 2 peaks located at 184 06ev and 186 6 ev of pure fztnt corresponded to the 4 oxidation state of zr similar results were also reported by earlier researchers 28 29 post fluoride adsorption these peaks shifted to 184 31 ev and 186 48 ev respectively further the zr3d5 2 peak at 180 5 ev which indicated the presence of 2 oxidation state of zr shifted to 182 15 ev the positive shift in peaks towards higher binding energies was probably because of the formation of new zirconium based species zrf4 and zr based oxy fluorides further the effective bonding of fluoride ions with zr would cause decrease of electron density of zr leading to positive shift in binding energies of zr3d5 2 and zr3d3 2 peaks similar results were reported for various other zr based fluoride adsorbents 28 30 fig 12b reveals that fe was present in its 3 oxidation state in pure fztnt as shown by the fe2p3 2 peak positioned at 711 5 ev this was in agreement with the previously reported data 31 32 this fe2p3 2 peak underwent a positive shift in binding energy by a value of 0 34 ev post fluoride adsorption this positive shift in the fe peak suggested the successful binding of fluoride ions of with fe as shown in fig 12c the deconvolution of the high resolution spectra of ti of pure fztnt consisted of 2p3 2 peaks at 459 2 ev and 460 2 ev which corresponded to the 4 and 3 oxidation states of ti respectively similar data were reported for other ti based materials 33 35 these ti2p3 2 peaks shifted to the binding energies of 459 67 ev and 461 48 ev respectively after adsorption with 100 mg l of fluoride ions in addition there exists a ti 2p1 2 peak at 465 3 ev in pure fztnt corresponded to the 4 oxidation state of ti which shifted to 466 03 ev post fluoride adsorption the positive shifts in the binding energy of the peaks of ti confirmed its effective uptake of fluoride ions by exchanging with the hydroxyl ions the 3 oxidation state of ti further indicated the presence of oxygen vacancies in the fztnt which can also serve as active adsorption sites when an oxygen atom is lost from the surface 2e remains trapped in the vacant site vo as reported earlier 36 the ti4 ions present near the vacancy accepts one electron from the vo to form ti3 similarly zr4 transforms to zr2 the scheme of formation of ti3 is as shown below t i 4 e t i 3 fig 12d represents the deconvoluted peaks of oxygen the o1s peak was deconvoluted to two peaks at 530 65 ev and 532 8 ev which correspond to the hydroxide bonds m oh m zr fe and ti and h2o molecules respectively 33 37 27 30 post fluoride adsorption a significant decrease in intensity of these two peaks was observed the decrease in intensity was possibly due to exchange of the hydroxyl ions m oh of the absorbent surface with the fluoride ions this confirmed the fluoride adsorption by fztnt to be through ion exchange mechanism the results are in concurrence with previous reports 27 30 38 3 4 2 ftir ftir spectra of pure and fluoride adsorbed fztnt are shown in fig 13 the peaks at 3445 cm 1 and 1642 cm 1 can be attributed to the oh stretch of the hydroxyl groups adsorbed on active sites of fztnt surface and bending vibrations of hoh bond respectively 39 further the peaks around 1347 and 1563 cm 1 could be attributed to zr oh 40 vibrations the ti o and ti oh vibrations were confirmed by the presence of peaks at 928 cm 1 and 1415 cm 1 respectively 20 39 41 the peaks at 655 cm 1 and 876 cm 1 could be ascribed to the fe o and fe oh vibrations respectively 42 43 it was observed that the intensities of the m oh m fe ti zr peaks of the fluoride adsorbed fztnt were much lesser than the pure fztnt this could be due to the replacement of the surface hydroxyl groups by fluoride ions which resulted in the weakening of the m oh peaks 28 30 27 these results are thus in agreement with the xps analysis therefore combining the results of xps and ftir studies ion exchange between the oh ions and the f ions is proposed to be the most probable route for fluoride uptake by fztnt at neutral ph as shown in the equation below m o h f m f h 2 o the xps analysis of pure fztnt confirmed the presence of multivalent cations ti4 ti3 fe3 zr4 and zr3 the presence of these multivalent ions increased the number of surface hydroxyl ions on the fztnt surface which further resulted in enhanced fluoride uptake capacity by fztnt compared to htnt at neutral ph the similar xrd pattern of pure and fluoride adsorbed fztnt fig 1a b indicated that there was no change in the crystal structure of the adsorbent due to fluoride adsorption which further confirmed the ion exchange mechanism therefore the high adsorption capacity of fztnt at neutral ph was a result of the synergic effect of its tubular morphology and surface modification 3 5 practical application of fztnt in defluoridating groundwater samples anantapur district of andhra pradesh where the authors university is located has been reported to have high levels of fluoride in groundwater 20 groundwater samples were collected from areas around the university the characteristics of groundwater samples collected are shown in table 4 44 46 the fluoride ion concentration of the water samples ranged from 1 8 mg l 3 8 mg l fztnt was used to defluoridate the collected samples and a maximum of 70 fluoride removal was observed as seen in fig 14 further it can be observed that the final fluoride concentration of all the collected ground water samples could be brought down to less than 1 5 mg l which is the who standard for drinking water this was possible with the use of 0 3 g of fztnt per 100 ml of groundwater sample higher adsorbent dosage is required considering the effect of competing ions on fluoride adsorption by fztnt carbonate and bicarbonate are major competing ions for fztnt as shown in fig 11a as the concentration of carbonate and bicarbonate ions are high in the groundwater samples they compete with fluoride ions for the available adsorbent sites on fztnt thus requiring an adsorbent dosage of 3 g l for groundwater samples it is noteworthy that the parent material htnt had zero fluoride adsorption towards neutral ph and hence could not be used for groundwater sample whereas fztnt proved to be a potential material for defluoridating ground water samples 3 6 comparison of fztnt with other ti o based adsorbents the langmuir adsorption capacity of fztnt was compared with the other ti o based adsorbents reported in literature so far table 5 the attractive advantages of fztnt over the other ti o based materials reported till date are i higher adsorption capacity at neutral ph ii applicability to ground water samples iii rapid adsorption and iv reusability 4 conclusion fztnt a product of surface modification of htnt with fe iii and zr iv ions was a potential defluoridating agent compared to htnt the process of surface functionalization transformed htnt into a remarkable fluoride adsorbent fztnt by shifting its surface charge to less negative more positive while retaining the positive traits of htnt that is the nanotubular morphology and the high surface area moreover it has increased the availability of oh ions on the surface of fztnt as a result fztnt exhibited high fluoride adsorption capability of 229 35 mg g which was 4 times higher than that of htnt this adsorption capacity was possessed by fztnt at neutral ph at which htnt had negligible adsorption this made fztnt a superior adsorbent compared to htnt and other reported ti o based materials not only did it work with synthetic water samples but also with groundwater samples collected from villages of anantapur district of andhra pradesh where the university is situated fztnt dosage as low as 3 g l was able to reduce the high fluoride concentrations to who limits within a short span of time thus the results of the present study concluded that fztnt was a potential adsorbent for removing hazardous contaminant fluoride from potable
