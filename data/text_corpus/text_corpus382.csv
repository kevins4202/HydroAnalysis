1910,the kozeny carman k c equation based on poiseuille s law is an efficient theoretical equation predicting hydraulic conductivity some modified k c equations were proposed focusing on obtaining the uncertainty parameters in the original k c equation however assumptions of some modified k c equations are inconsistent with poiseuille s law this study proposes a new modified k c equation considering the derivation principle of the original k c equation by applying poiseuille s law in porous media the concept of 2d porosity ε and a correction coefficient for permeation f are presented during the derivation process each section s void distribution is assumed to be similar and void pipes in various directions share similar characteristics because the effective porosity ne is approximately equal to ε only when the change in the cross section in porous media is small the parameters in the new modified k c equation include specific surface area s 0 tortuosity 1 cosθ and ne the prediction formulas of ne are presented according to the soil mineral and bound water features the prediction formulas for s 0 and 1 cosθ are deduced and verified by comparing them with established formulas proposed by other researchers and experimental data the new modified k c equation is adequate for predicting hydraulic conductivity for clay and sand by comparing it with the

property of soils which is a significant factor influencing soil deformation zeng et al 2022 wang et al 2019 2023 well pumping wu et al 2016 xu et al 2019 internal erosion yang et al 2019 and soil contamination hu et al 2021 2022 soil permeability is often a major factor leading to engineering or geological disasters such as land subsidence wang and xu 2022 xu et al 2016 slope failure song and tan 2020 jiang and tan 2021 shallow gas leakage xu et al 2017 2018 tunnel leakage wu et al 2020 et al hydraulic conductivity is a crucial parameter in expressing soil permeability which can be evaluated by many investigation methods such as laboratory permeability masaoka and kosugi 2018 field pumping wu et al 2017 however applying these investigation methods is frequently time consuming and involves uncertainties rabouli et al 2021 singh and sharma 2023 it is a feasible approach to predict hydraulic conductivity by obtaining the relationship between porosity and hydraulic conductivity nomura et al 2018 the kozeny carman equation k c equation carman 1939 nomura et al 2018 is an applicable theoretical equation to get hydraulic conductivity values because of its simplicity and capability ren et al 2016 singh and sharma 2023 the k c equation uses porosity n specific surface s 0 void shape constant k 0 and tortuosity le l to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of porous media due to the difficulty of obtaining some parameters in the k c equation many modifications were proposed some researchers proposed empirical values of the parameters to fit specific cases for example yin et al 2022 and mauret renaud 1997 presented empirical formulas to estimate k 0 and le l nomura et al 2018 presented a formula using particle distribution to estimate s 0 ren et al 2016 presented an empirical formula to correct the value of n they all simplified the obtainment of those parameters under some particular conditions others proposed theoretical expressions for specific parameters based on various derivation hypotheses however some derivation hypotheses did not conform to poiseuille s law the derivation principle of the original k c equation carman 1939 for example the derivation of s 0 and k 0 from xu yu 2008 and yu cheng 2002 assumed that soil pores could be regarded as a bundle of tortuous capillary tubes and poiseuille s law for circle pipes was used directly however poiseuille s law is obtained based on the premise that the fluid close to the tube wall is stationary and the juxtaposed hypothetical pipes cannot satisfy this due to the absence of a substantial pipe wall in the center of a void besides safari et al 2021 used a theoretical formula of poiseuille s law for ellipse section voids to obtain k 0 and assumed that the particles are ellipses or ellipsoids however the ellipse voids and particles cannot exist simultaneously those studies ignored the basics of poiseuille s law for porous media currently the derivation principle of the original k c equation is seldom mentioned and discussed during its modification process this paper presents a new modified k c equation considering the derivation principle of the original k c equation first the modified k c equation is derived based on poiseuille s law where new parameters considering the flow section in voids are discussed then the k c equation s implicit conditions are discussed and the simplified equation and estimation formulas for s 0 ne and le l are presented finally the new modified k c equation is verified 2 theory derivation of the modified k c equation 2 1 derivation of the original k c equation poiseuille s law as illustrated in eq 1 is the theoretical basis of the original k c equation carman 1939 which was initially used to estimate the pressure loss for laminar newtonian fluids along a circle section straight pipe 1 u m 2 k 0 δ p μ l e where u is the actual average liquid velocity m is the hydraulic radius equal to the ratio of pipe cross sectional area to section perimeter length for a circular pipe the section perimeter length is 2πr the cross sectional area is πr 2 where r is pipe radius δp is the pressure difference between the soil which is determined as γw h 1 h 2 p 1 p 2 where γw is the unit weight of water h 1 and p 1 are the height relative to a certain reference plane and pressure of one point on upper reaches section respectively and h 2 and p 2 are the height relative to same reference plane and pressure of one point of lower reaches section respectively μ is the fluid s dynamic viscosity le is the actual seepage distance considering the tortuous seepage path k 0 is the shape constant considering the cross section shape of voids a series of values of k 0 for certain sections are listed in table 1 carman 1939 according to the relationship between seepage velocity and actual average flow velocity based on the equal flow s law eq 2 the k c equation is presented in eq 3 2 u l e v ln 3 μ k γ w 1 k s 0 2 n 3 1 n 2 carman 1939 simplified m as the ratio of the pipe volume and the wetted surface area v s which is equivalent to the section area to perimeter ratio for a constant section pipe v is the soil void volume s is the void surface area s s 0 1 n v s 0 is the specific surface of the soil particles n is porosity l is the length of soils along the equivalent seepage direction and v is the seepage velocity k is the hydraulic conductivity μk γw is the hydraulic coefficient defined by carman 1939 and k is the k c constant defined by carman 1939 k k 0 le l 2 the value of k 0 corresponds to the cross section shapes carman 1939 carman declared that the voids in sandy soils were typically elongated and consequently k 0 should be close to 2 5 referring to table 1 however the scanning electron microscopy images of clays cotecchia et al 2016 golsanami et al 2022 illustrate that the small voids in clays are closer to circles and k 0 with a value of 2 0 should be more suitable based on k 0 2 5 and the experimental value of le l 20 5 carman 1997 carman 1939 determined an empirical value of k as 5 moreover carman 1939 assumed that the particles surface area equals the surface of voids carman declared that the effective porosity ne should be used to consider the influence of bound water in clays ne indicates the proportion of the void filled with flowable free water the volume of soil particles with little bound water is 1 n in the soil of unit volume and the surface area s per unit volume of soil equals s 0 1 n if the soil particle includes the bound water and closed pores s should be s 0 1 ne here s 0 is the specific surface of particles with bound water 2 2 modified k c equation considering poiseuille s law during carman s derivation process the cross sectional area for flow in the soil section of area a was na and n was the volume proportion of the void in the soil this paper defines 2d porosity which is labeled as ε as the void s section area proportion of cross section the difference between n and ε can be explained using an element with a unit thickness fig 1 the element s overhead view size is l l and n is al bl ab l 2 while ε in the section a a should be a l since a is not equal to b considering the soil s anisotropy the value of n is not equal to ε furthermore if the liquid flows along the vertical direction in fig 1 the abrupt change at the cross will cause a horizontal flow velocity component indicating that the traditional poiseuille s law no longer fits this result explains why the k c equation failed to predict the hydraulic conductivities of pipes with abrupt cross sections as valdes parada et al 2009 presented due to the heterogeneity of soils n or ε at one point differ the representative elementary volume rev is the minimal volume of soils when the specimens of this volume around a specific point own stable properties he et al 2022 and the average values of n or ε in rev will be stable consequently the modified k c equation should be deducted in an element larger than rev referring to poiseuille s law if a liquid with a volume of va flows through a soil element larger than rev the pressure loss dp in this element is shown in eq 4 4 d p f μ u k 0 d l e m 2 where f is the correction coefficient for permeation considering the difference between the constant section pipe and the changed section void pipes in the element which carman ignored dle is the actual length fluid goes through inside the element considering the tortuous void according to the discussion in section 2 1 k 0 2 0 for clays and k 0 2 5 for sand are more reasonable according to the law of equal flow rate eq 5 can be obtained 5 u va ε a v ε according to carman s 1939 definition of dle eq 6 is acquired 6 d l e d l 1 c o s θ where θ is the included angle between the void pipe direction dl is the element s length according to experimental results of carman 1939 θ was set as 45 in the original k c equation carman 1997 1 cosθ is the tortuosity le l then the expression of the modified poiseuille law eq 7 is obtained after substituting eq 5 and eq 6 into eq 4 7 d p f μ v k 0 d l ε m 2 c o s θ by considering the original definition of hydraulic radius m εa c where c is the pore perimeter in area a a is the soil element s section area k can be obtained using eq 8 from eq 7 and darcy s law 8 k γ w μ v γ w μ j v γ w d l μ d p ε 3 a 2 c o s θ f k 0 c 2 ε m 2 c o s θ f k 0 3 results and discussion a simplified eq 8 is derived using some empirical corrections to improve the practicality of applying eq 8 which are discussed in the following 3 1 discussion of the modified poiseuille law 3 1 1 the value of f if the particles of saturated soils own stable bound water layer the shape of voids filled with free water is stable liquid adsorption action from particles can be neglected and these voids can be regarded as pipes in soils in this study flow in pipe is regarded as constant one referring to the assumption of poiseuille s law consequently the gradual adsorption and hydrogel formation before stability which will cause extra head loss benson and daniel 1990 and time varying flow are neglected in this study the head loss in pipes can be divided into local and friction head loss wang et al 2020 and poiseuille s law is a formula predicting friction head loss the changes in the pipe section and the flow direction cause local head loss when the flow velocity is small the friction head loss is proportional to the first power of flow velocity and the local head loss is proportional to the square of velocity considering the soil s slow permeation process the value of f can be determined as following 9 f μ k 0 c i 2 l i ε 1 i 3 ζ i ρ w u 2 μ k 0 c 2 l t ε 1 c 3 where ci is the wetted perimeter of void i ε 1 i is ε 1 of void i and li is the length of void i ε 1 c is ε 1 used for calculating eq 5 ρw is the water density ζi is the local head loss coefficient regarding the shapes of voids i and void i 1 lt is the total length of all voids table 2 lists the values of f for circle pipes the actual value of f equals the ratio of the actual head loss to the calculated head loss using dp 2μudl r 2 2 where r is the radius of the water inlet of the circle pipe the value of f will be closer to 1 0 when the variation of the pipe section and u are small the void section variations will influence the value of f following the same law the hydraulic radius ratio of two adjacent voids r r can be used for measuring the void section variations according to hemes et al 2015 and keller et al 2013 the rev size lr of clays is approximately 2 μm and approximately hundreds μm for sands previous studies reported that some in situ manually compacted clay samples which were compacted using large clay clods at low moisture content own inter clod voids k is controlled by the inter clod voids instead of clay clods voids benson and daniel 1990 gera et al 1996 wright et al 1996 and their k is much larger than compacted samples of few inter clod voids prepared at high moisture content or made of small clods chapuis and aubertin 2003 consequently the rev of these samples should be considered as the size of clods which are usually much larger than 2 μm if the observation length scale such as the product of the soil sample lengths in permeability tests and n is ls the maximal value of r r is less than lr ls ls and the minimal one is more than ls ls lr if ls is much larger compared to lr r r will be approximately 1 0 and f will be approximately 1 0 consequently for porous media with a much smaller rev than the observation scale the value of f is approximately 1 0 samples made of large clay clods own much larger rev than original clays the value of f for these samples in laboratory scale is large usually several centimeters which need more investigation because of a more complex void changes compared with the cases in table 2 this study will not discuss this kind of cases 3 1 2 the relationship between ε and ne fig 2 shows the relationship between ε and ε 1 the white pipe is the effective pores for permeation along the dl direction whereas the green pipe is the occlusive pores that allow no water along dl to flow these two pipes are separate and the overlapping parts of two pipes are not connected consequently they only allow water flow in their directions if the rev scale is much smaller than the observation scale the effective porosity ne aε 1dl adl ε 1 where ε 1 is the 2d porosity on the plane perpendicular to the seepage direction furthermore for the void pipes cross section the area should be aε and ne aεdl adlcosθ ε cosθ consequently ε ε 1cosθ ne cosθ the flow distance length in soil pores is dl cosθ according to the definition of θ in this way eq 8 can be modified as eq 10 10 k γ w μ n e 3 a 2 c o s 4 θ f k 0 c 2 3 1 3 relationship between c and s 0 the surface area s of effective pores in the soil element whose length is l and the cross section area is a is expressed as l e c d l the volume v of the effective pores is expressed as l e ε a d l if the rev scale of the porous media is much smaller than the observation scale eqns 11 and 12 can be obtained 11 v l e ε a d l n e a l 12 s l e c d l c l c o s θ where c is the average value of c in the soil element according to the definition of s eq 13 can be obtained 13 s s 0 a l v s 0 a l 1 n e eq 14 is obtained by comparing eqns 12 and 13 13 c s 0 a 1 n e c o s θ where al is the soil element volume s 0 is the specific surface area of particles after substituting eq 14 into eq 10 eq 15 is obtained 15 k γ w μ n e 3 c o s 2 θ f k 0 s 0 2 1 n e 2 3 2 estimations of the parameters the simplified poiseuille law s crucial point is obtaining the values of s 0 ne and 1 cosθ these parameters estimation methods will be discussed 3 2 1 estimation of s 0 nomura et al 2018 considered the soil particles as spheres and obtained eq 16 which used particle size distribution psd curves to obtain s 0 in eq 16 s 0 of a specific particle with diameter d is considered as 6 d 16 s 0 3 π d 50 1 a sin π 2 a where a is the fitting number for the psd curves nomura et al 2018 the mass proportion of particles whose diameters are smaller than d i is i di i 100 i 0 5 ad 50 however the actual particles are not always spheres while with various shapes and rough surfaces consequently b a correction coefficient for considering particle shapes and rough surfaces is presented to correct the difference between the actual particle and the sphere the modified eq 16 is shown in eq 17 17 s 0 b 3 π d 50 1 a sin π 2 a table 3 shows the value of s 0 of river sands and manufactured sands from the experiments of ji et al 2011 specimens a d are river sands and specimens e and f are manufactured the particle density ρs is 2 65 g cm3 to obtain the specific surface area s 0 m of unit weight sands furthermore the value of d 50 is estimated using d 50 100 i i 0 5 adi because of the lack of measured data according to the ratios of experimental values and predicted ones of s 0 in table 3 the average value of b for sands is determined as 1 8 the values of s 0 of clays are challenging to obtain using psd consequently it will not be discussed in this study 3 2 2 estimation of ne the weighting method compares the mass difference of saturation and dry densities to obtain n dry densities are obtained using drying methods the common drying method is to continuously dry samples with atmospheric pressure at approximately 101 kpa and with temperature at 378 k namely 105 c rai et al 2017 liang and wang 2020 until their weights are stable the dry weight changes at various temperatures owing to different energy of bound water at various locations van olphen 1965 the primary difference between saturation and dry density is the soil s water weight including bound water water attracted by electrostatic attraction force from particles huo et al 2012 and free water the volume proportion of free water is ne consequently if n and the volume of bound water can be obtained ne can be acquired bound water exists in the spacing among the crystal lattices of a particle and the surface of a particle cluster achari et al 1999 tertre et al 2018 asaad et al 2021 cao et al 2021 which are called interlayer spacing water and surface bound water respectively the thickness of bound water can be influenced by solution type temperature clay type etc achari et al 1999 huo et al 2012 the ratio of interlayer thickness of vermiculite after dried at 373 k 473 k to the wet particle thickness which includes the interlayer thickness at 293 k 20 c is approximately 1 5 and becomes approximately 1 3 after dried at 523 k ma et al 2019 this ratio is a little larger in cacl2 or mgcl2 solution than nacl huo et al 2012 this study discusses the permeation of water cases and the cases after dried at 378 k the ratios of total wet particle thickness at 293 k to layer thickness after heating at 378 k for smectite illite and kaolinite are approximately 1 9 1 0 and 1 0 respectively in water or low concentration cacl2 solution norrish 1954 kevan 2003 huggett 2005 liu et al 2021 depasquale and jenkins 2022 it should be note that this ratio of smectite is much larger approximately 4 2 in 0 31 mol l concentration nacl solution considering the interlayer thickness values in water and the drying temperature of 378 k eq 18 is obtained to estimate the volume proportion of free water and surface bound water np in water 18 n p c q v c s v c il v c k v 1 25 c v v 1 9 c s v n 0 25 c v v 0 9 c s v where cq v cil v ck v cv v and cs v are the volume proportion of quartz illite kaolinite vermiculite and smectite respectively since the densities of these clay minerals are similar approximately 2 6 g cm3 though smectite is sometimes lighter 2 2 7 g cm3 the mass proportion can be used to estimate the volume proportion according to alansari et al 2019 the particle volume of kaolinite or illite and surface bound water is approximately 1 7 times their particle volume 1 ne 1 7 1 np for the other mixed clay mineral such as chlorite and mica it is twice 1 ne 2 1 np and for smectite it varies by comparing the relationship between ne and np eq 19 is presented to estimate ne 19 n e c q v 1 7 c il v 1 7 c k v 2 5 c v v x c s v n 0 7 c il v 0 7 c k v 1 5 c v v y c s v where x is the coefficient considering the thickness of all bound water of smectite y x 1 and x 0 005 pi 1 4576 pi is the plastic index of clays the value of x will be discussed in section 3 2 4 table 4 shows the empirical equations to predict the ne of two clay samples from terzaghi and zunker carman 1939 and the predictions from eq 19 since carman had not declared the types of clays here all clays are regarded as kaolinite and illite because they are the primary minerals in non swelling clays the results indicate that eq 19 can produce satisfying predictions of the ne of the clays showing that the coefficients for kaolinite and illite in eq 19 are reasonable 3 2 3 estimation of 1 cosθ mauret renaud 1997 considered a close relationship between n and 1 cosθ for sands and glass beads and presented eq 20 to estimate 1 cosθ 20 1 c o s θ 1 0 49 l n n however the prediction results using eq 20 are usually irrational for clays an overestimation of the free water volume proportion of clays because of bound water attributes to the irrationality the particle arrangement of natural clays may also attribute to this wright et al 1996 consequently it is more reasonable to use ne replacing n the modified format of eq 20 is shown in eq 21 21 1 c o s θ 1 0 49 l n n e fig 3 compares the prediction results using eq 21 and the experimental data and numerical results of tortuosity of sands and glass beads from abderrahmene et al 2017 barrande et al 2007 delgado 2006 and fu et al 2021 for sand and glass bead ne equals n the result illustrates that eq 20 can reasonably predict the value of 1 cosθ for sand and glass beads fig 4 compares the prediction result of the tortuosity of clay using eq 20 and eq 21 the experimental data are from lekhov et al 2021 and the values of ne are obtained from eq 19 the prediction values from eq 21 are more reasonable than those from eq 20 the generally larger values of experimental data might be because authors used concentrated gradient experiments instead of hydraulic gradient experiments and these two experiments give different results fu et al 2021 consequently eq 21 can more reasonably predict the tortuosity of clay 3 2 4 the value of x this section discusses the value of x in eq 19 according to the data from mishra et al 2011 mishra et al 2011 provided a series of relationships between n and k of smectite mixtures with various properties such as s 0 t total specific surface of dry particles liquid limit ll plastic index pi and smectite proportions according to alansari et al s 2019 study the maximal volume ratio of surface bound water to a particle is 1 0 1 ne 2 1 np illustrating x 4 according to mishra et al 2011 using similar s 0 t values the clays with larger ll have smaller k or in other words smaller ne consequently x for the clay with the largest ll in mishara et al s study is estimated to be 4 0 equations 10 19 and 21 obtain k n see appendix mishra et al 2011 provided s 0 t of bentonite clays whose specific surface areas are much larger than sandy soils according to the definition of specific surface area the ratio of surface area to volume the total specific surface area is the sum of products of the members proportions and specific surface areas the values of bentonites s 0 are much larger than sandy soils in mishara et al s study consequently the product of bentonite proportion and bentonite specific surface area is approximately the total specific surface area of the mixture comparing the theoretical k n and the actual one 1 5 of s 0 t of the mixture is suitable for s 0 because the total specific surface area considers closed voids surfaces which cannot participate in permeations then 1 5 of s 0 t is taken as the value of s 0 in the subsequent calculation the clays in the bentonites attribute the properties of ll pl and pi and the dominant clay is smectite consequently the clay proportion cp in bentonite can measure the proportion of smectite and pi cp and ll cp can emphasize the influence of smectite fig 5 shows a series of x values obtained by comparing the slope values of n k curves given by mishra et al 2011 when a mixture s ll and pi are large the corresponding x is large fitting the regular pattern in mishra et al s 2011 study the regression equations for pi ll ll cp and pi cp with x in fig 5 are shown in eq 22 eq 25 respectively 22 x 0 005 p i 1 4576 r 2 0 937 23 x 0 0051 l l 1 1547 r 2 0 943 24 x 0 0062 l l c p 0 3767 r 2 0 960 25 x 0 0053 p i c p 0 6256 r 2 0 956 the thickness of bound water is relative to pi and ll dolinar 2009 previous studies have shown that pi is more related to k and ll has some limitations in predicting k nishida and nakagawa 1969 sivapullaiah et al 2000 dolinar 2009 consequently eq 22 and eq 25 can be more reliable theoretically cp in eq 25 can emphasize the influence from smectite better however considering the value of cp is difficult to obtain in most cases eq 22 is more convenient these equations also give a relationship between the bound water proportion and bentonite properties correlating with the regular pattern given by mishra et al 2011 4 verification of the modified k c equation to ensure that the calculated k is rational the empirical equations proposed in this study should satisfy the additional hypothesis conditions as follows i each section s void distribution is similar to ensure the mostly unchanged ε requests a tiny rev and a large observation scale ii the void pipes in various directions share similar void characteristics fig 6 compares the prediction results of μk γw from the proposed formulas in this study with the experimental results of manufactured sand from man et al 2022 and glass beads from yin et al 2022 in this figure the experimental values of k are converted into μk γw μ and γ w are the values of water viscosity and the unit weight at kelvin temperature with a value of 293 k in fig 6 a nomura et al s 2018 formulas and yin et al s 2022 formulas are used for comparison the values of s 0 in yin et al s formulas are provided by eq 17 in fig 6 b formulas from carman 1939 yin et al 2022 and this study are used the values of s 0 are provided by yin et al because of a lack of psd curves eqns 10 19 and 21 give a satisfactory prediction for the permeability of sand fig 7 compares the prediction results of k using the proposed formulas in this study with the experimental results of clay mixtures including kaolinite sand and bentonite sand mixtures from niu 2017 the s 0 values of sand kaolinite and bentonite are determined from the inverses of eqns 10 19 and 21 using three points of experimental data because of the lack of relevant information the s 0 values used for calculation are determined from the weighted average method mentioned in section 3 2 4 furthermore due to the lack of the smectite proportion data an average value of 0 74 is used the smectite proportion for bentonite is 0 6 0 88 mishra et al 2011 x values are determined from eq 22 the formulas from ren et al 2016 and carman 1939 are used for comparison fig 7 a shows that the predictions of the original k c equation using n are unreasonable considering the difference of k between high proportion bentonite mixtures silty ones and low proportion ones sandy ones the formula from ren et al 2016 is compared with the proposed formulas in this study for sandy bentonite sand mixtures in fig 7 b and silty bentonite sand mixtures in fig 7 c eqns 10 17 19 and 21 also give good predictions of k for clay mixtures 5 conclusions the following conclusions were drawn in this study 1 a new modified k c equation is proposed considering the derivation principle of the original k c equation by adding the corrections considering section changes f and 2d porosity ε into poiseuille s law an implied assumption in the k c equation is that the changes in flow sections should be slight so that the difference between ε and effective porosity ne can be neglected and f is approximately 1 2 the prediction formulas for the parameters in the new modified k c equation including specific surface s 0 tortuosity 1 cosθ and ne are introduced the availability of the prediction formulas for the parameters is verified by comparing experimental data and established formulas proposed by other researchers 3 the availability of the new modified k c equation is verified by comparing the experimental values and established formulas the new modified k c equation effectively predicts k for clay and sand 4 the new modified k c equation has limitations in the estimation of f and s 0 and considering anisotropy the estimation methods of f for large representative elementary volume rev cases and 1 cosθ ne for anisotropic porous media need further investigation a general method to estimate s 0 for clays is discussed little

1910,the kozeny carman k c equation based on poiseuille s law is an efficient theoretical equation predicting hydraulic conductivity some modified k c equations were proposed focusing on obtaining the uncertainty parameters in the original k c equation however assumptions of some modified k c equations are inconsistent with poiseuille s law this study proposes a new modified k c equation considering the derivation principle of the original k c equation by applying poiseuille s law in porous media the concept of 2d porosity ε and a correction coefficient for permeation f are presented during the derivation process each section s void distribution is assumed to be similar and void pipes in various directions share similar characteristics because the effective porosity ne is approximately equal to ε only when the change in the cross section in porous media is small the parameters in the new modified k c equation include specific surface area s 0 tortuosity 1 cosθ and ne the prediction formulas of ne are presented according to the soil mineral and bound water features the prediction formulas for s 0 and 1 cosθ are deduced and verified by comparing them with established formulas proposed by other researchers and experimental data the new modified k c equation is adequate for predicting hydraulic conductivity for clay and sand by comparing it with the

property of soils which is a significant factor influencing soil deformation zeng et al 2022 wang et al 2019 2023 well pumping wu et al 2016 xu et al 2019 internal erosion yang et al 2019 and soil contamination hu et al 2021 2022 soil permeability is often a major factor leading to engineering or geological disasters such as land subsidence wang and xu 2022 xu et al 2016 slope failure song and tan 2020 jiang and tan 2021 shallow gas leakage xu et al 2017 2018 tunnel leakage wu et al 2020 et al hydraulic conductivity is a crucial parameter in expressing soil permeability which can be evaluated by many investigation methods such as laboratory permeability masaoka and kosugi 2018 field pumping wu et al 2017 however applying these investigation methods is frequently time consuming and involves uncertainties rabouli et al 2021 singh and sharma 2023 it is a feasible approach to predict hydraulic conductivity by obtaining the relationship between porosity and hydraulic conductivity nomura et al 2018 the kozeny carman equation k c equation carman 1939 nomura et al 2018 is an applicable theoretical equation to get hydraulic conductivity values because of its simplicity and capability ren et al 2016 singh and sharma 2023 the k c equation uses porosity n specific surface s 0 void shape constant k 0 and tortuosity le l to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of porous media due to the difficulty of obtaining some parameters in the k c equation many modifications were proposed some researchers proposed empirical values of the parameters to fit specific cases for example yin et al 2022 and mauret renaud 1997 presented empirical formulas to estimate k 0 and le l nomura et al 2018 presented a formula using particle distribution to estimate s 0 ren et al 2016 presented an empirical formula to correct the value of n they all simplified the obtainment of those parameters under some particular conditions others proposed theoretical expressions for specific parameters based on various derivation hypotheses however some derivation hypotheses did not conform to poiseuille s law the derivation principle of the original k c equation carman 1939 for example the derivation of s 0 and k 0 from xu yu 2008 and yu cheng 2002 assumed that soil pores could be regarded as a bundle of tortuous capillary tubes and poiseuille s law for circle pipes was used directly however poiseuille s law is obtained based on the premise that the fluid close to the tube wall is stationary and the juxtaposed hypothetical pipes cannot satisfy this due to the absence of a substantial pipe wall in the center of a void besides safari et al 2021 used a theoretical formula of poiseuille s law for ellipse section voids to obtain k 0 and assumed that the particles are ellipses or ellipsoids however the ellipse voids and particles cannot exist simultaneously those studies ignored the basics of poiseuille s law for porous media currently the derivation principle of the original k c equation is seldom mentioned and discussed during its modification process this paper presents a new modified k c equation considering the derivation principle of the original k c equation first the modified k c equation is derived based on poiseuille s law where new parameters considering the flow section in voids are discussed then the k c equation s implicit conditions are discussed and the simplified equation and estimation formulas for s 0 ne and le l are presented finally the new modified k c equation is verified 2 theory derivation of the modified k c equation 2 1 derivation of the original k c equation poiseuille s law as illustrated in eq 1 is the theoretical basis of the original k c equation carman 1939 which was initially used to estimate the pressure loss for laminar newtonian fluids along a circle section straight pipe 1 u m 2 k 0 δ p μ l e where u is the actual average liquid velocity m is the hydraulic radius equal to the ratio of pipe cross sectional area to section perimeter length for a circular pipe the section perimeter length is 2πr the cross sectional area is πr 2 where r is pipe radius δp is the pressure difference between the soil which is determined as γw h 1 h 2 p 1 p 2 where γw is the unit weight of water h 1 and p 1 are the height relative to a certain reference plane and pressure of one point on upper reaches section respectively and h 2 and p 2 are the height relative to same reference plane and pressure of one point of lower reaches section respectively μ is the fluid s dynamic viscosity le is the actual seepage distance considering the tortuous seepage path k 0 is the shape constant considering the cross section shape of voids a series of values of k 0 for certain sections are listed in table 1 carman 1939 according to the relationship between seepage velocity and actual average flow velocity based on the equal flow s law eq 2 the k c equation is presented in eq 3 2 u l e v ln 3 μ k γ w 1 k s 0 2 n 3 1 n 2 carman 1939 simplified m as the ratio of the pipe volume and the wetted surface area v s which is equivalent to the section area to perimeter ratio for a constant section pipe v is the soil void volume s is the void surface area s s 0 1 n v s 0 is the specific surface of the soil particles n is porosity l is the length of soils along the equivalent seepage direction and v is the seepage velocity k is the hydraulic conductivity μk γw is the hydraulic coefficient defined by carman 1939 and k is the k c constant defined by carman 1939 k k 0 le l 2 the value of k 0 corresponds to the cross section shapes carman 1939 carman declared that the voids in sandy soils were typically elongated and consequently k 0 should be close to 2 5 referring to table 1 however the scanning electron microscopy images of clays cotecchia et al 2016 golsanami et al 2022 illustrate that the small voids in clays are closer to circles and k 0 with a value of 2 0 should be more suitable based on k 0 2 5 and the experimental value of le l 20 5 carman 1997 carman 1939 determined an empirical value of k as 5 moreover carman 1939 assumed that the particles surface area equals the surface of voids carman declared that the effective porosity ne should be used to consider the influence of bound water in clays ne indicates the proportion of the void filled with flowable free water the volume of soil particles with little bound water is 1 n in the soil of unit volume and the surface area s per unit volume of soil equals s 0 1 n if the soil particle includes the bound water and closed pores s should be s 0 1 ne here s 0 is the specific surface of particles with bound water 2 2 modified k c equation considering poiseuille s law during carman s derivation process the cross sectional area for flow in the soil section of area a was na and n was the volume proportion of the void in the soil this paper defines 2d porosity which is labeled as ε as the void s section area proportion of cross section the difference between n and ε can be explained using an element with a unit thickness fig 1 the element s overhead view size is l l and n is al bl ab l 2 while ε in the section a a should be a l since a is not equal to b considering the soil s anisotropy the value of n is not equal to ε furthermore if the liquid flows along the vertical direction in fig 1 the abrupt change at the cross will cause a horizontal flow velocity component indicating that the traditional poiseuille s law no longer fits this result explains why the k c equation failed to predict the hydraulic conductivities of pipes with abrupt cross sections as valdes parada et al 2009 presented due to the heterogeneity of soils n or ε at one point differ the representative elementary volume rev is the minimal volume of soils when the specimens of this volume around a specific point own stable properties he et al 2022 and the average values of n or ε in rev will be stable consequently the modified k c equation should be deducted in an element larger than rev referring to poiseuille s law if a liquid with a volume of va flows through a soil element larger than rev the pressure loss dp in this element is shown in eq 4 4 d p f μ u k 0 d l e m 2 where f is the correction coefficient for permeation considering the difference between the constant section pipe and the changed section void pipes in the element which carman ignored dle is the actual length fluid goes through inside the element considering the tortuous void according to the discussion in section 2 1 k 0 2 0 for clays and k 0 2 5 for sand are more reasonable according to the law of equal flow rate eq 5 can be obtained 5 u va ε a v ε according to carman s 1939 definition of dle eq 6 is acquired 6 d l e d l 1 c o s θ where θ is the included angle between the void pipe direction dl is the element s length according to experimental results of carman 1939 θ was set as 45 in the original k c equation carman 1997 1 cosθ is the tortuosity le l then the expression of the modified poiseuille law eq 7 is obtained after substituting eq 5 and eq 6 into eq 4 7 d p f μ v k 0 d l ε m 2 c o s θ by considering the original definition of hydraulic radius m εa c where c is the pore perimeter in area a a is the soil element s section area k can be obtained using eq 8 from eq 7 and darcy s law 8 k γ w μ v γ w μ j v γ w d l μ d p ε 3 a 2 c o s θ f k 0 c 2 ε m 2 c o s θ f k 0 3 results and discussion a simplified eq 8 is derived using some empirical corrections to improve the practicality of applying eq 8 which are discussed in the following 3 1 discussion of the modified poiseuille law 3 1 1 the value of f if the particles of saturated soils own stable bound water layer the shape of voids filled with free water is stable liquid adsorption action from particles can be neglected and these voids can be regarded as pipes in soils in this study flow in pipe is regarded as constant one referring to the assumption of poiseuille s law consequently the gradual adsorption and hydrogel formation before stability which will cause extra head loss benson and daniel 1990 and time varying flow are neglected in this study the head loss in pipes can be divided into local and friction head loss wang et al 2020 and poiseuille s law is a formula predicting friction head loss the changes in the pipe section and the flow direction cause local head loss when the flow velocity is small the friction head loss is proportional to the first power of flow velocity and the local head loss is proportional to the square of velocity considering the soil s slow permeation process the value of f can be determined as following 9 f μ k 0 c i 2 l i ε 1 i 3 ζ i ρ w u 2 μ k 0 c 2 l t ε 1 c 3 where ci is the wetted perimeter of void i ε 1 i is ε 1 of void i and li is the length of void i ε 1 c is ε 1 used for calculating eq 5 ρw is the water density ζi is the local head loss coefficient regarding the shapes of voids i and void i 1 lt is the total length of all voids table 2 lists the values of f for circle pipes the actual value of f equals the ratio of the actual head loss to the calculated head loss using dp 2μudl r 2 2 where r is the radius of the water inlet of the circle pipe the value of f will be closer to 1 0 when the variation of the pipe section and u are small the void section variations will influence the value of f following the same law the hydraulic radius ratio of two adjacent voids r r can be used for measuring the void section variations according to hemes et al 2015 and keller et al 2013 the rev size lr of clays is approximately 2 μm and approximately hundreds μm for sands previous studies reported that some in situ manually compacted clay samples which were compacted using large clay clods at low moisture content own inter clod voids k is controlled by the inter clod voids instead of clay clods voids benson and daniel 1990 gera et al 1996 wright et al 1996 and their k is much larger than compacted samples of few inter clod voids prepared at high moisture content or made of small clods chapuis and aubertin 2003 consequently the rev of these samples should be considered as the size of clods which are usually much larger than 2 μm if the observation length scale such as the product of the soil sample lengths in permeability tests and n is ls the maximal value of r r is less than lr ls ls and the minimal one is more than ls ls lr if ls is much larger compared to lr r r will be approximately 1 0 and f will be approximately 1 0 consequently for porous media with a much smaller rev than the observation scale the value of f is approximately 1 0 samples made of large clay clods own much larger rev than original clays the value of f for these samples in laboratory scale is large usually several centimeters which need more investigation because of a more complex void changes compared with the cases in table 2 this study will not discuss this kind of cases 3 1 2 the relationship between ε and ne fig 2 shows the relationship between ε and ε 1 the white pipe is the effective pores for permeation along the dl direction whereas the green pipe is the occlusive pores that allow no water along dl to flow these two pipes are separate and the overlapping parts of two pipes are not connected consequently they only allow water flow in their directions if the rev scale is much smaller than the observation scale the effective porosity ne aε 1dl adl ε 1 where ε 1 is the 2d porosity on the plane perpendicular to the seepage direction furthermore for the void pipes cross section the area should be aε and ne aεdl adlcosθ ε cosθ consequently ε ε 1cosθ ne cosθ the flow distance length in soil pores is dl cosθ according to the definition of θ in this way eq 8 can be modified as eq 10 10 k γ w μ n e 3 a 2 c o s 4 θ f k 0 c 2 3 1 3 relationship between c and s 0 the surface area s of effective pores in the soil element whose length is l and the cross section area is a is expressed as l e c d l the volume v of the effective pores is expressed as l e ε a d l if the rev scale of the porous media is much smaller than the observation scale eqns 11 and 12 can be obtained 11 v l e ε a d l n e a l 12 s l e c d l c l c o s θ where c is the average value of c in the soil element according to the definition of s eq 13 can be obtained 13 s s 0 a l v s 0 a l 1 n e eq 14 is obtained by comparing eqns 12 and 13 13 c s 0 a 1 n e c o s θ where al is the soil element volume s 0 is the specific surface area of particles after substituting eq 14 into eq 10 eq 15 is obtained 15 k γ w μ n e 3 c o s 2 θ f k 0 s 0 2 1 n e 2 3 2 estimations of the parameters the simplified poiseuille law s crucial point is obtaining the values of s 0 ne and 1 cosθ these parameters estimation methods will be discussed 3 2 1 estimation of s 0 nomura et al 2018 considered the soil particles as spheres and obtained eq 16 which used particle size distribution psd curves to obtain s 0 in eq 16 s 0 of a specific particle with diameter d is considered as 6 d 16 s 0 3 π d 50 1 a sin π 2 a where a is the fitting number for the psd curves nomura et al 2018 the mass proportion of particles whose diameters are smaller than d i is i di i 100 i 0 5 ad 50 however the actual particles are not always spheres while with various shapes and rough surfaces consequently b a correction coefficient for considering particle shapes and rough surfaces is presented to correct the difference between the actual particle and the sphere the modified eq 16 is shown in eq 17 17 s 0 b 3 π d 50 1 a sin π 2 a table 3 shows the value of s 0 of river sands and manufactured sands from the experiments of ji et al 2011 specimens a d are river sands and specimens e and f are manufactured the particle density ρs is 2 65 g cm3 to obtain the specific surface area s 0 m of unit weight sands furthermore the value of d 50 is estimated using d 50 100 i i 0 5 adi because of the lack of measured data according to the ratios of experimental values and predicted ones of s 0 in table 3 the average value of b for sands is determined as 1 8 the values of s 0 of clays are challenging to obtain using psd consequently it will not be discussed in this study 3 2 2 estimation of ne the weighting method compares the mass difference of saturation and dry densities to obtain n dry densities are obtained using drying methods the common drying method is to continuously dry samples with atmospheric pressure at approximately 101 kpa and with temperature at 378 k namely 105 c rai et al 2017 liang and wang 2020 until their weights are stable the dry weight changes at various temperatures owing to different energy of bound water at various locations van olphen 1965 the primary difference between saturation and dry density is the soil s water weight including bound water water attracted by electrostatic attraction force from particles huo et al 2012 and free water the volume proportion of free water is ne consequently if n and the volume of bound water can be obtained ne can be acquired bound water exists in the spacing among the crystal lattices of a particle and the surface of a particle cluster achari et al 1999 tertre et al 2018 asaad et al 2021 cao et al 2021 which are called interlayer spacing water and surface bound water respectively the thickness of bound water can be influenced by solution type temperature clay type etc achari et al 1999 huo et al 2012 the ratio of interlayer thickness of vermiculite after dried at 373 k 473 k to the wet particle thickness which includes the interlayer thickness at 293 k 20 c is approximately 1 5 and becomes approximately 1 3 after dried at 523 k ma et al 2019 this ratio is a little larger in cacl2 or mgcl2 solution than nacl huo et al 2012 this study discusses the permeation of water cases and the cases after dried at 378 k the ratios of total wet particle thickness at 293 k to layer thickness after heating at 378 k for smectite illite and kaolinite are approximately 1 9 1 0 and 1 0 respectively in water or low concentration cacl2 solution norrish 1954 kevan 2003 huggett 2005 liu et al 2021 depasquale and jenkins 2022 it should be note that this ratio of smectite is much larger approximately 4 2 in 0 31 mol l concentration nacl solution considering the interlayer thickness values in water and the drying temperature of 378 k eq 18 is obtained to estimate the volume proportion of free water and surface bound water np in water 18 n p c q v c s v c il v c k v 1 25 c v v 1 9 c s v n 0 25 c v v 0 9 c s v where cq v cil v ck v cv v and cs v are the volume proportion of quartz illite kaolinite vermiculite and smectite respectively since the densities of these clay minerals are similar approximately 2 6 g cm3 though smectite is sometimes lighter 2 2 7 g cm3 the mass proportion can be used to estimate the volume proportion according to alansari et al 2019 the particle volume of kaolinite or illite and surface bound water is approximately 1 7 times their particle volume 1 ne 1 7 1 np for the other mixed clay mineral such as chlorite and mica it is twice 1 ne 2 1 np and for smectite it varies by comparing the relationship between ne and np eq 19 is presented to estimate ne 19 n e c q v 1 7 c il v 1 7 c k v 2 5 c v v x c s v n 0 7 c il v 0 7 c k v 1 5 c v v y c s v where x is the coefficient considering the thickness of all bound water of smectite y x 1 and x 0 005 pi 1 4576 pi is the plastic index of clays the value of x will be discussed in section 3 2 4 table 4 shows the empirical equations to predict the ne of two clay samples from terzaghi and zunker carman 1939 and the predictions from eq 19 since carman had not declared the types of clays here all clays are regarded as kaolinite and illite because they are the primary minerals in non swelling clays the results indicate that eq 19 can produce satisfying predictions of the ne of the clays showing that the coefficients for kaolinite and illite in eq 19 are reasonable 3 2 3 estimation of 1 cosθ mauret renaud 1997 considered a close relationship between n and 1 cosθ for sands and glass beads and presented eq 20 to estimate 1 cosθ 20 1 c o s θ 1 0 49 l n n however the prediction results using eq 20 are usually irrational for clays an overestimation of the free water volume proportion of clays because of bound water attributes to the irrationality the particle arrangement of natural clays may also attribute to this wright et al 1996 consequently it is more reasonable to use ne replacing n the modified format of eq 20 is shown in eq 21 21 1 c o s θ 1 0 49 l n n e fig 3 compares the prediction results using eq 21 and the experimental data and numerical results of tortuosity of sands and glass beads from abderrahmene et al 2017 barrande et al 2007 delgado 2006 and fu et al 2021 for sand and glass bead ne equals n the result illustrates that eq 20 can reasonably predict the value of 1 cosθ for sand and glass beads fig 4 compares the prediction result of the tortuosity of clay using eq 20 and eq 21 the experimental data are from lekhov et al 2021 and the values of ne are obtained from eq 19 the prediction values from eq 21 are more reasonable than those from eq 20 the generally larger values of experimental data might be because authors used concentrated gradient experiments instead of hydraulic gradient experiments and these two experiments give different results fu et al 2021 consequently eq 21 can more reasonably predict the tortuosity of clay 3 2 4 the value of x this section discusses the value of x in eq 19 according to the data from mishra et al 2011 mishra et al 2011 provided a series of relationships between n and k of smectite mixtures with various properties such as s 0 t total specific surface of dry particles liquid limit ll plastic index pi and smectite proportions according to alansari et al s 2019 study the maximal volume ratio of surface bound water to a particle is 1 0 1 ne 2 1 np illustrating x 4 according to mishra et al 2011 using similar s 0 t values the clays with larger ll have smaller k or in other words smaller ne consequently x for the clay with the largest ll in mishara et al s study is estimated to be 4 0 equations 10 19 and 21 obtain k n see appendix mishra et al 2011 provided s 0 t of bentonite clays whose specific surface areas are much larger than sandy soils according to the definition of specific surface area the ratio of surface area to volume the total specific surface area is the sum of products of the members proportions and specific surface areas the values of bentonites s 0 are much larger than sandy soils in mishara et al s study consequently the product of bentonite proportion and bentonite specific surface area is approximately the total specific surface area of the mixture comparing the theoretical k n and the actual one 1 5 of s 0 t of the mixture is suitable for s 0 because the total specific surface area considers closed voids surfaces which cannot participate in permeations then 1 5 of s 0 t is taken as the value of s 0 in the subsequent calculation the clays in the bentonites attribute the properties of ll pl and pi and the dominant clay is smectite consequently the clay proportion cp in bentonite can measure the proportion of smectite and pi cp and ll cp can emphasize the influence of smectite fig 5 shows a series of x values obtained by comparing the slope values of n k curves given by mishra et al 2011 when a mixture s ll and pi are large the corresponding x is large fitting the regular pattern in mishra et al s 2011 study the regression equations for pi ll ll cp and pi cp with x in fig 5 are shown in eq 22 eq 25 respectively 22 x 0 005 p i 1 4576 r 2 0 937 23 x 0 0051 l l 1 1547 r 2 0 943 24 x 0 0062 l l c p 0 3767 r 2 0 960 25 x 0 0053 p i c p 0 6256 r 2 0 956 the thickness of bound water is relative to pi and ll dolinar 2009 previous studies have shown that pi is more related to k and ll has some limitations in predicting k nishida and nakagawa 1969 sivapullaiah et al 2000 dolinar 2009 consequently eq 22 and eq 25 can be more reliable theoretically cp in eq 25 can emphasize the influence from smectite better however considering the value of cp is difficult to obtain in most cases eq 22 is more convenient these equations also give a relationship between the bound water proportion and bentonite properties correlating with the regular pattern given by mishra et al 2011 4 verification of the modified k c equation to ensure that the calculated k is rational the empirical equations proposed in this study should satisfy the additional hypothesis conditions as follows i each section s void distribution is similar to ensure the mostly unchanged ε requests a tiny rev and a large observation scale ii the void pipes in various directions share similar void characteristics fig 6 compares the prediction results of μk γw from the proposed formulas in this study with the experimental results of manufactured sand from man et al 2022 and glass beads from yin et al 2022 in this figure the experimental values of k are converted into μk γw μ and γ w are the values of water viscosity and the unit weight at kelvin temperature with a value of 293 k in fig 6 a nomura et al s 2018 formulas and yin et al s 2022 formulas are used for comparison the values of s 0 in yin et al s formulas are provided by eq 17 in fig 6 b formulas from carman 1939 yin et al 2022 and this study are used the values of s 0 are provided by yin et al because of a lack of psd curves eqns 10 19 and 21 give a satisfactory prediction for the permeability of sand fig 7 compares the prediction results of k using the proposed formulas in this study with the experimental results of clay mixtures including kaolinite sand and bentonite sand mixtures from niu 2017 the s 0 values of sand kaolinite and bentonite are determined from the inverses of eqns 10 19 and 21 using three points of experimental data because of the lack of relevant information the s 0 values used for calculation are determined from the weighted average method mentioned in section 3 2 4 furthermore due to the lack of the smectite proportion data an average value of 0 74 is used the smectite proportion for bentonite is 0 6 0 88 mishra et al 2011 x values are determined from eq 22 the formulas from ren et al 2016 and carman 1939 are used for comparison fig 7 a shows that the predictions of the original k c equation using n are unreasonable considering the difference of k between high proportion bentonite mixtures silty ones and low proportion ones sandy ones the formula from ren et al 2016 is compared with the proposed formulas in this study for sandy bentonite sand mixtures in fig 7 b and silty bentonite sand mixtures in fig 7 c eqns 10 17 19 and 21 also give good predictions of k for clay mixtures 5 conclusions the following conclusions were drawn in this study 1 a new modified k c equation is proposed considering the derivation principle of the original k c equation by adding the corrections considering section changes f and 2d porosity ε into poiseuille s law an implied assumption in the k c equation is that the changes in flow sections should be slight so that the difference between ε and effective porosity ne can be neglected and f is approximately 1 2 the prediction formulas for the parameters in the new modified k c equation including specific surface s 0 tortuosity 1 cosθ and ne are introduced the availability of the prediction formulas for the parameters is verified by comparing experimental data and established formulas proposed by other researchers 3 the availability of the new modified k c equation is verified by comparing the experimental values and established formulas the new modified k c equation effectively predicts k for clay and sand 4 the new modified k c equation has limitations in the estimation of f and s 0 and considering anisotropy the estimation methods of f for large representative elementary volume rev cases and 1 cosθ ne for anisotropic porous media need further investigation a general method to estimate s 0 for clays is discussed little

1911,the management and remediation of algal blooms on a global scale are primarily focused on controlling nutrient inputs with an emphasis on limiting phosphorus inputs from point and non point sources it is well known however that physical factors such as water temperature water column stability and advective flow also play critical roles in the timing and size of algal blooms for nutrient control programs to be effective it is essential to understand the relative importance of hydrological processes associated with nutrient dynamics and bioavailability this study examines the relative importance of physical processes in hyper eutrophic canyon reservoirs in regulating the development of algal blooms we hypothesized that water column stability determines when algal blooms develop as well as the potential size of the bloom to test the hypothesis the study was implemented in gaoyang lake located in the middle of the pengxi river a 1st order tributary in the three gorges reservoir the ce qual w2 model was applied to verify the lacustrine nature of gaoyang lake we sampled the lake for 33 consecutive days from april 15th to may 17th in 2019 algal composition and abundance chlorophyll a concentration and different forms of p from the surface middle and bottom of the water column respectively and available phosphorus in sediment were sampled and measured daily water temperature dissolved oxygen chlorophyll a and water velocity were measured in situ daily we demonstrate that 1 during the initial stratification period a surface density layer sdl was formed as a result of a lack of turbulent wind mixing the formation of the sdl initiated the development of algal blooms as a result of surface optimum temperatures being achieved early in the year although the sdl maintained the algal community within the euphotic zone it also limited nutrient influx to the surface waters resulting in a decline of bioavailable phosphorus 2 surface cooling events however weakened the sdl resulting in enhanced nutrient flux into the upper water column the nutrient supply resulted in the formation of subsequent and more severe algal blooms when the sdl was re established our results demonstrate that physical processes such as the formation and stability of the sdl can be used to predict the occurrence and size of algal blooms in canyon reservoirs to control algal blooms we suggest conducting further research to regulate the development and stability of sdl through interventions such as artificial mixing or flow modification during critical time periods these approaches may provide rapid remediation options for managing harmful algal blooms keywords surface density layer algal blooms phosphorus three gorges reservoir water column stability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction globally harmful algal blooms habs in lakes and reservoirs are typically managed by controlling nutrient inputs from both point and non point sources however lakes and reservoirs have different hydrological processes such as advective flow and water column stability that can affect the development of habs to effectively manage these systems and achieve desired outcomes a better understanding of how physical processes regulate nutrient dynamics and bioavailability is essential this is particularly important for managing harmful algal blooms in reservoirs where modifying physical processes that regulate bloom formation may be possible it is estimated that more than 6 700 dams with backwater surface areas larger than 0 01 km2 have been constructed on the world s rivers lehner et al 2011 messager et al 2016 damming of rivers often causes water deterioration as a result of slow water flow and increased nutrient concentrations dumestre et al 2002 liro 2019 furthermore the development of reservoirs enhances instream metabolism and greenhouse gas emissions chen et al 2020 maavara et al 2020 which substantially changes the role of river systems as reactors liu et al 2022 the global phenomenon of algal blooms in dammed tributaries strongly supports this reactor effect maavara et al 2020 tan et al 2022 reservoirs are commonly situated in river valleys and basin like depressions downing et al 2006 to minimize engineering costs and facilitate water storage examples include itaipu reservoir in brazil lake mead reservoir in the united states and three gorges reservoir tgr in china there are significant differences in the physical chemical and biological dynamics between reservoirs and natural lakes thornton et al 1991 chen et al 2020 middelburg 2020 reservoirs often exhibit both riverine and lacustrine dynamics that regulate water flow and water column stability which are key physical factors modifying the development of algal blooms zhang et al 2020 unlike most lacustrine systems advective water flow and water column stability in reservoirs can be regulated by operational procedures leading to the potential to modify key physical processes that determine the timing and severity of harmful algal blooms for example algal blooms in tgr have been confined to the spring period zhang et al 2020 xiang et al 2021 tan et al 2022 and do not conform to those typically observed in temperate natural lakes where intense algal blooms are confined to the late summer chen et al 2013 ai et al 2023 therefore it is essential to study of the unique physical environments of reservoirs and how these relate to the development and potential management of algal blooms janssen et al 2019 huang et al 2020 song et al 2021 since 2003 the three gorges dam has changed the middle yangtze river into a serpentine canyon reservoir the three gorges reservoir tgr with 1080 km2 reservoir surface and storage of 39 3 billion m3 at the highest water level 175 m above sea level zeng et al 2019 following the impoundment of the dam 50 20 of 40 of the 1st order tributaries in the tgr catchment have developed spring algal blooms yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 xiang et al 2021 toxins from habs in the tgr have been associated with an 11 incidence of liver illness in children li et al 2011 and renal function impairment in adults lin et al 2016 as its name three gorges implies over 95 of the tgr catchment consists of deep canyons with large elevation differences 2000 m between the water surface and surrounding mountain peaks li et al 2001 strong wind events capable of causing surface mixing are rare in the tgr area yang et al 2017 in canyon reservoirs water column stratification differs from most lacustrine systems due to the lack of turbulent wind mixing which results in minimal heat energy transfer down the water column as a result a surface density layer sdl or surface metalimnion is formed at the top of the water column liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 tan et al 2022 although similar surface warming is observed in lakes these events tend to be transient imberger patterson 1989 in the tgr area the surface density layer can persist for days or weeks throughout the spring and summer periods liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 tan et al 2022 to distinguish the difference between transient surface warming and the stable surface temperature layers referred to in this paper the latter structure is defined as the surface density layer sdl zhang et al 2020 tan et al 2022 thermal stratification profiles in water columns determine both the mixing dynamics and internal nutrient cycling that can regulate the formation and size of algal blooms lehman 2014 therefore there is a need to determine how bloom forming algae track changes in the physical chemical environments of reservoirs in order to develop the best remediation strategies we hypothesized that the initiation of algal blooms in canyon reservoirs where wind mixing is severely restricted depends on the timing of the formation of the sdl we further hypothesize that the size and duration of the algal blooms are determined by nutrient diffusion rates into the sdl to test these hypotheses we used the ce qual w2 model to identify the hydrological status of gaoyang lake as a lacustrine system in the middle of the pengxi river a 1st order tributary of the tgr we sampled gaoyang lake for 33 consecutive days to track the development of algal blooms in 2019 this research aimed to quantify the relationship between the formation of the sdl and the initiation and duration of the algal blooms the results of this study will further our understanding on the relative importance of hydrological processes in the timing and severity of harmful algal blooms in canyon reservoirs and how these processes can be modified to manage algal blooms in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1

elevation difference 2000 m in 95 of the catchment results in the tgr being a system with minimal surface mixing the pengxi river 30 49 31 42 n 107 56 108 54 e is the largest tributary on the northern

108 40ˊ41 6 e s in fig 1c d was formed in 2003 as a result of the water level increase associated with the three gorges dam and is in the middle reach of the pengxi river with 5 km2 of water surface and a maximum 1 km in width at the high water table as a result of water level regulation in the tgr gaoyang lake alternates between shallow conditions max depth 10 m during the late summer when water is released by the three gorges dam and deep conditions max depth 40 m when water is stored over the winter period zhang et al 2020 the lake depth varied from 17 5 m to 10 m during the sampling period fig 2 with a retention time of 50 70 days zhang et al 2020 huang et al 2022 since 2007 gaoyang lake has produced the most severe algal blooms in the pengxi river guo et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 2020 tan et al 2022 the sampling transect s is in the center of gaoyang lake fig 1d three locations 10 m apart around s were sampled during each sampling event this transect was chosen because of the historically high prevalence of algal blooms in spring zhang et al 2015 2020 tan et al 2022 along with the daily sampling at site s sites of px1 5 fig 1c were surveyed by a multi parameter probe rbr

application the ce qual w2 model was selected for this study to determine the lacustrine nature of gaoyang lake as it compensated for the changing depth of the water columns frequently observed in the tgr chuo et al 2019 ce qual w2 is a two dimensional laterally averaged hydrodynamic and water quality model which is constructed to simulate relatively long and narrow water bodies exhibiting longitudinal and vertical water quality gradients co developed by the u s army corps of engineers waterways experiment station and portland state university based on applications for more than 500 different water bodies rivers reservoirs lakes sloughs and estuaries under a wide variety of conditions it has been found that the model is able to simulate water temperature hydrodynamics and water quality accurately the computational grid of pengxi river was developed based on the bathymetric and geometric data for the tgr represented by 107 longitudinal segments 500 m in length and 91 vertical layers of 1 m thickness fig s1 the bottom elevation of the confluence was 98 m model widths ranged from 10 to 1750 m the accuracy of the bathymetry data was confirmed by comparing the observed and simulated storage water elevation curves fig s2 px1 px3 downstream px4 middle reach and px5 upstream fig 1c were used to validate the model as shown and explained in figs s1 s2 after validating the ce qual w2 model march 1st may 31st 2019 was chosen to simulate the flow streamlines and longitudinal velocities in pengxi river i e parameters except for flow streamlines and longitudinal velocities are

modelling procedures were explained in supplementary information including figs s1 s2 2 4 data analysis relative water column stability rwcs is a critical parameter used to evaluate the strength of stratification in the water column the larger the rwcs the more stable the water column tian et al 2012 in this study the influence of silt on water density was ignored tian et al 2012 and the water density corresponding to water temperature was calculated according to formula 1 lawson anderson 2007 1 ρ 1000 1 t 288 9414 508929 2 t 68 12963 t 3 9863 2 where ρ is the density of water kg m 3 and t is the water temperature c the dimensionless parameter rwcs was calculated according to padisak et al 2003 by comparing the density difference between the bottom db and surface ds of the water column to the density difference between 4 c d4 and 5 c d5 of pure water using formula 2 and h is the depth of the water body padisak et al 2003 2 rwcs d b d s d 4 d 5 h correlation analyses were performed by pearson correlation and the difference analyses were performed by one way anova in spss 13 0 graphing and analysis were performed by origin 2018 3 results 3 1 hydrodynamics and thermal stratification based on in situ water temperature readings fig 2 summarizes the simulated flow streamlines in pengxi river on april 27th may 4th and may 9th 2019 respectively the strongest stratification occurred in the middle of pengxi river gaoyang lake with the highest surface water temperature and thermal density layering became more intense as time progressed below gaoyang lake water intrusion from the yangtze river flowing into the pengxi river at a depth of 5 10 m weakened thermal stratification up to 20 km from the pengxi river confluence upstream of gaoyang lake the water flow was low flowing out along the river bed and limiting water column stratification fig 2a b the results of the ce qual w2 model demonstrate that gaoyang lake was a lacustrine system during the sampling period of this study and that the formation of the sdl was restricted to this reach of the pengxi river 3 2 temporal water column stability during the sampling period longitudinal velocities simulated by the model were small with very little interference from downstream intrusion flow and inflow from upstream verifying the lacustrine characteristics of gaoyang lake fig 3 a the observed water temperature wt ranged from 14 05 to 27 4 c fig 3b wt increased rapidly from april 24th at the surface forming a surface density layer until may 6th when water column stability was relatively higher as indicated by the rwcs fig 3b wt at the surface declined to 23 c as a result of a storm event on may 7th weakening the sdl and leading to surface mixing to a depth of 6 2 m along with a decrease in water column stability fig 3b after may 9th with the rise of wt at the surface the lake re stratified although the rwcs levels remained low as expected zmix sdldepth was significantly negatively correlated with rwcs r 0 759 p 0 01 n 33 fig 3b it is interesting to note that during 11 days out of the 33 sampling days april 18th to 19th april 24th april 26th to 27th may 2nd to 3rd may 11th to 12th and may 16th to 17th the thermal structure of the water column was dominated by the sdls the sdls were stable during the first 22 days april 15th to may 6th of warm weather and were weakened and extended deeper into the water column at the end of this period as a result of the surface water cooling event on may 7th fig 3c the temporal oxygen profiles in the water column were consistent with that of the thermal water column structure fig 4 a b elevated oxygen concentrations reaching super saturation were observed in the sdl as a result of high photosynthetic production and limited diffusion dynamics within sdl fig 4a super saturated concentrations of do were observed on april 27th and on may 2nd at the times of strong surface density layering since the elevated oxygen in water is mainly produced by algal photosynthesis ignjatovic 1968 the oxygen profiles reveal that photosynthetic activity was mainly confined to the upper 5 m of the water column with evidence of photo inhibition observed during periods of both strong and weak stratification fig 4b of interest with respect to nutrient recycling is that the hypoxia in the lower water column persisted throughout the sampling period fig 4a b 3 3 p dynamics in water column and sediment the molar ratio of tn to tp throughout the water column ranged from 15 to 75 indicating that gaoyang lake was a p limited system fig 5 a tp concentrations in the surface and lower water column changed rapidly during the study period fig 5b c d with the formation of the sdl april 24th to may 6th surface dtp concentrations followed a downward trend reaching low levels e g 4 4 µg l 1 between may 1st and may 7th when dip concentrations were below detection fig 5b the concentrations of surface pp ranged from 1 to 394 µg l 1 accounting for 3 to 97 of tp in the surface waters figs 5 6 concentrations of dtp in the bottom layer b dp 10 101 µg l 1 were higher than those in the surface s dp 4 60 µg l 1 but they were statistically significantly and positively correlated with each other p 0 05 n 33 fig 5 interestingly b dp was significantly negatively correlated with the sediment available phosphorous sap

surface cooling event the tp content of the sediment stp sap and som all showed increasing trends during the sampling period while the bottom dissolved oxygen b do showed a general decreasing trend during the sampling season fig s3 the difference in the internal phosphorus circles among weak and strong stratification and sdls are summarized in fig s4 3 4 daily changes in chl a and algal biomass during the 33 day daily sampling period the chl a concentration across the three sampling depths ranged from 5 3 to 413 2 µg l 1 fig 6a the concentration of chl a in the bottom layer 5 3 147 µg l 1 was significantly lower than that observed in the surface 10 2 413 2 µg l 1 and middle layers 9 2 222 9 µg l 1 p 0 05 for both table s2 respectively the surface and middle layers had similar chl a temporal dynamic and the correlation coefficient between these two layers chl a content was 0 8 n 33 p 0 01 chl a concentrations during the may 1st 7th period achieved relatively high levels 250 ugl 1 before the surface cooling event of may 7th the surface cooling event resulted in the water mass sinking lower in the column therefore diluting the algal biomass after may 7th the surface algal biomass declined fig 6a b by may 9th the surface density layer was in the process of re establishing fig 3b and chl a concentrations exceeded 400ug l 1 fig 6a cyanophytes dominated the phytoplankton fig s5 with microcystis marginata being the most abundant species tan 2020 as m marginata lacks gas vacuoles for buoyancy regulation it is probable that the density layer was critical to its ability to stay within the euphotic depth 3 m the correlation coefficient between the cell density of m marginata and chl a was not significant p greater than 0 05 n 11 the cell density of m marginata on may 9th was approximately 15 times that observed on may 8th fig s6 pp was significantly positively correlated with chl a r 0 649 n 33 p 0 01 in the surface layer concentrations of chl a and tp in the surface layer were also significantly correlated r 0 628 p 0 01 n 33 linear regression between these two variables was chl a 716 785 tp 0 767 adjusted r2 0 415 f1 64 47 2 p 0 001 the 3d mapping figure created by origin 2018 fig 8 reveals the quantitative relationship among dtp zmix sdldepth and chl a by showing that the high concentrations of dtp and deep zmix sdldepth resulted in higher levels of chl a in gaoyang lake during the sampling period 4 discussion 4 1 water column stability and the development of habs in dammed rivers this study demonstrates how physical processes such as the onset of surface stratification in canyon reservoirs determined the seasonality of algal blooms furthermore the strength and duration of the sdl regulated p availability even in a hyper eutrophic system like the tgr the formation of the surface density layer or surface metalimnion increases water temperature such that optimal temperatures for species associated with habs are achieved early in the year most microalgae are capable of carrying out photosynthesis and growth under temperatures between 15 c and 30 c with optimal conditions between 20 c and 25 c raven geider 1988 however microalgae need optimal light and temperature combinations to achieve maximal growth rates singh singh 2015 recent studies conclude that a saturated light environment enhances the thermal tolerance of psii of microalgae abu ghosh et al 2020 therefore the formation of the sdl provides the optimal temperature and light conditions for the growth of cyanobacteria much earlier in the year than what is observed in other temperate lakes chen et al 2013 ai et al 2023 the sdl also restricts the diffusion of nutrients from the lower water column to the upper surface waters where the bloom is contained diehl 2002 zhou et al 2020 prolonged sdl periods can limit the development of severe algal blooms with the depletion of bioavailable p within the sdl figs 4 5 8 chl a and tp in the surface layer were significantly correlated supporting the conclusion that most of the phosphorus was tied up in algal cells microcystis aeruginosa a species of cyanobacteria which is considered to be tolerant to relatively low phosphorus concentrations stopped growing when dtp concentrations were lower than 10 µg l 1 yuan et al 2019 explaining the low chl a during the sdl existence this study demonstrates that rapid temporal variations in thermal structure can play a critical role in the formation size and duration of algal blooms in canyon reservoirs like the tgr when sdls are broken or weakened by atmospheric events or by water drawdown nutrients are transported from the lower water column into the euphotic zone to enhance the development of further algal blooms zhang et al 2020 li et al 2021 4 2 mitigating effect of sdls to summer algal blooms since the construction of the tgr the algal blooms of gaoyang lake have been confined to the spring period zhang et al 2020 xiang et al 2021 tan et al 2022 this study relates this observation to the formation of the sdl the growth of algae in the reservoir is much reduced in the summer probably as the result of both nutrient deficiency and high water temperatures 30 c tan 2020 zhang et al 2020 some studies have further attributed the low frequency of summer algal blooms in tgr tributaries xiang et al 2021 to the relatively high water flow velocities during water drawdown there is very strong evidence that physical processes are just as important as nutrient concentrations in the development of habs in the tgr ji et al 2017 the formation of the sdl determines both the timing and severity of the spring blooms as well as the lack of blooms in the summer as a result of high humidity in tgr area surface water temperatures up to 33 c are observed in the sdl liu et al 2012 huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 such high temperatures can inhibit algal growth as a result of heat stress under high light and high temperatures 30 35 c m aeruginosa has been observed to increase reactive oxygen species levels and reduce photosynthetic pigment content thus decreasing photosystem ii psii efficiency and resulting in the inhibition of cell growth zheng et al 2020 with the climate change sdls are predicted to develop earlier and become more stable until late summer potentially limiting bloom development throughout most of the year 4 3 sdl and internal nutrient cycling another effect of the sdl is to inhibit oxygen diffusion into the lower water column resulting in hypoxia at the water sediment interface fig 4 fig s3 hypoxic conditions inhibit bioturbation and decrease mineralization rates of organic matter even within short periods of a few days jessen et al 2017 previous studies have reported that fe al p is the major p form in the sediment of gaoyang lake ranging from 0 384 to 0 47 g kg 1 jiang et al 2017 during the algal season in tgr the general decreasing b do fig s3 could enhance the transformation from fe3 to fe2 resulting in soluble phosphorus released from fe bounded p in sediment tammeorg et al 2022 as observed in the increasing trend of sap in this study fig s3 episodic surface cooling events led to the decreased rwcs on may 7th such events have the possibility to increase algal sinking rates moving algal cells out of the euphotic depth and into the lower water column fig 3b fig 6b marce et al 2007 chl a concentration in the surface layer however increased more than 4 times within 48 h as a result of the re suspended algal biomass and nutrient replenishment from the lower water column kratz myers 1955 kurmayer kutzenberger 2003 4 4 management of habs in reservoirs sdls have been observed in the other 1st order tributaries in the tgr for example xiangxi bay xxb in xiangxi river the second 1st order tributary from the three gorges dam tgd developed an sdl in april li et al 2021 and august which was originally referred to as an extremely shallow mixing depth liu et al 2012 due to its location close to the tgd xxb is frequently intruded by the main stem of the yangtze limiting the persistence of the sdl li et al 2021 the study demonstrates how the formation and episodic weakening of sdls in canyon reservoirs played a major role in determining the timing duration and size of algal blooms the formation of the sdl aids algal cells to remain in the euphotic zone and achieve faster growth rates in response to optimal temperatures reached earlier in the year compared with that commonly observed in natural lakes however the sdl limits diffusion resulting in nutrient limitation even in hyper eutrophic systems the importance of sdls in canyon reservoirs can provide the opportunity to manage the timing and size of blooms in this study alteration of the sdl was dependent on a weather event but water management processes such as drawdown and artificial mixing can also regulate the formation and intensity of sdls thereby enhancing our ability to prevent or at least limit the development of habs further research should focus on physical chemical dynamics within sdls 5 conclusions our results demonstrate that the sdl phenomenon observed in canyon reservoirs and other systems with restricted wind mixing can regulate the timing and size of algal blooms it is possible to modify sdl development and duration in the reservoirs and this observation provides the

1911,the management and remediation of algal blooms on a global scale are primarily focused on controlling nutrient inputs with an emphasis on limiting phosphorus inputs from point and non point sources it is well known however that physical factors such as water temperature water column stability and advective flow also play critical roles in the timing and size of algal blooms for nutrient control programs to be effective it is essential to understand the relative importance of hydrological processes associated with nutrient dynamics and bioavailability this study examines the relative importance of physical processes in hyper eutrophic canyon reservoirs in regulating the development of algal blooms we hypothesized that water column stability determines when algal blooms develop as well as the potential size of the bloom to test the hypothesis the study was implemented in gaoyang lake located in the middle of the pengxi river a 1st order tributary in the three gorges reservoir the ce qual w2 model was applied to verify the lacustrine nature of gaoyang lake we sampled the lake for 33 consecutive days from april 15th to may 17th in 2019 algal composition and abundance chlorophyll a concentration and different forms of p from the surface middle and bottom of the water column respectively and available phosphorus in sediment were sampled and measured daily water temperature dissolved oxygen chlorophyll a and water velocity were measured in situ daily we demonstrate that 1 during the initial stratification period a surface density layer sdl was formed as a result of a lack of turbulent wind mixing the formation of the sdl initiated the development of algal blooms as a result of surface optimum temperatures being achieved early in the year although the sdl maintained the algal community within the euphotic zone it also limited nutrient influx to the surface waters resulting in a decline of bioavailable phosphorus 2 surface cooling events however weakened the sdl resulting in enhanced nutrient flux into the upper water column the nutrient supply resulted in the formation of subsequent and more severe algal blooms when the sdl was re established our results demonstrate that physical processes such as the formation and stability of the sdl can be used to predict the occurrence and size of algal blooms in canyon reservoirs to control algal blooms we suggest conducting further research to regulate the development and stability of sdl through interventions such as artificial mixing or flow modification during critical time periods these approaches may provide rapid remediation options for managing harmful algal blooms keywords surface density layer algal blooms phosphorus three gorges reservoir water column stability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction globally harmful algal blooms habs in lakes and reservoirs are typically managed by controlling nutrient inputs from both point and non point sources however lakes and reservoirs have different hydrological processes such as advective flow and water column stability that can affect the development of habs to effectively manage these systems and achieve desired outcomes a better understanding of how physical processes regulate nutrient dynamics and bioavailability is essential this is particularly important for managing harmful algal blooms in reservoirs where modifying physical processes that regulate bloom formation may be possible it is estimated that more than 6 700 dams with backwater surface areas larger than 0 01 km2 have been constructed on the world s rivers lehner et al 2011 messager et al 2016 damming of rivers often causes water deterioration as a result of slow water flow and increased nutrient concentrations dumestre et al 2002 liro 2019 furthermore the development of reservoirs enhances instream metabolism and greenhouse gas emissions chen et al 2020 maavara et al 2020 which substantially changes the role of river systems as reactors liu et al 2022 the global phenomenon of algal blooms in dammed tributaries strongly supports this reactor effect maavara et al 2020 tan et al 2022 reservoirs are commonly situated in river valleys and basin like depressions downing et al 2006 to minimize engineering costs and facilitate water storage examples include itaipu reservoir in brazil lake mead reservoir in the united states and three gorges reservoir tgr in china there are significant differences in the physical chemical and biological dynamics between reservoirs and natural lakes thornton et al 1991 chen et al 2020 middelburg 2020 reservoirs often exhibit both riverine and lacustrine dynamics that regulate water flow and water column stability which are key physical factors modifying the development of algal blooms zhang et al 2020 unlike most lacustrine systems advective water flow and water column stability in reservoirs can be regulated by operational procedures leading to the potential to modify key physical processes that determine the timing and severity of harmful algal blooms for example algal blooms in tgr have been confined to the spring period zhang et al 2020 xiang et al 2021 tan et al 2022 and do not conform to those typically observed in temperate natural lakes where intense algal blooms are confined to the late summer chen et al 2013 ai et al 2023 therefore it is essential to study of the unique physical environments of reservoirs and how these relate to the development and potential management of algal blooms janssen et al 2019 huang et al 2020 song et al 2021 since 2003 the three gorges dam has changed the middle yangtze river into a serpentine canyon reservoir the three gorges reservoir tgr with 1080 km2 reservoir surface and storage of 39 3 billion m3 at the highest water level 175 m above sea level zeng et al 2019 following the impoundment of the dam 50 20 of 40 of the 1st order tributaries in the tgr catchment have developed spring algal blooms yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 xiang et al 2021 toxins from habs in the tgr have been associated with an 11 incidence of liver illness in children li et al 2011 and renal function impairment in adults lin et al 2016 as its name three gorges implies over 95 of the tgr catchment consists of deep canyons with large elevation differences 2000 m between the water surface and surrounding mountain peaks li et al 2001 strong wind events capable of causing surface mixing are rare in the tgr area yang et al 2017 in canyon reservoirs water column stratification differs from most lacustrine systems due to the lack of turbulent wind mixing which results in minimal heat energy transfer down the water column as a result a surface density layer sdl or surface metalimnion is formed at the top of the water column liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 tan et al 2022 although similar surface warming is observed in lakes these events tend to be transient imberger patterson 1989 in the tgr area the surface density layer can persist for days or weeks throughout the spring and summer periods liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 tan et al 2022 to distinguish the difference between transient surface warming and the stable surface temperature layers referred to in this paper the latter structure is defined as the surface density layer sdl zhang et al 2020 tan et al 2022 thermal stratification profiles in water columns determine both the mixing dynamics and internal nutrient cycling that can regulate the formation and size of algal blooms lehman 2014 therefore there is a need to determine how bloom forming algae track changes in the physical chemical environments of reservoirs in order to develop the best remediation strategies we hypothesized that the initiation of algal blooms in canyon reservoirs where wind mixing is severely restricted depends on the timing of the formation of the sdl we further hypothesize that the size and duration of the algal blooms are determined by nutrient diffusion rates into the sdl to test these hypotheses we used the ce qual w2 model to identify the hydrological status of gaoyang lake as a lacustrine system in the middle of the pengxi river a 1st order tributary of the tgr we sampled gaoyang lake for 33 consecutive days to track the development of algal blooms in 2019 this research aimed to quantify the relationship between the formation of the sdl and the initiation and duration of the algal blooms the results of this study will further our understanding on the relative importance of hydrological processes in the timing and severity of harmful algal blooms in canyon reservoirs and how these processes can be modified to manage algal blooms in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1

and a maximum 1 km in width at the high water table as a result of water level regulation in the tgr gaoyang lake alternates between shallow conditions max depth 10 m during the late summer when water is released by the three gorges dam and deep conditions max depth 40 m when water is stored over the winter period zhang et al 2020 the lake depth varied from 17 5 m to 10 m during the sampling period fig 2 with a retention time of 50 70 days zhang et al 2020 huang et al 2022 since 2007 gaoyang lake has produced the most severe algal blooms in the pengxi river guo et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 2020 tan et al 2022 the sampling transect s is in the center of gaoyang lake fig 1d three locations 10 m apart around s were sampled during each sampling event this transect was chosen because of the

application the ce qual w2 model was selected for this study to determine the lacustrine nature of gaoyang lake as it compensated for the changing depth of the water columns frequently observed in the tgr chuo et al 2019 ce qual w2 is a two dimensional laterally averaged hydrodynamic and water quality model which is constructed to simulate relatively long and narrow water bodies exhibiting longitudinal and vertical water quality gradients co developed by the u s army corps of engineers waterways experiment station and portland state university based on applications for more than 500 different water bodies rivers reservoirs lakes sloughs and estuaries under a wide variety of conditions it has been found that the model is able to simulate water temperature hydrodynamics and water quality accurately the computational grid of pengxi river was developed based on the bathymetric and geometric data for the tgr represented by 107 longitudinal segments 500 m in length and 91 vertical layers of 1 m thickness fig s1 the bottom elevation of the confluence was 98 m model widths ranged from 10 to 1750 m the accuracy of the bathymetry data was confirmed by comparing the observed and simulated storage water elevation curves fig s2 px1 px3 downstream px4 middle reach and px5 upstream fig 1c were used to validate the model as shown and explained in figs s1 s2 after validating the ce

modelling procedures were explained in supplementary information including figs s1 s2 2 4 data analysis relative water column stability rwcs is a critical parameter used to evaluate the strength of stratification in the water column the larger the rwcs the more stable the water column tian et al 2012 in this study the influence of silt on water density was ignored tian et al 2012 and the water density corresponding to water temperature was calculated according to formula 1 lawson anderson 2007 1 ρ 1000 1 t 288 9414 508929 2 t 68 12963 t 3 9863 2 where ρ is the density of water kg m 3 and t is the water temperature c the dimensionless parameter rwcs was calculated according to padisak et al 2003 by comparing the density difference between the bottom db and surface ds of the water column to the density difference between 4 c d4 and 5 c d5 of pure water using formula 2 and h is the depth of the water body padisak et al 2003 2 rwcs d b d s d 4 d 5 h correlation analyses were performed

stratification based on in situ water temperature readings fig 2 summarizes the simulated flow streamlines in pengxi river on april 27th may 4th and may 9th 2019 respectively the strongest stratification occurred in the middle of pengxi river gaoyang lake with the highest surface water temperature and thermal density layering became more intense as time progressed below gaoyang lake water intrusion from the yangtze river flowing into the pengxi river at a depth of 5 10 m weakened thermal stratification up to 20 km from the pengxi river confluence upstream of gaoyang lake the water flow was low flowing out along the river bed and limiting water column stratification fig 2a b the results of the ce qual w2 model demonstrate that gaoyang lake was a lacustrine system during the sampling period of this study and that the formation of the sdl was restricted to this reach of the pengxi river 3 2 temporal water column stability during the sampling period longitudinal velocities simulated by the model were small with very little interference from downstream intrusion flow and inflow from upstream verifying the lacustrine characteristics of gaoyang lake fig 3 a the observed water temperature wt ranged from 14 05 to 27 4 c fig 3b wt increased rapidly from april 24th at the surface forming a surface density layer until may 6th when water column stability was relatively higher as indicated by the rwcs fig 3b wt at the surface declined to 23 c as a result of a storm event on may 7th weakening the sdl and leading to surface mixing to a depth of 6 2 m along with a decrease in water column stability fig 3b after may 9th with the rise of wt at the surface the lake re stratified although the rwcs levels remained low as expected zmix sdldepth was significantly negatively correlated with rwcs r 0 759 p 0 01 n 33 fig 3b it is interesting to note that during 11 days out of the 33 sampling days april 18th to 19th april 24th april 26th to 27th may 2nd to 3rd may 11th to 12th and may 16th to 17th the thermal structure of the water column was dominated by the sdls the sdls were stable during the first 22 days april 15th to may 6th of warm weather and were weakened and extended deeper into the water column at the end of this period as a result of the surface water cooling event on may 7th fig 3c the temporal oxygen profiles in the water column were consistent with that of the thermal water column structure fig 4 a b elevated oxygen concentrations reaching super saturation were observed in the sdl as a result of high photosynthetic production and limited diffusion dynamics within sdl fig 4a super saturated concentrations of do were observed on april 27th and on may 2nd at the times of strong surface density layering since the elevated oxygen in water is mainly produced by algal photosynthesis ignjatovic 1968 the oxygen profiles reveal that photosynthetic activity was mainly confined to the upper 5 m of the water column with evidence of photo inhibition observed during periods of both strong and weak stratification fig 4b of interest with respect to nutrient recycling is that the hypoxia in the lower water column persisted throughout the sampling period fig 4a b 3 3 p dynamics in water column and sediment the molar ratio of tn to tp throughout the water column ranged from 15 to 75 indicating that gaoyang lake was a p limited system fig 5 a tp concentrations in the surface and lower water column changed rapidly during the study period fig 5b c d with the formation of the sdl april 24th to may 6th surface dtp concentrations followed a downward trend reaching low levels e g 4 4 µg l 1 between may 1st and may 7th when dip concentrations were below detection fig 5b the concentrations of surface pp ranged from 1 to 394 µg l 1 accounting for 3 to 97 of tp in the surface waters figs 5 6 concentrations of dtp in the bottom layer b dp 10 101 µg l 1 were higher than those in the surface s dp 4 60 µg l 1 but they were statistically significantly and positively correlated with each other p 0 05 n 33 fig 5 interestingly b dp was significantly negatively correlated with the sediment available phosphorous sap

surface cooling event the tp content of the sediment stp sap and som all showed increasing trends during the sampling period while the bottom dissolved oxygen b do showed a general decreasing trend during the sampling season fig s3 the difference in the internal phosphorus circles among weak and strong stratification and sdls are summarized in fig s4 3 4 daily changes in chl a and algal biomass during the 33 day daily sampling period the chl a concentration across the three sampling depths ranged from 5 3 to 413 2 µg l 1 fig 6a the concentration of chl a in the bottom layer 5 3 147 µg l 1 was significantly lower than that observed in the surface 10 2 413 2 µg l 1 and middle layers 9 2 222 9 µg l 1 p 0 05 for both table s2 respectively the surface and middle layers had similar chl a temporal dynamic and the correlation coefficient between these two layers chl a content was 0 8 n 33 p 0 01 chl a concentrations during the may 1st 7th period achieved relatively high levels 250 ugl 1 before the surface cooling event of may 7th the surface cooling event resulted in the water mass sinking lower in the column therefore diluting the algal biomass after may 7th the surface algal biomass declined fig 6a b by may 9th the surface density layer was in the process of re establishing fig 3b and chl a concentrations exceeded 400ug l 1 fig 6a cyanophytes dominated the phytoplankton fig s5 with microcystis marginata being the most abundant species tan 2020 as m marginata lacks gas vacuoles for buoyancy regulation it is probable that the density layer was critical to its ability to stay within the euphotic depth 3 m the correlation coefficient between the cell density of m marginata and chl a was not significant p greater than 0 05 n 11 the cell density of m marginata on may 9th was approximately 15 times that observed on may 8th fig s6 pp was significantly positively correlated with chl a r 0 649 n 33 p 0 01 in the surface layer concentrations of chl a and tp in the

created by origin 2018 fig 8 reveals the quantitative relationship among dtp zmix sdldepth and chl a by showing that the high concentrations of dtp and deep zmix sdldepth resulted in higher levels of chl a in gaoyang lake during the sampling period 4 discussion 4 1 water column stability and the development of habs in dammed rivers this study demonstrates how physical processes such as the onset of surface stratification in canyon reservoirs determined the seasonality of algal blooms furthermore the strength and duration of the sdl regulated p availability even in a hyper eutrophic system like the tgr the formation of the surface density layer or surface metalimnion increases water temperature such that optimal temperatures for species associated with habs are achieved early in the year most microalgae are capable of carrying out photosynthesis and growth under temperatures between 15 c and 30 c with optimal conditions between 20 c and 25 c raven geider 1988 however microalgae need optimal light and temperature combinations to achieve maximal growth rates singh singh 2015 recent studies conclude that a saturated light environment enhances the thermal tolerance of psii of microalgae abu ghosh et al 2020 therefore the formation of the sdl provides the optimal temperature and light conditions for the growth of cyanobacteria much earlier in the year than what is observed in other temperate lakes chen et al 2013 ai et al 2023 the sdl also restricts the diffusion of nutrients from the lower water column to the upper surface waters where the bloom is contained diehl 2002 zhou et al 2020 prolonged sdl periods can limit the development of severe algal blooms with the depletion of bioavailable p within the sdl figs 4 5 8 chl a and tp in the surface layer were significantly correlated supporting the conclusion that most of the phosphorus was tied up in algal cells microcystis aeruginosa a species of cyanobacteria which is considered to be tolerant to relatively low phosphorus concentrations stopped growing when dtp concentrations were lower than 10 µg l 1 yuan et al 2019 explaining the low chl a during the sdl existence this study demonstrates that rapid temporal variations in thermal structure can play a critical role in the formation size and duration of algal blooms in canyon reservoirs like the tgr when sdls are broken or weakened by atmospheric events or by water drawdown nutrients are transported from the lower water column into the euphotic zone to enhance the development of further algal blooms zhang et al 2020 li et al 2021 4 2 mitigating effect of sdls to summer algal blooms since the construction of the tgr the algal blooms of gaoyang lake have been confined to the spring period zhang et al 2020 xiang et al 2021 tan et al 2022 this study relates this observation to the formation of the sdl the growth of algae in the reservoir is much reduced in the summer probably as the result of both nutrient deficiency and high water temperatures 30 c tan 2020 zhang et al 2020 some studies have further attributed the low frequency of summer algal blooms in tgr tributaries xiang et al 2021 to the relatively high water flow velocities during water drawdown there is very strong evidence that physical processes are just as important as nutrient concentrations in the development of habs in the tgr ji et al 2017 the formation of the sdl determines both the timing and severity of the spring blooms as well as the lack of blooms in the summer as a result of high humidity in tgr area surface water temperatures up to 33 c are observed in the sdl liu et al 2012 huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 such high temperatures can inhibit algal growth as a result of heat stress under high light and high temperatures 30 35 c m aeruginosa has been observed to increase reactive oxygen species levels and reduce photosynthetic pigment content thus decreasing photosystem ii psii efficiency and resulting in the inhibition of cell growth zheng et al 2020 with the climate change sdls are predicted to develop earlier and become more stable until late summer potentially limiting bloom development throughout most of the year 4 3 sdl and internal nutrient cycling another effect of the sdl is to inhibit oxygen diffusion into the lower water column resulting in hypoxia at the water sediment interface fig 4 fig s3 hypoxic conditions inhibit bioturbation and decrease mineralization rates of organic matter even within short periods of a few days jessen et al 2017 previous studies have reported that fe al p is the major p form in the sediment of gaoyang lake ranging from 0 384 to 0 47 g kg 1 jiang et al 2017 during the algal season in tgr the general decreasing b do fig s3 could enhance the transformation from fe3 to fe2 resulting in soluble phosphorus released from fe bounded p in sediment tammeorg et al 2022 as observed in the increasing trend of sap in this study fig s3 episodic surface cooling events led to the decreased rwcs on may 7th such events have the possibility to increase algal sinking rates moving algal cells out of the euphotic depth and into the lower water column fig 3b fig 6b marce et al 2007 chl a concentration in the surface layer however increased more than 4 times within 48 h as a result of the re suspended algal biomass and nutrient replenishment from the lower water column kratz myers 1955 kurmayer kutzenberger 2003 4 4 management of habs in reservoirs sdls have been observed in the other 1st order tributaries in the tgr for example xiangxi bay xxb in xiangxi river the second 1st order tributary from the three gorges dam tgd developed an sdl in april li et al 2021 and august which was originally referred to as an extremely shallow mixing depth liu et al 2012 due to its location close to the tgd xxb is frequently intruded by the main stem of the yangtze limiting the persistence of the sdl li et al 2021 the study demonstrates how the formation and episodic weakening of sdls in canyon reservoirs played a major role in determining the timing duration and size of algal blooms the formation of the sdl aids algal cells to remain in the euphotic zone and achieve faster growth rates in response to optimal temperatures reached earlier in the year compared with that commonly observed in natural lakes however the sdl limits diffusion resulting in nutrient limitation even in hyper eutrophic systems the importance of sdls in canyon reservoirs can provide the opportunity to manage the timing and size of blooms in this study alteration of the sdl was dependent on a weather event but water management processes such as drawdown and artificial mixing can also regulate the formation and intensity of sdls thereby enhancing our ability to prevent or at least limit the development of habs further research should focus on physical chemical dynamics within sdls 5 conclusions our results demonstrate that the sdl phenomenon observed in canyon reservoirs and other systems with restricted wind mixing can regulate the timing and size of algal blooms it is possible to modify sdl development and duration in the reservoirs and this observation provides the opportunity to develop hab management programs that can be implemented immediately by altering flow regimes or water column stability as compared with the lag time associated with nutrient control

1912,conceptual rainfall runoff crr models are widely used tools in climate change impact studies however the assumption that hydroclimate variables are stationary is no longer justifiable when input forcing is significantly different from the hydro climatological conditions used in model building it is particularly important to identify and discard such modelling that are unsuitable for future prediction in a calibration evaluation strategy previous literatures have thoroughly investigated the implications of climate change on catchments around the world but a few studies have systematically assessed the transferability of crr models in this paper the transferability of crr models in a climate variability context is reviewed first the development of the data split methods for examining parameter dependence on climate and the associated objective function with model robustness metrics are presented second by comparing the outcomes collectively both the robustness assessment of the classic differential split sample test dsst and its variants such as the large sample generalized split sample test gsst and linkages between model transferability with non stationary climate and with catchment characteristics are explored among others we answer the following questions 1 under which climatic constraints can models empirically be transferred 2 are models more difficult to transfer in catchments with certain characteristics a set of model transferability criteria that explicitly consider potential failure scenarios at different steps in a data splitting approach is established thus a strategy to diagnose model transferability is proposed for routinely assessing the prediction ability of crr models under various climate conditions particularly when results are used to inform adaptation decision making keywords conceptual rainfall runoff modelling model robustness model transferability split sample tests climate variability review data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction impact assessment of climate change on available water resources has become an increasing focus of research throughout the world eisner et al 2017 faramarzi et al 2013 haddeland et al 2014 hattermann et al 2017 krysanova et al 2018 kundzewicz et al 2018 mirzaei et al 2016 jajarmizadeh et al 2016

al 2023 given the projected future large scale changes to the global climate system culley et al 2016 milly et al 2008 researchers would calibrate a hydrological model using historical runoff data and then drive it with climate series generated by general circulation model gcm simulations using the same ideal parameter values the impact of climate change on runoff is determined by comparing projected and recorded runoff chiew et al 2009 vaze teng 2011 however an underlying assumption is that hydrological models developed in the past are still viable for future use under changing climatic conditions potential climate fluctuations may exceed observed variability when hydrological models are deployed to conditions other than those used for training refsgaard et al 2014 seibert 2003 statistical features e g expected value variance and coefficient of variation of hydroclimate variables may change with time and become a deterministic function of time non stationary koutsoyiannis montanari 2015 although climate models and future emissions have been identified to be the two most significant sources of uncertainty in the hydrological modelling chain kay et al 2009 maurer 2007 mirzaei et al 2014 teng et al 2012 numerous publications have pointed out that the uncertainty in hydrological modelling caused by the non stationarity of catchment conditions can also be substantial brigode et al 2013 chawla mujumdar 2018 coron et al 2012 faghih et al 2017 fowler et al 2016 huang et al 2016a huang et al 2016b leta et al 2015 melsen et al 2018 ng et al 2019 poulin et al 2011 wilby 2005 in order to define the usually conceptually ambiguous non stationarity beven 2016 has outlined many types of sources that result in non stationarity in this paper non stationarity refers to changes in catchment conditions over time that result in variability of hydrological model parameters this variability often depends on the duration of the data used for estimation since it is no longer valid to assume the stationarity in hydroclimate variables in a changing climate hydrologic model parameters conditioned on historical record could become less trustworthy for future projections ng et al 2020 milly et al 2008 stephens et al 2020 vaze et al 2010 westra et al 2014 several studies have already observed the impact of seasonal variation on model simulation for example a study of the parameter evolution of a five parameter lumped model in a uk catchment demonstrates that different optimal parameter values are required for governing the rapid water transfer during the summer and rain storm seasons wagener et al 2003 clustered seasonal periods of the south korean catchment using hydrological similarity indexes and by calibrating topmodel parameters for each cluster the optimal set of parameters varied greatly among the clusters experiments by westra et al 2014 in the scott creek catchment showed improved model predictions when soil storage parameters in the gr4j model varied according to seasonal annual and long term trends during recent decades whether it is seasonal variability or long term climate change many researchers have explored the transferability of models between climatically dissimilar periods as the demand for quantitative assessment of the potential consequences of climate variability on runoff grows e g bastola et al 2011 broderick et al 2016 coron et al 2012 gharari et al 2013 gibbs et al 2018 guo et al 2020 hartmann bárdossy 2005 li et al 2012 merz et al 2011 seiller et al 2012 seiller et al 2015 thirel et al 2015 mirzaei et al 2013 mirzaei et al 2015 mirzaei et al 2021 some studies highlighted the limitations of transferring parameters between climatically contrasting periods either in a limited number of cases or by utilizing a large amount of catchments and or models that would allow general conclusions to be drawn on this subject overall the performance of calibrated models often declines when they are used to predict behaviors outside of the calibration period using the same parameter set bastola et al 2011 broderick et al 2016 coron et al 2012 guo et al 2020 kling et al 2015 li et al 2012 merz et al 2011 vaze et al 2010 zheng et al 2018 as there is a degradation in performance from calibration to evaluation that is difficult to eliminate due to the approximation of the model inputs parameters and structure thus a model lack of robustness often referred to as low transferability hartmann bárdossy 2005 can be attributed to the combined effects of uncertainties caused by input errors model structure and parameter non uniqueness broderick et al 2016 this additional uncertainty associated with the model transferability induced by complex interactions between catchment characteristics and climate fluctuations is much more obvious when rainfall runoff models are run under drastically different hydroclimatic conditions than those used for calibration merz et al 2011 o et al 2020 vaze et al 2010 therefore it is crucial to account for model transferability when evaluating and interpreting model results rainfall runoff models can be broadly classified into empirical conceptual and physically based models with increasing complexity furthermore based on the spatial structure of catchment processes in the model these can also be classified as lumped semi distributed and fully distributed models in the existing literature the issue of transferability across calibration and evaluation periods has been primarily examined for lumped daily conceptual rainfall runoff crr models e g broderick et al 2016 coron et al 2012 gibbs et al 2018 guo et al 2020 however the transferability of crr models under contrasting climate conditions still lacks strong interpretations and generalizations therefore faced with numerous unknowns regarding this topic there is an apparent need for more robust rainfall runoff modelling to ensure that operational model applications forecasting design etc deliver reliable results where nonstationary conditions are explicitly taken into account the unsolved problems in hydrology no 19 in the paper by blöschl et al 2019 in this paper we present a literature review 1 to provide an overview of the development of most generally used strategy to allocate data for calibration and evaluation sect 2 2 to present objective functions and metrics for assessment of model robustness used in model transferability studies sect 3 3 to illustrate the robustness of crr models under similar contrasting climate configurations and the empirical climatic constraints under which models can be transferred sect 4 1 4 to discuss the robustness of crr models under climate induced changes in catchment response sect 4 2 5 to propose a strategy for diagnosing model transferability sect 5 and we close with conclusions sect 6 we note that the temporal transferability of crr models is a concept that is inextricably linked to model robustness and we use it here interchangeably throughout the paper 2 split sample method model calibration and evaluation are key components in assessing the robustness of hydrological models the most generally used strategy to allocate data for calibration and evaluation is the split sample method sst which divides measured data into two sections it is applicable when catchment conditions are steady and adequate data are available for model testing refsgaard 2001 however to illustrate the potential loss of model performance under different environmental conditions the differential split sample test dsst introduced by klemeš 1986 has become a common testing approach for examining parameter dependence on climate and the associated ramifications for model performance 2 1 differential split sample test differential split sample test dsst is a subset of the split sample test sst which divides the whole available data into two sections for calibration and evaluation periods based on their climatic differences dsst is recommended anytime a model is to simulate flows in a gauged catchment under conditions other than those observed in the existing flow record e g future scenarios land use change groundwater abstraction daggupati et al 2015 it uses statistical analysis to split the reference historical period into two subperiods with contrasting climates such as the wettest and driest years of historical period in this regard dsst has become a standard scheme for testing model transferability chiew et al 2009 de vos et al 2010 donnelly makowecki moore 1999 luo et al 2012 refsgaard knudsen 1996 ruelland et al 2015 seibert 2003 seiller et al 2012 vaze et al 2010 vormoor et al 2018 wilby 2005 wu johnston 2007 xu 1999 the application of dsst however presupposes that periods of previous climatic variability can be utilized to project future climate change which has inherent drawbacks fowler et al 2018a klemeš 1986 stephens et al 2020 found that dsst assessments of hydrologic data that use historical climate variability as a proxy for future change are likely to underestimate the uncertainty associated with climate change in addition a third performance evaluation period distinct from the calibration and evaluation periods is rarely included which makes it difficult to properly understand how crr models behave under climate variability arsenault et al 2018 however given our inability to project the unseen future this may still be the best course of action today refsgaard et al 2014 2 2 other split sample test variations many variants of the dsst approaches have evolved over the recent decades and have been applied to numerous hydrological modelling studies however the use of dsst only exists in a limited number of transfer experiments thus the outcomes are not necessarily comparable moreover differing data segmentation methods can have a substantial effect on model performance notably the model s capacity to reliably recreate the mean and variability of runoff guo et al 2020 in order to get robust interpretations and generalizations on model transferability a large sample hydrology approach gupta et al 2014 is necessary to test the model in as many and diverse climatic configurations as possible including climatic configurations that are similar and distinct between calibration and evaluation e g coron et al 2012 guo et al 2018 vormoor et al 2018 a generalized split sample test gsst and associated analysis tools were proposed by coron et al 2012 which allow for extensive calibration evaluation work by sampling independent subperiods based on a continuous moving window over historical period this enabled the conduct of further evaluation exercises and a more in depth examination of observed climate variability in 216 catchments in australia in fact the gsst was not created with the explicit purpose of identifying contrasted periods but instead to present a spectrum of climatic scenarios ranging from similar to contrasted dakhlaoui et al 2019 rather than sampling continuous time periods discontinuous sub periods consisting of independent hydrological years were considered in order to create more distinct and differentiated time periods for example seiller et al 2012 used five non continuous hydrologic years to obtain four contrasted climate conditions based on annual precipitation and temperature dry warm dry cold humid warm humid cold coron 2013 bring forward a random bootstrap sst in which subperiods are generated according to a bootstrap using randomly selected combinations of discontinuous years for calibration and evaluation see also arsenault et al 2018 dakhlaoui et al 2017 proposed a four subperiod dsst by combining mean annual temperature and precipitation data to generate four climate contradictory subperiods hot wet hot dry cold wet and cold dry further dakhlaoui et al 2019 continued to present a general differential split sample test gdsst based on coupling the random bootstrap sst and four subperiod dsst technique which allows for a large number of evaluationtestswhile taking into extremely divergent situations compared to three other existing data splitting approaches the split sample test techniques have been summarized by dakhlaoui et al 2019 in table 1 which is reprinted here 2 3 calibration period selection for daily hydrological models many studies indicate that the parameter estimates depend on the choice of calibration period bisselink et al 2016 choi beven 2007 le lay et al 2007 luo et al 2012 myers et al 2021 osuch et al 2015 wagener et al 2003 wu johnston 2007 several split approaches have demonstrated the importance of period selection in resolving the low transferability of hydrological models for example zheng et al 2018 reported segmenting historical data into several pairs for model calibration evaluation using some type of data splitting approach can have a considerable effect on both the quality of the data based hydrological models and the quality of the assessment normally calibration of hydrologic models using full length data sets is regarded as the most robust option because using extended periods can ensure that the climatic and flow variables used for calibration are sufficiently diverse to provide a fair picture of their natural variability for example arnold et al 2012 suggested using a suitably long calibration period that is indicative of a wider range of both wet and dry conditions which is congruous withprevious recommendations e g bastola et al 2011 gupta sorooshian 1985 razavi tolson 2013 sorooshian et al 1983 yapo et al 1996 on the contrary more researchers advocated choosing calibration periods that are similar to future climate conditions usually associated with recent data i e calibration could be undertaken on a subset of the whole data set that exhibits hydroclimatic conditions analogous to those expected during the evaluation period e g daggupati et al 2015 dakhlaoui et al 2019 de vos et al 2010 gibbs et al 2018 juston et al 2009 li et al 2012 moriasi et al 2015 perrin et al 2007 poulin et al 2011 vaze et al 2010 likewise motavita et al 2019 demonstrated that selecting hydrological conditions for a subperiod may be more important than selecting its length these authors suggest that for catchments with similar events patterns shorter calibration periods can sufficiently ensure that all the most relevant information i e events patterns is embedded to represent the future behavioral patterns during the calibration process with regard to crr models sampling the specific subperiod length has been a challenging problem anctil et al 2004 juston et al 2009 perrin et al 2007 razavi tolson 2013 yapo et al 1996 for instance anctil et al 2004 show that a calibration period of 3 5 years allows gr4j to achieve good performance while perrin et al 2007 show that gr4j and topmo models require only one year to obtain stable and robust parameter values li et al 2010 and yapo et al 1996 discovered that eight year datasets are sufficient to obtain stable estimates of crr model performance and parameters and longer calibration data series do not further improve the performance however these studies paid less attention to the choice of data type i e the choice of wet dry conditions for calibration in addition razavi and tolson 2013 showed that model calibration to short data periods reasonably shorter than the full data period results in performances ranging from poor to excellent relying on the representativeness of that period which is often unknown a priori regarding such studies that consider data types and lengths some authors indicate that calibrating crr models during the full period is the optimal strategy for obtaining a robust transferable parameter set arsenault et al 2018 shen et al 2022 singh bárdossy 2012 however the problem with these studies is that they often assume that the range of fluctuations in hydrological processes is stationary and do not explicitly account for the significant effects of changes in input variables a broader empirical assessment is therefore needed to further generalize their key findings obviously using short data periods could provide more contrasted periods using of excessive time periods on the other hand may work against the study s objectives by diluting the contrast between periods and is computationally demanding vaze et al 2010 suggested that the subperiod length should be determined by future climate conditions particularly if future climatic conditions are significantly different from long term historical climate for example models calibrated over extremely short and dry periods 10 years are inadequate to simulate runoff over long wet periods 40 years whereas models calibrated over short wet periods 10 years are suitable for simulating runoff over relatively longer dry periods 20 years or more however most of the studies that adopted the data splitting approach did not clarify the reasons for using specific period lengths dakhlaoui et al 2019 indicated that an 8 year time span was adequate for model calibration given the 30 year reference period they also found that models calibrated on the entire observed period were shown to underestimate the impacts of climate change on runoff by 5 20 compared to those calibrated on sub periods that were close to projected future conditions coron et al 2012 used a consecutive 10 year sliding window with each shifted one year for calibration and independent others for evaluation guo et al 2020 used 50 of the available data that led to calibration periods longer than 15 years chiew et al 2009 demonstrates that a crr model that has been satisfactorily calibrated against streamflow data over a sufficiently extended time period 20 30 years can be used to estimate runoff for a drier or wetter period possibly due to the unique characteristics of the catchments and models employed in those studies there is no clear consensus on the proper calibration length for rainfall runoff models while five to ten years interval were frequently employed in research investigating the transferability of crr models under change coron et al 2012 gelfan et al 2015 guo et al 2018 li et al 2012 merz et al 2011 ruelland et al 2015 sleziak et al 2018 3 calibration criteria and performance measures 3 1 objective function model performance was found to vary considerably depending on the evaluation criteria used thyer et al 2009 in model transferability studies it is common practice in crr modeling to optimize models to least squares metrics such as the widely used nash sutcliffe efficiency nse guo et al 2018 gupta et al 2009 li et al 2012 wilby 2005 or its variants such as the kling gupta efficiency kge nse decomposition proposed by gupta et al 2009 dakhlaoui et al 2019 dakhlaoui et al 2017 guo et al 2020 kling et al 2015 mathevet et al 2020 sometimes least squares methods are applied with penalty for model bias to give weight to both dynamic representation and water balance coron et al 2014 li et al 2012 saft et al 2016a vaze et al 2010 viney et al 2009 nevertheless it is nearly impossible for a set of time invariantparameters to accurately reproduce all aspects of a time series of state variables the limitation of least squares methods is that these metrics generally favor parameter sets that provide a better match to higher flow fowler et al 2018b fowler et al 2016 krause et al 2005 which may result in the model selecting parameter values that do not accurately reflect real processes and are not robust to changes in climate conditions berthet et al 2010 consequently modelers have used least squares methods with prior transformed flows which place a greater emphasis on mid to low flows to offset the influence of high flows broderick et al 2016 oudin et al 2006 fowler et al 2018b argue that in future projections of drier periods it is even more important to pay attention to periods of low and medium flows as these are the closest available simulations of future climate and therefore cannot be ignored as containing the most relevant information they recommend that future research could avoid least squares methods in drying climates such as catchments with high hydroclimatic variability in australia moreover hartmann and bárdossy 2005 demonstrated that calibration using only shorter time intervals days weeks or months does not detect all changed signal to ensure the transferability of a hydrological model it is essential to use objective functions that incorporate longer time periods than daily values consequently other objective functions that are relatively more advantageous such as meta objective functions combined with different time steps or flow regimes beven 2006 fowler et al 2018b gharari et al 2013 liu et al 2009 zhang et al 2011 and multiple objective functions efstratiadis koutsoyiannis 2010 should be taken into account in transferability studies of models under changing climate it should be noted that prolonged droughts have been observed in catchments in regions like southeastern australia or north african nations which exhibit long term regional non stationarity sellami et al 2016 however this paper does not propose a complete abandonment of least squares methods in all climate change studies as their application in high flow regimes may still be useful there is no unanimity over the objective function for runoff projections the selection of the objective function is mostly determined by the purpose of the research also the transferability of the model can be enhanced by varying model parameters according to changing conditions pathiraja et al 2016 xiong et al 2019 zeng et al 2019 improving model structures fowler et al 2020 fowler et al 2021 westra et al 2014 using a muti model ensemble broderick et al 2016 marshall et al 2007 seiller et al 2012 and improving calibration schemes gaborit et al 2015 stephens et al 2019 3 2 robustness assessment metric metrics for model robustness assessment are related to performance measures of model transfer from one state to another which are vital for model selection and uncertainty estimation bennett et al 2013 and moriasi et al 2015 have provided a full explanation of model performance indicators and criteria in the temporal context the bias and nse are useful metrics to assess crr model robustness the relative formulation of bias has the advantage of providing values that are comparable across time periods and catchments nse and its modified version are also commonly used by hydrologists to quantify the degradation in the model evaluation results which determine if a model can effectively reproduce the hydrologic response over a pair of contrasted periods guo et al 2020 assessed the robustness of the crr models based on variation in the values ofkge and its three factors across all data splits for all catchments since all exercises are tested on the same evaluation period these metrics values for multiple calibration periods but a single evaluation period can be directly compared to illustrate the superiority of one parameter set over another each performance metric emphasizes a different component of a hydrograph and applying a particular performance metric often entails discounting one aspect in favor of another as previously mentioned the least squares evaluation metrics such as nse rmse and kge are volume dependent and their ability to identify crr models that are robust to changing catchment flow regimes is limited to overcome the noted challenges another metrics such as coron et al 2012 established a model robustness criterion mrc that can be fully comparable across a wide range of climate catchment scale and dynamic conditions they stated that the mrc values should not be significantly affected by the imperfect fit of the model to a specific period caused by data and model structure errors gelfan and millionshchikova 2018 introduced an enhanced nse criterion which take seasonal or annual trend into consideration to calibrate and evaluate a physically based model performance under the application of dsst climatically contrasting periods the significance test proved the model was robust when assessing climate change implications on annual and monthly runoff in selenga river basin royer gaspard et al 2021 proposed a proxy for model robustness pmr without implementing dsst which can be achieved with a single calibration of a hydrological model and is applicable to any type of hydrological model however the majority of studies assessing model transferability employ a single performance metric which limits the ability to gauge the overall robustness of a model hence it cannot be assumed that a model is entirely robust if only one performance indicator transfers well we advocate for further development of novel or multi criteria methods to assess model transferability as this is often contingent upon the definition of model robustness and may exceed the scope of conventional split sample tests 4 model transferability associated with climatic and catchment characteristics hydrologists have linked low model transferability to time variations in some catchments with the majority of the studies using procedure like dsst gsst focusing on the contrasting conditions dry wet warm cool between the calibration and evaluation periods bastola et al 2011 coron et al 2012 dakhlaoui et al 2019 fowler et al 2018b hartmann bárdossy 2005 however despite they provide various flexibility in terms of crr model structure and the number of parameters even the most sophisticated models utilized remain conceptual and empirical to some extent due to their insufficient information and observation on the genuine behavior of the hydrologic system coron et al 2011 mount et al 2016 murphy et al 2006 the relative simplicity of the crr models and the need to calibrate their parameters on a reference period do not always justify their application when conditions deviate beyond the range of previous experience hublart et al 2015 guo et al 2020 discovered that poor performance robustness in drier catchments is more likely due to model parameter inadequacies than poor parameter identifiability whereas vaze et al 2010 discovered the additional parameters in certain model e g the sacramento model have little effect compared to other lumped conceptual models when the calibrated model is used for any period other than the calibration period newman et al 2017 found that physically motivated model with expanded degrees of freedom in parameters improve the performance of the model but the model transferability is compromised hence constructing andcalibrating the model to obtain physically meaningful values for its parameters at multiple spatial and temporal scales is difficult and remains a holy grail of hydrological science even so the model predictive ability in the face of climate change does not help to improve as models become more complicated similar behavior can be found between sophisticated conceptual distributed model and parsimonious lumped models with respect to reproducing runoff breuer et al 2009 karlsson et al 2014 refsgaard knudsen 1996 just as mathevet et al 2020 observed simulation performance depend more on the hydro meteorological conditions of a given period than on the complexity of the model structure in practice conceptual models representing the functioning of the catchments using simplified descriptions of physical processes with very few free parameters are often preferred not surprisingly a significant difference can still be detected between individual conceptual model structures when driven by the same downscaled climate change projections despite the models similar performance under observed conditions bastola et al 2011 the reason is that the capacity of model parameter estimation could be hampered by situations such as the quality or availability of inputs changes model structures as well as challenges associated with parameterization and parameter transferability under non stationary conditions popular examples of conceptual models used in such studies include the gr4j perrin et al 2003 gr4jmod hughes et al 2013 simhyd chiew et al 2002 ihacres jakeman et al 1990 ihacre cmd croke jakeman 2004 awbm boughton 2004 sacramento burnash 1995 the hbv model bergström lindström 2015 seibert bergström 2022 and so forth a recent review on the development of runoff models can be found in peel and mcmahon 2020 but determining a priori which conceptual model structure is most appropriate for a given situation remains a challenging problem in hydrology clark et al 2008 4 1 model transferability associated with climatic characteristics typically model parameters are employed as a function of climate characteristics to validate the transferability of the model under contrasting climatic conditions the primary variables utilized to classify subperiods of various climatic conditions are precipitation p temperature t and potential evapotranspiration pet bastola et al 2011 coron et al 2012 dakhlaoui et al 2019 fowler et al 2018b hartmann bárdossy 2005 li et al 2012 refsgaard knudsen 1996 seiller et al 2012 vaze et al 2010 other variables such as the aridity index runoff streamflow the number of extreme rain or drought events etc were also used to select corresponding periods brigode et al 2013 motavita et al 2019 seibert 2003 singh et al 2011 stephens et al 2019 vormoor et al 2018 osuch et al 2015 quantified correlation between hbv model parameters and nine climatic indices over 5 years sliding windows and found that water related indices mean precipitation p mean wet day precipitation pw and temperature related indices mean potential evapotranspiration pet have the most significant influence on the corresponding hbv model parameters generally these climate indices are utilized independently of one another to cluster contrasting climate periods due to the observed dependency between climatic variables i e pet and t conclusive inference about the individual role performed by any variable could be reached by employing a representation that allowed for the simultaneous display of multiple climate variables see coron et al 2012 overall model performance shows low robustness across splits of calibration assessment data in rainfall runoff modelling bastola et al 2011 broderick et al 2016 coron et al 2014 dakhlaoui et al 2017 guo et al 2020 kling et al 2015 merz et al 2011 seiller et al 2012 vaze et al 2010 4 1 1 model transferability under contrast and similar climate conditions model performance is mostly determined by changes in rainfall mainly and temperature between calibration and evaluation periods bastola et al 2011 coron et al 2012 sleziak et al 2018 a common finding is that performance losses were greater for wet to dry transfers than for dry to wet transfers implying that model parameters may be less transferable under drier future conditions broderick et al 2016 dakhlaoui et al 2019 fowler et al 2016 saft et al 2016a saft et al 2016b vaze et al 2010 the difficulties transferring to a drier environment could be attributed to the fact that nonlinearities in hydrological processes are more pronounced and poorly defined under a wetter regime van esse et al 2013 besides using recorded periods as proxies for a drier future may reduce the robustness of the model even further stephens et al 2020 in contrast when applied to periods with similar climatic circumstances in terms of temperature and precipitation dakhlaoui et al 2019 derived that the three rainfall runoff models used in northern tunisia were robust similarly li et al 2012 used average precipitation to divide climate periods and concluded that to simulate runoff under wet dry climate conditions calibration should also be performed over similar historical wet dry periods see also bisselink et al 2016 broderick et al 2016 stephens et al 2019 reported predictive improvement between climatically similar subsets in terms of reconnaissance drought index rdi over 164 australian catchments on the contrary motavita et al 2019 suggested calibrating solely on dry hydrologic conditions would be the most reliable strategy for predicting any conditions wet dry or mixed however even though the parameters were shifted to another time frame with similar climates the robustness of the model yielded minimal degradation compared to calibration coron et al 2012 saying that average conditions such as the total rainfall can remain stable between the two periods whereas meaningful differences exist e g daily variability in rainfall and runoff one potential reason is that non stationarity obtained by processes like dsst does not fully represent the genuine non stationarity when simulating climate change implications on future water resources stephens et al 2020 as existing data have been thoroughly explored guo et al 2018 employed a stochastic weather generator to represent a range of plausible rainfall conditions allowing them to test the transferability of three crr models beyond observed records they concluded that drier future conditions displayed less uncertainty in runoff predictions this seems in contrast to prior findings that crr models perform worse when modelling historical dry periods fowler et al 2016 stephens et al 2020 vaze et al 2010 guo et al 2018 described the high potential robustness as a model that has low variability in runoff predictions for each of the synthetic climate scenarios considered however in cases of systematic bias precision in model outputs does not always imply low uncertainty saft et al 2016a indicated that uncertainty from hydrologic modeling is likely to be underestimated when a change in rainfall runoff relationship is prompted by a projected climate change 4 1 2 consequences of model transfer on runoff predictions runoff is a fundamental but critical indication for water resource management in climate change impact studies in this section we attempt to summarize the crr models ability to accurately predict the mean runoff under various climatic conditions in terms of bias values coron et al 2012 found a pattern in all studied models that the total volume bias was influenced by changes in both mean rainfall and potential evapotranspiration they noted that all models showed a tendency to overestimate flows in the validation period when the calibration period was wetter and cooler and to underestimate flows when the calibration period was dryer and warmer fowler et al 2021 suggested model structures based on conceptual buckets failure to accurately track the moisture deficit accumulatingas dry conditions continue resulting in an overestimation of runoff and a possible long term bias under a drier environment such overestimation was also validated by other studies on crr model transferability bastola et al 2011 coron et al 2014 dakhlaoui et al 2019 fowler et al 2018b guo et al 2020 hartmann bárdossy 2005 merz et al 2011 saft et al 2016a singh et al 2011 wilby 2005 moreover guo et al 2020 used kling gupta efficiency to show that the crr models calibrated from wetter periods for drier periods not only overestimated the mean runoff but also underestimated the runoff variation interestingly when subperiods were chosen based on the aridity index brigode et al 2013 noted that using wet calibration subperiods for the dry evaluation subperiods did not produce higher bias between observed and simulated flows than those using dry calibration subperiods although changing climatic environments can lead to degraded performance of crr models the degradation is not equivalent across models and catchments coron et al 2012 observed that a 20 absolute bias was introduced when mean rainfall differed by 10 20 and pe differed by 1 2 between calibration and validation basically in agreement with sleziak et al 2018 saft et al 2016a employed a statistical test to determine if the yearly rainfall runoff connection changed significantly during the dry season and the performance in catchments with or without a significant shift in rainfall runoff interactions was exceedingly variable the average bias among all six lumped conceptual rainfall runoff models was 93 and 10 respectively further research is required to investigate whether these findings are linked to model structure and catchment characteristics 4 1 3 under which climatic constraints can models be transferred based on runoff predictions a significant link between changes in climate variables and model transferability was found when the results from the related literatures were analyzed together follow the literature review in the work done by dakhlaoui et al 2019 although only a few have used sst and its variants to quantify the acceptable climatic changes for model transferability under nonstationary conditions in anticipation of a large number of such studies we attempted to establish an empirical climate constraint assuming that the model can be transferred for usage in alternative future periods table 2 in general precipitation and temperature are the main variables used to determine transferability limits vaze et al 2010 and merz et al 2011 demonstrated that climate variations between calibration and evaluation can have a considerable effect on model performance for example vaze et al 2010 discovered that shifting parameters to a drier future environment was particularly difficult for 61 australian catchments concluding that change in annual mean rainfall of more than 15 drier or 20 wetter 15 to 20 should be avoided similarly bastola et al 2011 discovered that when the difference in annual mean precipitation between the calibration and evaluation periods was less than 10 model transferability was less affected singh et al 2011 established an acceptable range of annual mean precipitation changes 10 to 20 with no discernible influence on model transferability for five catchments across the continental united states dakhlaoui et al 2017 used dsst to assess the transferability of three crr models under concurrent precipitation and temperature variabilityin northern tunisia and discovered that the model robustness became unacceptable when annual mean precipitation decreased by more than 25 and annual mean temperatures increased by more than 1 75 c furthermore sleziak et al 2018 found changes in optimized parameter values over time with a nonlinear relationship between variation in simulated runoff volume and differences in precipitation they postulate that calibrated parameters can only be considered trustworthy when the change in annual mean precipitation is within 10 on the basis of user need through setting the limitations of transferability of the crr models as drop in nse of more than 0 2 and a fluctuation in ve of more than 25 the models are thus roughly transferable for changes in precipitation δp 0 08 δt 0 18 with δp 30 80 and changes in temperature δt 2 c to 2 c dakhlaoui et al 2019 in acknowledging the subjectivity of these limits it is important to consider hydrological conditions and the specific requirements of users such as the need to attain an acceptable level of uncertainty for water resource management in a particular setting under the most stringent criteria an intuitive threshold for acceptable transferability should be a variation in average precipitation and temperature of no more than 10 and 1 75 c respectively as shown in table 2 4 2 model transferability associated with catchment characteristics the crr models contain many parameters with a physical connotation that can be inferred from catchment characteristics and are often calibrated using observed flow data of selected catchments parameters in crr models are designed to accurately represent the physical attributes of the catchment without regard to climate conditions however several model parameters do correspond to transient catchment conditions in fact climate change contributes to the time varying nature of hydrological responses over a range of temporal scales and the simple split sample test always ignores the spatial variability of critical hydrologic components within the catchment this call into question the implicit assumption of long term stability of catchment functioning 4 2 1 confounding impacts of climate change on catchment characteristics when assessing catchment runoff as a result of changing climatic forcing an implicit assumption that is frequently made is that future catchment dynamics can be extrapolated from historical catchment behavior in reality factors that can influence catchment response are likely to be influenced by climate change which makes the estimation of model parameters somewhat time dependent these include changes in the dominant hydrological processes e g climate runoff relation soil moisture regimes greening under wet conditions as well as changes in the timing and intensity of rainfall and drought etc some researchers have examined the relationships between parameter values and hydroclimatic conditions brigode et al 2013 de vos et al 2010 merz et al 2011 wilby 2005 for example rosero et al 2010 discovered that parameters from the noah land surface model were highly influenced by climatic conditions despite the fact that they should be governed solely by physical site factors e g soil and vegetation type these findings are not limited to only a few catchments merz et al 2011 calibrated a crr model to six consecutive 5 year periods in a large sample of catchments 273 catchments in austria and found a significant trend in parameters controlling snow and soil moisture processes associated with changes in the climatic conditions therefore changes in catchment s dominating processes as a result of climate change may render obsolete previously calibrated models the parameter values can actually vary seasonally or over longer time scales in order to forecast future hydrologic conditions it is critical to understand if a prolonged change in climate might result in changes in catchment behavior saft et al 2015 discovered that it is internal catchment dynamics rather than changes in rainfall patterns or the severity of drought that explained a significantly shift in the rainfall runoff relationship in some catchments they also noted that the deterioration in model predictive power was due to changes in rainfall runoff processes as a result of the protracted dry spell instead of a direct decrease in rainfall i e model performance can vary significantly in a catchment that responds differently to rainfall runoff interactions yet experiences a comparable level of rainfall reduction moreover in a virtual catchment experiment stephens et al 2020 concluded that performance changes were associated with a variety of climate change scenarios implying that failing to account for ecological adaptations to future conditions increased temperature and or co2 could increase uncertainty in streamflow simulations in other words neglect of feedbacks catchment adaptation between the hydrological cycle and parameter evolution could introduce a significant amount of inaccuracy into simulations casting doubt on their actual implementation flow simulation forecasting design reservoir management climate change impact assessments etc for better understanding of how changing climatic conditions modified hydrologic systems a deeper knowledge of the biophysical mechanisms pertaining to vegetation soil quality and groundwater that affect rainfall runoff in catchments is required 4 2 2 are models more difficult to transfer in catchments with certain characteristics the manifestation of varying degrees of non stationarity among different catchments is not an unexpected phenomenon gupta razavi 2018 catchment non stationarity can alter the rainfall runoff connection and examples include human activities such as changes in land use land drainage interception and groundwater abstractions as well as changes in response to climate change milly et al 2015 in section 4 1 we already discovered a correlation between climatic differences during calibration and biases in the simulated discharges however we lack information on the degree to which this connection is homogeneous among catchments it is usually difficult to generalize interpretations based on a particular catchment gupta et al 2014 on the other hand the use of one single catchment or model structure can indeed provide detailed hydro climatic process studies but attempts to adequately account for regional variation by establishing model parameters mostly neglect temporal spatial variability in dominating hydrological processes which precludes statistically robust comparisons and categorization of the various hydroclimatic conditions dirmeyer et al 2006 newman et al 2017 for example water limited catchments as opposed to energy limited catchments budyko 1974 may result in a greater responsiveness of flows to precipitation than to potential evapotranspiration and temperature now that large sample studies e g gsst allow for the collection of a large pair of year periods and calibrations can be performed over myriads of catchment conditions coron et al 2012 found that transferred parameters were applicable for various periods in several catchments even with contrasting climates for other catchments a clear correlation between simulation bias and climate changes between calibration and evaluation was discovered the magnitude of model deficiency is somewhat catchment dependent and determined by the impact of differences in climate conditions between periods despite the fact that the literature has not yet fully investigated this issue we were able to correlate the magnitude of these changes with certain catchment properties in this regard coron et al 2012 note that the biggest model transferability failures were in catchments with low annual runoff yield seibert 2003 used dsst to evaluate the reliability of the hbv model extrapolation in snow dominated catchments they reported that years with lower runoff peaks did not yield more accurate results than years with higher runoff peaks saft et al 2015 concluded that large catchments with dry climates low slopes and sparse forest cover were more likely to undergo changes in rainfall runoff relationships during lengthy droughts thus limiting model transferability in such catchments see also tian et al 2018 kling et al 2015 found that when evaluating daily discharge over independent periods the crr model performance in catchments with humid climates was more robust than in semi arid catchments often characterized by strong rainfall non stationarity guo et al 2020 identified 12 catchment attributes in which lower model robustness was correlated with high runoff skewness where the catchments were drier with low runoff and extreme flow events often occurred in particular models calibrated at these catchments often result in low storage capacity estimates wagener 2007 pointed out that to guarantee realistic modelling of environmental change impact strong correlations between model parameters and catchment characteristics should be proved and established however such priori knowledge is not particularly clear at present to this end more research is needed into the spatial extrapolation capabilities of hydrological models by establishing linkages between parameter values and catchments characteristics model parameterization can help mitigate the consequences of changes in these characteristics on model robustness for example de vos et al 2010 clustered input time series based on three variables of hydrological similarity precipitation and its 10 day moving average soil moisture which represent recent input memory and storage dynamics of the catchment respectively allowing parameters to fluctuate over a period of hydrological similarity jeremiah et al 2013 explored the applicability of parameter fluctuations as a function of several catchment characteristics to enhance the modelling performance of hierarchical mixtures of experts hme thus for regionalization purposes in addition to relating parameters with only physical catchment characteristics e g rau et al 2019 we recommend more variables of hydrological similarity be applied along with physical catchment characteristics in a regional clustering strategy to test the extrapolation abilities of parameter sets by transferring them to additional catchments in similar hydroclimatic zones extrapolation in both space and time patil stieglitz 2015 5 a proposed strategy for diagnosing model transferability inspired by previous research especially the work of coron et al 2012 dakhlaoui et al 2019 saft et al 2015 we proposed a strategy for quantitively testing model transferability as shown in fig 1 note that nicolle et al 2021 have presented an efficient robustness assessment test rat as an alternative to the splits sample test the strategy proposed in this paper for diagnosing model transferability is still within the application of classical dsst for the core steps labeled in fig 1 we make several assumptions as following step 1 according to the most stringent criteria table 2 intuitively the model can be considered transferable only if the annual mean precipitation and temperature vary within 10 and 1 75 c respectively this is a criterion that is rather subjective and depending on catchment conditions and model structures the thresholds will evolve over time as the performance metrics progress especially when the hydroclimatic variability is not only expressed in the variation of the mean precipitation and temperature step 2 3 when splitting the data the demand for long term observational data is necessary to provide more contrasted periods under climate variability which will lead to more robust parameterization and increase the likelihood of finding a better representation of future conditions still by using consecutive periods the average precipitation would be smoothed out and the climate disparity between periods would be reduced alternatively using modified climate classification methods e g random bootstrap sst technique gdsst technique coron 2013 dakhlaoui et al 2019 in areas where there are no remarkable trends in one or more climate variables may produce adequately long periods of contrasting pair to take advantage of significant interannual variability step 4 the rainfall runoff relationship can be used to explore potential changes in the hydrologic response of a catchment to climate fluctuations if the rainfall runoff response plotted matches that from other periods we assume that the hydrological processes are consistent with those observed during other periods conversely if the rainfall runoff response displayed deviates from that of other periods hydrological processes are assumed to be different a statistical test would be helpful e g catchments with significant change either upward or downward in the rainfall runoff relationship at the 5 significance level t test result 0 05 can be deemed non transferable alternatively we suggest identifying the rainfall runoff relationship at larger timescales e g annually since it can reflect the cumulative impact of changes at finer timescales resulting from prolonged catchment adaptation for more detail see potter et al 2011 and saft et al 2015 overall while statistical performance measures e g nse pbias are widely used by prior contributions in step 1 to quantify transferability limits we assume that the model cannot satisfy the mathematical ranges does not directly pronounce the model non transferable and thus apply another performance measure the graphical method in step 4 to quantify the statistical significance e g t test between simulation and output response to give the testing model a second chance also these historical analogues are extremely dependent on available data and may thus suffice for shorter future time horizons and lower levels of climate change there is no doubt that these historical runs do not represent the actual transferability of the hydrological model by comparing model predictions across contrasting historical sub periods if the hydrologic model is capable of successfully transferring between past climates thus gives us more confidence in model s capability to forecast similar conditions in the future 6 conclusions previous researches have thoroughly investigated the implications of climate change on catchments around the world but few have systematically assessed the transferability of hydrological models for daily conceptual rainfall runoff crr models the premise of parametric stationarity parameters give practical simulations when applied to hydro climatological conditions distinct from those used for model construction has been frequently questioned this casts doubt on the validity of such parameter transferorthe climatic extrapolation capacity of the model in this article we present the development of the data split method to examine parameter dependence on climate and the associated calibration methods with performance metrics for assessing model robustness to facilitate comparison we summarized together both study of individual cases the classic dsst differential split sample test and the study of large sample methods gsst generalized split sample test the model transferability robustness under non stationary climate and different catchment characteristics are discussed respectively we highlight the importance of exercising caution when assuming model reliability under input forcing that is significantly different from the data used to create the model follow the path done by previous research especially the work done by coron et al 2012 dakhlaoui et al 2019 saft et al 2015 a strategy to diagnose model transferability is proposed in fig 1 although the transferability of crr models seems to vary according to the catchment testing scenario and evaluation criteria used we could still observe some relationships between climate variability and model performance within some catchments when the results were analyzed together based on our overview five general conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the performance of calibrated models often declines when they are used to predict behaviors outside of the calibration period using the same parameter set some researchers have proposed a set of acceptable boundaries for changes in climatic circumstances within which crr models are more likely to produce satisfactory outcomes under the most stringent criteria the crr model can only be considered credible if the variation in annual average precipitation and temperature is within 10 and 1 75 c respectively 2 although the application of dsst has the inherent drawback of presupposing that previous periods of climate variability can be used to predict future climate change yet given that we cannot predict the unseen future this may still be the best course of action for investigating the temporal transferability of hydrologic models in such studies calibration period of five to ten years is frequently employed additionally more studies advised that using a calibration period that closely resembles future climate conditions would ensure all the most relevant information i e events patterns is used to accurately depict future behavioral patterns 3 in terms of changes in rainfall and temperature between calibration and evaluation periods model performance losses were found greater for wet to dry transfers than the other way around implying that model parameters may be less transferable under drier future conditions moreover a possible overestimation of future available water resources in regions expected to be drier includes midlatitude and subtropical arid and semiarid areas around the globe 4 although changes in the mean precipitation often have the greatest impact on the effectiveness of models we highlight that the deterioration in model transferability without drastic environmental change is partially due to direct change in input rainfall in the long run however internal catchment dynamics changes in rainfall runoff processes caused by prolonged catchment adaptation may play the most significant role see saft et al 2015 this is the basis of our proposed strategy to diagnose model transferability that beyond the acceptable thresholds of transferability i e statistical tests of annual rainfall runoff relationships 5 the crr models has limited transferability in catchments characterized by high runoff skewness and low runoff generation which corresponds with the low robustness exhibited by the model in climatically drier conditions therefore the predictive power of crr model calibrated on such catchments should be interpreted with caution however more general conclusions need to be reached in this regard in future studies we underline the importance of implementing such novel strategies in fig 1 for routinely assessing the prediction ability of crr models under various climate conditions particularly when results are used to influence adaptation decision making it is critical for water practitioners using crr models to understand the added uncertainty imposed by non stationarity under scenarios of climate change however additional methodological works are still required on the topic of robustness evaluation in view of the above here we offer the following recommendations 1 developing expanded dsst methodology or more superior data splitting methods that minimize the disadvantages of the existing method as their ability to identify robustness of rainfall runoff models to changing catchment flow regimes is often limited 2 improving the robustness of crr models by employing more adaptable model structural forms or even a multi model ensemble that can cope with a wider range of hydroclimatic conditions 3 exploring a wider range of possible hydroclimatic changes other than mean conditions of climatic characteristics such as increasing decreasing intensity of hydrological regime or temporal distributions 4 in addition to the temporal dynamics of temperature and precipitation a broader variety of simultaneously changing hydroclimatic variables e g solar radiation evapotranspiration wind speed or indicators e g aridity index is necessary to fully characterize the crr models transferability limitations and to compare these limitations to future climate projections 5 additional research for parameter transferability is required to apply similar testing procedures to other hydrological models e g physically based models or a range of catchment types e g water limited vs energy limited 6 assessing more complicated objective functions and developing a novel or multicriteria method for determining model transferability even though this is typically related to how robustness a model is defined and sometimes falls outside the scope of mere split sample test 7 rainfall runoff models can be developed in unmeasured catchments using parameters calibrated at potential donor locations determined on the basis of both physical and climatic similarities 8 continue developing and refining the strategy for diagnosing model transferability under various climate conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
1912,conceptual rainfall runoff crr models are widely used tools in climate change impact studies however the assumption that hydroclimate variables are stationary is no longer justifiable when input forcing is significantly different from the hydro climatological conditions used in model building it is particularly important to identify and discard such modelling that are unsuitable for future prediction in a calibration evaluation strategy previous literatures have thoroughly investigated the implications of climate change on catchments around the world but a few studies have systematically assessed the transferability of crr models in this paper the transferability of crr models in a climate variability context is reviewed first the development of the data split methods for examining parameter dependence on climate and the associated objective function with model robustness metrics are presented second by comparing the outcomes collectively both the robustness assessment of the classic differential split sample test dsst and its variants such as the large sample generalized split sample test gsst and linkages between model transferability with non stationary climate and with catchment characteristics are explored among others we answer the following questions 1 under which climatic constraints can models empirically be transferred 2 are models more difficult to transfer in catchments with certain characteristics a set of model transferability criteria that explicitly consider potential failure scenarios at different steps in a data splitting approach is established thus a strategy to diagnose model transferability is proposed for routinely assessing the prediction ability of crr models under various climate conditions particularly when results are used to inform adaptation decision making keywords conceptual rainfall runoff modelling model robustness model transferability split sample tests climate variability review data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction impact assessment of climate change on available water resources has become an increasing focus of

al 2023 given the projected future large scale changes to the global climate system culley et al 2016 milly et al 2008 researchers would calibrate a hydrological model using historical runoff data and then drive it with climate series generated by general circulation model gcm simulations using the same ideal parameter values the impact of climate change on runoff is determined by comparing projected and recorded runoff chiew et al 2009 vaze teng 2011 however an underlying assumption is that hydrological models developed in the past are still viable for future use under changing climatic conditions potential climate fluctuations may exceed observed variability when hydrological models are deployed to conditions other than those used for training refsgaard et al 2014 seibert 2003 statistical features e g expected value variance and coefficient of variation of hydroclimate variables may change with time and become a deterministic function of time non stationary koutsoyiannis

mirzaei et al 2014 teng et al 2012 numerous publications have pointed out that the uncertainty in hydrological modelling caused by the non stationarity of catchment conditions can also be substantial brigode et al 2013 chawla mujumdar 2018 coron et al 2012 faghih et al 2017 fowler et al 2016 huang et al 2016a huang et al 2016b leta et al 2015 melsen et al 2018 ng et al 2019 poulin et al 2011 wilby 2005 in order to define the usually conceptually ambiguous non stationarity beven 2016 has outlined many types of sources that result in non stationarity in this paper non stationarity refers to changes in catchment conditions over time that result in variability of hydrological model parameters this variability often depends on the duration of the data used for estimation since it is no longer valid to assume the stationarity in hydroclimate variables in a changing climate hydrologic model parameters conditioned on historical record could become less trustworthy for future projections ng et al 2020 milly et al 2008 stephens et al 2020 vaze et al 2010 westra et al 2014 several studies have already observed the impact of seasonal variation on model simulation for example a study of the parameter evolution of a five parameter lumped model in a uk catchment demonstrates that different optimal parameter values are required for governing the rapid water transfer during the summer and rain storm seasons wagener et al 2003 clustered seasonal periods of the south korean catchment using hydrological similarity indexes and by calibrating topmodel parameters for each cluster the optimal set of parameters varied greatly among the clusters experiments by westra et al 2014 in the scott creek catchment showed improved model predictions when soil storage parameters in the gr4j model varied according to seasonal annual and long term trends during recent decades whether it is seasonal variability or long term climate change many researchers have explored the transferability of models between climatically dissimilar periods as the demand for quantitative assessment of the potential consequences of climate variability on runoff grows e g bastola et al 2011 broderick et al 2016 coron et al 2012 gharari et al 2013 gibbs et al 2018 guo et al 2020 hartmann bárdossy 2005 li et al 2012 merz et al 2011 seiller et al 2012 seiller et al 2015 thirel et al 2015 mirzaei et al 2013 mirzaei et al 2015 mirzaei et al 2021 some studies highlighted the limitations of transferring parameters between climatically contrasting periods either in a limited number of cases or by utilizing a large amount of catchments and or models that would allow general conclusions to be drawn on this subject overall the performance of calibrated models often declines when they are used to predict behaviors outside of the calibration period using the same parameter set bastola et al 2011 broderick et al 2016 coron et al 2012 guo et al 2020 kling et al 2015 li et al 2012 merz et al 2011 vaze et al 2010 zheng et al 2018 as there is a degradation in performance from calibration to evaluation that is difficult to eliminate due to the approximation of the model inputs parameters and structure thus a model lack of robustness often referred to as low transferability hartmann bárdossy 2005 can be attributed to the combined effects of uncertainties caused by input errors model structure and parameter non uniqueness broderick et al 2016 this additional uncertainty associated with the model transferability induced by complex interactions between catchment characteristics and climate fluctuations is much more obvious when rainfall runoff models are run under drastically different hydroclimatic conditions than those used for calibration merz et al 2011 o et al 2020 vaze et al 2010 therefore it is crucial to account for model transferability when evaluating and interpreting model results rainfall runoff models can be broadly classified into empirical conceptual and physically based models with increasing complexity furthermore based on the spatial structure of catchment processes in the model these can also be classified as lumped semi distributed and fully distributed models in the existing literature the issue of transferability across calibration and evaluation periods has been primarily examined for lumped daily conceptual rainfall runoff crr models e g broderick et al 2016 coron et al 2012 gibbs et al 2018 guo et al 2020 however the transferability of crr models under contrasting climate conditions still lacks strong interpretations and generalizations therefore faced with numerous unknowns regarding this topic there is an apparent need for more robust rainfall runoff modelling to ensure that operational model applications forecasting design etc deliver reliable results where nonstationary conditions are explicitly taken into account the unsolved problems in hydrology no 19 in the paper by blöschl et al 2019 in this paper we present a literature review 1 to provide an overview of the development of most generally used strategy to allocate data for calibration and evaluation sect 2 2 to present objective functions and metrics for assessment of model robustness used in model transferability studies sect 3 3 to illustrate the robustness of crr models under similar contrasting climate configurations and the empirical climatic constraints under which models can be transferred sect 4 1 4 to discuss the robustness of crr models under climate induced changes in catchment response sect 4 2 5 to propose a strategy for diagnosing model transferability sect 5 and we close with conclusions sect 6 we note that the temporal transferability of crr models is a concept that is inextricably linked to model robustness and we use it here interchangeably throughout the paper 2 split sample method model calibration and evaluation are key components in assessing the robustness of hydrological models the most generally used strategy to allocate data for calibration and evaluation is the split sample method sst which divides measured data into two sections it is applicable when catchment conditions are steady and adequate data are available for model testing refsgaard 2001 however to illustrate the potential loss of model performance under different environmental conditions the differential split sample test dsst introduced by klemeš 1986 has become a common testing approach for examining parameter dependence on climate and the associated ramifications for model performance 2 1 differential split sample test differential split sample test dsst is a subset of the split sample test sst which divides the whole available data into two sections for calibration and evaluation periods based on their climatic differences dsst is recommended anytime a model is to simulate flows in a gauged catchment under conditions other than those observed in the existing flow record e g future scenarios land use change groundwater abstraction daggupati et al 2015 it uses statistical analysis to split the reference historical period into two subperiods with contrasting climates such as the wettest and driest years of historical period in this regard dsst has become a standard scheme for testing model transferability chiew et al 2009 de vos et al 2010 donnelly makowecki moore 1999 luo et al 2012 refsgaard knudsen 1996 ruelland et al 2015 seibert 2003 seiller et al 2012 vaze et al 2010 vormoor et al 2018 wilby 2005 wu johnston 2007 xu 1999 the application of dsst however presupposes that periods of previous climatic variability can be utilized to project future climate change which has inherent drawbacks fowler et al 2018a klemeš 1986 stephens et al 2020 found that dsst assessments of hydrologic data that use historical climate variability as a proxy for future change are likely to underestimate the uncertainty associated with climate change in addition a third performance evaluation period distinct from the calibration and evaluation periods is rarely included which makes it difficult to properly understand how crr models behave under climate variability arsenault et al 2018 however given our inability to project the unseen future this may still be the best course of action today refsgaard et al 2014 2 2 other split sample test variations many variants of the dsst approaches have evolved over the recent decades and have been applied to numerous hydrological modelling studies however the use of dsst only exists in a limited number of transfer experiments thus the outcomes are not necessarily comparable moreover differing data segmentation methods can have a substantial effect on model performance notably the model s capacity to reliably recreate the mean and variability of runoff guo et al 2020 in order to get robust interpretations and generalizations on model transferability a large sample hydrology approach gupta et al 2014 is necessary to test the model in as many and diverse climatic configurations as possible including climatic configurations that are similar and distinct between calibration and evaluation e g coron et al 2012 guo et al 2018 vormoor et al 2018 a generalized split sample test gsst and associated analysis tools were proposed by coron et al 2012 which allow for extensive calibration evaluation work by sampling independent subperiods based on a continuous moving window over historical period this enabled the conduct of further evaluation exercises and a more in depth examination of observed climate variability in 216 catchments in australia in fact the gsst was not created with the explicit purpose of identifying contrasted periods but instead to present a spectrum of climatic scenarios ranging from similar to contrasted dakhlaoui et al 2019 rather than sampling continuous time periods discontinuous sub periods consisting of independent hydrological years were considered in order to create more distinct and differentiated time periods for example seiller et al 2012 used five non continuous hydrologic years to obtain four contrasted climate conditions based on annual precipitation and temperature dry warm dry cold humid warm humid cold coron 2013 bring forward a random bootstrap sst in which subperiods are generated according to a bootstrap using randomly selected combinations of discontinuous years for calibration and evaluation see also arsenault et al 2018 dakhlaoui et al 2017 proposed a four subperiod dsst by combining mean annual temperature and precipitation data to generate four climate contradictory subperiods hot wet hot dry cold wet and cold dry further dakhlaoui et al 2019 continued to present a general differential split sample test gdsst based on coupling the random bootstrap sst and four subperiod dsst technique which allows for a large number of evaluationtestswhile taking into extremely divergent situations compared to three other existing data splitting approaches the split sample test techniques have been summarized by dakhlaoui et al 2019 in table 1 which is reprinted here 2 3 calibration period selection for daily hydrological models many studies indicate that the parameter estimates depend on the choice of calibration period bisselink et al 2016 choi beven 2007 le lay et al 2007 luo et al 2012 myers et al 2021 osuch et al 2015 wagener et al 2003 wu johnston 2007 several split approaches have demonstrated the importance of period selection in resolving the low transferability of hydrological models for example zheng et al 2018 reported segmenting historical data into several pairs for model calibration evaluation using some type of data splitting approach can have a considerable effect on both the quality of the data based hydrological models and the quality of the assessment normally calibration of hydrologic models using full length data sets is regarded as the most robust option because using extended periods can ensure that the climatic and flow variables used for calibration are sufficiently diverse to provide a fair picture of their natural variability for example arnold et al 2012 suggested using a suitably long calibration period that is indicative of a wider range of both wet and dry conditions which is congruous withprevious recommendations e g bastola et al 2011 gupta sorooshian 1985 razavi tolson 2013 sorooshian et al 1983 yapo et al 1996 on the contrary more researchers advocated choosing calibration periods that are similar to future climate conditions usually associated with recent data i e calibration could be undertaken on a subset of the whole data set that exhibits hydroclimatic conditions analogous to those expected during the evaluation period e g daggupati et al 2015 dakhlaoui et al 2019 de vos et al 2010 gibbs et al 2018 juston et al 2009 li et al 2012 moriasi et al 2015 perrin et al 2007 poulin et al 2011 vaze et al 2010 likewise motavita et al 2019 demonstrated that selecting hydrological conditions for a subperiod may be more important than selecting its length these authors suggest that for catchments with similar events patterns shorter calibration periods can sufficiently ensure that all the most relevant information i e events patterns is embedded to represent the future behavioral patterns during the calibration process with regard to crr models sampling the specific subperiod length has been a challenging problem anctil et al 2004 juston et al 2009 perrin et al 2007 razavi tolson 2013 yapo et al 1996 for instance anctil et al 2004 show that a calibration period of 3 5 years allows gr4j to achieve good performance while perrin et al 2007 show that gr4j and topmo models require only one year to obtain stable and robust parameter values li et al 2010 and yapo et al 1996 discovered that eight year datasets are sufficient to obtain stable estimates of crr model performance and parameters and longer calibration data series do not further improve the performance however these studies paid less attention to the choice of data type i e the choice of wet dry conditions for calibration in addition razavi and tolson 2013 showed that model calibration to short data periods reasonably shorter than the full data period results in performances ranging from poor to excellent relying on the representativeness of that period which is often unknown a priori regarding such studies that consider data types and lengths some authors indicate that calibrating crr models during the full period is the optimal strategy for obtaining a robust transferable parameter set arsenault et al 2018 shen et al 2022 singh bárdossy 2012 however the problem with these studies is that they often assume that the range of fluctuations in hydrological processes is stationary and do not explicitly account for the significant effects of changes in input variables a broader empirical assessment is therefore needed to further generalize their key findings obviously using short data periods could provide more contrasted periods using of excessive time periods on the other hand may work against the study s objectives by diluting the contrast between periods and is computationally demanding vaze et al 2010 suggested that the subperiod length should be determined by future climate conditions particularly if future climatic conditions are significantly different from long term historical climate for example models calibrated over extremely short and dry periods 10 years are inadequate to simulate runoff over long wet periods 40 years whereas models calibrated over short wet periods 10 years are suitable for simulating runoff over relatively longer dry periods 20 years or more however most of the studies that adopted the data splitting approach did not clarify the reasons for using specific period lengths dakhlaoui et al 2019 indicated that an 8 year time span was adequate for model calibration given the 30 year reference period they also found that models calibrated on the entire observed period were shown to underestimate the impacts of climate change on runoff by 5 20 compared to those calibrated on sub periods that were close to projected future conditions coron et al 2012 used a consecutive 10 year sliding window with each shifted one year for calibration and independent others for evaluation guo et al 2020 used 50 of the available data that led to calibration periods longer than 15 years chiew et al 2009 demonstrates that a crr model that has been satisfactorily calibrated against streamflow data over a sufficiently extended time period 20 30 years can be used to estimate runoff for a drier or wetter period possibly due to the unique characteristics of the catchments and models employed in those studies there is no clear consensus on the proper calibration length for rainfall runoff models while five to ten years interval were frequently employed in research investigating the transferability of crr models under change coron et al 2012 gelfan et al 2015 guo et al 2018 li et al 2012 merz et al 2011 ruelland et al 2015 sleziak et al 2018 3 calibration criteria and performance measures 3 1 objective function model performance was found to vary considerably depending on the evaluation criteria used thyer et al 2009 in model transferability studies it is common practice in crr modeling to optimize models to least squares metrics such as the widely used nash sutcliffe efficiency nse guo et al 2018 gupta et al 2009 li et al 2012 wilby 2005 or its variants such as the kling gupta efficiency kge nse decomposition proposed by gupta et al 2009 dakhlaoui et al 2019 dakhlaoui et al 2017 guo et al 2020 kling et al 2015 mathevet et al 2020 sometimes least squares methods are applied with penalty for model bias to give weight to both dynamic representation and water balance coron et al 2014 li et al 2012 saft et al 2016a vaze et al 2010 viney et al 2009 nevertheless it is nearly impossible for a set of time invariantparameters to accurately reproduce all aspects of a time series of state variables the limitation of least squares methods is that these metrics generally favor parameter sets that provide a better match to higher flow fowler et al 2018b fowler et al 2016 krause et al 2005 which may result in the model selecting parameter values that do not accurately reflect real processes and are not robust to changes in climate conditions berthet et al 2010 consequently modelers have used least squares methods with prior transformed flows which place a greater emphasis on mid to low flows to offset the influence of high flows broderick et al 2016 oudin et al 2006 fowler et al 2018b argue that in future projections of drier periods it is even more important to pay attention to periods of low and medium flows as these are the closest available simulations of future climate and therefore cannot be ignored as containing the most relevant information they recommend that future research could avoid least squares methods in drying climates such as catchments with high hydroclimatic variability in australia moreover hartmann and bárdossy 2005 demonstrated that calibration using only shorter time intervals days weeks or months does not detect all changed signal to ensure the transferability of a hydrological model it is essential to use objective functions that incorporate longer time periods than daily values consequently other objective functions that are relatively more advantageous such as meta objective functions combined with different time steps or flow regimes beven 2006 fowler et al 2018b gharari et al 2013 liu et al 2009 zhang et al 2011 and multiple objective functions efstratiadis koutsoyiannis 2010 should be taken into account in transferability studies of models under changing climate it should be noted that prolonged droughts have been observed in catchments in regions like southeastern australia or north african nations which exhibit long term regional non stationarity sellami et al 2016 however this paper does not propose a complete abandonment of least squares methods in all climate change studies as their application in high flow regimes may still be useful there is no unanimity over the objective function for runoff projections the selection of the objective function is mostly determined by the purpose of the research also the transferability of the model can be enhanced by varying model parameters according to changing conditions pathiraja et al 2016 xiong et al 2019 zeng et al 2019 improving model structures fowler et al 2020 fowler et al 2021 westra et al 2014 using a muti model ensemble broderick et al 2016 marshall et al 2007 seiller et al 2012 and improving calibration schemes gaborit et al 2015 stephens et al 2019 3 2 robustness assessment metric metrics for model robustness assessment are related to performance measures of model transfer from one state to another which are vital for model selection and uncertainty estimation bennett et al 2013 and moriasi et al 2015 have provided a full explanation of model performance indicators and criteria in the temporal context the bias and nse are useful metrics to assess crr model robustness the relative formulation of bias has the advantage of providing values that are comparable across time periods and catchments nse and its modified version are also commonly used by hydrologists to quantify the degradation in the model evaluation results which determine if a model can effectively reproduce the hydrologic response over a pair of contrasted periods guo et al 2020 assessed the robustness of the crr models based on variation in the values ofkge and its three factors across all data splits for all catchments since all exercises are tested on the same evaluation period these metrics values for multiple calibration periods but a single evaluation period can be directly compared to illustrate the superiority of one parameter set over another each performance metric emphasizes a different component of a hydrograph and applying a particular performance metric often entails discounting one aspect in favor of another as previously mentioned the least squares evaluation metrics such as nse rmse and kge are volume dependent and their ability to identify crr models that are robust to changing catchment flow regimes is limited to overcome the noted challenges another metrics such as coron et al 2012 established a model robustness criterion mrc that can be fully comparable across a wide range of climate catchment scale and dynamic conditions they stated that the mrc values should not be significantly affected by the imperfect fit of the model to a specific period caused by data and model structure errors gelfan and millionshchikova 2018 introduced an enhanced nse criterion which take seasonal or annual trend into consideration to calibrate and evaluate a physically based model performance under the application of dsst climatically contrasting periods the significance test proved the model was robust when assessing climate change implications on annual and monthly runoff in selenga river basin royer gaspard et al 2021 proposed a proxy for model robustness pmr without implementing dsst which can be achieved with a single calibration of a hydrological model and is applicable to any type of hydrological model however the majority of studies assessing model transferability employ a single performance metric which limits the ability to gauge the overall robustness of a model hence it cannot be assumed that a model is entirely robust if only one performance indicator transfers well we advocate for further development of novel or multi criteria methods to assess model transferability as this is often contingent upon the definition of model robustness and may exceed the scope of conventional split sample tests 4 model transferability associated with climatic and catchment characteristics hydrologists have linked low model transferability to time variations in some catchments with the majority of the studies using procedure like dsst gsst focusing on the contrasting conditions dry wet warm cool between the calibration and evaluation periods bastola et al 2011 coron et al 2012 dakhlaoui et al 2019 fowler et al 2018b hartmann bárdossy 2005 however despite they provide various flexibility in terms of crr model structure and the number of parameters even the most sophisticated models utilized remain conceptual and empirical to some extent due to their insufficient information and observation on the genuine behavior of the hydrologic system coron et al 2011 mount et al 2016 murphy et al 2006 the relative simplicity of the crr models and the need to calibrate their parameters on a reference period do not always justify their application when conditions deviate beyond the range of previous experience hublart et al 2015 guo et al 2020 discovered that poor performance robustness in drier catchments is more likely due to model parameter inadequacies than poor parameter identifiability whereas vaze et al 2010 discovered the additional parameters in certain model e g the sacramento model have little effect compared to other lumped conceptual models when the calibrated model is used for any period other than the calibration period newman et al 2017 found that physically motivated model with expanded degrees of freedom in parameters improve the performance of the model but the model transferability is compromised hence constructing andcalibrating the model to obtain physically meaningful values for its parameters at multiple spatial and temporal scales is difficult and remains a holy grail of hydrological science even so the model predictive ability in the face of climate change does not help to improve as models become more complicated similar behavior can be found between sophisticated conceptual distributed model and parsimonious lumped models with respect to reproducing runoff breuer et al 2009 karlsson et al 2014 refsgaard knudsen 1996 just as mathevet et al 2020 observed simulation performance depend more on the hydro meteorological conditions of a given period than on the complexity of the model structure in practice conceptual models representing the functioning of the catchments using simplified descriptions of physical processes with very few free parameters are often preferred not surprisingly a significant difference can still be detected between individual conceptual model structures when driven by the same downscaled climate change projections despite the models similar performance under observed conditions bastola et al 2011 the reason is that the capacity of model parameter estimation could be hampered by situations such as the quality or availability of inputs changes model structures as well as challenges associated with parameterization and parameter transferability under non stationary conditions popular examples of conceptual models used in such studies include the gr4j perrin et al 2003 gr4jmod hughes et al 2013 simhyd chiew et al 2002 ihacres jakeman et al 1990 ihacre cmd croke jakeman 2004 awbm boughton 2004 sacramento burnash 1995 the hbv model bergström lindström 2015 seibert bergström 2022 and so forth a recent review on the development of runoff models can be found in peel and mcmahon 2020 but determining a priori which conceptual model structure is most appropriate for a given situation remains a challenging problem in hydrology clark et al 2008 4 1 model transferability associated with climatic characteristics typically model parameters are employed as a function of climate characteristics to validate the transferability of the model under contrasting climatic conditions the primary variables utilized to classify subperiods of various climatic conditions are precipitation p temperature t and potential evapotranspiration pet bastola et al 2011 coron et al 2012 dakhlaoui et al 2019 fowler et al 2018b hartmann bárdossy 2005 li et al 2012 refsgaard knudsen 1996 seiller et al 2012 vaze et al 2010 other variables such as the aridity index runoff streamflow the number of extreme rain or drought events etc were also used to select corresponding periods brigode et al 2013 motavita et al 2019 seibert 2003 singh et al 2011 stephens et al 2019 vormoor et al 2018 osuch et al 2015 quantified correlation between hbv model parameters and nine climatic indices over 5 years sliding windows and found that water related indices mean precipitation p mean wet day precipitation pw and temperature related indices mean potential evapotranspiration pet have the most significant influence on the corresponding hbv model parameters generally these climate indices are utilized independently of one another to cluster contrasting climate periods due to the observed dependency between climatic variables i e pet and t conclusive inference about the individual role performed by any variable could be reached by employing a representation that allowed for the simultaneous display of multiple climate variables see coron et al 2012 overall model performance shows low robustness across splits of calibration assessment data in rainfall runoff modelling bastola et al 2011 broderick et al 2016 coron et al 2014 dakhlaoui et al 2017 guo et al 2020 kling et al 2015 merz et al 2011 seiller et al 2012 vaze et al 2010 4 1 1 model transferability under contrast and similar climate conditions model performance is mostly determined by changes in rainfall mainly and temperature between calibration and evaluation periods bastola et al 2011 coron et al 2012 sleziak et al 2018 a common finding is that performance losses were greater for wet to dry transfers than for dry to wet transfers implying that model parameters may be less transferable under drier future conditions broderick et al 2016 dakhlaoui et al 2019 fowler et al 2016 saft et al 2016a saft et al 2016b vaze et al 2010 the difficulties transferring to a drier environment could be attributed to the fact that nonlinearities in hydrological processes are more pronounced and poorly defined under a wetter regime van esse et al 2013 besides using recorded periods as proxies for a drier future may reduce the robustness of the model even further stephens et al 2020 in contrast when applied to periods with similar climatic circumstances in terms of temperature and precipitation dakhlaoui et al 2019 derived that the three rainfall runoff models used in northern tunisia were robust similarly li et al 2012 used average precipitation to divide climate periods and concluded that to simulate runoff under wet dry climate conditions calibration should also be performed over similar historical wet dry periods see also bisselink et al 2016 broderick et al 2016 stephens et al 2019 reported predictive improvement between climatically similar subsets in terms of reconnaissance drought index rdi over 164 australian catchments on the contrary motavita et al 2019 suggested calibrating solely on dry hydrologic conditions would be the most reliable strategy for predicting any conditions wet dry or mixed however even though the parameters were shifted to another time frame with similar climates the robustness of the model yielded minimal degradation compared to calibration coron et al 2012 saying that average conditions such as the total rainfall can remain stable between the two periods whereas meaningful differences exist e g daily variability in rainfall and runoff one potential reason is that non stationarity obtained by processes like dsst does not fully represent the genuine non stationarity when simulating climate change implications on future water resources stephens et al 2020 as existing data have been thoroughly explored guo et al 2018 employed a stochastic weather generator to represent a range of plausible rainfall conditions allowing them to test the transferability of three crr models beyond observed records they concluded that drier future conditions displayed less uncertainty in runoff predictions this seems in contrast to prior findings that crr models perform worse when modelling historical dry periods fowler et al 2016 stephens et al 2020 vaze et al 2010 guo et al 2018 described the high potential robustness as a model that has low variability in runoff predictions for each of the synthetic climate scenarios considered however in cases of systematic bias precision in model outputs does not always imply low uncertainty saft et al 2016a indicated that uncertainty from hydrologic modeling is likely to be underestimated when a change in rainfall runoff relationship is prompted by a projected climate change 4 1 2 consequences of model transfer on runoff predictions runoff is a fundamental but critical indication for water resource management in climate change impact studies in this section we attempt to summarize the crr models ability to accurately predict the mean runoff under various climatic conditions in terms of bias values coron et al 2012 found a pattern in all studied models that the total volume bias was influenced by changes in both mean rainfall and potential evapotranspiration they noted that all models showed a tendency to overestimate flows in the validation period when the calibration period was wetter and cooler and to underestimate flows when the calibration period was dryer and warmer fowler et al 2021 suggested model structures based on conceptual buckets failure to accurately track the moisture deficit accumulatingas dry conditions continue resulting in an overestimation of runoff and a possible long term bias under a drier environment such overestimation was also validated by other studies on crr model transferability bastola et al 2011 coron et al 2014 dakhlaoui et al 2019 fowler et al 2018b guo et al 2020 hartmann bárdossy 2005 merz et al 2011 saft et al 2016a singh et al 2011 wilby 2005 moreover guo et al 2020 used kling gupta efficiency to show that the crr models calibrated from wetter periods for drier periods not only overestimated the mean runoff but also underestimated the runoff variation interestingly when subperiods were chosen based on the aridity index brigode et al 2013 noted that using wet calibration subperiods for the dry evaluation subperiods did not produce higher bias between observed and simulated flows than those using dry calibration subperiods although changing climatic environments can lead to degraded performance of crr models the degradation is not equivalent across models and catchments coron et al 2012 observed that a 20 absolute bias was introduced when mean rainfall differed by 10 20 and pe differed by 1 2 between calibration and validation basically in agreement with sleziak et al 2018 saft et al 2016a employed a statistical test to determine if the yearly rainfall runoff connection changed significantly during the dry season and the performance in catchments with or without a significant shift in rainfall runoff interactions was exceedingly variable the average bias among all six lumped conceptual rainfall runoff models was 93 and 10 respectively further research is required to investigate whether these findings are linked to model structure and catchment characteristics 4 1 3 under which climatic constraints can models be transferred based on runoff predictions a significant link between changes in climate variables and model transferability was found when the results from the related literatures were analyzed together follow the literature review in the work done by dakhlaoui et al 2019 although only a few have used sst and its variants to quantify the acceptable climatic changes for model transferability under nonstationary conditions in anticipation of a large number of such studies we attempted to establish an empirical climate constraint assuming that the model can be transferred for usage in alternative future periods table 2 in general precipitation and temperature are the main variables used to determine transferability limits vaze et al 2010 and merz et al 2011 demonstrated that climate variations between calibration and evaluation can have a considerable effect on model performance for example vaze et al 2010 discovered that shifting parameters to a drier future environment was particularly difficult for 61 australian catchments concluding that change in annual mean rainfall of more than 15 drier or 20 wetter 15 to 20 should be avoided similarly bastola et al 2011 discovered that when the difference in annual mean precipitation between the calibration and evaluation periods was less than 10 model transferability was less affected singh et al 2011 established an acceptable range of annual mean precipitation changes 10 to 20 with no discernible influence on model transferability for five catchments across the continental united states dakhlaoui et al 2017 used dsst to assess the transferability of three crr models under concurrent precipitation and temperature variabilityin northern tunisia and discovered that the model robustness became unacceptable when annual mean precipitation decreased by more than 25 and annual mean temperatures increased by more than 1 75 c furthermore sleziak et al 2018 found changes in optimized parameter values over time with a nonlinear relationship between variation in simulated runoff volume and differences in precipitation they postulate that calibrated parameters can only be considered trustworthy when the change in annual mean precipitation is within 10 on the basis of user need through setting the limitations of transferability of the crr models as drop in nse of more than 0 2 and a fluctuation in ve of more than 25 the models are thus roughly transferable for changes in precipitation δp 0 08 δt 0 18 with δp 30 80 and changes in temperature δt 2 c to 2 c dakhlaoui et al 2019 in acknowledging the subjectivity of these limits it is important to consider hydrological conditions and the specific requirements of users such as the need to attain an acceptable level of uncertainty for water resource management in a particular setting under the most stringent criteria an intuitive threshold for acceptable transferability should be a variation in average precipitation and temperature of no more than 10 and 1 75 c respectively as shown in table 2 4 2 model transferability associated with catchment characteristics the crr models contain many parameters with a physical connotation that can be inferred from catchment characteristics and are often calibrated using observed flow data of selected catchments parameters in crr models are designed to accurately represent the physical attributes of the catchment without regard to climate conditions however several model parameters do correspond to transient catchment conditions in fact climate change contributes to the time varying nature of hydrological responses over a range of temporal scales and the simple split sample test always ignores the spatial variability of critical hydrologic components within the catchment this call into question the implicit assumption of long term stability of catchment functioning 4 2 1 confounding impacts of climate change on catchment characteristics when assessing catchment runoff as a result of changing climatic forcing an implicit assumption that is frequently made is that future catchment dynamics can be extrapolated from historical catchment behavior in reality factors that can influence catchment response are likely to be influenced by climate change which makes the estimation of model parameters somewhat time dependent these include changes in the dominant hydrological processes e g climate runoff relation soil moisture regimes greening under wet conditions as well as changes in the timing and intensity of rainfall and drought etc some researchers have examined the relationships between parameter values and hydroclimatic conditions brigode et al 2013 de vos et al 2010 merz et al 2011 wilby 2005 for example rosero et al 2010 discovered that parameters from the noah land surface model were highly influenced by climatic conditions despite the fact that they should be governed solely by physical site factors e g soil and vegetation type these findings are not limited to only a few catchments merz et al 2011 calibrated a crr model to six consecutive 5 year periods in a large sample of catchments 273 catchments in austria and found a significant trend in parameters controlling snow and soil moisture processes associated with changes in the climatic conditions therefore changes in catchment s dominating processes as a result of climate change may render obsolete previously calibrated models the parameter values can actually vary seasonally or over longer time scales in order to forecast future hydrologic conditions it is critical to understand if a prolonged change in climate might result in changes in catchment behavior saft et al 2015 discovered that it is internal catchment dynamics rather than changes in rainfall patterns or the severity of drought that explained a significantly shift in the rainfall runoff relationship in some catchments they also noted that the deterioration in model predictive power was due to changes in rainfall runoff processes as a result of the protracted dry spell instead of a direct decrease in rainfall i e model performance can vary significantly in a catchment that responds differently to rainfall runoff interactions yet experiences a comparable level of rainfall reduction moreover in a virtual catchment experiment stephens et al 2020 concluded that performance changes were associated with a variety of climate change scenarios implying that failing to account for ecological adaptations to future conditions increased temperature and or co2 could increase uncertainty in streamflow simulations in other words neglect of feedbacks catchment adaptation between the hydrological cycle and parameter evolution could introduce a significant amount of inaccuracy into simulations casting doubt on their actual implementation flow simulation forecasting design reservoir management climate change impact assessments etc for better understanding of how changing climatic conditions modified hydrologic systems a deeper knowledge of the biophysical mechanisms pertaining to vegetation soil quality and groundwater that affect rainfall runoff in catchments is required 4 2 2 are models more difficult to transfer in catchments with certain characteristics the manifestation of varying degrees of non stationarity among different catchments is not an unexpected phenomenon gupta razavi 2018 catchment non stationarity can alter the rainfall runoff connection and examples include human activities such as changes in land use land drainage interception and groundwater abstractions as well as changes in response to climate change milly et al 2015 in section 4 1 we already discovered a correlation between climatic differences during calibration and biases in the simulated discharges however we lack information on the degree to which this connection is homogeneous among catchments it is usually difficult to generalize interpretations based on a particular catchment gupta et al 2014 on the other hand the use of one single catchment or model structure can indeed provide detailed hydro climatic process studies but attempts to adequately account for regional variation by establishing model parameters mostly neglect temporal spatial variability in dominating hydrological processes which precludes statistically robust comparisons and categorization of the various hydroclimatic conditions dirmeyer et al 2006 newman et al 2017 for example water limited catchments as opposed to energy limited catchments budyko 1974 may result in a greater responsiveness of flows to precipitation than to potential evapotranspiration and temperature now that large sample studies e g gsst allow for the collection of a large pair of year periods and calibrations can be performed over myriads of catchment conditions coron et al 2012 found that transferred parameters were applicable for various periods in several catchments even with contrasting climates for other catchments a clear correlation between simulation bias and climate changes between calibration and evaluation was discovered the magnitude of model deficiency is somewhat catchment dependent and determined by the impact of differences in climate conditions between periods despite the fact that the literature has not yet fully investigated this issue we were able to correlate the magnitude of these changes with certain catchment properties in this regard coron et al 2012 note that the biggest model transferability failures were in catchments with low annual runoff yield seibert 2003 used dsst to evaluate the reliability of the hbv model extrapolation in snow dominated catchments they reported that years with lower runoff peaks did not yield more accurate results than years with higher runoff peaks saft et al 2015 concluded that large catchments with dry climates low slopes and sparse forest cover were more likely to undergo changes in rainfall runoff relationships during lengthy droughts thus limiting model transferability in such catchments see also tian et al 2018 kling et al 2015 found that when evaluating daily discharge over independent periods the crr model performance in catchments with humid climates was more robust than in semi arid catchments often characterized by strong rainfall non stationarity guo et al 2020 identified 12 catchment attributes in which lower model robustness was correlated with high runoff skewness where the catchments were drier with low runoff and extreme flow events often occurred in particular models calibrated at these catchments often result in low storage capacity estimates wagener 2007 pointed out that to guarantee realistic modelling of environmental change impact strong correlations between model parameters and catchment characteristics should be proved and established however such priori knowledge is not particularly clear at present to this end more research is needed into the spatial extrapolation capabilities of hydrological models by establishing linkages between parameter values and catchments characteristics model parameterization can help mitigate the consequences of changes in these characteristics on model robustness for example de vos et al 2010 clustered input time series based on three variables of hydrological similarity precipitation and its 10 day moving average soil moisture which represent recent input memory and storage dynamics of the catchment respectively allowing parameters to fluctuate over a period of hydrological similarity jeremiah et al 2013 explored the applicability of parameter fluctuations as a function of several catchment characteristics to enhance the modelling performance of hierarchical mixtures of experts hme thus for regionalization purposes in addition to relating parameters with only physical catchment characteristics e g rau et al 2019 we recommend more variables of hydrological similarity be applied along with physical catchment characteristics in a regional clustering strategy to test the extrapolation abilities of parameter sets by transferring them to additional catchments in similar hydroclimatic zones extrapolation in both space and time patil stieglitz 2015 5 a proposed strategy for diagnosing model transferability inspired by previous research especially the work of coron et al 2012 dakhlaoui et al 2019 saft et al 2015 we proposed a strategy for quantitively testing model transferability as shown in fig 1 note that nicolle et al 2021 have presented an efficient robustness assessment test rat as an alternative to the splits sample test the strategy proposed in this paper for diagnosing model transferability is still within the application of classical dsst for the core steps labeled in fig 1 we make several assumptions as following step 1 according to the most stringent criteria table 2 intuitively the model can be considered transferable only if the annual mean precipitation and temperature vary within 10 and 1 75 c respectively this is a criterion that is rather subjective and depending on catchment conditions and model structures the thresholds will evolve over time as the performance metrics progress especially when the hydroclimatic variability is not only expressed in the variation of the mean precipitation and temperature step 2 3 when splitting the data the demand for long term observational data is necessary to provide more contrasted periods under climate variability which will lead to more robust parameterization and increase the likelihood of finding a better representation of future conditions still by using consecutive periods the average precipitation would be smoothed out and the climate disparity between periods would be reduced alternatively using modified climate classification methods e g random bootstrap sst technique gdsst technique coron 2013 dakhlaoui et al 2019 in areas where there are no remarkable trends in one or more climate variables may produce adequately long periods of contrasting pair to take advantage of significant interannual variability step 4 the rainfall runoff relationship can be used to explore potential changes in the hydrologic response of a catchment to climate fluctuations if the rainfall runoff response plotted matches that from other periods we assume that the hydrological processes are consistent with those observed during other periods conversely if the rainfall runoff response displayed deviates from that of other periods hydrological processes are assumed to be different a statistical test would be helpful e g catchments with significant change either upward or downward in the rainfall runoff relationship at the 5 significance level t test result 0 05 can be deemed non transferable alternatively we suggest identifying the rainfall runoff relationship at larger timescales e g annually since it can reflect the cumulative impact of changes at finer timescales resulting from prolonged catchment adaptation for more detail see potter et al 2011 and saft et al 2015 overall while statistical performance measures e g nse pbias are widely used by prior contributions in step 1 to quantify transferability limits we assume that the model cannot satisfy the mathematical ranges does not directly pronounce the model non transferable and thus apply another performance measure the graphical method in step 4 to quantify the statistical significance e g t test between simulation and output response to give the testing model a second chance also these historical analogues are extremely dependent on available data and may thus suffice for shorter future time horizons and lower levels of climate change there is no doubt that these historical runs do not represent the actual transferability of the hydrological model by comparing model predictions across contrasting historical sub periods if the hydrologic model is capable of successfully transferring between past climates thus gives us more confidence in model s capability to forecast similar conditions in the future 6 conclusions previous researches have thoroughly investigated the implications of climate change on catchments around the world but few have systematically assessed the transferability of hydrological models for daily conceptual rainfall runoff crr models the premise of parametric stationarity parameters give practical simulations when applied to hydro climatological conditions distinct from those used for model construction has been frequently questioned this casts doubt on the validity of such parameter transferorthe climatic extrapolation capacity of the model in this article we present the development of the data split method to examine parameter dependence on climate and the associated calibration methods with performance metrics for assessing model robustness to facilitate comparison we summarized together both study of individual cases the classic dsst differential split sample test and the study of large sample methods gsst generalized split sample test the model transferability robustness under non stationary climate and different catchment characteristics are discussed respectively we highlight the importance of exercising caution when assuming model reliability under input forcing that is significantly different from the data used to create the model follow the path done by previous research especially the work done by coron et al 2012 dakhlaoui et al 2019 saft et al 2015 a strategy to diagnose model transferability is proposed in fig 1 although the transferability of crr models seems to vary according to the catchment testing scenario and evaluation criteria used we could still observe some relationships between climate variability and model performance within some catchments when the results were analyzed together based on our overview five general conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the performance of calibrated models often declines when they are used to predict behaviors outside of the calibration period using the same parameter set some researchers have proposed a set of acceptable boundaries for changes in climatic circumstances within which crr models are more likely to produce satisfactory outcomes under the most stringent criteria the crr model can only be considered credible if the variation in annual average precipitation and temperature is within 10 and 1 75 c respectively 2 although the application of dsst has the inherent drawback of presupposing that previous periods of climate variability can be used to predict future climate change yet given that we cannot predict the unseen future this may still be the best course of action for investigating the temporal transferability of hydrologic models in such studies calibration period of five to ten years is frequently employed additionally more studies advised that using a calibration period that closely resembles future climate conditions would ensure all the most relevant information i e events patterns is used to accurately depict future behavioral patterns 3 in terms of changes in rainfall and temperature between calibration and evaluation periods model performance losses were found greater for wet to dry transfers than the other way around implying that model parameters may be less transferable under drier future conditions moreover a possible overestimation of future available water resources in regions expected to be drier includes midlatitude and subtropical arid and semiarid areas around the globe 4 although changes in the mean precipitation often have the greatest impact on the effectiveness of models we highlight that the deterioration in model transferability without drastic environmental change is partially due to direct change in input rainfall in the long run however internal catchment dynamics changes in rainfall runoff processes caused by prolonged catchment adaptation may play the most significant role see saft et al 2015 this is the basis of our proposed strategy to diagnose model transferability that beyond the acceptable thresholds of transferability i e statistical tests of annual rainfall runoff relationships 5 the crr models has limited transferability in catchments characterized by high runoff skewness and low runoff generation which corresponds with the low robustness exhibited by the model in climatically drier conditions therefore the predictive power of crr model calibrated on such catchments should be interpreted with caution however more general conclusions need to be reached in this regard in future studies we underline the importance of implementing such novel strategies in fig 1 for routinely assessing the prediction ability of crr models under various climate conditions particularly when results are used to influence adaptation decision making it is critical for water practitioners using crr models to understand the added uncertainty imposed by non stationarity under scenarios of climate change however additional methodological works are still required on the topic of robustness evaluation in view of the above here we offer the following recommendations 1 developing expanded dsst methodology or more superior data splitting methods that minimize the disadvantages of the existing method as their ability to identify robustness of rainfall runoff models to changing catchment flow regimes is often limited 2 improving the robustness of crr models by employing more adaptable model structural forms or even a multi model ensemble that can cope with a wider range of hydroclimatic conditions 3 exploring a wider range of possible hydroclimatic changes other than mean conditions of climatic characteristics such as increasing decreasing intensity of hydrological regime or temporal distributions 4 in addition to the temporal dynamics of temperature and precipitation a broader variety of simultaneously changing hydroclimatic variables e g solar radiation evapotranspiration wind speed or indicators e g aridity index is necessary to fully characterize the crr models transferability limitations and to compare these limitations to future climate projections 5 additional research for parameter transferability is required to apply similar testing procedures to other hydrological models e g physically based models or a range of catchment types e g water limited vs energy limited 6 assessing more complicated objective functions and developing a novel or multicriteria method for determining model transferability even though this is typically related to how robustness a model is defined and sometimes falls outside the scope of mere split sample test 7 rainfall runoff models can be developed in unmeasured catchments using parameters calibrated at potential donor locations determined on the basis of both physical and climatic similarities 8 continue developing and refining the strategy for diagnosing model transferability under various climate conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
1913,data assimilation da in physically based hydrodynamic models is conditioned by the difference in temporal and spatial scales of the observed data and the resolution of the model itself in order to use remote sensing data in small scale hydrodynamic modelling it is necessary to explore innovative da methods that can lead to a more plausible representation of the spatial variability of the parameters and processes involved in the present study satellite derived soil moisture and in situ observed streamflow data were jointly assimilated into a high resolution hydrological hydrodynamic model based on the iber software using the tempered particle filter tpf for the dual estimation of model state variables and parameters twelve storm events occurring in a 199 km2 catchment located in nw spain were used for testing the proposed approach a 3 step procedure was followed 1 sensitivity analysis of the model parameters 2 joint assimilation of soil moisture and discharge data to estimate correlations between observations and model parameters 3 joint assimilation of soil moisture and discharge data using an initial set of particles and parameter standard deviations derived from prior information the numerical model correctly reproduces the observed data with an average nash sutcliffe efficiency nse value of 0 74 over the 12 events when the prior information is used the approach described is shown to be most efficient with storm events that produce isolated peak discharges keywords hydrodynamic modelling iber flood forecasting tempered particle filter shallow water equations data assimilation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the inherent uncertainty of hydrological modelling blöschl etal 2019 can be reduced by assimilating independent observed data such as satellite observations or data from gauging stations liu and gupta 2007 data assimilation da has been traditionally used for uncertainty quantification and probabilistic forecasting in climate and ocean models more recently da has also been applied in the field of hydrology to improve the accuracy of model predictions assimilating variables such as soil moisture and streamflow gavahi etal 2020 hostache etal 2020 moradkhani etal 2005 xu etal 2020 and has proved to be a powerful approach to real time forecasting by updating the model state variables and parameters when new observations become available hostache etal 2018 moradkhani etal 2019 the spatiotemporal resolution of remote sensing data is particularly appropriate for assimilation into large scale hydrological and climate models abbaszadeh etal 2018 azimi etal 2020 lievens etal 2017 on the other hand observations at in situ gauging stations are still the most commonly used ones in hydrodynamic modelling jafarzadegan etal 2021 with the inconvenience that such data are scarce in their distribution in terms of space this is so because the spatial and temporal resolutions of satellite data are often too low to allow for their integration into high resolution small scale hydrodynamic models due to the rapid dynamics of some flood events in small and medium scale catchments it is not possible to work with a time resolution longer than one day and especially in flood extent analysis with spatial resolutions much greater than the resolution of the numerical model itself since satellite products are still not always able to provide these temporal and spatial resolutions the integration of these data into hydrodynamic models tends to be rather recent and usually focused on large rivers brêda et al 2019 dasgupta et al 2021a 2021c meyer oliveira et al 2021 wongchuig correa et al 2020 most da frameworks are based on the kalman filter and its variants annis etal 2022 jafarzadegan etal 2021 muñoz etal 2022 revilla romero etal 2016 wongchuig correa etal 2020 these techniques do not require a very large number of model simulations which is a clear advantage when applied to near real time forecasting however they assume a gaussian distribution of model and observation errors which in general are not realistic in real world data therefore the capacity of particle filter pf methods to handle non linear and non gaussian systems has attracted the attention of the research community in recent years van leeuwen etal 2019 unfortunately degeneracy affects pf methods in that most of the particles are of very little weight after a few assimilation steps this results in a large weight variance and reduces the ability of the particle ensemble to assess uncertainty and to correctly approximate the posterior distribution of the model parameters the tempered particle filter tpf herbst y schorfheide 2019 is one approach that was developed to deal with such limitations tpf reduces degeneracy based on a factorization of the likelihood using tempering coefficients that iteratively inflate the posterior probability variance such an approach has already been used for da into flood models di mauro etal 2022 di mauro et al 2021 previous studies focusing on da into hydrodynamic models assimilate flood extent maps dasgupta et al 2021a dasgupta et al 2021b altimetry brêda et al 2019 water stage giustarini et al 2011 matgen et al 2010 oubanas et al 2018 or discharge and water stage jointly jafarzadegan et al 2021 in the present study we extend the tpf framework to the joint assimilation of soil moisture data from the soil moisture active passive smap satellite and streamflow data from a gauging station the joint assimilation of soil moisture and streamflow through particle filter based methods has already shown its effectiveness in large scale hydrological models for instance in the work of yan and moradkhani 2016 where a distributed hydrological model of a 7400 km2 basin was used yet it has never been applied to a small scale hydrological hydrodynamic model based on two dimensional shallow water equations 2d swe the landro basin 199 km2 in north western spain was used as a case study numerical modelling was carried out using iber garcía feal etal 2018 a gpu parallelized version of the iber software bladé etal 2014 that solves the 2d swe including rainfall runoff transformation processes cea and bladé 2015 twelve storm events of 48 hours were analysed first a sensitivity analysis sa was performed to identify the parameters with the highest impact on the model output the tpf was then applied to each event independently in order to find sets of feasible parameters the assimilation process started from a random set of particles and a common standard deviation was assumed for all the parameters based on the obtained parameter sets we conducted a regression analysis to investigate how the prior information of each event antecedent rainfall soil moisture and streamflow relates to the model parameters finally the tpf was again applied to each of the twelve events using a first guess i e a first set of particles with parameter sets derived from the prior information antecedent rainfall soil moisture and streamflow for each event 2 methodology 2 1 numerical model the numerical model used in this study is the freely distributed software iber garcía feal et al 2018 which solves the 2d swe by using gpu parallelization techniques the mass and momentum conservation equations solved by the model can be expressed as 1 h t q x x q y y r f 2 q x t x q x 2 h g h 2 2 y q x q y h g h z b x g h n 2 h 10 3 q q x 3 q y t x q x q y h y q y 2 h g h 2 2 g h z b y g h n 2 h 10 3 q q y where h is the water depth q x q y and q are the two components of the unit discharge and its modulus z b is the bed elevation n is the manning s coefficient g is the gravity acceleration r is the rainfall intensity and f is the infiltration rate these equations are solved using an unstructured finite volume solver that includes a specific numerical scheme for hydrological applications cea and bladé 2015 as shown in several recent studies the 2d swe can be used to model rainfall runoff transformation and surface runoff with a relatively high resolution at spatial scales ranging from hillslopes to small and medium size catchments cea etal 2016 cea et al 2010 cea and bladé 2015 costabile and costanzo 2021 ferraro etal 2020 fraga etal 2019 garcía alén etal 2022 sanz ramos etal 2021 uber etal 2021 iber includes several formulations to compute infiltration losses in the current study the physically based green ampt formulation was used chow etal 1988 in its implementation in iber the infiltration rate is estimated as 4 f pot k s 1 h ψ b f m i n f pot h δ t where f pot is the potential infiltration rate k s is the saturated soil permeability in the vertical direction h is the water depth over the terrain ψ is the suction in the unsaturated soil layer b is the thickness of the saturated soil layer and δ t is the computational time step the real infiltration rate f is limited by the availability of water over the terrain h the suction ψ and the saturated permeability k s are model parameters to be defined by the user while the thickness of the saturated soil layer b is updated as the total infiltration depth increases thus 5 b b 0 f ϕ f 0 t f d t where b 0 is the initial thickness of the saturated soil layer ϕ is the porosity of the soil and f is the total infiltration depth since iber is a 2d model in which the flow in the vertical direction is not resolved the average moisture content of the soil layer θ is computed from the thickness of the saturated layer b as 6 θ b d s ϕ where d s is the total thickness of the soil layer the total thickness of the soil layer d s and its porosity ϕ are parameters to be defined by the user in iber the initial thickness of the saturated soil b 0 is defined by the user through the initial degree of saturation s r 0 of the soil given equation 6 and the relationship between soil moisture degree of saturation and porosity of the soil θ s r ϕ b 0 is estimated according to 7 b 0 s r 0 d s in addition to infiltration the model considers initial losses i a that can be satisfied by the initial rainfall or by the available overland water depth 2 2 sensitivity analysis a global sensitivity analysis sa of the model output to the infiltration parameters was performed in order to identify the most relevant parameters to be included in the data assimilation the five parameters analysed were saturated soil permeability k s manning s roughness coefficient n soil suction ψ soil initial saturation s r 0 and initial losses i a all the parameters were considered to be homogeneous in space except the bed roughness coefficient whose spatial distribution was predefined based on the spatial distribution of land uses in the basin thus the sensitivity to this parameter was assessed by considering a multiplier that was applied to scale its predefined spatial distribution regarding the porosity and soil layer parameters these were not taken into account in the sa since as described in section 3 3 below both were fixed for all simulations 5000 parameter sets were randomly generated using the latin hypercube sampling lhs within a predefined plausible range of variation for each parameter the numerical model was run with each parameter set in a representative sample of 5 storm events the outlet hydrograph obtained with each parameter set was compared to a synthetic reference hydrograph using the mean absolute difference mad to quantify the degree of dissimilarity between hydrographs the synthetic reference hydrograph was obtained by running the model with the mean value of the range of variation of each parameter the mad of all computations was analysed using the moment independent importance measure δ proposed by borgonovo 2007 as well as the first order variance based sensitivity indices s 1 i in order to quantify the effect of each parameter on the outlet hydrograph although variance based importance measure indices are often used they rely on the assumption that the variance is sufficient to describe output variability saltelli 2002 by contrast moment independent importance measures analyse the effect of the parameters without relying uniquely on the output variance 2 3 joint assimilation of soil moisture and discharge data particle filter pf methods follow a two step iterative procedure that includes predictions model forward simulations and analysis updating particle probabilities and or state variables by optimally combining the simulation results and the observations the prior and posterior probability distributions which characterise model states before and after the assimilation are approximated by a set of particles in our case each particle is a model simulation with its own set of parameters and associated state variables pf methods are likely to degenerate unless the number of particles is very large increasing exponentially with the dimension of the system state degeneracy leads to a high probability assigned to a very limited number of particles and negligible weights to all other particles van leeuwen etal 2019 given that degeneracy issues have been noted in previous studies di mauro et al 2021 and also considering that a large number of particles implies a significant increase in the computational cost of da for the present study we used a variant of the pf the so called tempered particle filter tpf method herbst y schorfheide 2019 this relatively novel approach applies tempering coefficients to inflate the likelihood within an iterative process respecting the bayes formula the bayes theorem in a pf can be formalised as follows 8 p m o p o m p o p m where p m o is the conditional probability of the model given the observation also called posterior or analysis p m is the probability of the model also called prior or background p o m is the conditional probability of the observation given the model also called the likelihood of the observations and p o is a normalisation factor in the tpf the likelihood p o m in equation 8 is factorised as 9 p m o i 1 n p o m φ i p o p m w i t h i 1 n φ i 1 where φ i is the tempering factor at the i th iteration this small enough to enable a substantial likelihood variance inflation and n is the number of iterations the tempering coefficients must add up to one in order to follow the bayes formula equation 8 this factorisation enables the decomposition of the assimilation into several tempering steps where the degeneration problem is overcome by the inflation of the likelihood variance following the pf formulation and assuming as independent both the observations assimilated into this study soil moisture and discharge p m o can be estimated at each tempering iteration i thus 10 p i m o j 1 np w j i φ i δ m m j w j i φ i i 1 ni p q o m j φ i p q o i 1 ni p θ o m j φ i p θ o where w j i is the global weight of the j th particle in the i th iteration δ is the dirac delta function np is the number of particles m j is an ensemble of size np model states ni is the number of iterations up to the i th iteration p q o m j and p θ o m j are the conditional probabilities of the observed discharge q and soil moisture θ estimated given the j th model state and p q o and p θ o are the normalization factors of the observed discharge and soil moisture respectively observation errors are assumed to be independent of each other a flow chart of the data assimilation framework is presented in fig 1 in the first iteration an initial set of parameters i e first guess must be defined to create the first set of particles after the model simulations particle weights are estimated using the observations and the tempering factor φ i this exponent ranges between 0 and 1 0 φ i 1 and makes it possible to retain a substantial number of particles with significant weights it is increased at each iteration and represents the solution to the ensemble inefficiency ratio ineff φ i 11 i n e f f φ i r w i t h i n e f f φ i 1 np j 1 np w j i φ i 2 where a targeted inefficient ratio r is previously defined the particles with high weights are resampled after each iteration i using a sequential importance resampling sir particles are replicated proportionally with their weights those with an associated low importance weight are replaced with replicas of those having higher weight particles are equally weighted after resampling next two mutations are applied to the particles model parameters are slightly perturbed these mutations based on a metropolis hasting mh algorithm allow the ensemble to regain diversity after each resampling step the mutated particle simulations are carried out and the mutated particles are accepted or rejected based on their likelihood as compared to the resampled particles likelihood after two runs of mh a new iteration is started with the estimation of a new tempering coefficient φ i and the computation of the particle weights the entire process is repeated until the sum of the tempering coefficients is equal to unity i e iterations are ended when φ n 1 i n 1 φ i where n is the total number of iterations detailed descriptions of the tpf can be found in di mauro et al 2022 and herbst and schorfheide 2019 the tpf approach was applied twice 1 using as first guess a set of random particles from the ranges of variation and assuming in the mutation of the particles a standard deviation common for all parameters 2 using a relationship between model parameters and basin antecedent conditions to establish the initial set of particles first guess and to define the standard deviation of each parameter in both cases the number of particles np used was equal to 15 and a targeted inefficient ratio r equal to 2 was assumed for the comparison of the simulated and observed discharge we used the mean absolute error mae normalised to the peak flow the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the relative volume error over the hydrograph for the comparison of soil moisture values the rmse was used 3 case study and model setup 3 1 study area the landro basin is located in the north western iberian peninsula fig 2 a streamflow gauging station managed by the regional water administration augas de galicia is located near the basin outlet receiving runoff from an area of 199 km2 the altitude ranges from 91 to 1427 m above sea level with an average terrain slope of 27 the soil is made up of gneiss metasediment and granitic rock most of the basin is covered by eucalyptus pine forests and scrublands with only a very small proportion of cultivated areas in the main channel floodplains its location confers on the basin an atlantic climate marked by abundant rainfall throughout the year with storms occurring mainly during the winter season the mean annual rainfall depth is 1412 mm and the average annual maximum daily precipitation is 62 mm the landro river has a length of 42 km and follows a s n direction on average the river has a minimum mean and maximum annual streamflow equal to 1 44 5 8 and 16 9 m3 s respectively 3 2 observed data 3 2 1 rainfall rainfall data since 2019 were provided by the regional meteorological agency meteogalicia in the form of raster rainfall fields those were estimated from the combination of rain gauge and meteorological radar observations using a conditional merging technique pettazzi and salsón 2012 which improves the characterisation of the spatial distribution of rainfall by combining the advantages of rain gauges high accuracy of rainfall data at ground level and radar high space resolution of the observations the meteorological radar operated by meteogalicia has spatial and temporal resolutions of 250 m and 5 min respectively while the rain gauge data has a temporal resolution of 10 min the observed rainfall intensity data were implemented in the numerical model as raster fields with a spatial resolution of 250 m and a temporal resolution of 1 h from the period with available rainfall data 12 storm events representing different peak flow and initial soil moisture conditions were selected table 1 each of the events analysed has a total duration of 48 h 3 2 2 river discharge discharge data for the 12 storm events were available from a stream gauge operated by the regional water administration augas de galicia the data were obtained from water level measurements performed every 10 min converted to discharge values using previously calibrated rating curves the location of the landro gauging station is shown in fig 2 longitude 613 652 utmx 29 t ed 89 latitude 4 830 448 utmy 29 t ed 89 the data provided by augas de galicia underwent an internal validation process in which erroneous observations were discarded however the uncertainty of the data is not provided within the framework of this study it was assumed that the observed discharge had a maximum relative error of 10 which is an order of magnitude used in similar studies abbaszadeh etal 2018 3 2 3 soil moisture soil moisture data were retrieved from the soil moisture active passive smap satellite provided by the national snow and ice data center among the different products available there the root zone soil moisture analysis update spl4smau was used which is obtained via the assimilation of smap l band brightness temperature data into the catchment land surface model using ensemble based kalman filtering reichle etal 2020 the product version 5 provides instantaneous soil moisture fields for both the surface 0 5 cm and root zone 0 100 cm layers at 3 h intervals over an earth fixed global cylindrical 9 km equal area scalable earth grid ease grid 2 0 peng etal 2021 reichle etal 2017 due to the rapid dynamics of some flood events the temporal resolution of satellite data is one of the main limitations of integrating satellite products into the numerical simulation of small scale hydrodynamic models the spl4smau product has a temporal resolution that is well suited for its application in short duration storm events in this study the soil moisture value for the root zone was used since it was considered the most representative means of characterising the infiltration capacity of the soil in the assimilation of observed data the average soil moisture in the whole catchment was used with the smap data having an uncertainty value of 0 02 m3 m3 reichle etal 2019 table 1 indicates the soil moisture value at the beginning of each storm event 3 3 model setup whereas section 2 1 presented a general description of the numerical model and the selected infiltration model here we will specify the particular characteristics of the numerical model of the landro basin including aspects such as the spatial discretisation used and the range of variation of the hydrological parameters considered in iber the digital terrain model dtm values are interpolated to the nodes of the computational mesh using a bilinear interpolation method the elevation value at each mesh vertex is interpolated using 5 m spatial resolution lidar derived dtm provided by the national geological institute of spain ign cnig 2021 bottom friction is modelled in iber with the manning s formula for this study the manning s roughness coefficient was defined according to the land use map of the european project corine land cover 2018 clc2018 european union copernicus land monitoring service 2018 and the recommendations of the methodological guide for the development of the national floodplain mapping system sánchez and lastra 2011 which proposes a manning s coefficient for each land use in corine since the roughness values required when computing the overland flow with the 2d swe are sometimes higher than those commonly used for riverbeds cea etal 2016 fraga etal 2013 sanz ramos etal 2021 the manning s coefficient multiplier was used here with a rather wide range of variation regarding the numerical simulation of the base flow this was set constant for each storm event and was equal to the observed flow at the beginning of the corresponding event rainfall losses were computed using the green ampt infiltration model we considered five parameters of this model k s n ψ s r 0 i a and chose a range of variation capable of representing a wide variety of soils table 2 the other two parameters contemplated in the implementation of this infiltration model were fixed in all simulations total thickness of the soil layer d s and porosity ϕ the total thickness of the soil layer d s was set to 1 m to remain consistent with the smap derived soil moisture data see section 3 2 3 the porosity ϕ of the soil was set to 0 42 since it was considered to be a parameter directly related to soil type and with low variation from one event to another this value was set within the range of variation shown in the study by fraga et al 2019 over the same area the computational domain was discretised with an unstructured non uniform mesh using a coarser mesh size in the hillslopes and a finer mesh size in the channel network this is a common procedure in 2d swe models that allows for a reduction in computational cost without compromising the accuracy of the results costabile and costanzo 2021 in order to establish the mesh size that would be used in the numerical simulations a mesh convergence analysis was performed using events 1 and 8 the results with a mesh of 1 m elements were used as a reference the resolution of this reference mesh is equal to 5 m on the watercourse and 25 m on the hillslopes these resolutions are consistent with garcía alén et al 2022 where it is concluded that higher mesh resolutions provide similar results in terms of the output hydrograph the use of a 15 k element mesh with a mesh resolution of 40 m in the water course and 800 m in the hillsides fig 3 a made it possible to reduce the computational cost of the simulation by a factor of 90 times and provides a mad mean absolute difference normalised to the peak flow lower than 3 5 in both events when compared with the reference simulation on a 1 m elements mesh fig 3b thus the 15 k mesh was taken for the numerical simulation of the selected events 4 results and discussion 4 1 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis sa was based on five different events that were simulated using 5000 different parameter sets fig 4 includes scatter plots that show the relationship between the model parameters and the mad relative to the comparison of the simulated hydrographs with the hydrographs computed in the reference simulation in this comparison the entire time series of the simulated hydrographs were considered as mentioned in section 2 2 this reference simulation was obtained by running the model with the mean value of the range of variation of each parameter in these plots each point corresponds to a single simulation result using a given parameter set a weighted histogram weighted by the mad of each simulation is included above each scatter plot most of the samples providing high mad values are grouped within a small range of k s values on the contrary the outlet hydrograph does not seem to be sensitive to the manning multiplier or to the suction parameter ψ since uniform histograms are observed for these two parameters in all the events the initial degree of saturation s r 0 tends to be very relevant when it is close to 1 and far less relevant when it is smaller than 0 8 finally the uniformity of the histograms indicates that the model is not very sensitive to the initial loss parameter i a fig 5 shows the interactions according to these three parameters k s s r 0 and i a for each of the five events and for the three pairs of parameters k s s r 0 k s i a and s r 0 i a mad values obtained in each simulation are plotted in the parameter space the size and colour of the dots are proportional to the mad value in the first row in fig 5 s r 0 against k s it can be observed that for high values of s r 0 close to 1 the results are independent of the value of k s however when s r 0 is far from its upper limit a significant interaction is observed for low values of k s there is not a clear interaction between i a and the other two parameters confirming that the sensitivity of the model to this parameter is low to further quantify the relevance of each model parameter several sensitivity measures were computed based on the mad results 1 the borgonovo moment independent importance measure δ i 2 the first order sobol sensitivity index s 1 i and 3 the sensitivity measure μ derived from the morris analysis fig 6 provides the δ i top s 1 i middle and μ bottom results obtained for the five parameters and for the five events considered in the sa the borgonovo importance measure indicates that the model is more sensitive to k s and s r 0 than to the other 3 parameters this result is consistent with the μ values obtained in the morris analysis where the values of k s and s r 0 stand out slightly above the rest of the parameters regarding the sobol s indices the sums of the first order indices are greater than 0 89 in all events indicating a weak interaction among the parameters moreover it can be deduced that the initial degree of saturation s r 0 is able to explain between 65 and 77 of the first order mad variance conversely and although the effect of the initial losses i a is already low the manning s coefficient multiplier and the suction ψ have a limited effect on the mad the effect of k s is moderate in this case with an average value of 0 13 based on these results it can be concluded that k s s r 0 and to a lesser extent i a are the most relevant model parameters 4 2 joint assimilation of soil moisture and discharge data based on the sa results the number of parameters considered in the da was reduced to saturated soil permeability k s initial degree of saturation s r 0 and initial losses i a the range of variation considered for these parameters is shown in table 2 the manning s coefficient multiplier and suction were set to 4 5 and 136 5 mm in all the simulations thus the chosen roughness coefficients maintain the same order of magnitude as in other overland flow studies where it has been observed that these coefficients tend to be higher than the ones commonly used in the simulation of river flows nguyen etal 2016 the suction value was established from the literature as based on previous experiences see e g chow et al 1988 as mentioned in section 2 3 15 particles were considered in the tempered particle filter tpf approach each particle corresponds to a model simulation with its own set of parameters and associated state variables after the iterative process 15 different outputs of streamflow and soil moisture were obtained the ensemble expectation average value of the 15 particles was used to compare with observations and to evaluate the performance of the da approach in the first iteration of the assimilation first guess the parameter values of each particle were randomly selected from their range of variation also in the application of the mh algorithm for the mutation of the particles carried out at each tempering iteration a standard deviation equal to 1 was assumed for all parameters 1 for s r 0 1 mm h for k s and 1 mm for i a fig 7 summarises the performance metrics obtained for each event while fig 8 shows the observed and simulated hydrographs and sm values the agreement between modelled and observed hydrographs is good in most of the events except in events 6 and 7 in both of these and especially in event 7 the model was unable to reproduce the observed hydrograph considering the time variability of the observed rainfall in both events the proposed methodology seems to be less effective in storm events with continuous and low intensity rainfall that generates less pronounced peak discharges excluding the result of these events the mean nse value obtained for the other 10 events was 0 72 in general a better fit was observed in the events with a well defined isolated peak discharge e g events 8 9 and 11 with nse values equal to 0 97 0 92 and 0 96 respectively concerning soil moisture the rmse between the simulations and observations was less than 0 02 in 8 of the 12 events which can be considered very satisfactory events 3 and 11 both had poor performances with rmse values of 0 08 and 0 09 respectively in order to carry out this joint assimilation by reducing as much as possible the ranges of variation of the numerical parameters considered we also searched for relationships between the parameters considered in the da and the antecedent rainfall soil moisture and streamflow of the basin fig 9 shows the relationships obtained between saturated soil permeability k s initial soil saturation s r 0 and initial losses i a and also the following antecedent conditions of the basin accumulated 5 day antecedent rainfall initial moisture observed by smap and base flow at the beginning of the event the accumulated antecedent rainfall was estimated over the 5 days prior to the start of the event in that it is a time period commonly used to estimate the antecedent moisture conditions of a basin brocca etal 2008 event 7 the worst in terms of nse is represented in red the saturated soil permeability does not show a clear trend with the antecedent conditions with rather low spearman s correlation coefficients fig 8 conversely the initial sm exhibits a significant trend with the 3 antecedent conditions considered the spearman s rank correlation with the initial baseflow reaches 0 958 which is particularly high a high correlation coefficient with the initial sm derived from smap is also observed regarding the initial losses there is no evident relationship with the basin antecedent conditions although the spearman s correlation coefficients are not high these relationships could be used to at least reduce the parameter variance and thus optimise the number of iterations needed in the pf approach particularly for dry antecedent conditions as seen in the results of i a obtained for initial sm lower than 0 3 or base flow lower than 10 m3 s it can be observed that i a varies in a range between 20 and 30 m3 s 4 3 joint assimilation of soil moisture and discharge data using a first guess and parameter variances derived from prior information the relationships between model parameters and antecedent conditions shown in fig 9 were used in a slightly different implementation of the tpf hence those relationships were used 1 to define the parameter standard deviations used in the particle mutations and 2 to establish a set of parameters synthetic prediction derived from the basin antecedent conditions of each event the synthetic parameter sets were utilised together with the parameter standard deviations to generate the first set of particles first guess of the assimilation a linear relationship was assumed for the three model parameters between k s and the initial sm from smap s r 0 and the initial sm from smap and i a and the 5 day antecedent rainfall fig 10 in the estimation of the linear regressions event 7 was not included due to its poor performance the pearson s coefficient values obtained for the relationships of k s s r 0 and i a were 0 46 0 90 and 0 59 respectively from the linear regressions standard deviations of 0 074 for s r 0 1 078 mm h for k s and 7 159 mm for i a were estimated fig 11 and fig 12 show the performance metrics obtained for each event as well as the comparison between the observed and simulated hydrographs and sm the results with this implementation of the tpf improve with respect to those obtained using the standard implementation especially in terms of discharge since in this case only 4 events gave a nse lower than 0 7 the worst nse was again on event 7 with a value of 0 27 however the mae normalised to the peak flow and the relative volume error over the hydrograph for this event indicate that the prediction was in agreement with the results observed in terms of sm no significant improvement was observed with respect to the standard implementation of the tpf however 9 of the 12 events remained with rmse values in the range of 0 02 0 03 a result very close to the uncertainty value considered in the da process 0 02 in event 11 a poor reproduction of the sm observations was obtained rmse equal to 0 087 although the s r 0 dis not match the observed sm from smap and therefore the first guess was not adequate the assimilation method was able to adapt to this outlier and eventually took it as a feasible parameter fig 13 a shows the nse obtained in the standard blue and improved orange applications of the tpf approach after the implementation of the prior information the nse always increased except in event 4 considering the 12 events the average nse was 0 37 in the first assimilation and increased to 0 74 after the implementation of prior information if event 7 is excluded in the estimation of these average values the mean nses obtained in the first and second implementations were 0 69 and 0 78 respectively fig 13a also includes the number of iterations needed in the da process a value that is directly related to the number of model runs required and thus to the computational cost of the method in general an equivalent or even higher number of iterations was needed when the prior information was included this increase in the number of iterations is in some cases related to outliers in the linear relationship between model parameters and antecedent conditions fig 10 especially in the case of i a and k s where the relation is less evident for example in the case of event 9 the value of i a taken from the linear regression and based on the 5 day antecedent rainfall red dot in fig 13b is very different from the value which yielded a good reproduction of the observed discharge data 5 conclusions a particle filer based data assimilation methodology to assimilate in situ observed discharge and satellite derived soil moisture was proposed and applied to a 2d hydrological model based on the 2d swe the proposed approach was based on the joint assimilation of soil moisture data provided by the smap satellite and discharge data measured at a gauging station twelve storm events registered in the landro river basin 199 km2 were analysed and used to evaluate the effectiveness of the method this joint assimilation framework allowed for a correct reproduction of the basin outflow with soil moisture values close to the observations for most storm events a mean nse value of 0 74 was reached for all twelve events the results were in general more accurate in rainfall events that produced isolated peak flows it was found that it was possible to relate some of the model parameters to the hydrological antecedent conditions of the catchment in this way improving the assimilation process the most significant correlation pearson s coefficient of 0 90 was identified with the initial soil saturation the application of these relationships to the da process lead to better performances but was not always accompanied by a reduction in computational cost the results of this case study then show that by considering only three hydrological parameters in the assimilation process a good compromise between da effort and model performance can be achieved declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

1913,data assimilation da in physically based hydrodynamic models is conditioned by the difference in temporal and spatial scales of the observed data and the resolution of the model itself in order to use remote sensing data in small scale hydrodynamic modelling it is necessary to explore innovative da methods that can lead to a more plausible representation of the spatial variability of the parameters and processes involved in the present study satellite derived soil moisture and in situ observed streamflow data were jointly assimilated into a high resolution hydrological hydrodynamic model based on the iber software using the tempered particle filter tpf for the dual estimation of model state variables and parameters twelve storm events occurring in a 199 km2 catchment located in nw spain were used for testing the proposed approach a 3 step procedure was followed 1 sensitivity analysis of the model parameters 2 joint assimilation of soil moisture and discharge data to estimate correlations between observations and model parameters 3 joint assimilation of soil moisture and discharge data using an initial set of particles and parameter standard deviations derived from prior information the numerical model correctly reproduces the observed data with an average nash sutcliffe efficiency nse value of 0 74 over the 12 events when the prior information is used the approach described is shown to be most efficient with storm events that produce isolated peak discharges keywords hydrodynamic modelling iber flood forecasting tempered particle filter shallow water equations data assimilation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the inherent uncertainty of hydrological modelling blöschl etal 2019 can be reduced by assimilating independent observed data such as satellite observations or data from gauging stations liu and gupta 2007 data assimilation da has been traditionally used for uncertainty quantification and probabilistic forecasting in climate and ocean models more recently da has also been applied in the field of hydrology to improve the accuracy of model predictions assimilating variables such as soil moisture and streamflow gavahi etal 2020 hostache etal 2020 moradkhani etal 2005 xu etal 2020 and has proved to be a powerful approach to real time forecasting by updating the model state variables and parameters when new observations become available hostache etal 2018 moradkhani etal 2019 the spatiotemporal resolution of remote sensing data is particularly appropriate for assimilation into large scale hydrological and climate models abbaszadeh etal 2018 azimi etal 2020 lievens etal 2017 on the other hand observations at in situ gauging stations are still the most commonly used ones in hydrodynamic modelling jafarzadegan etal 2021 with the inconvenience that such data are scarce in their distribution in terms of space this is so because the spatial and temporal resolutions of satellite data are often too low to allow for their integration into high resolution small scale hydrodynamic models due to the rapid dynamics of some flood events in small and medium scale catchments it is not possible to work with a time resolution longer than one day and especially in flood extent analysis with spatial resolutions much greater than the resolution of the numerical model itself since satellite products are still not always able to provide these temporal and spatial resolutions the integration of these data into hydrodynamic models tends to be rather recent and usually focused on large rivers brêda et al 2019 dasgupta et al 2021a 2021c meyer oliveira et al 2021 wongchuig correa et al 2020 most da frameworks are based on the kalman filter and its variants annis etal 2022 jafarzadegan etal 2021 muñoz etal 2022 revilla romero etal 2016 wongchuig correa etal 2020 these techniques do not require a very large number of model simulations which is a clear advantage when applied to near real time forecasting however they assume a gaussian distribution of model and observation errors which in general are not realistic in real world data therefore the capacity of particle filter pf methods to handle non linear and non gaussian systems has attracted the attention of the research community in recent years van leeuwen etal 2019 unfortunately degeneracy affects pf methods in that most of the particles are of very little weight after a few assimilation steps this results in a large weight variance and reduces the ability of the particle ensemble to assess uncertainty and to correctly approximate the posterior distribution of the model parameters the tempered particle filter tpf herbst y schorfheide 2019 is one approach that was developed to deal with such limitations tpf reduces degeneracy based on a factorization of the likelihood using tempering coefficients that iteratively inflate the posterior probability variance such an approach has already been used for da into flood models di mauro etal 2022 di mauro et al 2021 previous studies focusing on da into hydrodynamic models assimilate flood extent maps dasgupta et al 2021a dasgupta et al 2021b altimetry brêda et al 2019 water stage giustarini et al 2011 matgen et al 2010 oubanas et al 2018 or discharge and water stage jointly jafarzadegan et al 2021 in the present study we extend the tpf framework to the joint assimilation of soil moisture data from the soil moisture active passive smap satellite and streamflow data from a gauging station the joint assimilation of soil moisture and streamflow through particle filter based methods has already shown its effectiveness in large scale hydrological models for instance in the work of yan and moradkhani 2016 where a distributed hydrological model of a 7400 km2 basin was used yet it has never been applied to a small scale hydrological hydrodynamic model based on two dimensional shallow water equations 2d swe the landro basin 199 km2 in north western spain was used as a case study numerical modelling was carried out using iber garcía feal etal 2018 a gpu parallelized version of the iber software bladé etal 2014 that solves the 2d swe including rainfall runoff transformation processes cea and bladé 2015 twelve storm events of 48 hours were analysed first a sensitivity analysis sa was performed to identify the parameters with the highest impact on the model output the tpf was then applied to each event independently in order to find sets of feasible parameters the assimilation process started from a random set of particles and a common standard deviation was assumed for all the parameters based on the obtained parameter sets we conducted a regression analysis to investigate how the prior information of each event antecedent rainfall soil moisture and streamflow relates to the model parameters finally the tpf was again applied to each of the twelve events using a first guess i e a first set of particles with parameter sets derived from the prior information antecedent rainfall soil moisture and streamflow for each event 2 methodology 2 1 numerical model the numerical model used in this study is the freely distributed software iber garcía feal et al 2018 which solves the 2d swe by using gpu parallelization techniques the mass and momentum conservation equations solved by the model can be expressed as 1 h t q x x q y y r f 2 q x t x q x 2 h g h 2 2 y q x q y h g h z b x g h n 2 h 10 3 q q x 3 q y t x q x q y h y q y 2 h g h 2 2 g h z b y g h n 2 h 10 3 q q y where h is the water depth q x q y and q are the two components of the unit discharge and its modulus z b is the bed elevation n is the manning s coefficient g is the gravity acceleration r is the rainfall intensity and f is the infiltration rate these equations are solved using an unstructured finite volume solver that includes a specific numerical scheme for hydrological applications cea and bladé 2015 as shown in several recent studies the 2d swe can be used to model rainfall runoff transformation and surface runoff with a relatively high resolution at spatial scales ranging from hillslopes to small and medium size catchments cea etal 2016 cea et al 2010 cea and bladé 2015 costabile and costanzo 2021 ferraro etal 2020 fraga etal 2019 garcía alén etal 2022 sanz ramos etal 2021 uber etal 2021 iber includes several formulations to compute infiltration losses in the current study the physically based green ampt formulation was used chow etal 1988 in its implementation in iber the infiltration rate is estimated as 4 f pot k s 1 h ψ b f m i n f pot h δ t where f pot is the potential infiltration rate k s is the saturated soil permeability in the vertical direction h is the water depth over the terrain ψ is the suction in the unsaturated soil layer b is the thickness of the saturated soil layer and δ t is the computational time step the real infiltration rate f is limited by the availability of water over the terrain h the suction ψ and the saturated permeability k s are model parameters to be defined by the user while the thickness of the saturated soil layer b is updated as the total infiltration depth increases thus 5 b b 0 f ϕ f 0 t f d t where b 0 is the initial thickness of the saturated soil layer ϕ is the porosity of the soil and f is the total infiltration depth since iber is a 2d model in which the flow in the vertical direction is not resolved the average moisture content of the soil layer θ is computed from the thickness of the saturated layer b as 6 θ b d s ϕ where d s is the total thickness of the soil layer the total thickness of the soil layer d s and its porosity ϕ are parameters to be defined by the user in iber the initial thickness of the saturated soil b 0 is defined by the user through the initial degree of saturation s r 0 of the soil given equation 6 and the relationship between soil moisture degree of saturation and porosity of the soil θ s r ϕ b 0 is estimated according to 7 b 0 s r 0 d s in addition to infiltration the model considers initial losses i a that can be satisfied by the initial rainfall or by the available overland water depth 2 2 sensitivity analysis a global sensitivity analysis sa of the model output to the infiltration parameters was performed in order to identify the most relevant parameters to be included in the data assimilation the five parameters analysed were saturated soil permeability k s manning s roughness coefficient n soil suction ψ soil initial saturation s r 0 and initial losses i a all the parameters were considered to be homogeneous in space except the bed roughness coefficient whose spatial distribution was predefined based on the spatial distribution of land uses in the basin thus the sensitivity to this parameter was assessed by considering a multiplier that was applied to scale its predefined spatial distribution regarding the porosity and soil layer parameters these were not taken into account in the sa since as described in section 3 3 below both were fixed for all simulations 5000 parameter sets were randomly generated using the latin hypercube sampling lhs within a predefined plausible range of variation for each parameter the numerical model was run with each parameter set in a representative sample of 5 storm events the outlet hydrograph obtained with each parameter set was compared to a synthetic reference hydrograph using the mean absolute difference mad to quantify the degree of dissimilarity between hydrographs the synthetic reference hydrograph was obtained by running the model with the mean value of the range of variation of each parameter the mad of all computations was analysed using the moment independent importance measure δ proposed by borgonovo 2007 as well as the first order variance based sensitivity indices s 1 i in order to quantify the effect of each parameter on the outlet hydrograph although variance based importance measure indices are often used they rely on the assumption that the variance is sufficient to describe output variability saltelli 2002 by contrast moment independent importance measures analyse the effect of the parameters without relying uniquely on the output variance 2 3 joint assimilation of soil moisture and discharge data particle filter pf methods follow a two step iterative procedure that includes predictions model forward simulations and analysis updating particle probabilities and or state variables by optimally combining the simulation results and the observations the prior and posterior probability distributions which characterise model states before and after the assimilation are approximated by a set of particles in our case each particle is a model simulation with its own set of parameters and associated state variables pf methods are likely to degenerate unless the number of particles is very large increasing exponentially with the dimension of the system state degeneracy leads to a high probability assigned to a very limited number of particles and negligible weights to all other particles van leeuwen etal 2019 given that degeneracy issues have been noted in previous studies di mauro et al 2021 and also considering that a large number of particles implies a significant increase in the computational cost of da for the present study we used a variant of the pf the so called tempered particle filter tpf method herbst y schorfheide 2019 this relatively novel approach applies tempering coefficients to inflate the likelihood within an iterative process respecting the bayes formula the bayes theorem in a pf can be formalised as follows 8 p m o p o m p o p m where p m o is the conditional probability of the model given the observation also called posterior or analysis p m is the probability of the model also called prior or background p o m is the conditional probability of the observation given the model also called the likelihood of the observations and p o is a normalisation factor in the tpf the likelihood p o m in equation 8 is factorised as 9 p m o i 1 n p o m φ i p o p m w i t h i 1 n φ i 1 where φ i is the tempering factor at the i th iteration this small enough to enable a substantial likelihood variance inflation and n is the number of iterations the tempering coefficients must add up to one in order to follow the bayes formula equation 8 this factorisation enables the decomposition of the assimilation into several tempering steps where the degeneration problem is overcome by the inflation of the likelihood variance following the pf formulation and assuming as independent both the observations assimilated into this study soil moisture and discharge p m o can be estimated at each tempering iteration i thus 10 p i m o j 1 np w j i φ i δ m m j w j i φ i i 1 ni p q o m j φ i p q o i 1 ni p θ o m j φ i p θ o where w j i is the global weight of the j th particle in the i th iteration δ is the dirac delta function np is the number of particles m j is an ensemble of size np model states ni is the number of iterations up to the i th iteration p q o m j and p θ o m j are the conditional probabilities of the observed discharge q and soil moisture θ estimated given the j th model state and p q o and p θ o are the normalization factors of the observed discharge and soil moisture respectively observation errors are assumed to be independent of each other a flow chart of the data assimilation framework is presented in fig 1 in the first iteration an initial set of parameters i e first guess must be defined to create the first set of particles after the model simulations particle weights are estimated using the observations and the tempering factor φ i this exponent ranges between 0 and 1 0 φ i 1 and makes it possible to retain a substantial number of particles with significant weights it is increased at each iteration and represents the solution to the ensemble inefficiency ratio ineff φ i 11 i n e f f φ i r w i t h i n e f f φ i 1 np j 1 np w j i φ i 2 where a targeted inefficient ratio r is previously defined the particles with high weights are resampled after each iteration i using a sequential importance resampling sir particles are replicated proportionally with their weights those with an associated low importance weight are replaced with replicas of those having higher weight particles are equally weighted after resampling next two mutations are applied to the particles model parameters are slightly perturbed these mutations based on a metropolis hasting mh algorithm allow the ensemble to regain diversity after each resampling step the mutated particle simulations are carried out and the mutated particles are accepted or rejected based on their likelihood as compared to the resampled particles likelihood after two runs of mh a new iteration is started with the estimation of a new tempering coefficient φ i and the computation of the particle weights the entire process is repeated until the sum of the tempering coefficients is equal to unity i e iterations are ended when φ n 1 i n 1 φ i where n is the total number of iterations detailed descriptions of the tpf can be found in di mauro et al 2022 and herbst and schorfheide 2019 the tpf approach was applied twice 1 using as first guess a set of random particles from the ranges of variation and assuming in the mutation of the particles a standard deviation common for all parameters 2 using a relationship between model parameters and basin antecedent conditions to establish the initial set of particles first guess and to define the standard deviation of each parameter in both cases the number of particles np used was equal to 15 and a targeted inefficient ratio r equal to 2 was assumed for the comparison of the simulated and observed discharge we used the mean absolute error mae normalised to the peak flow the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the relative volume error over the hydrograph for the comparison of soil moisture values the rmse was used 3 case study and model setup 3 1 study area the landro basin is located in the north western iberian peninsula fig 2 a streamflow gauging station managed by the regional water administration augas de galicia is located near the basin outlet receiving runoff from an area of 199 km2 the altitude ranges from 91 to 1427 m above sea level with an average terrain slope of 27 the soil is made up of gneiss metasediment and granitic rock most of the basin is covered by eucalyptus pine forests and scrublands with only a very small proportion of cultivated areas in the main channel floodplains its location confers on the basin an atlantic climate marked by abundant rainfall throughout the year with storms occurring mainly during the winter season the mean annual rainfall depth is 1412 mm and the average annual maximum daily precipitation is 62 mm the landro river has a length of 42 km and follows a s n direction on average the river has a minimum mean and maximum annual streamflow equal to 1 44 5 8 and 16 9 m3 s respectively 3 2 observed data 3 2 1 rainfall rainfall data since 2019 were provided by the regional meteorological agency meteogalicia in the form of raster rainfall fields those were estimated from the combination of rain gauge and meteorological radar observations using a conditional merging technique pettazzi and salsón 2012 which improves the characterisation of the spatial distribution of rainfall by combining the advantages of rain gauges high accuracy of rainfall data at ground level and radar high space resolution of the observations the meteorological radar operated by meteogalicia has spatial and temporal resolutions of 250 m and 5 min respectively while the rain gauge data has a temporal resolution of 10 min the observed rainfall intensity data were implemented in the numerical model as raster fields with a spatial resolution of 250 m and a temporal resolution of 1 h from the period with available rainfall data 12 storm events representing different peak flow and initial soil moisture conditions were selected table 1 each of the events analysed has a total duration of 48 h 3 2 2 river discharge discharge data for the 12 storm events were available from a stream gauge operated by the regional water administration augas de galicia the data were obtained from water level measurements performed every 10 min converted to discharge values using previously calibrated rating curves the location of the landro gauging station is shown in fig 2 longitude 613 652 utmx 29 t ed 89 latitude 4 830 448 utmy 29 t ed 89 the data provided by augas de galicia underwent an internal validation process in which erroneous observations were discarded however the uncertainty of the data is not provided within the framework of this study it was assumed that the observed discharge had a maximum relative error of 10 which is an order of magnitude used in similar studies abbaszadeh etal 2018 3 2 3 soil moisture soil moisture data were retrieved from the soil moisture active passive smap satellite provided by the national snow and ice data center among the different products available there the root zone soil moisture analysis update spl4smau was used which is obtained via the assimilation of smap l band brightness temperature data into the catchment land surface model using ensemble based kalman filtering reichle etal 2020 the product version 5 provides instantaneous soil moisture fields for both the surface 0 5 cm and root zone 0 100 cm layers at 3 h intervals over an earth fixed global cylindrical 9 km equal area scalable earth grid ease grid 2 0 peng etal 2021 reichle etal 2017 due to the rapid dynamics of some flood events the temporal resolution of satellite data is one of the main limitations of integrating satellite products into the numerical simulation of small scale hydrodynamic models the spl4smau product has a temporal resolution that is well suited for its application in short duration storm events in this study the soil moisture value for the root zone was used since it was considered the most representative means of characterising the infiltration capacity of the soil in the assimilation of observed data the average soil moisture in the whole catchment was used with the smap data having an uncertainty value of 0 02 m3 m3 reichle etal 2019 table 1 indicates the soil moisture value at the beginning of each storm event 3 3 model setup whereas section 2 1 presented a general description of the numerical model and the selected infiltration model here we will specify the particular characteristics of the numerical model of the landro basin including aspects such as the spatial discretisation used and the range of variation of the hydrological parameters considered in iber the digital terrain model dtm values are interpolated to the nodes of the computational mesh using a bilinear interpolation method the elevation value at each mesh vertex is interpolated using 5 m spatial resolution lidar derived dtm provided by the national geological institute of spain ign cnig 2021 bottom friction is modelled in iber with the manning s formula for this study the manning s roughness coefficient was defined according to the land use map of the european project corine land cover 2018 clc2018 european union copernicus land monitoring service 2018 and the recommendations of the methodological guide for the development of the national floodplain mapping system sánchez and lastra 2011 which proposes a manning s coefficient for each land use in corine since the roughness values required when computing the overland flow with the 2d swe are sometimes higher than those commonly used for riverbeds cea etal 2016 fraga etal 2013 sanz ramos etal 2021 the manning s coefficient multiplier was used here with a rather wide range of variation regarding the numerical simulation of the base flow this was set constant for each storm event and was equal to the observed flow at the beginning of the corresponding event rainfall losses were computed using the green ampt infiltration model we considered five parameters of this model k s n ψ s r 0 i a and chose a range of variation capable of representing a wide variety of soils table 2 the other two parameters contemplated in the implementation of this infiltration model were fixed in all simulations total thickness of the soil layer d s and porosity ϕ the total thickness of the soil layer d s was set to 1 m to remain consistent with the smap derived soil moisture data see section 3 2 3 the porosity ϕ of the soil was set to 0 42 since it was considered to be a parameter directly related to soil type and with low variation from one event to another this value was set within the range of variation shown in the study by fraga et al 2019 over the same area the computational domain was discretised with an unstructured non uniform mesh using a coarser mesh size in the hillslopes and a finer mesh size in the channel network this is a common procedure in 2d swe models that allows for a reduction in computational cost without compromising the accuracy of the results costabile and costanzo 2021 in order to establish the mesh size that would be used in the numerical simulations a mesh convergence analysis was performed using events 1 and 8 the results with a mesh of 1 m elements were used as a reference the resolution of this reference mesh is equal to 5 m on the watercourse and 25 m on the hillslopes these resolutions are consistent with garcía alén et al 2022 where it is concluded that higher mesh resolutions provide similar results in terms of the output hydrograph the use of a 15 k element mesh with a mesh resolution of 40 m in the water course and 800 m in the hillsides fig 3 a made it possible to reduce the computational cost of the simulation by a factor of 90 times and provides a mad mean absolute difference normalised to the peak flow lower than 3 5 in both events when compared with the reference simulation on a 1 m elements mesh fig 3b thus the 15 k mesh was taken for the numerical simulation of the selected events 4 results and discussion 4 1 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis sa was based on five different events that were simulated using 5000 different parameter sets fig 4 includes scatter plots that show the relationship between the model parameters and the mad relative to the comparison of the simulated hydrographs with the hydrographs computed in the reference simulation in this comparison the entire time series of the simulated hydrographs were considered as mentioned in section 2 2 this reference simulation was obtained by running the model with the mean value of the range of variation of each parameter in these plots each point corresponds to a single simulation result using a given parameter set a weighted histogram weighted by the mad of each simulation is included above each scatter plot most of the samples providing high mad values are grouped within a small range of k s values on the contrary the outlet hydrograph does not seem to be sensitive to the manning multiplier or to the suction parameter ψ since uniform histograms are observed for these two parameters in all the events the initial degree of saturation s r 0 tends to be very relevant when it is close to 1 and far less relevant when it is smaller than 0 8 finally the uniformity of the histograms indicates that the model is not very sensitive to the initial loss parameter i a fig 5 shows the interactions according to these three parameters k s s r 0 and i a for each of the five events and for the three pairs of parameters k s s r 0 k s i a and s r 0 i a mad values obtained in each simulation are plotted in the parameter space the size and colour of the dots are proportional to the mad value in the first row in fig 5 s r 0 against k s it can be observed that for high values of s r 0 close to 1 the results are independent of the value of k s however when s r 0 is far from its upper limit a significant interaction is observed for low values of k s there is not a clear interaction between i a and the other two parameters confirming that the sensitivity of the model to this parameter is low to further quantify the relevance of each model parameter several sensitivity measures were computed based on the mad results 1 the borgonovo moment independent importance measure δ i 2 the first order sobol sensitivity index s 1 i and 3 the sensitivity measure μ derived from the morris analysis fig 6 provides the δ i top s 1 i middle and μ bottom results obtained for the five parameters and for the five events considered in the sa the borgonovo importance measure indicates that the model is more sensitive to k s and s r 0 than to the other 3 parameters this result is consistent with the μ values obtained in the morris analysis where the values of k s and s r 0 stand out slightly above the rest of the parameters regarding the sobol s indices the sums of the first order indices are greater than 0 89 in all events indicating a weak interaction among the parameters moreover it can be deduced that the initial degree of saturation s r 0 is able to explain between 65 and 77 of the first order mad variance conversely and although the effect of the initial losses i a is already low the manning s coefficient multiplier and the suction ψ have a limited effect on the mad the effect of k s is moderate in this case with an average value of 0 13 based on these results it can be concluded that k s s r 0 and to a lesser extent i a are the most relevant model parameters 4 2 joint assimilation of soil moisture and discharge data based on the sa results the number of parameters considered in the da was reduced to saturated soil permeability k s initial degree of saturation s r 0 and initial losses i a the range of variation considered for these parameters is shown in table 2 the manning s coefficient multiplier and suction were set to 4 5 and 136 5 mm in all the simulations thus the chosen roughness coefficients maintain the same order of magnitude as in other overland flow studies where it has been observed that these coefficients tend to be higher than the ones commonly used in the simulation of river flows nguyen etal 2016 the suction value was established from the literature as based on previous experiences see e g chow et al 1988 as mentioned in section 2 3 15 particles were considered in the tempered particle filter tpf approach each particle corresponds to a model simulation with its own set of parameters and associated state variables after the iterative process 15 different outputs of streamflow and soil moisture were obtained the ensemble expectation average value of the 15 particles was used to compare with observations and to evaluate the performance of the da approach in the first iteration of the assimilation first guess the parameter values of each particle were randomly selected from their range of variation also in the application of the mh algorithm for the mutation of the particles carried out at each tempering iteration a standard deviation equal to 1 was assumed for all parameters 1 for s r 0 1 mm h for k s and 1 mm for i a fig 7 summarises the performance metrics obtained for each event while fig 8 shows the observed and simulated hydrographs and sm values the agreement between modelled and observed hydrographs is good in most of the events except in events 6 and 7 in both of these and especially in event 7 the model was unable to reproduce the observed hydrograph considering the time variability of the observed rainfall in both events the proposed methodology seems to be less effective in storm events with continuous and low intensity rainfall that generates less pronounced peak discharges excluding the result of these events the mean nse value obtained for the other 10 events was 0 72 in general a better fit was observed in the events with a well defined isolated peak discharge e g events 8 9 and 11 with nse values equal to 0 97 0 92 and 0 96 respectively concerning soil moisture the rmse between the simulations and observations was less than 0 02 in 8 of the 12 events which can be considered very satisfactory events 3 and 11 both had poor performances with rmse values of 0 08 and 0 09 respectively in order to carry out this joint assimilation by reducing as much as possible the ranges of variation of the numerical parameters considered we also searched for relationships between the parameters considered in the da and the antecedent rainfall soil moisture and streamflow of the basin fig 9 shows the relationships obtained between saturated soil permeability k s initial soil saturation s r 0 and initial losses i a and also the following antecedent conditions of the basin accumulated 5 day antecedent rainfall initial moisture observed by smap and base flow at the beginning of the event the accumulated antecedent rainfall was estimated over the 5 days prior to the start of the event in that it is a time period commonly used to estimate the antecedent moisture conditions of a basin brocca etal 2008 event 7 the worst in terms of nse is represented in red the saturated soil permeability does not show a clear trend with the antecedent conditions with rather low spearman s correlation coefficients fig 8 conversely the initial sm exhibits a significant trend with the 3 antecedent conditions considered the spearman s rank correlation with the initial baseflow reaches 0 958 which is particularly high a high correlation coefficient with the initial sm derived from smap is also observed regarding the initial losses there is no evident relationship with the basin antecedent conditions although the spearman s correlation coefficients are not high these relationships could be used to at least reduce the parameter variance and thus optimise the number of iterations needed in the pf approach particularly for dry antecedent conditions as seen in the results of i a obtained for initial sm lower than 0 3 or base flow lower than 10 m3 s it can be observed that i a varies in a range between 20 and 30 m3 s 4 3 joint assimilation of soil moisture and discharge data using a first guess and parameter variances derived from prior information the relationships between model parameters and antecedent conditions shown in fig 9 were used in a slightly different implementation of the tpf hence those relationships were used 1 to define the parameter standard deviations used in the particle mutations and 2 to establish a set of parameters synthetic prediction derived from the basin antecedent conditions of each event the synthetic parameter sets were utilised together with the parameter standard deviations to generate the first set of particles first guess of the assimilation a linear relationship was assumed for the three model parameters between k s and the initial sm from smap s r 0 and the initial sm from smap and i a and the 5 day antecedent rainfall fig 10 in the estimation of the linear regressions event 7 was not included due to its poor performance the pearson s coefficient values obtained for the relationships of k s s r 0 and i a were 0 46 0 90 and 0 59 respectively from the linear regressions standard deviations of 0 074 for s r 0 1 078 mm h for k s and 7 159 mm for i a were estimated fig 11 and fig 12 show the performance metrics obtained for each event as well as the comparison between the observed and simulated hydrographs and sm the results with this implementation of the tpf improve with respect to those obtained using the standard implementation especially in terms of discharge since in this case only 4 events gave a nse lower than 0 7 the worst nse was again on event 7 with a value of 0 27 however the mae normalised to the peak flow and the relative volume error over the hydrograph for this event indicate that the prediction was in agreement with the results observed in terms of sm no significant improvement was observed with respect to the standard implementation of the tpf however 9 of the 12 events remained with rmse values in the range of 0 02 0 03 a result very close to the uncertainty value considered in the da process 0 02 in event 11 a poor reproduction of the sm observations was obtained rmse equal to 0 087 although the s r 0 dis not match the observed sm from smap and therefore the first guess was not adequate the assimilation method was able to adapt to this outlier and eventually took it as a feasible parameter fig 13 a shows the nse obtained in the standard blue and improved orange applications of the tpf approach after the implementation of the prior information the nse always increased except in event 4 considering the 12 events the average nse was 0 37 in the first assimilation and increased to 0 74 after the implementation of prior information if event 7 is excluded in the estimation of these average values the mean nses obtained in the first and second implementations were 0 69 and 0 78 respectively fig 13a also includes the number of iterations needed in the da process a value that is directly related to the number of model runs required and thus to the computational cost of the method in general an equivalent or even higher number of iterations was needed when the prior information was included this increase in the number of iterations is in some cases related to outliers in the linear relationship between model parameters and antecedent conditions fig 10 especially in the case of i a and k s where the relation is less evident for example in the case of event 9 the value of i a taken from the linear regression and based on the 5 day antecedent rainfall red dot in fig 13b is very different from the value which yielded a good reproduction of the observed discharge data 5 conclusions a particle filer based data assimilation methodology to assimilate in situ observed discharge and satellite derived soil moisture was proposed and applied to a 2d hydrological model based on the 2d swe the proposed approach was based on the joint assimilation of soil moisture data provided by the smap satellite and discharge data measured at a gauging station twelve storm events registered in the landro river basin 199 km2 were analysed and used to evaluate the effectiveness of the method this joint assimilation framework allowed for a correct reproduction of the basin outflow with soil moisture values close to the observations for most storm events a mean nse value of 0 74 was reached for all twelve events the results were in general more accurate in rainfall events that produced isolated peak flows it was found that it was possible to relate some of the model parameters to the hydrological antecedent conditions of the catchment in this way improving the assimilation process the most significant correlation pearson s coefficient of 0 90 was identified with the initial soil saturation the application of these relationships to the da process lead to better performances but was not always accompanied by a reduction in computational cost the results of this case study then show that by considering only three hydrological parameters in the assimilation process a good compromise between da effort and model performance can be achieved declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

1914,the restriction of hydrocarbon migration within shale reservoirs by pre adsorbed water necessitates an investigation into water adsorption control mechanisms within shales in this study water vapor adsorption isotherms obtained from marine and lacustrine shale samples along with isotherms from their organic matter and experimentally verified kerogen molecular models were used to evaluate water adsorption mechanisms with simulated wet kerogen quartz nanocomposites furthermore these were also used to investigate organic matter inorganic interaction controls on water adsorption pore size distribution psd controls on water distribution in organic matter were obtained via water vapor adsorption and low pressure nitrogen adsorption analysis along with small angle neutron scattering sans analysis the results reveal water adsorption is linked to changes in mesopore volume within organic matter and porosity in kerogen models psd obtained from the shales only reveal mesopore controls at high rh with water adsorption mainly controlled by oxygen functional groups in organic matter pores and swelling clays inorganic controls on water adsorption are also observed in adsorbed water not tightly bound to the shale surface due to a high montmorillonite content in clay interlayers and organic matter interaction with quartz with a negative relationship between the adsorbed water and the quartz content collectively these findings indicate that co2 migration in shale reservoirs could be inhibited by water that is distributed in potential co2 adsorption sites within organic matter pores and montmorillonite keywords water vapor adsorption shale reservoirs organic matter pore size distribution water distribution co2 storage data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction understanding the impact of pore scale water distribution relative to other immiscible fluids present within shale formations tokunaga 2009 is critical to hydrocarbon exploitation of shale reservoirs this is especially important when changes in adsorption selectivity of hydrocarbon mixtures due to the presence of pre adsorbed water di lella et al 2006 is factored into the hydrocarbon exploitation process for shale reservoirs this is because unlike conventional reservoirs shales are characterised by fluid interactions controlled by capillary forces along with inorganic and organic content dehghanpour et al 2013 while organic content influence on water adsorption is found in an induction of wettability complexity within shales liang et al 2016 that of inorganic content is seen in effective permeability alteration due to clay mineral hydration dehghanpour et al 2012 zolfaghari et al 2017a however it is important to note that adsorption forces also play a role in water uptake for water wet organic rich shales which are swelling clay deficient dehghanpour et al 2012 with studies noting the physical and chemical nature of water interactions with organic matter zhou et al 2016 these findings along with the critical role organic and inorganic components play in low hydraulic fracture water recovery hu et al 2015 necessitate an analysis of mechanisms behind water adsorption these mechanisms can be experimentally analysed via sorption desorption isotherms described by a relationship between relative vapour pressure and water content at a given temperature arthur et al 2016 de la llave et al 2010 shen et al 2018 wan et al 2016 these isotherms which are usually linked to a hysteresis loop having a shape influenced by temperature pore size and pore wall hydrophyphilicity de la llave et al 2012 2010 striolo et al 2005 have been used to determine inorganic and organic pore size distribution psd chen et al 2020 zolfaghari dehghanpour xu 2017 zolfaghari dehghanpour 2015 and to experimentally verify water condensation differences in inorganic and organic pores as being responsible for a higher possession of gas storage accessible pores by the latter li et al 2017 however while experimental isotherms obtained from different shale formations have revealed a stronger relationship between inorganic content and water vapor adsorption capacity wang et al 2019 and a relationship between organic content and hysteresis loop variability yang et al 2020a the mechanisms behind variations in inorganic or organic pore influence on water vapor sorption isotherms for different shale reservoirs are yet to be analysed this is even more critical under higher temperature conditions which is difficult to impose in an experiment this is despite experimental suggestions of water vapor diffusion coefficient in shales that is usually enhanced at high temperatures sang et al 2020a thus the superiority of simulated isotherms over those obtained from experiments being found in an imposition of higher temperature conditions has led to the usage of a combination of experimental and simulated water adsorption isotherms to analyse mechanisms behind water adsorption striolo et al 2005 apart from high temperature limitations another demerit of experimental water adsorption is inaccuracy when used to determine capillary pressure since water sorption in shales is controlled by surface chemistry not pore size lahn et al 2020 seemann et al 2017 this is despite suggestions of shale psd obtained from water sorption desorption isotherms being superior to those obtained from experimental techniques like mercury injection capillary pressure analysis micp zolfaghari and dehghanpour 2015 and vapor sorption experiments these methods have been used to note water adsorption in shales as being moderately controlled by micropores 2 nm and dominantly influenced by mesopores 2 50 nm sang et al 2020b with the former having a major influence on monolayer water adsorption bai et al 2020 thus an investigation into water adsorption controls in shale reservoirs necessitates a conjunction of experimental water sorption desorption isotherms with various techniques which can be used to characterise shale nanopore structure these techniques include the usage of a combination of water vapor sorption desorption isotherms with low pressure nitrogen adsorption and small angle neutron scattering sans to observe micro and mesopore controls on water adsorption in shales sang et al 2018a furthermore a recent usage of sans to reveal organic and inorganic controls on water condensation in shales sang et al 2020b suggests an insight into water sorption controls in organic rich shales can be obtained by combining an experimental characterization of organic and inorganic pore structure with water sorption desorption studies have also emphasized the need for investigations into temperature influence on water sorption in shales via thermodynamic analysis and modelling of the two phases of water adsorption tang et al 2017 the efficacy of such an approach can be found in the usage of modelled experimental water vapor isotherm data along with an evaluation of isosteric heat determined via the clausius clapeyron equation duan and li 2018 sang et al 2019a in this study low pressure nitrogen adsorption and small angle neutron scattering analysis along with experimental water vapor isotherms are carried out on the organic matter om and shale samples of the marine longmaxi shale lacustrine qingshankou and chang 7 shale oil formations these methods are performed in conjunction with high temperature simulations of water adsorption in experimentally verified kerogen models of each formation to analyse water adsorption mechanisms for shale reservoirs water adsorption is discussed using the modelled isotherms along with isosteric heat pore structure and composition controls obtained from sans and low pressure nitrogen adsorption experimental observation of shale nanopores furthermore nanocomposites created with kerogen models and quartz are also used to evaluate water distribution controls in the shale formations ultimately we believe observations that is obtained in this study can be significant for co2 storage capacity evaluations in shale reservoirs 2 methodology 2 1 samples and experimental techniques organic matter in longmaxi shales was formed in a deep water continental shelf characterised by an oxygen deficient environment which aided a high biogenic yield derived from blooming algae radiolarians sponges pens and other organisms dong et al 2018 in comparison to this marine derivation of organic matter the lacustrine chang 7 shales comprises of organic matter generated within a lacustrine delta from phytoplankton and terrigenous plants chen et al 2019 similarly organic matter accumulation in the lacustrine qingshankou shales has also been stated as being due to an occurrence of good preservation conditions along with a high primary productivity and terrigenous input xu et al 2019 shale samples analysed in this study were obtained from the longmaxi qingshankou and chang 7 formations offcuts of each sample were crushed into powdered form 200 mesh and used for total organic carbon toc vitrinite reflectance and x ray diffraction measurements via procedures prescribed by sun et al 2016 the mineralogical and organic matter information obtained is shown in table 1 furthermore in order to ascertain organic carbon content influence on water adsorption solid organic matter om which includes kerogen and bitumen was also extracted from offcuts of each shale sample via chemical extraction procedure following zhang et al zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b 2 1 1 low pressure nitrogen adsorption and sans experiments low pressure n2 adsorption analysis was undertaken on weighed powdered organic matter and shale samples 35 80 mesh using the quantachrome autosorb 1 apparatus the procedure undertaken as described in our previous study finnian ukaomah et al 2022 while several studies have made optimal mesh recommendations based on low pressure adsorption data in shale samples with various mesh sizes hazra et al 2018 mastalerz et al 2017 the size of mesh that was used in this study is 200 which is generally recommended for low pressure n2 adsorption analysis of shale reservoirs han et al 2016 other sample preparation procedures include moisture removal via degassing of the powdered samples at 110 c for 5 h in a vacuum considering the influence of temperature on low pressure adsorption data holmes et al 2017 degassing temperature was 110 c which is proposed for shale samples singh et al 2021 degassing was followed by measurement of nitrogen adsorption desorption at 77 3 k within relative pressures calibrated with saturated vapor pressure of the gas the density functional theory dft and the brauner emmet teller bet model were then respectively used to obtain the mesopore macropore volume 1 4 300 nm and surface area from the nitrogen adsorption data lowell et al 2004 thommes et al 2015 the sans experiments were done with the sans apparatus at the china spallation neutron source csns with fixed sample to detector distance at 4 m covering a 0 005 å 1 to 0 6 å 1 q range via neutrons that are received at different incident wavelengths 1 10 å powdered shale samples 35 80 mesh containing organic matter and extracted organic matter were respectively oven dried for 48 h at 60 c before being loaded into the sans apparatus to obtain their pore structure information the scattering length density sld for each shale sample was obtained by volume averaging the sld value of all shale components sun et al 2017 the sans datasets were analysed with the igor pro software via a polydisperse size distribution model pdsm that assumes shale pores are randomly distributed spheres sun et al 2022 the relationship between the q value from the sans data and the shale pore radius r was established via r 2 5 q radliński et al 2000 2 1 2 water vapor adsorption isotherm measurement sample preparation for water vapor sorption analysis wva involved weighed 35 80 mesh of the samples both shale and organic matter getting oven dried at 100 c for 48 h this removal of initial moisture content before conducting the wva was done to prevent irreversible pore structure changes the wva isotherms were then obtained from gravimetric measurements of water vapor uptake and loss as a function of relative humidity rh in a quantachrome aquadyne dvs sorption analyser at three temperatures 25 c 35 c and 45 c with rh set from 2 to 95 importantly the 2 rh was achieved before starting the experiment via usage of a 100 150 cm3 min flow rate furthermore while change in sample mass during adsorption and desorption processes was sequentially recorded with a 0 1 μg 1 accuracy sample adsorption desorption equilibrium conditions at any value of rh comprised 0 001 min sample mass change 2 2 adsorption models 2 2 1 gab model to mathematically describe water adsorption in the samples the guggenheim guggenheim 1963 anderson anderson 1946 and de boer de boer 1953 modified extension of the bet model brunauer et al 1938 is applied over the entire range of rh this gab model differs from the bet theory brunauer et al 1938 by assuming that the heat from adsorption of multilayers is less than the heat due to liquefaction and sorbate molecules beyond the monolayer will continue to interact with the sorbent surface sang et al 2019b the model introduces a parameter k into the adsorbed amount v mg g via sang et al 2019b 1 v v m k c gab r h 1 k r h 1 k r h c gab k r h where v m represents the gab monolayer capacity mg g c gab a constant linked to the heat of adsorption k a constant linked to adsorption energies within multilayer adsorption sites r h the relative humidity of water vapor 2 2 2 freundlich model this model assumes that all adsorption sites of a porous solid act simultaneously despite being unevenly distributed freundlich 1931 the model is linearly defined as sang et al 2019b 2 lnv l n k 1 n l n r h where v represents adsorbed mass mg g k and n are constants obtained from the intercept lnk and slope 1 n of linearly relating lnv vs ln r h 2 2 3 hysteresis characterisation a hysteresis loop is an observed difference in adsorption and desorption isotherms tang et al 2017 yang et al 2020c in this study hysteresis in water vapor isotherms obtained from shale and om samples is quantitively described via the area hysteresis index ahi as follows tang et al 2017 3 ahi a de a ad a de 100 where a de and a ad respectively represent the area under the adsorption and desorption isotherms 2 2 4 derivation of pore size distribution from water vapor adsorption several studies have used the kelvin equation to characterize psd from wva adsorption isotherms chen et al 2021 hou et al 2021 yang jia he et al 2020a zolfaghari dehghanpour xu 2017 chen et al 2021 suggested the insensitivity of the psd obtained via wva from natural and organic free shale samples via the kelvin equation to the changes in the contact angle in addition despite the speculation of uniform wettability within the pores without any condensation within the organic pores wva psd obtained via the kelvin equation can be used in conjunction with the psd from low pressure n2 adsorption to acquire the organic psd zolfaghari et al 2017b thus in this study we used the kelvin equation to characterise wva psd from shale and organic matter samples the equation exploits a relationship between rh and pore size when capillary condensation takes place within the pore zolfaghari et al 2017b 4 ln 1 rh 2 γ v m cos θ t r r p where rh represents relative humidity γ surface tension vm liquid molar volume t temperature θ the contact angle r and rp universal gas constant and pore radius since pore size is not dependent on the numerator yang et al 2020a the pore size of condensed water vapor filled capillary pores is obtained via zolfaghari et al 2017b 5 r p rt ln 1 rh 2 2 γ v m cos θ d w d l n 1 rh where w represents pore volume fraction of pore sizes less than or equal to rp which does not represent the true pore diameter since water vapor adsorption on pore surfaces also takes place via multilayer adsorption before capillary condensation the thickness formed from the former is considered into pore diameter calculations via 6 d 2 r p t with halsey s equation used to obtain the adsorption layer thickness t as follows 7 t 0 354 5 ln p p 0 2 2 3 molecular simulation molecular simulation is a theoretical method of analysing organic matter interaction with fluids under higher temperature conditions difficult to impose in an experiment thus in order to ascertain organic matter influence on water adsorption mechanisms in the shale formations water adsorption on their experimentally verified molecular kerogen models is simulated at 525 k on the materials studio ms application furthermore simulation of water distribution in nanocomposites respectively comprising the kerogen models and quartz was also utilized via ms to evaluate water distribution controls 2 3 1 molecular models experimentally verified kerogen models used include the silurian model c194h96o9n4s7 by huang et al 2017 the type ii chang 7 oil shale kerogen model c300h297o18n13s10 recently proposed by wu xu 2022 and the oil prone qingshankou kerogen model c156h159n3o10 proposed by cao et al 2021 to create 3 d structures of these models ten molecules of each model were respectively initially geometrically optimized using the condensed phase optimized molecular potentials for atomistic simulation studies compass forcefield before being placed in an amorphous cell with an 0 1 g cm3 initial density and 300 k temperature the forcefield uses a 6 9 lennard jones potential parameterization with mixing rules described in previous studies sun 1998 the amorphous cell setup exceeds the 1700 atoms cell requirement prescribed by previous studies ungerer et al 2015 in order to obtain configurations with the global lowest energy the cells were respectively further optimized and relaxed with the compass forcefield via annealing and molecular dynamics procedures prescribed by huang et al 2018 however it is critical to note that typical reservoir condition of each formation obtained from stated temperature and pressure gradients were used for final npt molecular dynamics simulations of the kerogen molecules fig 1 with final relaxation of the longmaxi molecules at 360 k and 23 6 mpa huang et al 2017 the chang 7 model at 346 84 k and 16 9 mpa li et al 2013 zhao et al 2021 and qingshankou kerogen molecules at 373 k and 42 5 mpa feng et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b for all simulations the nose hoover thermostat was used to control the system temperature hoover 1985 with pressure imposed via the berendsen barostat berendsen et al 1998 2 3 2 water adsorption simulation water adsorption on the kerogen models was performed via grand canonical monte carlo gcmc simulations conducted on the ms sorption module the simulations are characterised by chemical potential volume and temperature system parameters being fixed the chemical potential is converted to vapor pressure p zhang et al 2021 which is calibrated with water saturated vapor pressure psat determined from the national institute of standards and technology national institute of standards and technology 2018 the system relative humidity was therefore obtained as p psat water adsorption simulation was then carried out from 5 rh to 95 rh at 525 k with 1 107 monte carlo steps 5 106 steps for equilibration and 5 106 for ensemble average furthermore while the ewald summation method was used to describe electrostatic interactions with an accuracy of 0 001 kcal mol 1 van der waals atom method based interactions between different molecules were determined within a 15 5 å cut off distance the adsorbed water content s w was obtained from the number of water molecules n w adsorbed on the kerogen models via zhang et al 2021 8 s w n w m w n a a where water molar mass g mol is represented by m w n a represents the avogadro constant mol 1 and a the surface area of simulated kerogen m2 the compass forcefield which has been used to simulate the interaction of fluids with kerogen and quartz sui yao 2016 wu et al 2013 was used to parameterize water adsorption in gcmc simulations 2 3 3 water distribution in nanocomposites to determine water distribution controls in the shale reservoirs organic inorganic nanocomposite models were prepared by coupling ten molecules of each kerogen model with quartz similar to previous simulations of kerogen mineral interactions faisal et al 2021 the α quartz unit cell cell dimensions are a b 4 9134 å c 5 4052 å and α β 90 γ 120 on ms was used to create a 4 8 1 supercell used to construct the nanocomposite model wet nanocomposites were then built by using the packing task on ms to insert 32 water molecules with the density set to 0 4 g cm3 fig 2 nvt molecular dynamics simulation were then performed at 300 k and 400 ps to bring the wet model to equilibrium which was attained when temperature vs simulation time exhibit fluctuations in proximity to the simulation temperature after rising and approaching an equilibrium point to analyse heat treatment controls on water distribution the nanocomposites were further subjected to nvt 200 ps md simulations at 400 k after md simulations the quartz surface becomes unfixed and frames from the nvt trajectory are used to obtain the concentration profile from the nanocomposite the md simulation of water distribution was done via compass forcefield parameterization at a 0 1 fs time step 2 3 4 kerogen model validation a comparison of data from the simulated kerogen models with experimental results are done to ensure their validity for this study in the first phase a comparison of kerogen density reveals the 1 307 g cm3 and 1 18 g cm3 density respectively obtained from the longmaxi and qingshankou kerogen as falling within experimentally measured density ranges 1 18 g cm3 to 1 35 g cm3 for mature type ii kerogen okiongbo et al 2005 with the density obtained from the chang 7 kerogen model in this study that is 1 12 g cm3 being very close to this range further validation was also carried out with a helium probe to estimate kerogen porosity according to procedures prescribed by guo et al 2020 this involved using the conolly surface to obtain the free pore volume which was then used to determine the kerogen matrix porosity fig 3 the porosities respectively obtained for the longmaxi 21 78 chang 7 17 22 and qingshankou models 14 67 all fall within the range experimentally obtained from the barnet shale 4 45 22 50 loucks et al 2009 in addition the h c o c n c and s c atomic ratios in each model is equivalent to those from experimentally characterized kerogen in each formation this includes ratios from longmaxi kerogen model 0 495 0 046 0 02 1 86 0 036 being equivalent to those obtained from a highly mature type ii kerogen huang et al 2017 and chang 7 model atomic ratios 0 99 0 06 0 043 0 033 close to those of type ii oil prone chang 7 kerogen wu xu 2022 atomic ratios from the sulphur deficient qingshankou model h c o c and n c 1 101 0 064 0 019 resemble those experimentally proposed for oil prone kerogen from the qingshankou formation cao et al 2021 overall the atomic ratios in the kerogen models indicate a thermal maturity which varies from longmaxi chang 7 qingshankou 3 results 3 1 pore structure low pressure nitrogen adsorption wva and sans a correlation of hysteresis loops obtained from shale n2 adsorption and desorption isotherms fig 4 a with iupac recommendations sing et al 1985 reveals the presence of inkbottle and slit shaped pores with the latter also observed to be dominant in the organic matter samples fig 4b table 2 reveals shale mesopore macropore volume varies from 0 015 ml g to 0 019 ml g with organic matter specimens characterised by volume that varies from 0 02 ml g to 0 032 ml g in addition while bet surface area in the shales vary from 3 48 m2 g to 12 86 m2 g organic matter exhibited a surface area that varies from 11 32 m2 g to 24 54 m2 g porosity obtained from n2 adsorption on the shale samples was found from 2 9 to 4 6 table 2 sans profiles obtained from shale samples reveal scattering curves which obey a power law within a q range of 0 001 to 0 1 fig 5 power law deviations observed in the scattering profiles are probably due to long neutron wavelength 12 å radlinski et al 1999 micropore scattering sang et al 2018a and scattering from hydrogen atoms in organic matter or residual moisture within the pores mastalerz et al 2012 radlinski et al 1999 a comparison of scattering profiles also reveals that a higher flat scattering background at high q values observed in shale sample z22 48 is probably due to high micro scale heterogeneity or water bound within the clay minerals and organic matter the former is exemplified by the shale sample having the highest percentage of montmorillonite within mixed clays table 1 a comparison of porosities obtained from both sans and n2 adsorption table 2 reveals a similar variation in porosity obtained from pdsm porosity and n2 for the shale samples with higher values from the former being related to the sans experimental technique that basically measures both accessible and inaccessible pores within the samples this measurement difference also explains as why surface area measured with sans varies widely compared to what was found via n2 pore volume distribution obtained from wva sans and n2 adsorption are showing a similar trend over a 1 nm to 100 nm pore size range fig 6 for all shale samples except jy11 4 which is characterised by n2 pore volume distribution that steadily decreases within this pore size range another exception is also observed in sans and wva revealing sample z22 48 as being characterised by an initial increase in pore volume at a lower pore size range compared to the remaining samples considering the organic matter samples fig 7 apart from showing a comparable pattern pore volume distribution obtained from wva are higher than those obtained from n2 adsorption for all samples except sample 3hc 4 this variation in pore volume is negatively linked to the 3hc 4 z22 48 jy11 4 variation in mesopore macropore volume observed within the organic matter samples table 2 that is larger differences in pore volume are observed in organic matter samples having low mesopore macropore volumes 3 2 water vapor isotherm hysteresis characterisation water vapor adsorption desorption isotherms obtained from all shale and organic matter samples over the entire rh range 5 to 95 at three temperatures 25 c 35 c and 45 c reveal type ii adsorption isotherms with type h3 hysteresis loops fig 8 and fig 9 based on iupac classifications sing et al 1985 these isotherms are divided into a low rh region dominated by monolayer adsorption rh 0 2 intermediate region after termination of monolayer adsorption rh 0 8 and a high rh region dominated by capillary condensation rh varies from 0 8 to 0 95 hou et al 2021 all samples were also observed to be characterised by pronounced hysteresis behaviour at high rh conditions due to multilayer adsorption with water adsorption desorption isotherms obtained from some samples not converging towards minimum values and remaining open under low rh conditions this lack of convergence is profound in isotherms respectively obtained from shale samples jy11 4 and z22 48 at 25 c and 35 c fig 8a and 8b and isotherms obtained from organic matter sample jy11 4 at all experimental temperatures fig 9 a comparison of ahi values from shales at all experimental temperatures table 3 reveals jy11 4 has the highest ahi value due to being characterised by maximum hysteresis which occur at a higher rh in the organic matter samples table 4 this phenomenon is only observed at 45 c with sample z22 48 having the highest ahi values at 25 c and 35 c in addition a plot of ahi vs temperature for both shale and organic matter samples fig 10 a and 10b reveals sample jy11 4 having a weaker negative relationship of these two parameters compared to other samples 3 3 modelled adsorption isotherms from experiment wva isotherms are fitted with the gab and freundlich models to evaluate organic and inorganic controls on water sorption in the shale formations while parameters obtained from gab and freundlich fitted wva isotherms of the shale figs 11 and 12 are presented in table 3 those from organic matter samples figs 13 and 14 are illuminated in table 4 freundlich n parameters being 1 for all samples indicates an overall low affinity for water and a similar observation obtained for the correction factor k which confirms that multilayer adsorption is weaker compared to adsorption within the monolayer sang et al 2019b 3 3 1 shales for the shale samples gab fitting results at all temperatures reveal a monolayer moisture content v m varying in the order of 3hc 4 z22 48 jy11 4 table 3 in addition sample jy11 4 is observed as having the highest binding strength parameter c gab at all experimental temperatures freundlich fitting of the shale isotherms at all temperatures reveals the existence of two adsorption regimes with k values obtained from the entire rh range between those of low 70 rh and high 70 rh adsorption strength k values obtained at 70 rh are observed to follow 3hc 4 z22 48 jy11 4 with a similar trend only observed under 70 rh conditions at 45 c as the k values obtained at other temperatures show 3hc 4 jy11 4 z22 48 table 3 3 3 2 organic matter for the extracted organic matter samples table 4 gab fitting reveals a v m exhibiting jy11 4 z22 48 3hc 4 at 35 c and 45 c with the parameters showing jy11 4 3hc 4 z22 48 at 25 c in addition apart from values at 45 c which reveals jy11 4 as having a value higher than other samples c gab values obtained from the organic samples are observed as z22 48 jy11 4 3hc 4 similar to the shale samples freundlich fitting of the organic matter isotherms table 4 also was found that k values obtained from the entire rh range within those obtained from 70 rh and 70 rh with k values obtained at both rh ranges observed to follow jy11 4 z22 48 3hc 4 at all experimental temperatures 3 4 isosteric heat of adsorption several studies have used isosteric heat of adsorption to gain an insight into how adsorbed water interacts with the shale surface duan and li 2018 sang et al 2019b thus in this study we used the slope of ln p vs 1 t plots to obtain the isosteric heat of adsorption for shale and kerogen samples via the clausius clapeyron equation sang et al 2019b 4 ln p 1 t v 1 r δ h ads where p represents water vapor pressure kpa t temperature k r the universal gas constant jmol 1k 1 and δ h ads the heat of adsorption within a specified water content v mg g isosteric heat of adsorption δ h ads values obtained from the shale samples over a 0 05 mg g to 11 03 mg g water content range are exothermic and range from 5 kj mol to 45 kj mol for the entire samples except those from z22 48 approaching the pure water latent heat of vaporization δ h vap 42 kj mol 1 as water content increases fig 15 a while other samples are only characterised by decreasing δ h ads values at lower water content before approaching δ h vap as water content increases a reverse phenomenon is observed generally in lower δ h ads values in sample z22 48 in this sample this value increases with water content while remaining below δ h vap alike shale samples δ h ads values obtained from the organic matter samples over a 0 19 mg g to 21 mg g water content range are exothermic ranging from 16 kj mol to 57 kj mol fig 15b while sample z22 48 is characterised by δ h ads which increases at lower water content before decreasing to approach δ h vap after reaching maximum δ h ads 57 kj mol however an opposite trend is observed in sample jy11 4 which is characterised by a decreasing δ h ads at lower water content which then steadily increases while remaining less than δ h vap after minimum δ h ads 28 kj mol is attained another important phenomenon which contributes to the range of δ h ads values obtained from the organic matter samples is found in sample 3hc 4 being initially characterised by a reduction in δ h ads at lower water content which starts to increase and approach δ h vap when minimum δ h ads 16 kj mol is reached 4 discussion 4 1 pore structure controls on water adsorption studies have used a conjunction of sans and low pressure nitrogen adsorption experiments to observe shale pore structure controls on water vapor adsorption at higher rh sang et al 2018b with others using pore volume distributions obtained from wva and low pressure nitrogen adsorption to make a similar observation gao et al 2022 hou et al 2021 thus to obtain organic matter and inorganic pore structure controls on water adsorption we compare shale and organic matter pore structure parameters obtained from sans wva at 25 c and n2 adsorption shale wva isotherms obtained at 25 c fig 8a show 3hc 4 jy11 4 z22 48 variation of adsorbed volume at rh 80 that is similar to mesopore volume and or porosity variations obtained from low pressure n2 adsorption table 2 sans is also used to establish a negative relationship between the fraction of closed pores within the shale samples and water adsorption at rh 80 table 2 studies have shown that both inaccessible and accessible pore measurement can become possible when sans and low pressure adsorption are combined chandra et al 2020 with others methods following the same measurements technique to observe shales with larger mesopore volumes and nitrogen accessible pores possessing more sites for water condensation at high rh sang et al 2018b importantly since low pressure nitrogen adsorption is unable to characterize pores sizes 1 7 nm sang et al 2019b a possession of the highest fraction of pores inaccessible to low pressure n2 adsorption and an observation of a micropore volume peak 2nm pore size in sample z22 48 obtained from sans fig 6 both indicate that an inhibition of water condensation at high rh within the sample was due to the presence of a small number of external mesopores and the presence of bound water in large micropores less than but close to 2 nm the latter was also confirmed by this shale sample being characterised by a higher flat scattering background at high q fig 5 in addition the higher surface area and closed pore fraction observed in sample z22 48 is also possibly due to high montmorillonite content which resulted in the formation of inaccessible pores within interlayer spaces that cannot be accessed by the n2 molecules sang et al 2018a organic matter wva isotherms at 25 c fig 9a reveal a positive relationship between water vapor adsorption and organic matter mesopore volume organic matter mesopore controls on water adsorption are also delineated in a negative relationship between adsorbed water volume at all experimental rh and mesopore volume table 2 and a reduction in the difference between wva and n2 pore volume distributions as organic matter mesopore volume increases fig 7 organic matter porosity controls are also confirmed by the positive relationship between simulated adsorbed volume and porosity obtained from the kerogen models and experimental organic matter isotherms revealing a negative relationship between organic matter mesopore volume and water adsorption the latter is found in organic matter mesopore volume varying in opposite trend compared to a jy11 4 z22 48 3hc 4 organic matter variation in adsorbed volume gab v m and freundlich k while shale organic matter micropores control water adsorption at lower rh ranges via monolayer coverage mesopore control is achieved at higher rh values via multilayer adsorption zhang et al 2022 4 2 inorganic and organic content controls on water adsorption several studies have used wva isotherms to observe organic and inorganic controls on water adsorption in shale reservoirs sang et al 2019b yang et al 2021a in this study wva isotherms obtained from shales and organic matter along with simulated wet kerogen quartz nanocomposites reveal an interplay between organic matter and mineral content in regards to water adsorption controls 4 2 1 clay controls from wva and isosteric heat inorganic controls are first evidenced by an observation of mixed layer clay content characterised by a positive link to the gab monolayer moisture content v m and the fruendlich adsorption capacity constant k obtained from the shale samples at high adsorption strength regimes table 3 in addition the qingshankou shale sample which is characterised by the highest mixed layer clay content also has the highest adsorbed water volume at all observed maximum rh fig 8 table 1 clay content controls on water adsorption are also obtained from the determination of isosteric heat of adsorption from the shale samples they reveal all shale samples apart from the chang 7 formation as characterised by an isosteric heat that declines at low adsorbed water content to a minimum value before gradually approaching the heat of vaporization isosteric heat of adsorption can be used to determine the bound water and free water boundary quirijns et al 2005 with studies using isosteric heat of sorption from wheat grains to suggest that an increase in isosteric heat at low moisture content is due to monolayer adsorption induced by highly active polar sites within the sample li et al 2011 thus the observed increase in isosteric heat at low water content observed in the chang 7 shale sample is possibly due to a higher montmorillonite content in the clay interlayers which swells and provides additional primary water adsorption sites fig 15a this expansion is verified by isotherms from the shale sample with an increase in adsorbed desorbed volume with increasing experimental temperature fig 8 furthermore the occurrence of isosteric heat values obtained from the chang 7 shale sample beneath the latent heat of vaporization fig 15a also infers that the observed isotherm changes with temperature are due to monolayer moisture not being tightly bound to the shale surface isosteric heat values obtained from organic matter extracted from the chang 7 shale are demonstrating an initial increase at lower water content which then approaches the latent heat of vaporization after attaining a maximum value fig 15b however this indication of expansion in primary adsorption sites within organic matter requires further investigations in future studies 4 2 2 organic matter oxygen functional group ofg water interaction studies have reported that organic rich shales can adsorb high water amounts due to the presence of ofgs in organic matter pores yang et al 2021a which causes a lack of convergence in experimental water vapor isotherms this phenomenon is attributed to the adsorbed water trapped within the micropore space via hydrogen bonding yang et al 2020b with others observing a positive relationship between the thermal maturity of organic matter and adsorbed moisture li et al 2020 furthermore bai et al 2020 recently observed how changes in the ofgs of organic matter at primary adsorption sites can have a positive influence on monolayer water adsorption in shales with very little effect on multi layered adsorption in this study an indication of organic matter maturity control on water adsorption is signified by highly mature longmaxi shale sample having higher c gab and ahi values than less mature samples from other shale reservoirs despite having the lowest clay content the former observation differs from previous relationship of high c gab values to water adsorption on primary adsorption sites due to low thermal maturity of organic matter in shales yang et al 2021a in addition while the negative relationship observed between ahi and temperature for both shale and organic matter samples fig 10a and 10b are in agreement with similar observations to temperature controls on ahi variation in shales tang et al 2017 the longmaxi samples revealed to have less affected by temperature this is probably due to the higher ofg content of the organic matter in the shale which restricted the desorption of adsorbed water the higher adsorbed water volume in the longmaxi organic matter samples is also linked to the presence of more ofg studies have posited on how ofg rich asphaltene in organic matter being pre adsorbed on the quartz surface could reduce the water affinity of the mineral in shales li et al 2020 thus wva isotherms obtained from the extracted organic matter and kerogen models fig 9 and fig 16 reveal that despite being characterised by a high quartz content water adsorption on the mature longmaxi shale sample was inhibited by a pre adsorption of ofg rich organic compounds on the quartz surface the control of organic matter ofg on water interaction with quartz is also revealed in nanocomposite water distribution variations with temperature snapshots of water distribution in the nanocomposites under increasing temperature reveal water clustering on the quartz surface and adsorbed around kerogen polar groups fig 17 however due to the larger amounts of ofgs in the longmaxi kerogen water adsorbed on the kerogen ofgs become clustered on the quartz surface due to kerogen clustering induced by a temperature increase to 400 k fig 17a in addition compared to profiles obtained from other nanocomposites fig 18 b and 18c two prominent 400 k peaks on concentration profiles obtained from the longmaxi nanocomposites also reveal a higher clustering of kerogen molecules on the quartz surface as temperature increases fig 18a thus we speculate that an inhibition of organic matter quartz interaction is facilitated by lower quartz content and organic matter ofg which in turn caused higher water adsorption observed in the quartz deficient chang 7 and qingshankou shale samples overall this explains the quartz content control on water adsorption evidenced by gab monolayer moisture content v m varying from quartz deficient shales to quartz rich samples as follows 3hc 4 z22 48 jy11 4 thus while several studies have confirmed that thermal maturity of the organic matter controls water affinity hu et al 2016 and adsorption in shale formations yang et al 2021a and apart from the fact that carbon aromaticity of the organic material also impacts water wettability in shales jagadisan and heidari 2020 our observations suggest that its necessary to also consider pre adsorption of oxygen functional groups of the organic matter on mineral surfaces 4 3 water distribution and co2 storage implications shale reservoirs contain water which occur as free water within the pore space or adsorbed pore surface water yang et al 2021b studies have observed how the co2 storage capacity of shales is controlled by an occurrence of free water in reservoir pores hagemann et al 2016 and adsorbed water on hydrophilic clay nanopores jin and firoozabadi 2014 with others using wva isotherms to obtain adsorbed and free water distribution controls in shale reservoirs yang et al 2021b in this study psd obtained from wva sans and low pressure nitrogen adsorption illustrated mesopore control on water adsorption in shales at high rh with wva isotherms revealing water distribution as being controlled by the interaction of water with ofgs in organic matter pores and mixed layer clays while primary site adsorption is controlled via monolayer coverage induced by the latter the distribution of water in shale organic matter micropores is attributed to condensation at secondary adsorption sites after primary site adsorption has taken place yang et al 2021b in addition water distribution in extracted organic matter analysed in this study was facilitated by decreasing mesopore volume and increase in ofg within organic matter with quartz controls on water adsorption linked to an interaction with ofgs in organic matter the migration of injected co2 in shales is inhibited by the occupation or blocking of co2 adsorption sites by water adsorbed on hydrophilic clays and organic matter ofgs huang et al 2021 thus while co2 migration in other samples will be mainly suppressed by water occupation of potential co2 adsorption sites in organic matter pores the presence of pre adsorbed water induced by the hydrophilic mixed layer montmorillonite will severely stop the migration of injected co2 into the chang 7 shale oil reservoir this pre adsorbed water which is not tightly bound to the shale surface will block potential co2 adsorption sites in the shale reservoir during the co2 injection process 5 conclusion an experimental and molecular dynamics simulation into water adsorption in marine and lacustrine shales was undertaken to obtain water adsorption controls in shale reservoirs wva analysis and low pressure nitrogen adsorption were performed on shale and organic matter samples along with sans measurements from shales along with high temperature wva simulations and water distribution in kerogen nanocomposites with experimentally verified kerogen models based on the results the following key observations on water adsorption controls was seen 1 while water adsorption in shales at high rh is aided by a decrease in mesopore volume organic matter is characterised by a similar control at all rh and an increase in oxygen functional groups 2 water adsorption at all rh in shales is strongly controlled by the interaction of water with oxygen functional groups in organic matter pores and mixed layered clays with a negative relationship between water adsorption and quartz content being due to the interaction of oxygen functional groups within organic matter and quartz 3 the presence of high amounts of montmorillonite within clay interlayers of shales can induce water distribution not tightly bound to the shale surface 4 these findings are significant for hydrocarbon exploitation of shale reservoirs and also suggest that co2 migration in shale reservoirs will be inhibited by an occurrence of water in potential co2 adsorption sites within organic matter pores and montmorillonite induced water distribution that is not tightly bound to the shale surface credit authorship contribution statement chima

1914,the restriction of hydrocarbon migration within shale reservoirs by pre adsorbed water necessitates an investigation into water adsorption control mechanisms within shales in this study water vapor adsorption isotherms obtained from marine and lacustrine shale samples along with isotherms from their organic matter and experimentally verified kerogen molecular models were used to evaluate water adsorption mechanisms with simulated wet kerogen quartz nanocomposites furthermore these were also used to investigate organic matter inorganic interaction controls on water adsorption pore size distribution psd controls on water distribution in organic matter were obtained via water vapor adsorption and low pressure nitrogen adsorption analysis along with small angle neutron scattering sans analysis the results reveal water adsorption is linked to changes in mesopore volume within organic matter and porosity in kerogen models psd obtained from the shales only reveal mesopore controls at high rh with water adsorption mainly controlled by oxygen functional groups in organic matter pores and swelling clays inorganic controls on water adsorption are also observed in adsorbed water not tightly bound to the shale surface due to a high montmorillonite content in clay interlayers and organic matter interaction with quartz with a negative relationship between the adsorbed water and the quartz content collectively these findings indicate that co2 migration in shale reservoirs could be inhibited by water that is distributed in potential co2 adsorption sites within organic matter pores and montmorillonite keywords water vapor adsorption shale reservoirs organic matter pore size distribution water distribution co2 storage data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction understanding the impact of pore scale water distribution relative to other immiscible fluids present within shale formations tokunaga 2009 is critical to hydrocarbon exploitation of shale reservoirs this is especially important when changes in adsorption selectivity of hydrocarbon mixtures due to the presence of pre adsorbed water di lella et al 2006 is factored into the hydrocarbon exploitation process for shale reservoirs this is because unlike conventional reservoirs shales are characterised by fluid interactions controlled by capillary forces along with inorganic and organic content dehghanpour et al 2013 while organic content influence on water adsorption is found in an induction of wettability complexity within shales liang et al 2016 that of inorganic content is seen in effective permeability alteration due to clay mineral hydration dehghanpour et al 2012 zolfaghari et al 2017a however it is important to note that adsorption forces also play a role in water uptake for water wet organic rich shales which are swelling clay deficient dehghanpour et al 2012 with studies noting the physical and chemical nature of water interactions with organic matter zhou et al 2016 these findings along with the critical role organic and inorganic components play in low hydraulic fracture water recovery hu et al 2015 necessitate an analysis of mechanisms behind water adsorption these mechanisms can be experimentally analysed via sorption desorption isotherms described by a relationship between relative vapour pressure and water content at a given temperature arthur et al 2016 de la llave et al 2010 shen et al 2018 wan et al 2016 these isotherms which are usually linked to a hysteresis loop having a shape influenced by temperature pore size and pore wall hydrophyphilicity de la llave et al 2012 2010 striolo et al 2005 have been used to determine inorganic and organic pore size distribution psd chen et al 2020 zolfaghari dehghanpour xu 2017 zolfaghari dehghanpour 2015 and to experimentally verify water condensation differences in inorganic and organic pores as being responsible for a higher possession of gas storage accessible pores by the latter li et al 2017 however while experimental isotherms obtained from different shale formations have revealed a stronger relationship between inorganic content and water vapor adsorption capacity wang et al 2019 and a relationship between organic content and hysteresis loop variability yang et al 2020a the mechanisms behind variations in inorganic or organic pore influence on water vapor sorption isotherms for different shale reservoirs are yet to be analysed this is even more critical under higher temperature conditions which is difficult to impose in an experiment this is despite experimental suggestions of water vapor diffusion coefficient in shales that is usually enhanced at high temperatures sang et al 2020a thus the superiority of simulated isotherms over those obtained from experiments being found in an imposition of higher temperature conditions has led to the usage of a combination of experimental and simulated water adsorption isotherms to analyse mechanisms behind water adsorption striolo et al 2005 apart from high temperature limitations another demerit of experimental water adsorption is inaccuracy when used to determine capillary pressure since water sorption in shales is controlled by surface chemistry not pore size lahn et al 2020 seemann et al 2017 this is despite suggestions of shale psd obtained from water sorption desorption isotherms being superior to those obtained from experimental techniques like mercury injection capillary pressure analysis micp zolfaghari and dehghanpour 2015 and vapor sorption experiments these methods have been used to note water adsorption in shales as being moderately controlled by micropores 2 nm and dominantly influenced by mesopores 2 50 nm sang et al 2020b with the former having a major influence on monolayer water adsorption bai et al 2020 thus an investigation into water adsorption controls in shale reservoirs necessitates a conjunction of experimental water sorption desorption isotherms with various techniques which can be used to characterise shale nanopore structure these techniques include the usage of a combination of water vapor sorption desorption isotherms with low pressure nitrogen adsorption and small angle neutron scattering sans to observe micro and mesopore controls on water adsorption in shales sang et al 2018a furthermore a recent usage of sans to reveal organic and inorganic controls on water condensation in shales sang et al 2020b suggests an insight into water sorption controls in organic rich shales can be obtained by combining an experimental characterization of organic and inorganic pore structure with water sorption desorption studies have also emphasized the need for investigations into temperature influence on water sorption in shales via thermodynamic analysis and modelling of the two phases of water adsorption tang et al 2017 the efficacy of such an approach can be found in the usage of modelled experimental water vapor isotherm data along with an evaluation of isosteric heat determined via the clausius clapeyron equation duan and li 2018 sang et al 2019a in this study low pressure nitrogen adsorption and small angle neutron scattering analysis along with experimental water vapor isotherms are carried out on the organic matter om and shale samples of the marine longmaxi shale lacustrine qingshankou and chang 7 shale oil formations these methods are performed in conjunction with high temperature simulations of water adsorption in experimentally verified kerogen models of each formation to analyse water adsorption mechanisms for shale reservoirs water adsorption is discussed using the modelled isotherms along with isosteric heat pore structure and composition controls obtained from sans and low pressure nitrogen adsorption experimental observation of shale nanopores furthermore nanocomposites created with kerogen models and quartz are also used to evaluate water distribution controls in the shale formations ultimately we believe observations that is obtained in this study can be significant for co2 storage capacity evaluations in shale reservoirs 2 methodology 2 1 samples and experimental techniques organic matter in longmaxi shales was formed in a deep water continental shelf characterised by an oxygen deficient environment which aided a high biogenic yield derived from blooming algae radiolarians sponges pens and other organisms dong et al 2018 in comparison to this marine derivation of organic matter the lacustrine chang 7 shales comprises of organic matter generated within a lacustrine delta from phytoplankton and terrigenous plants chen et al 2019 similarly organic matter accumulation in the lacustrine qingshankou shales has also been stated as being due to an occurrence of good preservation conditions along with a high primary productivity and terrigenous input xu et al 2019 shale samples analysed in this study were obtained from the longmaxi qingshankou and chang 7 formations offcuts of each sample were crushed into powdered form 200 mesh and used for total organic carbon toc vitrinite reflectance and x ray diffraction measurements via procedures prescribed by sun et al 2016 the mineralogical and organic matter information obtained is shown in table 1 furthermore in order to ascertain organic carbon content influence on water adsorption solid organic matter om which includes kerogen and bitumen was also extracted from offcuts of each shale sample via chemical extraction procedure following zhang et al zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b 2 1 1 low pressure nitrogen adsorption and sans experiments low pressure n2 adsorption analysis was undertaken on weighed powdered organic matter and shale samples 35 80 mesh using the quantachrome autosorb 1 apparatus the procedure undertaken as described in our previous study finnian ukaomah et al 2022 while several studies have made optimal mesh recommendations based on low pressure adsorption data in shale samples with various mesh sizes hazra et al 2018 mastalerz et al 2017 the size of mesh that was used in this study is 200 which is generally recommended for low pressure n2 adsorption analysis of shale reservoirs han et al 2016 other sample preparation procedures include moisture removal via degassing of the powdered samples at 110 c for 5 h in a vacuum considering the influence of temperature on low pressure adsorption data holmes et al 2017 degassing temperature was 110 c which is proposed for shale samples singh et al 2021 degassing was followed by measurement of nitrogen adsorption desorption at 77 3 k within relative pressures calibrated with saturated vapor pressure of the gas the density functional theory dft and the brauner emmet teller bet model were then respectively used to obtain the mesopore macropore volume 1 4 300 nm and surface area from the nitrogen adsorption data lowell et al 2004 thommes et al 2015 the sans experiments were done with the sans apparatus at the china spallation neutron source csns with fixed sample to detector distance at 4 m covering a 0 005 å 1 to 0 6 å 1 q range via neutrons that are received at different incident wavelengths 1 10 å powdered shale samples 35 80 mesh containing organic matter and extracted organic matter were respectively oven dried for 48 h at 60 c before being loaded into the sans apparatus to obtain their pore structure information the scattering length density sld for each shale sample was obtained by volume averaging the sld value of all shale components sun et al 2017 the sans datasets were analysed with the igor pro software via a polydisperse size distribution model pdsm that assumes shale pores are randomly distributed spheres sun et al 2022 the relationship between the q value from the sans data and the shale pore radius r was established via r 2 5 q radliński et al 2000 2 1 2 water vapor adsorption isotherm measurement sample preparation for water vapor sorption analysis wva involved weighed 35 80 mesh of the samples both shale and organic matter getting oven dried at 100 c for 48 h this removal of initial moisture content before conducting the wva was done to prevent irreversible pore structure changes the wva isotherms were then obtained from gravimetric measurements of water vapor uptake and loss as a function of relative humidity rh in a quantachrome aquadyne dvs sorption analyser at three temperatures 25 c 35 c and 45 c with rh set from 2 to 95 importantly the 2 rh was achieved before starting the experiment via usage of a 100 150 cm3 min flow rate furthermore while change in sample mass during adsorption and desorption processes was sequentially recorded with a 0 1 μg 1 accuracy sample adsorption desorption equilibrium conditions at any value of rh comprised 0 001 min sample mass change 2 2 adsorption models 2 2 1 gab model to mathematically describe water adsorption in the samples the guggenheim guggenheim 1963 anderson anderson 1946 and de boer de boer 1953 modified extension of the bet model brunauer et al 1938 is applied over the entire range of rh this gab model differs from the bet theory brunauer et al 1938 by assuming that the heat from adsorption of multilayers is less than the heat due to liquefaction and sorbate molecules beyond the monolayer will continue to interact with the sorbent surface sang et al 2019b the model introduces a parameter k into the adsorbed amount v mg g via sang et al 2019b 1 v v m k c gab r h 1 k r h 1 k r h c gab k r h where v m represents the gab monolayer capacity mg g c gab a constant linked to the heat of adsorption k a constant linked to adsorption energies within multilayer adsorption sites r h the relative humidity of water vapor 2 2

2019b 2 lnv l n k 1 n l n r h where v represents adsorbed mass mg g k and n are constants obtained from the intercept lnk and slope 1 n of linearly relating lnv vs ln r h 2 2 3 hysteresis characterisation a hysteresis loop is an observed difference in adsorption and desorption isotherms tang et al 2017 yang et al 2020c in this study hysteresis in water vapor isotherms obtained from shale and om samples is quantitively described via the area hysteresis index ahi as follows tang et al 2017 3 ahi a de a ad a de 100 where a de and a ad respectively represent the area under the adsorption and desorption isotherms 2 2 4 derivation of pore size distribution from water vapor adsorption several studies have used the kelvin equation to characterize psd from wva adsorption isotherms chen et al 2021 hou et al 2021 yang jia he et al 2020a zolfaghari dehghanpour xu 2017 chen et al 2021 suggested the insensitivity of the psd obtained via wva from natural and organic free shale samples via the kelvin equation to the changes in the contact angle in addition despite the speculation of uniform wettability within the pores without any condensation within the organic pores wva psd obtained via the kelvin equation can be used in conjunction with the psd from low pressure n2 adsorption to acquire the organic psd zolfaghari et al 2017b thus in this study we used the kelvin equation to characterise wva psd from shale and organic matter samples the equation exploits a relationship between rh and pore size when capillary condensation takes place within the pore zolfaghari et al 2017b 4 ln 1 rh 2 γ v m cos θ t r r p where rh represents relative humidity γ surface tension vm liquid molar volume t temperature θ the contact angle r and rp universal gas constant and pore radius since pore size is not dependent on the numerator yang et al 2020a the pore size of condensed water vapor filled capillary pores is obtained via zolfaghari et al 2017b 5 r p rt ln 1 rh 2 2 γ v m cos θ d w d l n 1 rh where w represents pore volume fraction of pore sizes less than or equal to rp which does not represent the true pore diameter since water vapor adsorption on pore surfaces also takes place via multilayer adsorption before capillary condensation the thickness formed from the former is considered into pore diameter calculations via 6 d 2 r p t with halsey s equation used to obtain the adsorption layer thickness t as follows 7 t 0 354 5 ln p p 0 2 2 3 molecular simulation molecular simulation is a theoretical method of analysing organic matter interaction with fluids under higher temperature conditions difficult to impose in an experiment thus in order to ascertain organic matter influence on water adsorption mechanisms in the shale formations water adsorption on their experimentally verified molecular kerogen models is simulated at 525 k on the materials studio ms application furthermore simulation of water distribution in nanocomposites respectively comprising the kerogen models and quartz was also utilized via ms to evaluate water distribution controls 2 3 1 molecular models experimentally verified kerogen models used include the silurian model c194h96o9n4s7 by huang et al 2017 the type ii chang 7 oil shale kerogen model c300h297o18n13s10 recently proposed by wu xu 2022 and the oil prone qingshankou kerogen model c156h159n3o10 proposed by cao et al 2021 to create 3 d structures of these models ten molecules of each model were respectively initially geometrically optimized using the condensed phase optimized molecular potentials for atomistic simulation studies compass forcefield before being placed in an amorphous cell with an 0 1 g cm3 initial density and 300 k temperature the forcefield uses a 6 9 lennard jones potential parameterization with mixing rules described in previous studies sun 1998 the amorphous cell setup exceeds the 1700 atoms cell requirement prescribed by previous studies ungerer et al 2015 in order to obtain configurations with the global lowest energy the cells were respectively further optimized and relaxed with the compass forcefield via annealing and molecular dynamics procedures prescribed by huang et al 2018 however it is critical to note that typical reservoir condition of each formation obtained from stated temperature and pressure gradients were used for final npt molecular dynamics simulations of the kerogen molecules fig 1 with final relaxation of the longmaxi molecules at 360 k and 23 6 mpa huang et al 2017 the chang 7 model at 346 84 k and 16 9 mpa li et al 2013 zhao et al 2021 and qingshankou kerogen molecules at 373 k and 42 5 mpa feng et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b for all simulations the nose hoover thermostat was used to control the system temperature hoover 1985 with pressure imposed via the berendsen barostat berendsen et al 1998 2 3 2 water adsorption simulation water adsorption on the kerogen models was performed via grand canonical monte carlo gcmc simulations conducted on the ms sorption module the simulations are characterised by chemical potential volume and temperature system parameters being fixed the chemical potential is converted to vapor pressure p zhang et al 2021 which is calibrated with water saturated vapor pressure psat determined from the national institute of standards and technology national institute of standards and technology 2018 the system relative humidity was therefore obtained as p psat water adsorption simulation was then carried out from 5 rh to 95 rh at 525 k with 1 107 monte carlo steps 5 106 steps for equilibration and 5 106 for ensemble average furthermore while the ewald summation method was used to describe electrostatic interactions with an accuracy of 0 001 kcal mol 1 van der waals atom method based interactions between different molecules were determined within a 15 5 å cut off distance the adsorbed water content s w was obtained from the number of water molecules n w adsorbed on the kerogen models via zhang et al 2021 8 s w n w m w n a a where water molar mass g mol is represented by m w n a represents the avogadro constant mol 1 and a the surface area of simulated kerogen m2 the compass forcefield which has been used to simulate the interaction of fluids with kerogen and quartz sui yao 2016 wu et al 2013 was used to parameterize water adsorption in gcmc simulations 2 3 3 water distribution in nanocomposites to determine water distribution controls in the shale reservoirs organic inorganic nanocomposite models were prepared by coupling ten molecules of each kerogen model with quartz similar to previous simulations of kerogen mineral interactions faisal et al 2021 the α quartz unit cell cell dimensions are a b 4 9134 å c 5 4052 å and α β 90 γ 120 on ms was used to create a 4 8 1 supercell used to construct the nanocomposite model wet nanocomposites were then built by using the packing task on ms to insert 32 water molecules with the density set to 0 4 g cm3 fig 2 nvt molecular dynamics simulation were then performed at 300 k and 400 ps to bring the wet model to equilibrium which was attained when temperature vs simulation time exhibit fluctuations in proximity to the simulation temperature after rising and approaching an equilibrium point to analyse heat treatment controls on water distribution the nanocomposites were further subjected to nvt 200 ps md simulations at 400 k after md simulations the quartz surface becomes unfixed and frames from the nvt trajectory are used to obtain the concentration profile from the nanocomposite the md simulation of water distribution was done via compass forcefield parameterization at a 0 1 fs time step 2 3 4 kerogen model validation a comparison of data from the simulated kerogen models with experimental results are done to ensure their validity for this study in the first phase a comparison of kerogen density reveals the 1 307 g cm3 and 1 18 g cm3 density respectively obtained from the longmaxi and qingshankou kerogen as falling within experimentally measured density ranges 1 18 g cm3 to 1 35 g cm3 for mature type ii kerogen okiongbo et al 2005 with the density obtained from the chang 7 kerogen model in this study that is 1 12 g cm3 being very close to this range further validation was also carried out with a helium probe to estimate kerogen porosity according to procedures prescribed by guo et al 2020 this involved using the conolly surface to obtain the free pore volume which was then used to determine the kerogen matrix porosity fig 3 the porosities respectively obtained for the longmaxi 21 78 chang 7 17 22 and qingshankou models 14 67 all fall within the range experimentally obtained from the barnet shale 4 45 22 50 loucks et al 2009 in addition the h c o c n c and s c atomic ratios in each model is equivalent to those from experimentally characterized kerogen in each formation this includes ratios from longmaxi kerogen model 0 495 0 046 0 02 1 86 0 036 being equivalent to those obtained from a highly mature type ii kerogen huang et al 2017 and chang 7 model atomic ratios 0 99 0 06 0 043 0 033 close to those of type ii oil prone chang 7 kerogen wu xu 2022 atomic ratios from the sulphur deficient qingshankou model h c o c and n c 1 101 0 064 0 019 resemble those experimentally proposed for oil prone kerogen from the qingshankou formation cao et al 2021 overall the atomic ratios in the kerogen models indicate a thermal maturity which varies from longmaxi chang 7 qingshankou 3 results 3 1 pore structure low pressure nitrogen adsorption wva and sans a correlation of hysteresis loops obtained from shale n2 adsorption and desorption isotherms fig 4 a with iupac recommendations sing et al 1985 reveals the presence of inkbottle and slit shaped pores with the latter also observed to be dominant in the organic matter samples fig 4b table 2 reveals shale mesopore macropore volume varies from 0 015 ml g to 0 019 ml g with organic matter specimens characterised by volume that varies from 0 02 ml g to 0 032 ml g in addition while bet surface area in the shales vary from 3 48 m2 g to 12 86 m2 g organic matter exhibited a surface area that varies from 11 32 m2 g to 24 54 m2 g porosity obtained from n2 adsorption on the shale samples was found from 2 9 to 4 6 table 2 sans profiles obtained from shale samples reveal scattering curves which obey a power law within a q range of 0 001 to 0 1 fig 5 power law deviations observed in the scattering profiles are probably due to long neutron wavelength 12 å radlinski et al 1999 micropore scattering sang et al 2018a and scattering from hydrogen atoms in organic matter or residual moisture within the pores mastalerz et al 2012 radlinski et al 1999 a comparison of scattering profiles also reveals that a higher flat scattering background at high q values observed in shale sample z22 48 is probably due to high micro scale heterogeneity or water bound within the clay minerals and organic matter the former is exemplified by the shale sample having the highest percentage of montmorillonite within mixed clays table 1 a comparison of porosities obtained from both sans and n2 adsorption table 2 reveals a similar variation in porosity obtained from pdsm porosity and n2 for the shale samples with higher values from the former being related to the sans experimental technique that basically measures both accessible and inaccessible pores within the samples this measurement difference also explains as why surface area measured with sans varies widely compared to what was found via n2 pore volume distribution obtained from wva sans and n2 adsorption are showing a similar trend over a 1 nm to 100 nm pore size range fig 6 for all shale samples except jy11 4 which is characterised by n2 pore volume distribution that steadily decreases within this pore size range another exception is also observed in sans and wva revealing sample z22 48 as being characterised by an initial increase in pore volume at a lower pore size range compared to the remaining samples considering the organic matter samples fig 7 apart from showing a comparable pattern pore volume distribution obtained from wva are higher than those obtained from n2 adsorption for all samples except sample 3hc 4 this variation in pore volume is negatively linked to the 3hc 4 z22 48 jy11 4 variation in mesopore macropore volume observed within the organic matter samples table 2 that is larger differences in pore volume are observed in organic matter samples having low mesopore macropore volumes 3 2 water vapor isotherm hysteresis characterisation water vapor adsorption desorption isotherms obtained from all shale and organic matter samples over the entire rh range 5 to 95 at three temperatures 25 c 35 c and 45 c reveal type ii adsorption isotherms with type h3 hysteresis loops fig 8 and fig 9 based on iupac classifications sing et al 1985 these isotherms are divided into a low rh region dominated by monolayer adsorption rh 0 2 intermediate region after termination of monolayer adsorption rh 0 8 and a high rh region dominated by capillary condensation rh varies from 0 8 to 0 95 hou et al 2021 all samples were also observed to be characterised by pronounced hysteresis behaviour at high rh conditions due to multilayer adsorption with water adsorption desorption isotherms obtained from some samples not converging towards minimum values and remaining open under low rh conditions this lack of convergence is profound in isotherms respectively obtained from shale samples jy11 4 and z22 48 at 25 c and 35 c fig 8a and 8b and isotherms obtained from organic matter sample jy11 4 at all experimental temperatures fig 9 a comparison of ahi values from shales at all experimental temperatures table 3 reveals jy11 4 has the highest ahi value due to being characterised by maximum hysteresis which occur at a higher rh in the organic matter samples table 4 this phenomenon is only observed at 45 c with sample z22 48 having the highest ahi values at 25 c and 35 c in addition a plot of ahi vs temperature for both shale and organic matter samples fig 10 a and 10b reveals sample jy11 4 having a weaker negative relationship of these two parameters compared to other samples 3 3 modelled adsorption isotherms from experiment wva isotherms are fitted with the gab and freundlich models to evaluate organic and inorganic controls on water sorption in the shale formations while parameters obtained from gab and freundlich fitted wva isotherms of the shale figs 11 and 12 are presented in table 3 those from organic matter samples figs 13 and 14 are illuminated in table 4 freundlich n parameters being 1 for all samples indicates an overall low affinity for water and a similar observation obtained for the correction factor k which confirms that multilayer adsorption is weaker compared to adsorption within the monolayer sang et al 2019b 3 3 1 shales for the shale samples gab fitting results at all temperatures reveal a monolayer moisture content v m varying in the order of 3hc 4 z22 48 jy11 4 table 3 in addition sample jy11 4 is observed as having the highest binding strength parameter c gab at all experimental temperatures freundlich fitting of the shale isotherms at all temperatures reveals the existence of two adsorption regimes with k values obtained from the entire rh range between those of low 70 rh and high 70 rh adsorption strength k values obtained at 70 rh are observed to follow 3hc 4 z22 48 jy11 4 with a similar trend only observed under 70 rh conditions at 45 c as the k values obtained at other temperatures show 3hc 4 jy11 4 z22 48 table 3 3 3 2 organic matter for the extracted organic matter samples table 4 gab fitting reveals a v m exhibiting jy11 4 z22 48 3hc 4 at 35 c and 45 c with the parameters showing jy11 4 3hc 4 z22 48 at 25 c in addition apart from values at 45 c which reveals jy11 4 as having a value higher than other samples c gab values obtained from the organic samples are observed as z22 48 jy11 4 3hc 4 similar to the shale samples freundlich fitting of the organic matter isotherms table 4 also was found that k values obtained from the entire rh range within those obtained from 70 rh and 70 rh with k values obtained at both rh ranges observed to follow jy11 4 z22 48 3hc 4 at all experimental temperatures 3 4 isosteric heat of adsorption several studies have used isosteric heat of adsorption to gain an insight into how adsorbed water interacts with the shale surface duan and li 2018 sang et al 2019b thus in this study we used the slope of ln p vs 1 t plots to obtain the isosteric heat of adsorption for shale and kerogen samples via the clausius clapeyron equation sang et al 2019b 4 ln p 1 t v 1 r δ h ads where p represents water vapor pressure kpa t temperature k r the universal gas constant jmol 1k 1 and δ h ads the heat of adsorption within a specified water content v mg g isosteric heat of adsorption δ h ads values obtained from the shale samples over a 0 05 mg g to 11 03 mg g water content range are exothermic and range from 5 kj mol to 45 kj mol for the entire samples except those from z22 48 approaching the pure water latent heat of vaporization δ h vap 42 kj mol 1 as water content increases fig 15 a while other samples are only characterised by decreasing δ h ads values at lower water content before approaching δ h vap as water content increases a reverse phenomenon is observed generally in lower δ h ads values in sample z22 48 in this sample this value increases with water content while remaining below δ h vap alike shale samples δ h ads values obtained from the organic matter samples over a 0 19 mg g to 21 mg g water content range are exothermic ranging from 16 kj mol to 57 kj mol fig 15b while sample z22 48 is characterised by δ h ads which increases at lower water content before decreasing to approach δ h vap after reaching maximum δ h ads 57 kj mol however an opposite trend is observed in sample jy11 4 which is characterised by a decreasing δ h ads at lower water content which then steadily increases while remaining less than δ h vap after minimum δ h ads 28 kj mol is attained another important phenomenon which contributes to the range of δ h ads values obtained from the organic matter samples is found in sample 3hc 4 being initially characterised by a reduction in δ h ads at lower water content which starts to increase and approach δ h vap when minimum δ h ads 16 kj mol is reached 4 discussion 4 1 pore structure controls on water adsorption studies have used a conjunction of sans and low pressure nitrogen adsorption experiments to observe shale pore structure controls on water vapor adsorption at higher rh sang et al 2018b with others using pore volume distributions obtained from wva and low pressure nitrogen adsorption to make a similar observation gao et al 2022 hou et al 2021 thus to obtain organic matter and inorganic pore structure controls on water adsorption we compare shale and organic matter pore structure parameters obtained from sans wva at 25 c and n2 adsorption shale wva isotherms obtained at 25 c fig 8a show 3hc 4 jy11 4 z22 48 variation of adsorbed volume at rh 80 that is similar to mesopore volume and or porosity variations obtained from low pressure n2 adsorption table 2 sans is also used to establish a negative relationship between the fraction of closed pores within the shale samples and water adsorption at rh 80 table 2 studies have shown that both inaccessible and accessible pore measurement can become possible when sans and low pressure adsorption are combined chandra et al 2020 with others methods following the same measurements technique to observe shales with larger mesopore volumes and nitrogen accessible pores possessing more sites for water condensation at high rh sang et al 2018b importantly since low pressure nitrogen adsorption is unable to characterize pores sizes 1 7 nm sang et al 2019b a possession of the highest fraction of pores inaccessible to low pressure n2 adsorption and an observation of a micropore volume peak 2nm pore size in sample z22 48 obtained from sans fig 6 both indicate that an inhibition of water condensation at high rh within the sample was due to the presence of a small number of external mesopores and the presence of bound water in large micropores less than but close to 2 nm the latter was also confirmed by this shale sample being characterised by a higher flat scattering background at high q fig 5 in addition the higher surface area and closed pore fraction observed in sample z22 48 is also possibly due to high montmorillonite content which resulted in the formation of inaccessible pores within interlayer spaces that cannot be accessed by the n2 molecules sang et al 2018a organic matter wva isotherms at 25 c fig 9a reveal a positive relationship between water vapor adsorption and organic matter mesopore volume organic matter mesopore controls on water adsorption are also delineated in a negative relationship between adsorbed water volume at all experimental rh and mesopore volume table 2 and a reduction in the difference between wva and n2 pore volume distributions as organic matter mesopore volume increases fig 7 organic matter porosity controls are also confirmed by the positive relationship between simulated adsorbed volume and porosity obtained from the kerogen models and experimental organic matter isotherms revealing a negative relationship between organic matter mesopore volume and water adsorption the latter is found in organic matter mesopore volume varying in opposite trend compared to a jy11 4 z22 48 3hc 4 organic matter variation in adsorbed volume gab v m and freundlich k while shale organic matter micropores control water adsorption at lower rh ranges via monolayer coverage mesopore control is achieved at higher rh values via multilayer adsorption zhang et al 2022 4 2 inorganic and organic content controls on water adsorption several studies have used wva isotherms to observe organic and inorganic controls on water adsorption in shale reservoirs sang et al 2019b yang et al 2021a in this study wva isotherms obtained from shales and organic matter along with simulated wet kerogen quartz nanocomposites reveal an interplay between organic matter and mineral content in regards to water adsorption controls 4 2 1 clay controls from wva and isosteric heat inorganic controls are first evidenced by an observation of mixed layer clay content characterised by a positive link to the gab monolayer moisture content v m and the fruendlich adsorption capacity constant k obtained from the shale samples at high adsorption strength regimes table 3 in addition the qingshankou shale sample which is characterised by the highest mixed layer clay content also has the highest adsorbed water volume at all observed maximum rh fig 8 table 1 clay content controls on water adsorption are also obtained from the determination of isosteric heat of adsorption from the shale samples they reveal all shale samples apart from the chang 7 formation as characterised by an isosteric heat that declines at low adsorbed water content to a minimum value before gradually approaching the heat of vaporization isosteric heat of adsorption can be used to determine the bound water and free water boundary quirijns et al 2005 with studies using isosteric heat of sorption from wheat grains to suggest that an increase in isosteric heat at low moisture content is due to monolayer adsorption induced by highly active polar sites within the sample li et al 2011 thus the observed increase in isosteric heat at low water content observed in the chang 7 shale sample is possibly due to a higher montmorillonite content in the clay interlayers which swells and provides additional primary water adsorption sites fig 15a this expansion is verified by isotherms from the shale sample with an increase in adsorbed desorbed volume with increasing experimental temperature fig 8 furthermore the occurrence of isosteric heat values obtained from the chang 7 shale sample beneath the latent heat of vaporization fig 15a also infers that the observed isotherm changes with temperature are due to monolayer moisture not being tightly bound to the shale surface isosteric heat values obtained from organic matter extracted from the chang 7 shale are demonstrating an initial increase at lower water content which then approaches the latent heat of vaporization after attaining a maximum value fig 15b however this indication of expansion in primary adsorption sites within organic matter requires further investigations in future studies 4 2 2 organic matter oxygen functional group ofg water interaction studies have reported that organic rich shales can adsorb high water amounts due to the presence of ofgs in organic matter pores yang et al 2021a which causes a lack of convergence in experimental water vapor isotherms this phenomenon is attributed to the adsorbed water trapped within the micropore space via hydrogen bonding yang et al 2020b with others observing a positive relationship between the thermal maturity of organic matter and adsorbed moisture li et al 2020 furthermore bai et al 2020 recently observed how changes in the ofgs of organic matter at primary adsorption sites can have a positive influence on monolayer water adsorption in shales with very little effect on multi layered adsorption in this study an indication of organic matter maturity control on water adsorption is signified by highly mature longmaxi shale sample having higher c gab and ahi values than less mature samples from other shale reservoirs despite having the lowest clay content the former observation differs from previous relationship of high c gab values to water adsorption on primary adsorption sites due to low thermal maturity of organic matter in shales yang et al 2021a in addition while the negative relationship observed between ahi and temperature for both shale and organic matter samples fig 10a and 10b are in agreement with similar observations to temperature controls on ahi variation in shales tang et al 2017 the longmaxi samples revealed to have less affected by temperature this is probably due to the higher ofg content of the organic matter in the shale which restricted the desorption of adsorbed water the higher adsorbed water volume in the longmaxi organic matter samples is also linked to the presence of more ofg studies have posited on how ofg rich asphaltene in organic matter being pre adsorbed on the quartz surface could reduce the water affinity of the mineral in shales li et al 2020 thus wva isotherms obtained from the extracted organic matter and kerogen models fig 9 and fig 16 reveal that despite being characterised by a high quartz content water adsorption on the mature longmaxi shale sample was inhibited by a pre adsorption of ofg rich organic compounds on the quartz surface the control of organic matter ofg on water interaction with quartz is also revealed in nanocomposite water distribution variations with temperature snapshots of water distribution in the nanocomposites under increasing temperature reveal water clustering on the quartz surface and adsorbed around kerogen polar groups fig 17 however due to the larger amounts of ofgs in the longmaxi kerogen water adsorbed on the kerogen ofgs become clustered on the quartz surface due to kerogen clustering induced by a temperature increase to 400 k fig 17a in addition compared to profiles obtained from other nanocomposites fig 18 b and 18c two prominent 400 k peaks on concentration profiles obtained from the longmaxi nanocomposites also reveal a higher clustering of kerogen molecules on the quartz surface as temperature increases fig 18a thus we speculate that an inhibition of organic matter quartz interaction is facilitated by lower quartz content and organic matter ofg which in turn caused higher water adsorption observed in the quartz deficient chang 7 and qingshankou shale samples overall this explains the quartz content control on water adsorption evidenced by gab monolayer moisture content v m varying from quartz deficient shales to quartz rich samples as follows 3hc 4 z22 48 jy11 4 thus while several studies have confirmed that thermal maturity of the organic matter controls water affinity hu et al 2016 and adsorption in shale formations yang et al 2021a and apart from the fact that carbon aromaticity of the organic material also impacts water wettability in shales jagadisan and heidari 2020 our observations suggest that its necessary to also consider pre adsorption of oxygen functional groups of the organic matter on mineral surfaces 4 3 water distribution and co2 storage implications shale reservoirs contain water which occur as free water within the pore space or adsorbed pore surface water yang et al 2021b studies have observed how the co2 storage capacity of shales is controlled by an occurrence of free water in reservoir pores hagemann et al 2016 and adsorbed water on hydrophilic clay nanopores jin and firoozabadi 2014 with others using wva isotherms to obtain adsorbed and free water distribution controls in shale reservoirs yang et al 2021b in this study psd obtained from wva sans and low pressure nitrogen adsorption illustrated mesopore control on water adsorption in shales at high rh with wva isotherms revealing water distribution as being controlled by the interaction of water with ofgs in organic matter pores and mixed layer clays while primary site adsorption is controlled via monolayer coverage induced by the latter the distribution of water in shale organic matter micropores is attributed to condensation at secondary adsorption sites after primary site adsorption has taken place yang et al 2021b in addition water distribution in extracted organic matter analysed in this study was facilitated by decreasing mesopore volume and increase in ofg within organic matter with quartz controls on water adsorption linked to an interaction with ofgs in organic matter the migration of injected co2 in shales is inhibited by the occupation or blocking of co2 adsorption sites by water adsorbed on hydrophilic clays and organic matter ofgs huang et al 2021 thus while co2 migration in other samples will be mainly suppressed by water occupation of potential co2 adsorption sites in organic matter pores the presence of pre adsorbed water induced by the hydrophilic mixed layer montmorillonite will severely stop the migration of injected co2 into the chang 7 shale oil reservoir this pre adsorbed water which is not tightly bound to the shale surface will block potential co2 adsorption sites in the shale reservoir during the co2 injection process 5 conclusion an experimental and molecular dynamics simulation into water adsorption in marine and lacustrine shales was undertaken to obtain water adsorption controls in shale reservoirs wva analysis and low pressure nitrogen adsorption were performed on shale and organic matter samples along with sans measurements from shales along with high temperature wva simulations and water distribution in kerogen nanocomposites with experimentally verified kerogen models based on the results the following key observations on water adsorption controls was seen 1 while water adsorption in shales at high rh is aided by a decrease in mesopore volume organic matter is characterised by a similar control at all rh and an increase in oxygen functional groups 2 water adsorption at all rh in shales is strongly controlled by the interaction of water with oxygen functional groups in organic matter pores and mixed layered clays with a negative relationship between water adsorption and quartz content being due to the interaction of oxygen functional groups within organic matter and quartz 3 the presence of high amounts of montmorillonite within clay interlayers of shales can induce water distribution not tightly bound to the shale surface 4 these findings are significant for hydrocarbon exploitation of shale reservoirs and also suggest that co2 migration in shale reservoirs will be inhibited by an occurrence of water in potential co2 adsorption sites within organic matter pores and montmorillonite induced water distribution that is not tightly bound to the shale surface credit authorship contribution statement chima
