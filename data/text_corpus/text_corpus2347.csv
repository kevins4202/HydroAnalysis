11735,groundwater is an important resource used for multiple purposes and should be protected especially in arid regions the aim of this study is to assess the main processes on groundwater salinization from menzel habib shallow and deep aquifers southeastern tunisia which could be applied to further groundwater quality assessment indeed combined hydrogeochemical and isotopic fingerprints data approaches were used using multivariate statistical methods highlighting hierarchical clustering analysis and principal component analysis a total of 36 groundwater samples were collected from the menzel habib aquifer system 25 from shallow aquifer and 11 from deep aquifer the obtained results from both stretches indicated three dominant hydrochemical facies chloride sodic sulphated sodic and mixed water type the determination of groundwater salinization origin and the understanding of its hydrological and geochemical behaviors were assessed by a combined statistical and hydrogeochemical approach the study of correlations between major elements and total dissolved solids is thus an important tool where dissolution of evaporites that can originate from the triassic materials of hadifa mountain the precipitation and or dissolution of carbonates cationic exchange and inverse cationic exchange are the main processes associated to groundwater salinity increase moreover the hca has allowed to classify the groundwater samples into two clusters the first one with low to moderate salinity and the second one with high salinity in addition the application of stable isotopes allowed a better understanding of the hydrodynamic functioning of this aquifer system the isotopic data suggests a relatively high δ2h and δ18o values for groundwater samples located close to global meteoric water line that reflects recent recharge for the aquifer system by direct rainwater infiltration respectively from bordered reliefs in the study area it also showed a depletion in isotopic composition for almost groundwater samples that indicates the importance of evaporation on the hydrochemistry of the area graphical abstract image 1 keywords salinization hierarchical cluster analysis principal component analysis stable isotopes menzel habib tunisia data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the salinization risk of aquifer systems has been the subject of several research works and some suggest that groundwater salinization in coastal aquifer systems is often attributable to marine intrusion related to aquifer overexploitation el yaouti et al 2009 agoubi et al 2012 kharroubi et al 2012 ramatlapeng et al 2021 tran et al 2021 zarif et al 2021 elmeknassi et al 2022 wang et al 2022a 2022b likewise salinization in inland aquifers has been studied by various authors e g el mejri et al 2014 farid et al 2015 tarki et al 2016 mejri et al 2018 mnassri et al 2018 dhaoui et al 2022a dhaoui et al 2022b in this context dissolution or alteration processes on evaporites and carbonates as well as base exchange mechanisms abid et al 2009 lucas et al 2010 monjerezi et al 2012 ben ammar et al 2020 panneerselvam et al 2020 carol et al 2021 sarker et al 2021 zakaria et al 2021 samtio et al 2022 slama et al 2022 and infiltration of concentrated evaporated irrigation water also represent a crucial contribution to salinization processes the chemical characteristics of groundwater can be modified by natural phenomena such as the lithological composition of the aquifer residence time evaporation and or mixing with water from other aquifers in hydraulic connection krimissa et al 2004 bouchaou et al 2008 ettayfi et al 2012 carreira et al 2013 walter et al 2017 grünenbaum et al 2020 chen et al 2021 sunkari et al 2021 anthropic processes such as overexploitation boughriba et al 2006 carreira et al 2014 vallejos et al 2018 ghimire et al 2021 han et al 2021 hossain et al 2021 constitute another source of groundwater salinization indeed menzel habib area located in southeastern tunisia is bordered by cretaceous reliefs and depressions called sabkha sabkha el hamma and sabkha sidi mansour and whose tectonic disharmony has played a very important role on the arrangement of the aquifer formations and their intercommunications dhaoui et al 2021 indeed the present study aims to highlight the main hydrogeochemical facies assess the processes controlling the chemical contents of groundwater as well as the mechanisms of salinization and investigate the origin of groundwater in menzel habib area consequently this study could be applied on the prevention of groundwater quality deterioration and to a better understanding of a groundwater salinization process in a multi layered aquifer systems as a relevant tool for groundwater management 2 background 2 1 study area menzel habib area is considered as a part of the eastern southern lowlands of tunisia it is located in the northwest of gabès southeastern tunisia between latitudes 34 and 34 20 n and longitudes 9 15 and 9 58 e covering an area about 113 000 ha fig 1 a the area is characterized by a low arid climate with dry hot summers and relatively warm winters the interannual precipitation average is about 190 mm with an annual mean of temperature of 20 c ira 2011 nasa 2018 it is bordered by the orbata range e g belkhir mountain and sabkha sidi mansour to the north and by the northern range of chotts e g zemelt beida haidoudi mountain romana mountain and sabkha el hamma to the south fig 1b the mountainous range that borders sabkha el hamma fatnassa m 275 m haidoudi m 286 m hadifa m 578 m occupies the southern limits of menzel habib area while the northern region is constituted by a range of higher mountains belkhir 587 m finally the sabkha sidi mansour materialize respectively the northern limits this arrangement gives the study area the appearance of a strip that widens on the northeast side thus giving the shape of a funnel composed of a set of glacis plateaus plains and closed depressions floret and pontanier 1982 2 2 geological and hydrogeological features the plain of menzel habib area is presented as a syncline basin with mio plio quaternary with sandy clay filling the lithologic series extend from the triassic to the quaternary formation ages fig 1b the triassic formation is identified as a diapiric extrusion in hadifa mountain which is formed essentially by halite anhydrite gypsum and red clay ouled ghrib and slimane 1994 according to the geologic map fig 1b this diapiric extrusion is related to the tectonic context of the study area with a series of faults that promote a direct contact with cretaceous series represented by carbonate formations indeed the extrusion of this diapiric occurs on the fault wnw ese corridor along the northern flank to the west and east it is bordered by upper cretaceous limestones and marls which are straightened overturned and even partly covered by the diffuse material of this diapiric abdeljaouad 1983 jurassic formations do not outcrop in the study area ben cheikh 2013 three stretches constitute the aquifer system of menzel habib area fig 1c from two deeps layers which are the cenomanian turonian sediments which are constituted by limestone and marl limestone layers and the senonian that is formed by limestone levels with marl intercalation to the plio quaternary shallow aquifer which is constituted by sandy loam formation the first level is characterized by an extremely high salinity 19 g l and it will be excluded from the current study because it is prohibited to drill in this layer ben cheikh 2013 the shallow aquifer has a depth that range from 10 m to 65 m a groundwater level varying between 5 m and 39 m and a piezometric level varying from 100 6 m a s l in the west to 7 m a s l in the east with a general direction flow to the east with some variation due to groundwater abstraction dhaoui et al 2021 the measures in situ for the deep aquifer indicate a depth from 65 m to 120 m a groundwater static level ranging between 47 m and 55 m and a piezometric level varying from 21 to 45 5 m a s l 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and chemical analysis a total of thirty six groundwater samples were collected from pumping wells located on the menzel habib area after several minutes of pumping 15 20 min before sampling to remove groundwater stored in the wells equipped with poly vinyl chloride pvc pipes between april may 2018 twenty five groundwater samples were collected from wells capturing the shallow aquifer p1 p25 fig 1b and eleven from wells capturing the deep aquifer g1 g11 fig 1b all the groundwater samples were transported in polypropylene bottles within cooler boxes to avoid possible contamination and water chemical processes over time the non conservative physico chemical variables electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds and ph were measured in the field using a multi parameter analyzer c933 in the laboratory the samples were filtered through 0 45 μm pore size cellulose acetate membrane filters and were refrigerated in order to limit physico chemical water processes the chemical analysis of elements hco3 f cl so4 2 br na k ca2 and mg2 from groundwater samples were carried out at the laboratory of the higher institute of water sciences and techniques of gabès tunisia the chemical analysis of elements f cl so4 2 br na k ca2 and mg2 was carried out by ionic liquid chromatography while the hco3 contents were measured by titration method the precision of groundwater analysis was determined by ionic balance and remains acceptable e 5 for all the groundwater samples furthermore the piper diagram is used to distinguish chemical facies binary diagrams ionic ratios in order to complete the study and to cross reference the information provided by these different methods the sub application phreeq of diagrammes software from the hydrogeology laboratory of avignon was used to calculate saturation indices from the ionic activities the stable isotopes of the water 2h 18o were measured for all the collected samples using mass spectrometry machine model lwia the results are expressed as a relative deviation δ and will be applied on the determination of groundwater origin processes 3 2 multivariate statistical methodologies the analysis of the geochemical data to determine groundwater processes and main mineralization sources is also based on statistical techniques hamzaoui azaza et al 2011 voutsis et al 2015 mountadar et al 2018 khaskhoussy et hachicha 2020 sarti et al 2021 selvakumar et al 2021 balasubramanian et al 2022 mohamed et al 2022 the statistical analysis of groundwater geochemical data was performed with the spss software in this regard hierarchical cluster analysis hca and principal component analysis pca were involved the hca methodology allows to produce as many classes as there are entities samples in a database de andrade et al 2008 elumalai et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 the objective of this method is to define an aggregation criterion for the classes which could be defined by measuring the degree of similarity or dissimilarity between the samples el yaouti et al 2009 khalil et al 2021 mohammed et al 2022 hca can also group samples issued from different aquifer layers trabelsi et al 2012 hadj ammar et al 2014 liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2022a 2022b there are several measures for estimating the degree of similarity between samples the most commonly used being the euclidean distance as it is a geometric distance in a multi dimensional space bhakar and singh 2019 egbueri 2020 rao and chaudhary 2019 the euclidean distances indicates the shortest geometric distance between two points in a space cloutier et al 2008 in the current case the thirty six groundwater samples will be clustered based on groundwater salinity values expressed by tds values indeed this method produces a sequence of nested partitions of all the individuals to be ranked the partitions are represented by a classification tree or dendrogram the number of classes obtained depends on the level of the cut of the tree chosen called phenon line the aggregation criteria after the calculation of the distances are used for the determination of the sample classes yidana et al 2008 alfaifi et al 2021 this similarity is done according to the ward criterion ward 1963 which will produce better results than other methods bhakar and singh 2019 egbueri 2020 zhang et al 2022a 2022b the principal component analysis pca is one of the most widely used methods of multivariate data analysis it is well known as a method of dimension reduction which allows to explore multidimensional data sets made of quantitative variables and to transform highly correlated variables into new variables decorrelated from each other st hillaire et al 2004 blake et al 2016 abdelaziz et al 2020 the first step consists in calculating the pearson correlation coefficients between the variables then the projection axes are assimilated to the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix yidana et al 2008 mountadar et al 2018 bawoke et al 2019 the first axis will allow the identification of the individuals i e for which the variance of the individuals is maximal then a second principal component is the one that provides the greatest possible information complementary to the first hamzaoui azaza et al 2011 trabelsi and zouari 2019 the process continues until the last principal component is obtained the choice of the number of components is expressed in terms of the eigenvalues or percentages of eigenvalues or the percentages of variation explained by each principal component this method will be applied for thirty six groundwater samples observations with twelve variables both multivariate statistical methods applied in this research required standardization of the data in order to include internal variables measured with non comparable scales in the same classification mountadar et al 2018 thus regardless of the unit of each variable measured each one will have an equivalent weight in the classification the standardized value is noted zij medina gomez and herrara silveira 2003 z i j x i j x m σ i where xij is the real value of the variable xm is the mean value of the real variable and σi is its standard deviation 4 results and discussions 4 1 hydrogeochemistry results the descriptive statistics summary of the chemical analysis and field measurements of thirty six groundwater samples are presented in table 1 the relative proportions of the major cations in groundwater samples occurred in the order of na mg2 ca2 k for the samples issued from shallow and deep aquifers anions were dominated by so4 ions in groundwater samples from shallow aquifer and were present in the order of so4 2 cl hco3 br f however in the deep aquifer cl are considered as dominant anion in the order of cl so4 2 hco3 br f all samples show a high ec more than 3 ms cm and a high tds values for the ph all the samples from both aquifer levels are categorized as slightly alkaline table 1 the coefficients of variation for both layers are lower than other studies jain et al 2010 del campo et al 2014 which indicates a similarity between samples from shallow and deep aquifers that is why the samples are assessed together in statistical study 4 2 hca the representation of the thirty six observations which are the roots in the hierarchical clustering analysis tree allows the identification of a typology of waters from their physico chemical data fig 2 a consequently two clusters are identified fig 2b which represent the branches of the dendrogram the number of clusters increase or decrease according to the position of the phenom line depending on the distance of splitting considered as the euclidian distance in this study the two clusters are obtained for a distance of 10 therefore the statistical summary maximum minimum median mean standard deviation of the physico chemical groundwater parameters and the major ions for the obtained clusters are represented in table 2 and table 3 the groundwater was slightly acidic to alkaline with ph values between 6 95 and 8 6 for cluster 1 while it was alkaline for cluster 2 with ph values ranging from 7 40 to 7 85 the groundwater tds varies from 1598 to 4708 mg l and from 6031 to 8706 mg l and ec is ranged from 3 06 to 8 88 ms cm and from 10 86 to 14 98 ms cm for cluster 1 and cluster 2 respectively the dominant cation is na followed by ca2 mg2 and k for both clusters while the dominant anion is so4 2 followed by cl hco3 br and f for cluster 1 however the dominant anion is cl followed by so4 2 hco3 br and f for cluster 2 indeed a groundwater communication between deep and shallow aquifers will occur in the aquifer system trabelsi et al 2012 hadj ammar et al 2014 the groundwater samples spatial distribution by the two clusters were plotted in piper diagram to geochemical groundwater dominant facies characterization fig 3 both two cluster groups have different physicochemical characteristics and signatures tables 2 and 3 which could be described as following on one hand cluster 1 includes the highest number of groundwater samples 26 which are generally characterized by high concentrations of k and mg2 exceeding food and agriculture organization standards which are 0 2 mg l and 0 5 meq l respectively fao 1994 while hco3 contents area less than fao standards ca2 cl na and so4 2 groundwater contents are above and below these parametric values 0 30 meq l 0 40 meq l and 0 20 meq l respectively the tds range from 1598 to 4708 mg l thus this cluster is characterized by na cl na so4 and mixed water types on the other hand cluster 2 includes ten groundwater samples which are characterized by high to extremely high mineralization tds 6000 mg l in this group na is the dominant cation an increase by around the double of the chemical element s contents compared to the first cluster is noted the dominant facies of this group is na cl water type this cluster is characterized by the highest tds ca2 mg2 na cl so4 2 and k groundwater contents on the study area all the groundwater samples exceeded fao standards for agricultural activities for all chemical elements with the exception of hco3 4 3 bivariate correlation and pca the correlation matrix shows that several significant pearson correlations were found between the different groundwater ions composition table 4 a strong correlation r 0 7 table 4 was observed between cl na so4 mg and ca and tds which suggest an evaporitic origin nacl caso4 caso4 2h2o mgso4 of these elements in groundwater the slight difference between the correlation coefficients of chlorides r 0 92 and sodium r 0 89 with water salinity expressed by tds could be explained by the fact that sodium ions undergo non conservative transport cationic exchanges with clay minerals whereas chlorides do not undergo any transformation during their transport abid et al 2009 amiri et al 2016 el yaouti et al 2009 askri et al 2018 the difference of correlation coefficients between sulfate r 0 83 calcium r 0 79 and magnesium r 0 75 with groundwater salinity could be explained by the fact that calcium and magnesium ions undergo a non conservative transport cationic exchanges with the clay minerals of the aquifer and enter in the phenomena of precipitation dissolution of carbonates hsissou et al 1996 askri et al 2018 sikakwe and eyong 2022 significant to less significant correlations between cations and anions are highlighted between cl and na r 0 97 cl and mg2 r 0 68 cl and ca2 r 0 64 so4 2 and ca2 r 0 88 and so4 2 and mg2 r 0 90 these correlations suggest that the majority of chloride groundwater content is associated to the dissolution of nacl however a small contribution of this cation could result from other minerals dissolution in addition a relatively high correlation between cl and ca2 0 64 was found this is due to groundwater mechanisms of saline charge acquisition which are disturbed by several phenomena such as the exchange of bases that characterize highly mineralized waters the leaching of evaporitic levels and the dissolution of gypsum and halite that could increase calcium and chloride contents respectively the significant correlation between sulfate and calcium and magnesium is probably due to the dissolution of evaporites caso4 caso4 2h2o mgso4 the calcium and magnesium ions are also involved in carbonate dissolution precipitation phenomena and base exchange on clay minerals carol et al 2012 2021 askri et al 2018 bauer et al 2022 elmeknassi et al 2022 the eigenvalues for each component and the cumulative percentage obtained from pca methodology is presented in table 5 the two first components represent the main variance thus the component 1 component 2 factorial plan from obtained pca is plotted fig 4 the main axis of inertia expresses 47 29 of the variance and is positively defined by most of groundwater chemical elements tds ec cl so4 2 na mg2 ca2 and thus represents an axis of evaporite and saliferous mineralization on the study area a very good correlation was found between the elements na and cl which are located close on the graph fig 4 the first axis represents only 47 29 of the variance which shows some heterogeneity in the geochemical evolution of water table 3 the axis 2 expresses 16 19 of the variance and is essentially defined by ph and bicarbonates 4 4 geochemical assessment and saturation indices the study of the correlations between groundwater major elements concentrations cl so4 2 na ca2 mg2 and the total groundwater mineralization fig 5 allowed to trace the origin of the mineralization gharaat et al 2022 sunkari et al 2022 supported by the two clusters the presence of a positive correlation between the ions cl so4 2 na ca2 and mg2 and tds reflects the participation and the intervention of these elements in the acquisition of the salt charge of the groundwater and testifies the presence of a common source of mineralization that should be the dissolution of evaporites such as halite gypsum and anhydrite associated to the hadifa diapir fig 1c and from the evaporation phenomena that could affect groundwater wells located with low depth li et al 2018 particularly in the western part of the area fig 1c this is corroborated by the use of saturation indices si of several minerals such as halite gypsum anhydrite dolomite and calcite which shows a state of undersaturation for both clusters fig 6 a fig 6b with halite and slight undersaturation with gypsum except four samples from the second cluster which are slightly saturated with gypsum fig 6b the calculation of calcite and dolomite si shows that almost values of these indices are positive which prove that almost sampled groundwater is saturated with carbonate minerals calcite and dolomite with the exception of some samples associated to the first cluster fig 6a water is in equilibrium with a mineral when si 0 it is undersaturated when si 0 and oversaturated when si 0 cidu et al 2009 ahmad et al 2019 jalees et al 2021 groundwater ca2 and mg2 contents show a variability varying from 176 26 to 529 64 mg l for ca2 and from 189 63 to 341 57 mg l for mg2 on the first cluster table 2 and from 418 64 to 894 70 mg l for ca2 and from 109 86 to 188 06 mg l for mg2 on the second cluster table 3 this variability could be explained by that these two cations are probably involved in different phenomenon such as the dissolution precipitation processes of gypsum calcite and dolomite presence of a common ca2 ion and in the na ca or na mg base exchange and ca mg exchange phenomena due to the interaction between groundwater and carbonate rocks dolomitization processes mejri et al 2018 panneerselvam et al 2020 haji et al 2021 ongetta et al 2022 the projection of the different cluster points on the ca mg hco3 so4 versus na k cl diagram fig 7 indicates the distribution of groundwater samples between two processes where it shows that 41 of the points containing almost all the groundwater samples from cluster 2 and some groundwater samples from cluster 1 undergo reverse base exchange whereby na cations are adsorbed onto the surface of the clay minerals by releasing ca2 otherwise about 59 of the points almost groundwater samples of the first cluster undergo a direct base exchange with na cations are released from the complex and replaced by ca2 cations pratheepa et al 2015 panneerselvam et al 2020 mohammed et al 2022 slama et al 2022 4 5 isotopic study the groundwater isotopic signature has a relevant contribution on water processes such as the mixing of different water sources and evaporation process gat 1971 boosalik et al 2022 zhang et al 2022a 2022b indeed on the first cluster δ18o range between 7 94 and 4 13 with an average of 6 09 while δ2h varies between 69 54 and 38 49 with an average value of 46 93 table 2 the stable groundwater isotopic values from the second cluster indicate that δ18o varies from 7 86 to 4 89 with an average of 6 39 and δ2h ranges between 67 65 and 39 11 with an average of 46 94 table 3 the plotting of the different groundwater samples from both clusters in the diagram δ2h f δ18o relatively to the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 is presented on fig 8 consequently the groundwater samples from menzel habib aquifer system could be identified into three groups fig 8 the first group is constituted by the points located on gmwl reflecting a rapid infiltration of surface water or water from recent non evaporated rainfall hadj ammar et al 2014 mosaffa et al 2021 bahir et al 2022 the second one is formed by the groundwater points with enrichment on δ18o and a relatively depletion on δ2h which are plotted under gmwl and aligned along a line with a slope of 0 54 and representing the evaporation phenomenon yevenes and mannaerts 2011 hadj ammar et al 2014 mosaffa et al 2021 wang et al 2022a 2022b finally the third group is characterized by the most depleted δ2h and δ18o groundwater contents and represents older waters with a low renewing ben cheikh et al 2012 hadj ammar et al 2014 zhao et al 2022 5 conclusion this study on the groundwater from the menzel habib aquifer system will highlight the various geochemical phenomena that could occur within this important multilayer aquifer representing a relevant contribution to understand salinization processes ruling inland aquifers in arid semi arid areas the variation of salinity and hydrogeochemical behavior of the groundwater from menzel habib aquifer are explained by an interaction with the geological setting including evaporite diapir and sabkha within a complex structural context the multivariate statistical and geochemical methods using major elements have allowed to understand the groundwater mineralization processes from menzel habib aquifer system the indications delivered by the statistical and hydrochemical study are combined to investigate the main chemical elements in solution that control the salinity of the groundwater from menzel habib groundwater salinization is mainly associated to the dissolution of evaporite minerals the precipitation of carbonate minerals and the phenomena of base exchange and reverse base exchange the dissolution of halite and gypsum will also contribute to the salinization of groundwater which is also in perfect agreement with the state of groundwater saturation index relatively to these minerals the mechanism of base exchange and the processes of dissolution precipitation of carbonate minerals calcite dolomite are generally the main cause of the variability of major cations ca2 mg2 and na groundwater contents the stable isotopic groundwater composition reflects that almost groundwater samples were affected by evaporation phenomenon thus encouraging salinization funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors

occurs on the fault wnw ese corridor along the northern flank to the west and east it is bordered by upper cretaceous limestones and marls which are straightened overturned and even partly covered by the diffuse material of this diapiric abdeljaouad 1983 jurassic formations do not outcrop in the study area ben cheikh 2013 three stretches constitute the aquifer system of menzel habib area fig 1c from two deeps layers which are the cenomanian turonian sediments which are constituted by limestone and marl limestone layers and the senonian that is formed by limestone levels with marl intercalation to the plio quaternary shallow aquifer which is constituted by sandy loam formation the first level is characterized by an extremely high salinity 19 g l and it will be excluded from the current study because it is prohibited to drill in this layer ben cheikh 2013 the shallow aquifer has a depth that range from 10 m to 65 m a groundwater level varying between 5 m and 39 m and a piezometric level varying from 100 6 m a s l in the west to 7 m a s l in the east with a general direction flow to the east with some variation due to groundwater abstraction dhaoui et al 2021 the measures in situ for the deep aquifer indicate a depth from 65 m to 120 m a groundwater static level ranging between 47 m and 55 m and a piezometric level varying from 21 to 45 5 m a s l 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and chemical analysis a total of thirty six groundwater samples were collected from pumping wells located on the menzel habib area after several minutes of pumping 15 20 min before sampling to remove groundwater stored in the wells equipped with poly vinyl chloride pvc pipes between april may 2018 twenty five groundwater samples were collected from wells capturing the shallow aquifer p1 p25 fig 1b and eleven from wells capturing the deep aquifer g1 g11 fig 1b all the groundwater samples were transported in polypropylene bottles within cooler boxes to avoid possible contamination and water chemical processes over time the non conservative physico chemical variables electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds and ph were measured in the field using a multi parameter analyzer c933 in the laboratory the samples were filtered through 0 45 μm pore size cellulose acetate membrane filters and were refrigerated in order to limit physico chemical water processes the chemical analysis of elements hco3 f cl so4 2 br na k ca2 and mg2 from groundwater samples were carried out at the laboratory of the higher institute of water sciences and techniques of gabès tunisia the chemical analysis of elements f cl so4 2 br na k ca2 and mg2 was carried out by ionic liquid chromatography while the hco3 contents were measured by titration method the precision of groundwater analysis was determined by ionic balance and remains acceptable e 5 for all the groundwater samples furthermore the piper diagram is used to distinguish chemical facies binary diagrams ionic ratios in order to complete the study and to cross reference the information provided by these different methods the sub application phreeq of diagrammes software from the hydrogeology laboratory of avignon was used to calculate saturation indices from the ionic activities the stable isotopes of the water 2h 18o were measured for all the collected samples using mass spectrometry machine model lwia the results are expressed as a relative deviation δ and will be applied on the determination of groundwater origin processes 3 2 multivariate statistical methodologies the analysis of the geochemical data to determine groundwater processes and main mineralization sources is also based on statistical techniques hamzaoui azaza et al 2011 voutsis et al 2015 mountadar et al 2018 khaskhoussy et hachicha 2020 sarti et al 2021 selvakumar et al 2021 balasubramanian et al 2022 mohamed et al 2022 the statistical analysis of groundwater geochemical data was performed with the spss software in this regard hierarchical cluster analysis hca and principal component analysis pca were involved the hca methodology allows to produce as many classes as there are entities samples in a database de andrade et al 2008 elumalai et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 the objective of this method is to define an aggregation criterion for the classes which could be defined by measuring the degree of similarity or dissimilarity between the samples el yaouti et al 2009 khalil et al 2021 mohammed et al 2022 hca can also group samples issued from different aquifer layers trabelsi et al 2012 hadj ammar et al 2014 liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2022a 2022b there are several measures for estimating the degree of similarity between samples the most commonly used being the euclidean distance as it is a geometric distance in a multi dimensional space bhakar and singh 2019 egbueri 2020 rao and chaudhary 2019 the euclidean distances indicates the shortest geometric distance between two points in a space cloutier et al 2008 in the current case the thirty six groundwater samples will be clustered based on groundwater salinity values expressed by tds values indeed this method produces a sequence of nested partitions of all the individuals to be ranked the partitions are represented by a classification tree or dendrogram the number of classes obtained depends on the level of the cut of the tree chosen called phenon line the aggregation criteria after the calculation of the distances are used for the determination of the sample classes yidana et al 2008 alfaifi et al 2021 this similarity is done according to the ward criterion ward 1963 which will produce better results than other methods bhakar and singh 2019 egbueri 2020 zhang et al 2022a 2022b the principal component analysis pca is one of the most widely used methods of multivariate data analysis it is well known as a method of dimension reduction which allows to explore multidimensional data sets made of quantitative variables and to transform highly correlated variables into new variables decorrelated from each other st hillaire et al 2004 blake et al 2016 abdelaziz et al 2020 the first step consists in calculating the pearson correlation coefficients between the variables then the projection axes are assimilated to the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix yidana et al 2008 mountadar et al 2018 bawoke et al 2019 the first axis will allow the identification of the individuals i e for which the variance of the individuals is maximal then a second principal component is the one that provides the greatest possible information complementary to the first hamzaoui azaza et al 2011 trabelsi and zouari 2019 the process continues until the last principal component is obtained the choice of the number of components is expressed in terms of the eigenvalues or percentages of eigenvalues or the percentages of variation explained by each principal component this method will be applied for thirty six groundwater samples observations with twelve variables both multivariate statistical methods applied in this research required standardization of the data in order to include internal variables measured with non comparable scales in the same classification mountadar et al 2018 thus regardless of the unit of each variable measured each one will have an equivalent weight in the classification the standardized value is noted zij medina gomez and herrara silveira 2003 z i j x i j x m σ i where xij is the real value of the variable xm is the mean value of the real variable and σi is its standard deviation 4 results and discussions 4 1 hydrogeochemistry results the descriptive statistics summary of the chemical analysis and field measurements of thirty six groundwater samples are presented in table 1 the relative proportions of the major cations in groundwater samples occurred in the order of na mg2 ca2 k for the samples issued from shallow and deep aquifers anions were dominated by so4 ions in groundwater samples from shallow aquifer and were present in the order of so4 2 cl hco3 br f however in the deep aquifer cl are considered as dominant anion in the order of cl so4 2 hco3 br f all samples show a high ec more than 3 ms cm and a high tds values for the ph all the samples from both aquifer levels are categorized as slightly alkaline table 1 the coefficients of variation for both layers are lower than other studies jain et al 2010 del campo et al 2014 which indicates a similarity between samples from shallow and deep aquifers that is why the samples are assessed together in statistical study 4 2 hca the representation of the thirty six observations which are the roots in the hierarchical clustering analysis tree allows the identification of a typology of waters from their physico chemical data fig 2 a consequently two clusters are identified fig 2b which represent the branches of the dendrogram the number of clusters increase or decrease according to the position of the phenom line depending on the distance of splitting considered as the euclidian distance in this study the two clusters are obtained for a distance of 10 therefore the statistical summary maximum minimum median mean standard deviation of the physico chemical groundwater parameters and the major ions for the obtained clusters are represented in table 2 and table 3 the groundwater was slightly acidic to alkaline with ph values between 6 95 and 8 6 for cluster 1 while it was alkaline for cluster 2 with ph values ranging from 7 40 to 7 85 the groundwater tds varies from 1598 to 4708 mg l and from 6031 to 8706 mg l and ec is ranged from 3 06 to 8 88 ms cm and from 10 86 to 14 98 ms cm for cluster 1 and cluster 2 respectively the dominant cation is na followed by ca2 mg2 and k for both clusters while the dominant anion is so4 2 followed by cl hco3 br and f for cluster 1 however the dominant anion is cl followed by so4 2 hco3 br and f for cluster 2 indeed a groundwater communication between deep and shallow aquifers will occur in the aquifer system trabelsi et al 2012 hadj ammar et al 2014 the groundwater samples spatial distribution by the two clusters were plotted in piper diagram to geochemical groundwater dominant facies characterization fig 3 both two cluster groups have different physicochemical characteristics and signatures tables 2 and 3 which could be described as following on one hand cluster 1 includes the highest number of groundwater samples 26 which are generally characterized by high concentrations of k and mg2 exceeding food and agriculture organization standards which are 0 2 mg l and 0 5 meq l respectively fao 1994 while hco3 contents area less than fao standards ca2 cl na and so4 2 groundwater contents are above and below these parametric values 0 30 meq l 0 40 meq l and 0 20 meq l respectively the tds range from 1598 to 4708 mg l thus this cluster is characterized by na cl na so4 and mixed water types on the other hand cluster 2 includes ten groundwater samples which are characterized by high to extremely high mineralization tds 6000 mg l in this group na is the dominant cation an increase by around the double of the chemical element s contents compared to the first cluster is noted the dominant facies of this group is na cl water type this cluster is characterized by the highest tds ca2 mg2 na cl so4 2 and k groundwater contents on the study area all the groundwater samples exceeded fao standards for agricultural activities for all chemical elements with the exception of hco3 4 3 bivariate correlation and pca the correlation matrix shows that several significant pearson correlations were found between the different groundwater ions composition table 4 a strong correlation r 0 7 table 4 was observed between cl na so4 mg and ca and tds which suggest an evaporitic origin nacl caso4 caso4 2h2o mgso4 of these elements in groundwater the slight difference between the correlation coefficients of chlorides r 0 92 and sodium r 0 89 with water salinity expressed by tds could be explained by the fact that sodium ions undergo non conservative transport cationic exchanges with clay minerals whereas chlorides do not undergo any transformation during their transport abid et al 2009 amiri et al 2016 el yaouti et al 2009 askri et al 2018 the difference of correlation coefficients between sulfate r 0 83 calcium r 0 79 and magnesium r 0 75 with groundwater salinity could be explained by the fact that calcium and magnesium ions undergo a non conservative transport cationic exchanges with the clay minerals of the aquifer and enter in the phenomena of precipitation dissolution of carbonates hsissou et al 1996 askri et al 2018 sikakwe and eyong 2022 significant to less significant correlations between cations and anions are highlighted between cl and na r 0 97 cl and mg2 r 0 68 cl and ca2 r 0 64 so4 2 and ca2 r 0 88 and so4 2 and mg2 r 0 90 these correlations suggest that the majority of chloride groundwater content is associated to the dissolution of nacl however a small contribution of this cation could result from other minerals dissolution in addition a relatively high correlation between cl and ca2 0 64 was found this is due to groundwater mechanisms of saline charge acquisition which are disturbed by several phenomena such as the exchange of bases that characterize highly mineralized waters the leaching of evaporitic levels and the dissolution of gypsum and halite that could increase calcium and chloride contents respectively the significant correlation between sulfate and calcium and magnesium is probably due to the dissolution of evaporites caso4 caso4 2h2o mgso4 the calcium and magnesium ions are also involved in carbonate dissolution precipitation phenomena and base exchange on clay minerals carol et al 2012 2021 askri et al 2018 bauer et al 2022 elmeknassi et al 2022 the eigenvalues for each component and the cumulative percentage obtained from pca methodology is presented in table 5 the two first components represent the main variance thus the component 1 component 2 factorial plan from obtained pca is plotted fig 4 the main axis of inertia expresses 47 29 of the variance and is positively defined by most of groundwater chemical elements tds ec cl so4 2 na mg2 ca2 and thus represents an axis of evaporite and saliferous mineralization on the study area a very good correlation was found between the elements na and cl which are located close on the graph fig 4 the first axis represents only 47 29 of the variance which shows some heterogeneity in the geochemical evolution of water table 3 the axis 2 expresses 16 19 of the variance and is essentially defined by ph and bicarbonates 4 4 geochemical assessment and saturation indices the study of the correlations between groundwater major elements concentrations cl so4 2 na ca2 mg2 and the total groundwater mineralization fig 5 allowed to trace the origin of the mineralization gharaat et al 2022 sunkari et al 2022 supported by the two clusters the presence of a positive correlation between the ions cl so4 2 na ca2 and mg2 and tds reflects the participation and the intervention of these elements in the acquisition of the salt charge of the groundwater and testifies the presence of a common source of mineralization that should be the dissolution of evaporites such as halite gypsum and anhydrite associated to the hadifa diapir fig 1c and from the evaporation phenomena that could affect groundwater wells located with low depth li et al 2018 particularly in the western part of the area fig 1c this is corroborated by the use of saturation indices si of several minerals such as halite gypsum anhydrite dolomite and calcite which shows a state of undersaturation for both clusters fig 6 a fig 6b with halite and slight undersaturation with gypsum except four samples from the second cluster which are slightly saturated with gypsum fig 6b the calculation of calcite and dolomite si shows that almost values of these indices are positive which prove that almost sampled groundwater is saturated with carbonate minerals calcite and dolomite with the exception of some samples associated to the first cluster fig 6a water is in equilibrium with a mineral when si 0 it is undersaturated when si 0 and oversaturated when si 0 cidu et al 2009 ahmad et al 2019 jalees et al 2021 groundwater ca2 and mg2 contents show a variability varying from 176 26 to 529 64 mg l for ca2 and from 189 63 to 341 57 mg l for mg2 on the first cluster table 2 and from 418 64 to 894 70 mg l for ca2 and from 109 86 to 188 06 mg l for mg2 on the second cluster table 3 this variability could be explained by that these two cations are probably involved in different phenomenon such as the dissolution precipitation processes of gypsum calcite and dolomite presence of a common ca2 ion and in the na ca or na mg base exchange and ca mg exchange phenomena due to the interaction between groundwater and carbonate rocks dolomitization processes mejri et al 2018 panneerselvam et al 2020 haji et al 2021 ongetta et al 2022 the projection of the different cluster points on the ca mg hco3 so4 versus na k cl diagram fig 7 indicates the distribution of groundwater samples between two processes where it shows that 41 of the points containing almost all the groundwater samples from cluster 2 and some groundwater samples from cluster 1 undergo reverse base exchange whereby na cations are adsorbed onto the surface of the clay minerals by releasing ca2 otherwise about 59 of the points almost groundwater samples of the first cluster undergo a direct base exchange with na cations are released from the complex and replaced by ca2 cations pratheepa et al 2015 panneerselvam et al 2020 mohammed et al 2022 slama et al 2022 4 5 isotopic study the groundwater isotopic signature has a relevant contribution on water processes such as the mixing of different water sources and evaporation process gat 1971 boosalik et al 2022 zhang et al 2022a 2022b indeed on the first cluster δ18o range between 7 94 and 4 13 with an average of 6 09 while δ2h varies between 69 54 and 38 49 with an average value of 46 93 table 2 the stable groundwater isotopic values from the second cluster indicate that δ18o varies from 7 86 to 4 89 with an average of 6 39 and δ2h ranges between 67 65 and 39 11 with an average of 46 94 table 3 the plotting of the different groundwater samples from both clusters in the diagram δ2h f δ18o relatively to the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 is presented on fig 8 consequently the groundwater samples from menzel habib aquifer system could be identified into three groups fig 8 the first group is constituted by the points located on gmwl reflecting a rapid infiltration of surface water or water from recent non evaporated rainfall hadj ammar et al 2014 mosaffa et al 2021 bahir et al 2022 the second one is formed by the groundwater points with enrichment on δ18o and a relatively depletion on δ2h which are plotted under gmwl and aligned along a line with a slope of 0 54 and representing the evaporation phenomenon yevenes and mannaerts 2011 hadj ammar et al 2014 mosaffa et al 2021 wang et al 2022a 2022b finally the third group is characterized by the most depleted δ2h and δ18o groundwater contents and represents older waters with a low renewing ben cheikh et al 2012 hadj ammar et al 2014 zhao et al 2022 5 conclusion this study on the groundwater from the menzel habib aquifer system will highlight the various geochemical phenomena that could occur within this important multilayer aquifer representing a relevant contribution to understand salinization processes ruling inland aquifers in arid semi arid areas the variation of salinity and hydrogeochemical behavior of the groundwater from menzel habib aquifer are explained by an interaction with the geological setting including evaporite diapir and sabkha within a complex structural context the multivariate statistical and geochemical methods using major elements have allowed to understand the groundwater mineralization processes from menzel habib aquifer system the indications delivered by the statistical and hydrochemical study are combined to investigate the main chemical elements in solution that control the salinity of the groundwater from menzel habib groundwater salinization is mainly associated to the dissolution of evaporite minerals the precipitation of carbonate minerals and the phenomena of base exchange and reverse base exchange the dissolution of halite and gypsum will also contribute to the salinization of groundwater which is also in perfect agreement with the state of groundwater saturation index relatively to these minerals the mechanism of base exchange and the processes of dissolution precipitation of carbonate minerals calcite dolomite are generally the main cause of the variability of major cations ca2 mg2 and na groundwater contents the stable isotopic groundwater composition reflects that almost groundwater samples were affected by evaporation phenomenon thus encouraging salinization funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors

11736,in the present work remote sensing geographic information system gis field investigation and mapping methods techniques were incorporated to demarcate the groundwater potential zones in the khadir island of the kachchh region preliminary work consists of reconnaissance surveys and the preparation of various thematic maps of the region the lithology khadir formation of mesozoic period slope soil land use and land cover lulc lineament density faults fractures and linear valleys drainage density and geomorphology thematic maps were prepared using advanced land observation satellite phased array type l band synthetic aperture radar alos palsar data with 12 5 m spatial resolution sentinel 2 data bands 8 4 and 3 and icar national bureau of soil survey and land use planning and geological survey of india gsi published maps the groundwater potential index gwpi was determined by integrating and computing the groundwater thematic maps the groundwater potential map was further validated using the cohen s kappa statistic method the gwpi determines a high groundwater potential zone in the study area of which about 12 24 and 19 41 of the area are excellent and very good potential zones for groundwater extraction respectively the study shows that the cohen s kappa coefficient of 0 767 which falls under the good strength of agreement validates the result and determines that the western and eastern parts of the study area have greater groundwater potential zones graphical abstract image 1 keywords mcda analysis remote sensing and gis groundwater zonation kachchh basin data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction groundwater is a significant natural resource for its versatile uses in all spheres of life jha et al 2007 2010 over time especially in the last 200 years the use of groundwater has been manifolded due to the over exploitation of surface water as well as the erratic rain therefore the domestic industrial and agricultural fronts have mostly relied on groundwater resources to supplement the surface freshwater andualem and demeke 2019 groundwater resources are preferable to surface water resources for less pollution and dependability during drought periods rastogi et al 2014 the existing data suggests that globally groundwater is dominantly used as a source of water supply and 1 5 billion population depend on groundwater sources for their water supply withdrawing 600 700 103 million m3 y i e about 20 of global water withdrawals gleick 1993 shen et al 2008 mukherjee et al 2012 the dramatic increase in the human population has increased the use of surface and groundwater resources whenever and wherever they are available even though the groundwater occurrence is a subsurface phenomenon the zones can be delineated based on indirect analysis of some directly observable terrain features such as lineaments as shown by terrain features sener et al 2005 the occurrence and movement of groundwater in an area are governed by several factors such as topography lithology geological structures the extent of fractures secondary porosity soil lineament features slope drainage pattern landform geomorphology land use land cover lulc climatic conditions etc and the interrelationship between these factors greenbaum 1985 jaiswal et al 2003 chowdhury et al 2010 jha et al 2010 singh et al 2011b andualem and demeke 2019 nevertheless groundwater withdrawal without proper planning and scientific understanding can result in the depletion and pollution of the groundwater and eventually it can give rise to economic loss hence there is a need to find the groundwater potential zones especially in hard rock and hilly terrain where the groundwater is usually controlled by structures weathering and lithology gupta and srivastava 2010 the remote sensing rs and geographical information system gis technique has become very handy to analyse and integrating the data to derive useful outputs in exploring evaluating and managing vital groundwater resources sener et al 2005 srivastava et al 2008 ijumulana et al 2020 2021 2022 shyam et al 2021 thacker et al 2022 the landscape analysis using rs and gis techniques has become exceptionally beneficial in delineating potential groundwater zones in a region moreover published literatures reports shows the usefulness of gis based multi criteria analysis for the mapping groundwater recharge zones by computing the relative importance of thematic parameters hajkowicz and collins 2007 hajkowicz and higgins 2008 murthy and mamo 2009 chowdhury et al 2010 jha et al 2014 singh et al 2017 haque et al 2020 khan et al 2020 the kachchh district of western india is a drought prone region with an arid to semi arid climate predominating a desert landscape owing to the prolonged aridity with erratic rainfall the scarcity of surface water is perpetual hence the people are mainly dependent on the groundwater sources mukherjee et al 2012 keesari et al 2014 saha and gor 2020 further the industrial and infrastructural developments within last two decades increased the rate of extraction of groundwater resulting in a considerable decrease in groundwater table in kachchh several researchers have worked on determining the salt water intrusion and geochemical processes inhibiting in the coastal region of kachchh and gujarat gupta et al 2005 trivedi et al 2012 maurya et al 2019 bhagat et al 2021 shah et al 2022 conventionally the groundwater resources are crucially needed in a rapidly developing arid region like kachchh where civil engineering projects industries population growth and advanced irrigation practices are tremendously increasing jha et al 2007 2010 singh et al 2011a b andualem and demeke 2019 apart from the groundwater and surface water resources the government has provided long distance irrigation canals and pipeline systems in almost all areas of the kachchh region to fulfill the freshwater requirements for drinking agricultural and multipurpose uses chauhan et al 2021 however the khadir island of northern kachchh is yet to see the infrastructural and industrial development which is having maximum water scarcity compared to the other region of the kachchh district owing to its geographical location as surrounded by the great rann the salt playas this overturned triangular shaped rocky uplift barely contains alluvium at the southern tip mostly a hamada type rocky landscape with occasional structural depressions biswas 1974 hence the main source of freshwater in the khadir island is groundwater and a few surface reservoirs further due to shortage of availability of freshwater government has provided pipeline systems to fulfill the freshwater requirements however the available sources mentioned above are not sufficient to fulfill the freshwater requirements in the region thus the people residing import freshwater from nearby regions by different means of transportation which seems to be a temporary solution further owing to the scenic places like white rann salt flats hill stations birdlife wildlife archaeological sites and geological diversity the khadir region has become one of the favourite tourism centres in western india looking to the immense development potential of the khadir region there is a strong need to explore and fulfill the freshwater requirement of the region further the khadir island is located far from the sea therefore practices like installing desalination plants would be difficult and economically not feasible the khadir region has been undergoing freshwater scarcity for over 5000 years as evident by the unimaginably sophisticated water management system adopted by the harappan city dholavira one of the best preserved urban settlements of southeast asia sengupta et al 2020 the cultural water management system demonstrates the ingenuity of the harappan city people in their struggle to survive and thrive in a harsh water scarce environment singh 1996 two seasonal streams in this region use to be a scarce freshwater source and are assumed that due to the scientific water management system these people sustained independently without importing freshwater from anywhere in the arid region of khadir between 5000 and 3500 years bp possehl 2004 learning from the water management system of the indo saraswati civilization saini et al 2020 and the future development scenario with modern techniques to identify the freshwater resources and recharge them the authors believe that the area of khadir can be a self sustained region as far as the upcoming requirements of freshwater are concerned hence it is essential to identify groundwater potential zones and sustainable groundwater extraction methods in the khadir island mukherjee et al 2012 have performed a similar work but at a regional scale applying remote sensing and gis techniques to delineate the groundwater potential zones within the kachchh district the region of kachchh is known for varied geological structural and geomorphological diversity biswas 1993a biswas et al 2021 therefore the authors believe that a region specific high resolution investigation is needed to delineate the groundwater potential zones for the specific area looking at the geology structures and geomorphology of the particular region thus in the present study we applied remote sensing and gis techniques to mark the potential groundwater zones within the khadir region the multicriteria thematic mapping analysis using rs and gis tools is applied and the thematic maps of dem soil lithology land use and land cover lulc geomorphology slope lineament density and drainage density for the khadir region were prepared this method has proved to be fruitful to characterize groundwater potential zone in several places regionally as well as globally al shabeeb et al 2018 murmu et al 2019 arefin 2020 ravichandran et al 2022 sahu et al 2022 further the obtained results were validated with the existing groundwater sources of the study area using cohen s kappa statistic method the purpose of this investigation was to identify and delineate groundwater potential zones through the integration of gis with multi criteria decision analysis mcda and hence assess the groundwater potential zones in the khadir island the mcda is an effective tool for delineating groundwater resources as well as an aid to distinguish recharge zones in this area for future work chowdary et al 2009 machiwal et al 2011 al shabeeb et al 2018 andualem and demeke 2019 the groundwater potential zonation through mcda investigation will derive brief acquaintance on groundwater planning and policy makers for sustainable use of groundwater 2 description of

biswas 1993a biswas 2016a to the south it is controlled by the nww see trending kakindia fault fig 1 further the region of the khadir island is affected by several semi vertical longitudinal and transverse faults of e w n s and ne sw trends fig 1 biswas 1993a mafic intrusions of the deccan age seem to fill these longitudinal and transverse faults at places biswas 1993a the drainage pattern of the khadir island demonstrates the significant effect of key structural components chowksey et al 2010 ngangom et al 2017 jani et al 2021 the island is mostly drained by the south flowing rivers that follow the gentle backslope of the uplift ngangom and thakkar 2016 jani et al 2021 however there are also north flowing river systems that are direct expressions of the structure chowksey et al 2010 ngangom and thakkar 2016 jani et al 2021 the escarpment creates a major drainage divide essentially dividing drainage into the south and north flowing directions which merge into the rann deposits biswas 1974 jani et al 2021 3 materials and methods this investigation was carried out using a rigorous well planned and integrated strategy toposheets from the survey of india at a scale of 1 50 000 were utilized to define the research area and indicate the natural drainage for dem modification we used advanced land observation satellite phased array type l band synthetic aperture radar alos palsar data with 12 5 m spatial resolution from the alaska satellite facility website https asf alaska edu to generate drainage slope hill shadow and lineament maps in addition sentinel 2 data bands 8 4 and 3 with a spatial resolution of 10 m was downloaded from usgs earth explorer https earthexplorer usgs gov to create the land use land cover map and to validate the drainage derived from alos data the soil map was procured from icar national bureau of soil survey and land use planning the geological survey of india s geological map was meticulously digitized and prepared in arc gis 10 8 the geomorphological map was created by analysing the alos dem and sentinel 2 images fig 2 the flow chart describes the processing approach for finding groundwater potential zones utilising thematic map preparation and weight assignment for each layer fig 2 3 1 thematic map preparation 3 1 1 lithology the lithologic characteristics of the exposed rocks are important in controlling groundwater recharge when using the lineament and drainage some studies overlook this element el shazly et al 1983 edet et al 1998 this is because they considered the lineaments and drainage characteristics as a function of primary and secondary porosity therefore giving lithology information others however el baz et al 1995 include the lithology component due to its substantial effects on water percolation for the control of groundwater supply massive rock lithology has limited impact compared to topography lithology is a crucial factor in groundwater recharge processes because it controls percolation and infiltration adiat et al 2012 gates et al 2014 to determine groundwater potential zones with precision it is necessary to investigate lithological characteristics in depth weathering and fracture by secondary porosity cause the rocks to become aquifers sener et al 2005 the lithological units in the study area are described in fig 3 a furthermore the study area has 10 distinct types of litho units including aeolian sand clay marl agate pebble conglomerate basalt calcareous clay silty marl ferruginous sandstone with intercalated siltstone gypseous shale marl oolitic limestone polymictic conglomerate fossiliferous sandstone shale clay and shale with calcareous sandstone table 1 3 1 2 slope slope is one of the most influential factors on groundwater potential generally groundwater potential increases with decreasing slope values delin et al 2000 rahman et al 2012 in terms of groundwater flat regions with a low slope may retain precipitation and recharge it whereas elevated areas with a high slope will have substantial run off and minimal infiltration the landscape of the khadir island is characterized by a gentle southern slope and steep northern escarpment the slope theme of the study area was generated using data from the advanced land observation satellite phased array type l band synthetic aperture radar alos palsar with a spatial resolution of 12 5 m the slope angle of the khadir island varies from 00 to 05 in degrees fig 3b based on the slope angle the study area has been reclassified into five slope classes table 2 the majority of the landscape was determined to be in the slope class very low 00 01 and covered 29 64 of the study area table 2 3 1 3 soils soil is a crucial factor in determining groundwater potential because soil type soil thickness soil texture and soil composition govern infiltration characteristics and consequently groundwater recharge arulbalaji et al 2019 achu et al 2020 the primary soil types in the study area include calcareous loamy soil calcareous sandy soil fine loamy soil course loamy and clayey soil all of which have poor to excellent infiltration properties fig 4 a table 3 the majority of the soils are calcareous in nature calcareous soils are common in semi arid and dry regions particularly when calcareous parent material exists in flat to the hilly ground with scarce natural vegetation of xerophytic shrubs and ephemeral grasses 3 1 4 land use land cover lulc have a significant impact on groundwater resources by altering recharge conditions and influencing water demand lerner and harris 2009 jinno et al 2009 the impact of land use land cover lulc is exhibited by either lowering runoff and facilitating or by plants retaining water water droplets caught in this manner fall to the earth and refresh the groundwater lulc may potentially have a detrimental impact on groundwater through evapotranspiration assuming continuous interception barren land unculturable waste land scrub land dominated the landscapes followed by agricultural cropland and plantation which covered around 47 40 and 30 38 percent of the total area respectively fig 4b table 4 3 1 5 lineament density lineaments comprises linear units related with geology and geomorphologic processes they can indicate tectonic deformation zones topography components such as interfluves and valleys and ridgelines among other things jordan et al 2005 as the lineaments indicate the weak zones they influence the circulation of groundwater and enhance the likelihood of infiltration lineaments such as joints fractures and faults have great significance in hydrogeological studies because they can provide routes for groundwater flow sankar 2002 thus lineament density ld and groundwater potential are directly related as ld values rise so does groundwater potential magowe and carr 1999 varade et al 2018 lineaments can act as a conduit for groundwater movement resulting in enhanced porosity and therefore serving as a groundwater prospective zone obi reddy et al 2000 subsurface horizons are usually extended by the extension of large lineaments that signify a shear zone or fault similarly lineament intersections are likely to be strong groundwater potential zones individual lineaments are not as consistently and linearly connected to groundwater productivity hardcastle 1995 the lineament density of the study area was calculated using data from the advanced land observation satellite phased array type l band synthetic aperture radar alos palsar with a spatial resolution of 12 5 m lineament density ld is been utilized in this investigation to target groundwater in the study area lineaments are the total length of lineaments in a unit area as described by eq 1 yeh et al 2016 1 l d i 1 i n l i a where i 1 i n l i represents the total length of lineaments l and a represents a unit area l2 in this study the lineament density was categorised into five classes fig 5 with an aerial extent of 70 46 table 5 of the landscape the lineament with densities ranging from 0 to 40 km km2 dominated the study area groundwater potential is directly proportional to lineament density areas with a lineament density of 300 460 km km2 were identified as promising groundwater potential zones accounting for approximately 1 19 of the landscape 3 1 6 drainage density drainage density describes the relationship between total drainage length and basin area drainage density is highly correlated with permeability and infiltration capacity hence it is a crucial measure for identifying groundwater potential zones furthermore stream density reflects the pace at which precipitation infiltrates relative to surface runoff the infiltration runoff connection is mainly influenced by permeability which is determined by the rock type and fracture of the underlying rock or surface bedrock edet et al 1998 the area with a high drainage density indicates that drainage lines are closer together and vice versa thus high drainage density values encourage surface drainage while reflecting low permeability and groundwater potential pinto et al 2017 patra et al 2018 and vice versa groundwater prospects are poor in very high drainage density regions because the majority of the water poured over them during rainfall is lost as surface runoff with minimal penetration to fulfill groundwater needs low drainage density regions on the other hand allow for higher penetration and recharging of groundwater and hence have a high groundwater potential it is generally recognised that the higher the density of the drainage network lower the recharge rate and vice versa edet et al 1998 the drainage density km km2 expresses the closeness of spacing of stream channels thus providing a quantitative measurement of the average length of stream channels of the whole basin strahler 1964 singh et al 2017 the drainage density has an inverse relationship with the permeability of aquifers and plays a vital role in the run off distribution and level of infiltration edet et al 1998 the drainage density map was prepared using advanced land observation satellite phased array type l band synthetic aperture radar alos palsar data with 12 5 m spatial resolution and sentinel 2 data bands 8 4 and 3 with 10 m spatial resolution from usgs earth explorer for the verification of the drainage generated from alos data the drainage density is categorised into five classes ranging from very low 0 1 km km2 to very high 4 7 km km2 fig 6a table 6 3 1 7 geomorphology geomorphological investigations in conjunction with hydrogeological and structure lineament studies have proven to be quite successful in locating groundwater potential zones bahuguna et al 2003 the geomorphology of an area is an essential factor in determining groundwater potential as it essentially governs the groundwater flow under the earth s surface the majority of the terrain is covered with pediplains followed by pediments in low lying areas and the cuesta landform in higher elevation areas fig 6b table 7 3 2 weight assignment multi criteria decision analysis mcda was employed to determine the respective weights of the determinant thematic maps table 8 the groundwater conditioning factors were weighted based on expert knowledge and literature review of several researchers nampak et al 2014 rahmati et al 2015 ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 yeh et al 2016 naghibi et al 2017 rajaveni et al 2017 the union overlay tool in arc gis was utilized to overlay the thematic maps the pairwise comparison between each thematic layer obtained based on the methods employed by several researchers is presented in table 9 chowdhury et al 2009 2010 machiwal et al 2011 sahoo et al 2015 the normalized weights of the individual themes and their different layers were calculated using the analytical hierarchy process ahp method the pairs of criteria ci in the row and cj in the column were considered based on 1 which criterion was important ci or cj and 2 how much the said criterion is more important relative to the lesser important criterion the normalized weights were determined by dividing each ci row values by the column total table 9 according to the characteristics of the theme feature and its relation to groundwater contribution weights have been assigned the influence percentage and overall weights table 10 were developed based on the assigned weight to each feature and pairwise comparison between the feature classes the weight is assigned looking to the quality and quantity of the available theme within the study area the maximum weight is given to the lithology because the maximum part of the study area is dominated by porous sandstone and siltstones which act as a very good aquifer table 10 further the area is controlled by considerably good numbers of lineaments of various trends and the lineament has given the second highest weightage as the sandstone and siltstone of the study areas are of compact nature in comparison to the other sandstones and siltstones of the kachchh basin hence these lineaments support for infiltration of the surface water and also control the groundwater flow the third most important factor is the slope table 10 conventionally maximum area of the region comprises of low slope angle aiding infiltration of the rain water further the landform controls the surface water and the process of infiltration of the surface hence we have given the fourth highest weightage to the geomorphology theme table 10 likewise looking at the availability and possible role of the features the weightage assigned are mentioned in table 8 3 3 groundwater potential map development the groundwater potential gwp map is developed by overlaying the determinant groundwater contributing thematic layers the groundwater prospect zones were evaluated based on the groundwater potential index gwpi computed from the integration of all groundwater inﬂuencing thematic layers the union overlay in the arc gis tool was used to compute groundwater potential index values using the equation proposed by malczewski 1999 2 g w p i w 1 m j 1 n w j x i where wj is the normalized weight of the jth thematic layer xi is the normalized weight of the ith feature of the thematic layer m is the total number of thematic layers and n is the total number of features of a given theme the gwpi values were used to classify whether an area is excellent very good moderate poor to very poor with respect to groundwater potential chowdhury et al 2010 jha et al 2010 sahoo et al 2015 3 4 validation of groundwater maps the results of the groundwater potential maps were validated using the existing sources of the study area a detailed well inventory was carried out on the khadir island and a total of 30 pumping wells were found the locations of the existing pumping wells were mapped and digitized using arc gis software in the study area the data of pumping well discharge computed using barrel test and groundwater level map of the existing pumping wells were considered to validate the groundwater prospect map of the khadir island for the validation of groundwater potential maps developed using thematic maps cohen s kappa statistic method cohen 1960 was opted several workers have established a well defined relationship between the groundwater potential zonation mapping vulnerability modelling and its validation using cohen s kappa method globally masetti et al 2009 kordestani et al 2019 messier et al 2019 kumar et al 2021 3 5 geographic weighted regression analysis the geographic weighted regression gwr is a tool for analysing the association between variables that varies regionally fotheringham et al 2002 gwr uses explanatory variables with various weights based on their location to generate a regression model for each observation of the dependent variable on space the following equation is used to calculate the weight for an explanatory variable at observation wi g exp d h 2 3 where g is the vector that determines the dependent variable s coordinate d denotes the distance between the dependent variable at g and the explanatory variable at i and h denotes the bandwidth the regression model becomes a global one when h reaches infinite explanatory variables that are closer to the dependent variable have a stronger influence than those that are farther away the geographic weighted regression tool was utilized in the arc gis platform the gwp is considered as the dependent variable and all the above thematic maps lithology slope soil lulc lineament density drainage density and geomorphology as explanatory variables 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater prospect zones the groundwater prospect map showed that majorly the western and eastern sections of the study area have high potential resembling the excellent groundwater prospect zone geomorphologically the excellent potential zones consist of pediplain area with a lower slope gradient away from the rugged topography in the northern part hence it indurates infiltration with a minor rate of runoff further these excellent zones consist of sandstones and siltstones which support the percolation of rain water which might form good aquifer zones however the northern part comprises sandstone lithology but has a relatively higher slope gradient which demarcates higher runoff of rainwater causing a lower infiltration rate hence the northern parts are poor groundwater potential zones moreover the western parts comprise of major lineaments controlling the groundwater flow and infiltration tracts in the area further the lulc map shows a distinctive usage of agricultural land in the excellent potential zones different from the barren scrub land in the northern part as being poor groundwater zones the groundwater potential index gwpi map of the study area has been prepared using mcda fig 7 based on gwpi values groundwater prospect zones are classiﬁed into ﬁve groups table 11 the results of this study show that about 12 24 and 19 41 of the area had an excellent and very good groundwater potential respectively table 11 the overlay analysis results were compared to the sources present in the study area fig 8 pumping well discharge maps and a static water table depth to the groundwater below the ground surface were produced using existing pumping wells fig 9 a fig 9b bevan et al 2005 defined the water table level as the surface at which pore pressure equals atmospheric pressure water table level indicates hydraulic gradients of any point hence it can be useful to identify the area with high groundwater potential the pumping well discharge maps and depth to the groundwater below the ground surface generated from pumping wells using the kriging method of interpolation indicated that the eastern portion of the study area generates the highest discharge and also has the shallowest water level fig 9a fig 9b 4 2 groundwater map validation to validate the groundwater prospect zones the prediction accuracy is calculated and the cohen s kappa statistic was applied by comparing the existing groundwater well locations cohen 1960 cohen s kappa coefficient κ can be defined as follows 3 k o a a c 1 a c where oa is the sum of true positive and true negative divided by the total number of data and ac can be calculated as in equation 4 4 ac p n p n n n n n where p is the sum of true positive and false positive n is the sum of false negative and true negative and p is the sum of true positive and false negative thus the cohen s kappa coefficient shows the strength of agreement between two variables as in table 12 the data from 30 pumping wells were extracted to perform statistical analysis of cohen s kappa statistic the cohen s kappa coefficient computed from the existing well data is 0 767 which falls under the good strength of agreement hence the ahp method is a good technique in terms of groundwater prospects water resource management and engineering studies have used the ahp technique as a structured method of analysing multiple parameters for decisions related to earth environmental issues based on the assigned weights of decision criteria aggarwal et al 2009 bhatnagar and goyal 2012 kaliraj et al 2019 therefore the results of groundwater potential maps obtained using the ahp method have been considered a good prediction 4 3 geographic weighted regression results the geographic weighted regression gwr analysis result is determined in the terms of r square r2 values r2 is a measure of goodness of fit observed vs predicted it may be interpreted as the proportion of dependent variable variance standard deviation accounted for by the regression model brunsdon et al 1996 fotheringham and brunsdon 1999 these studies included mapping of environmental issues robinson et al 2011 estimation of above ground biomass propastin 2012 loss of forest areas pineda jaimes et al 2010 remote sensing kamarianakis et al 2008 and urban studies li et al 2010 its value varies from 0 0 to 1 0 with higher values being preferable brunsdon et al 1996 fotheringham and brunsdon 1999 the gwr analysis in the present research gives a resultant range of r2 from 0 26 to 0 66 supplementary figs 1 7 the dominant determinant factor influencing the groundwater recharge in the khadir region is the soil with a r2 value of 0 66 followed by the slope 0 65 lulc 0 62 geomorphology 0 58 lineament density 0 31 drainage density 0 3 and lithology 0 26 5 conclusion groundwater is a critical resource for the country s long term growth and water resource management remote sensing and gis techniques have been used to evaluate groundwater potential zones in the present study area of the khadir region of kachchh by utilising several thematic maps such as lithology soil land use lineament density drainage density etc the weight of thematic layers was ranked based on their groundwater contribution characteristics and were overlaid and merged for groundwater potential zone construction from our observations the following conclusions can be drawn the groundwater prospect map of the study area showed that majorly the western and eastern part of the study area has high potential in which about 12 24 and 19 41 of the area have an excellent and very good groundwater potential respectively based on the computed values of cohen s kappa coefficient and the analytical hierarchy process ahp method for the existing well data suggests that the 0 767 cohen s kappa coefficient falls under the good strength of agreement which can be implemented as a good technique in terms of groundwater prospect in terms of groundwater recharge the soil theme is the most determinant factor impacting groundwater recharge in the khadir island followed by slope lulc and geomorphology according to the gwr results supplementary figs 1 7 hence groundwater development activities can be carried out in such high groundwater potential zones of the landscape to increase supplementary irrigation and domestic use productivity 5 1 impact of the study this site specific study is very useful for water resources planners by indicating the potential areas for development the methodology can be applied effectively in other parts of the country for the long term utilization of groundwater resources and development purposes as well as for improving groundwater recharge this remote area of northern kachchh holds a significant indus saraswati civilization site of dholavira which was recently declared a world heritage site by unesco considering the infrastructural development and future need for exploration of surface and groundwater with the potential recharge zones this study may prove extremely useful further studies can be carried out on groundwater hydro chemistry and its suitability for domestic and irrigation purposes and also on the groundwater recharge amount and its relation to precipitation amount declaration of competing

11736,in the present work remote sensing geographic information system gis field investigation and mapping methods techniques were incorporated to demarcate the groundwater potential zones in the khadir island of the kachchh region preliminary work consists of reconnaissance surveys and the preparation of various thematic maps of the region the lithology khadir formation of mesozoic period slope soil land use and land cover lulc lineament density faults fractures and linear valleys drainage density and geomorphology thematic maps were prepared using advanced land observation satellite phased array type l band synthetic aperture radar alos palsar data with 12 5 m spatial resolution sentinel 2 data bands 8 4 and 3 and icar national bureau of soil survey and land use planning and geological survey of india gsi published maps the groundwater potential index gwpi was determined by integrating and computing the groundwater thematic maps the groundwater potential map was further validated using the cohen s kappa statistic method the gwpi determines a high groundwater potential zone in the study area of which about 12 24 and 19 41 of the area are excellent and very good potential zones for groundwater extraction respectively the study shows that the cohen s kappa coefficient of 0 767 which falls under the good strength of agreement validates the result and determines that the western and eastern parts of the study area have greater groundwater potential zones graphical abstract image 1 keywords mcda analysis remote sensing and gis groundwater zonation kachchh basin data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction groundwater is a significant natural resource for its versatile uses in all spheres of life jha et al 2007 2010 over time especially in the last 200 years the use of groundwater has been manifolded due to the over exploitation of surface water as well as the erratic rain therefore the domestic industrial and agricultural fronts have mostly relied on groundwater resources to supplement the surface freshwater andualem and demeke 2019 groundwater resources are preferable to surface water resources for less pollution and dependability during drought periods rastogi et al 2014 the existing data suggests that globally groundwater is dominantly used as a source of water supply and 1 5 billion population depend on groundwater sources for their water supply withdrawing 600 700 103 million m3 y i e about 20 of global water withdrawals gleick 1993 shen et al 2008 mukherjee et al 2012 the dramatic increase in the human population has increased the use of surface and groundwater resources whenever and wherever they are available even though the groundwater occurrence is a subsurface phenomenon the zones can be delineated based on indirect analysis of some directly observable terrain features such as lineaments as shown by terrain features sener et al 2005 the occurrence and movement of groundwater in an area are governed by several factors such as topography lithology geological structures the extent of fractures secondary porosity soil lineament features slope drainage pattern landform geomorphology land use land cover lulc climatic conditions etc and the interrelationship between these factors greenbaum 1985 jaiswal et al 2003 chowdhury et al 2010 jha et al 2010 singh et al 2011b andualem and demeke 2019 nevertheless groundwater withdrawal without proper planning and scientific understanding can result in the depletion and pollution of the groundwater and eventually it can give rise to economic loss hence there is a need to find the groundwater potential zones especially in hard rock and hilly terrain where the groundwater is usually controlled by structures weathering and lithology gupta and srivastava 2010 the remote sensing rs and geographical information system gis technique has become very handy to analyse and integrating the data to derive useful outputs in exploring evaluating and managing vital groundwater resources sener et al 2005 srivastava et al 2008 ijumulana et al 2020 2021 2022 shyam et al 2021 thacker et al 2022 the landscape analysis using rs and gis techniques has become exceptionally beneficial in delineating potential groundwater zones in a region moreover published literatures reports shows the usefulness of gis based multi criteria analysis for the mapping groundwater recharge zones by computing the relative importance of thematic parameters hajkowicz and collins 2007 hajkowicz and higgins 2008 murthy and mamo 2009 chowdhury et al 2010 jha et al 2014 singh et al 2017 haque et al 2020 khan et al 2020 the kachchh district of western india is a drought prone region with an arid to semi arid climate predominating a desert landscape owing to the prolonged aridity with erratic rainfall the scarcity of surface water is perpetual hence the people are mainly dependent on the groundwater sources mukherjee et al 2012 keesari et al 2014 saha and gor 2020 further the industrial and infrastructural developments within last two decades increased the rate of extraction of groundwater resulting in a considerable decrease in groundwater table in kachchh several researchers have worked on determining the salt water intrusion and geochemical processes inhibiting in the coastal region of kachchh and gujarat gupta et al 2005 trivedi et al 2012 maurya et al 2019 bhagat et al 2021 shah et al 2022 conventionally the groundwater resources are crucially needed in a rapidly developing arid region like kachchh where civil engineering projects industries population growth and advanced irrigation practices are tremendously increasing jha et al 2007 2010 singh et al 2011a b andualem and demeke 2019 apart from the groundwater and surface water resources the government has provided long distance irrigation canals and pipeline systems in almost all areas of the kachchh region to fulfill the freshwater requirements for drinking agricultural and multipurpose uses chauhan et al 2021 however the khadir island of northern kachchh is yet to see the infrastructural and industrial development which is having maximum water scarcity compared to the other region of the kachchh district owing to its geographical location as surrounded by the great rann the salt playas this overturned triangular shaped rocky uplift barely contains alluvium at the southern tip mostly a hamada type rocky landscape with occasional structural depressions biswas 1974 hence the main source of freshwater in the khadir island is groundwater and a few surface reservoirs further due to shortage of availability of freshwater government has provided pipeline systems to fulfill the freshwater requirements however the available sources mentioned above are not sufficient to fulfill the freshwater requirements in the region thus the people residing import freshwater from nearby regions by different means of transportation which seems to be a temporary solution further owing to the scenic places like white rann salt flats hill stations birdlife wildlife archaeological sites and geological diversity the khadir region has become one of the favourite tourism centres in western india looking to the immense development potential of the khadir region there is a strong need to explore and fulfill the freshwater requirement of the region further the khadir island is located far from the sea therefore practices like installing desalination plants would be difficult and economically not feasible the khadir region has been undergoing freshwater scarcity for over 5000 years as evident by the unimaginably sophisticated water management system adopted by the harappan city dholavira one of the best preserved urban settlements of southeast asia sengupta et al 2020 the cultural water management system demonstrates the ingenuity of the harappan city people in their struggle to survive and thrive in a harsh water scarce environment singh 1996 two seasonal streams in this region use to be a scarce freshwater source and are assumed that due to the scientific water management system these people sustained independently without importing freshwater from anywhere in the arid region of khadir between 5000 and 3500 years bp possehl 2004 learning from the water management system of the indo saraswati civilization saini et al 2020 and the future development scenario with modern techniques to identify the freshwater resources and recharge them the authors believe that the area of khadir can be a self sustained region as far as the upcoming requirements of freshwater are concerned hence it is essential to identify groundwater potential zones and sustainable groundwater extraction methods in the khadir island mukherjee et al 2012 have performed a similar work but at a regional scale applying remote sensing and gis techniques to delineate the groundwater potential zones within the kachchh district the region of kachchh is known for varied geological structural and geomorphological diversity biswas 1993a biswas et al 2021 therefore the authors believe that a region specific high resolution investigation is needed to delineate the groundwater potential zones for the specific area looking at the geology structures and geomorphology of the particular region thus in the present study we applied remote sensing and gis techniques to mark the potential groundwater zones within the khadir region the multicriteria thematic mapping analysis using rs and gis tools is applied and the thematic maps of dem soil lithology land use and land cover lulc geomorphology slope lineament density and drainage density for the khadir region were prepared this method has proved to be fruitful to characterize groundwater potential zone in several places regionally as well as globally al shabeeb et al 2018 murmu et al 2019 arefin 2020 ravichandran et al 2022 sahu et al 2022 further the obtained results were validated with the existing groundwater sources of the study area using cohen s kappa statistic method the purpose of this investigation was to identify and delineate groundwater potential zones through the integration of gis with multi criteria decision analysis mcda and hence assess the groundwater potential zones in the khadir island the mcda is an effective tool for delineating groundwater resources as well as an aid to distinguish recharge zones in this area for future work chowdary et al 2009 machiwal et al 2011 al shabeeb et al 2018 andualem and demeke 2019 the groundwater potential zonation through mcda investigation will derive brief acquaintance on groundwater planning and policy makers for sustainable use of groundwater 2 description of

lithostratigraphic unit containing bajocian to bathonian syn rift conglomerates and callovian to oxfordian and early cretaceous sandstones siltstones limestones and shales biswas 1974 2016b the island also contains tertiary sandstones laterites and clays biswas 1993b in many places the late cretaceous igneous rocks are intruded within the jurassic rocks in the form of dykes and sills biswas 1993a biswas 2016a occasionally the quaternary fluvial and aeolian deposits are preserved at the fringes of the khadir island and also as hinterland deposits within the local depressions biswas 1974 chowksey et al 2010 ngangom and thakkar 2016 the island is surrounded by the holocene marine inter tidal sediments of rann surface from all the sides ngangom et al 2017 structurally it is bounded by triangular fault systems having an e w trending island belt fault ibf while to the east it is bounded by the ne sw trending major transverse fault which is situated between the khadir and bela islands biswas 1993a biswas 2016a to the south it is controlled by the nww see trending kakindia fault fig 1 further the region of the khadir island is affected by several semi vertical longitudinal and transverse faults of e w n s and ne sw trends fig 1 biswas 1993a mafic intrusions of the deccan age seem to fill these longitudinal and transverse faults at places biswas 1993a the drainage pattern of the khadir island demonstrates the significant effect of key structural components chowksey et al 2010 ngangom et al 2017 jani et al 2021 the island is mostly drained by the south flowing rivers that follow the gentle backslope of the uplift ngangom and thakkar 2016 jani et al 2021 however there are also north flowing river systems that are direct expressions of the structure chowksey et al 2010 ngangom and thakkar 2016 jani et al 2021 the escarpment creates a major drainage divide essentially dividing drainage into the south and north flowing directions which merge into the rann deposits biswas 1974 jani et al 2021 3 materials and methods this investigation was carried out using a rigorous well planned and integrated strategy toposheets from the survey of india at a scale of 1 50 000 were utilized to define the research area and indicate the natural drainage for dem modification we used advanced land observation satellite phased array type l band synthetic aperture radar alos palsar data with 12 5 m spatial resolution from the alaska satellite facility website https asf alaska edu to generate drainage slope hill shadow and lineament maps in addition sentinel 2 data bands 8 4 and 3 with a spatial resolution of 10 m was downloaded from usgs earth explorer https earthexplorer usgs gov to create the land use land cover map and to validate the drainage derived from alos data the soil map was procured from icar national bureau of soil survey and land use planning the geological survey of india s geological map was meticulously digitized and prepared in arc gis 10 8 the geomorphological map was created by analysing the alos dem and sentinel 2 images fig 2 the flow chart describes the processing approach for finding groundwater potential zones utilising thematic map preparation and weight assignment for each layer fig 2 3 1 thematic map preparation 3 1 1 lithology the lithologic characteristics of the exposed rocks are important in controlling groundwater recharge when using the lineament and drainage some studies overlook this element el shazly et al 1983 edet et al 1998 this is because they considered the lineaments and drainage characteristics as a function of primary and secondary porosity therefore giving lithology information others however el baz et al 1995 include the lithology component due to its substantial effects on water percolation for the control of groundwater supply massive rock lithology has limited impact compared to topography lithology is a crucial factor in groundwater recharge processes because it controls percolation and infiltration adiat et al 2012 gates et al 2014 to determine groundwater potential zones with precision it is necessary to investigate lithological characteristics in depth weathering and fracture by secondary porosity cause the rocks to become aquifers sener et al 2005 the lithological units in the study area are described in fig 3 a furthermore the study area has 10 distinct types of litho units including aeolian sand clay marl agate pebble conglomerate basalt calcareous clay silty marl ferruginous sandstone with intercalated siltstone gypseous shale marl oolitic limestone polymictic conglomerate fossiliferous sandstone shale clay and shale with calcareous sandstone table 1 3 1 2 slope slope is one of the most influential factors on groundwater potential generally groundwater potential increases with decreasing slope values delin et al 2000 rahman et al 2012 in terms of groundwater flat regions with a low slope may retain precipitation and recharge it whereas elevated areas with a high slope will have substantial run off and minimal infiltration the landscape of the khadir island is characterized by a gentle southern slope and steep northern escarpment the slope theme of the study area was generated using data from the advanced land observation satellite phased array type l band synthetic aperture radar alos palsar with a spatial resolution of 12 5 m the slope angle of the khadir island varies from 00 to 05 in degrees fig 3b based on the slope angle the study area has been reclassified into five slope classes table 2 the majority of the landscape was determined to be in the slope class very low 00 01 and covered 29 64 of the study area table 2 3 1 3 soils soil is a crucial factor in determining groundwater potential because soil type soil thickness soil texture and soil composition govern infiltration characteristics and consequently groundwater recharge arulbalaji et al 2019 achu et al 2020 the primary soil types in the study area include calcareous loamy soil calcareous sandy soil fine loamy soil course loamy and clayey soil all of which have poor to excellent infiltration properties fig 4 a table 3 the majority of the soils are calcareous in nature calcareous soils are common in semi arid and dry regions particularly when calcareous parent material exists in flat to the hilly ground with scarce natural vegetation of xerophytic shrubs and ephemeral grasses 3 1 4 land use land cover lulc have a significant impact on groundwater resources by altering recharge conditions and influencing water demand lerner and harris 2009 jinno et al 2009 the impact of land use land cover lulc is exhibited by either lowering runoff and facilitating or by plants retaining water water droplets caught in this manner fall to the earth and refresh the groundwater lulc may potentially have a detrimental impact on groundwater through evapotranspiration assuming continuous interception barren land unculturable waste land scrub land dominated the landscapes followed by agricultural cropland and plantation which covered around 47 40 and 30 38 percent of the total area respectively fig 4b table 4 3 1 5 lineament density lineaments comprises linear units related with geology and geomorphologic processes they can indicate tectonic deformation zones topography components such as interfluves and valleys and ridgelines among other things jordan et al 2005 as the lineaments indicate the weak zones they influence the circulation of groundwater and enhance the likelihood of infiltration lineaments such as joints fractures and faults have great significance in hydrogeological studies because they can provide routes for groundwater flow sankar 2002 thus lineament density ld and groundwater potential are directly related as ld values rise so does groundwater potential magowe and carr 1999 varade et al 2018 lineaments can act as a conduit for groundwater movement resulting in enhanced porosity and therefore serving as a groundwater prospective zone obi reddy et al 2000 subsurface horizons are usually extended by the extension of large lineaments that signify a shear zone or fault similarly lineament intersections are likely to be strong groundwater potential zones individual lineaments are not as consistently and linearly connected to groundwater productivity hardcastle 1995 the lineament density of the study area was calculated using data from the advanced land observation satellite phased array type l band synthetic aperture radar alos palsar with a spatial resolution of 12 5 m lineament density ld is been utilized in this investigation to target groundwater in the study area lineaments are the total length of lineaments in a unit area as described by eq 1 yeh et al 2016 1 l d i 1 i n l i a where i 1 i n l i represents the total length of lineaments l and a represents a unit area l2 in this study the lineament density was categorised into five classes fig 5 with an aerial extent of 70 46 table 5 of the landscape the lineament with densities ranging from 0 to 40 km km2 dominated the study area groundwater potential is directly proportional to lineament density areas with a lineament density of 300 460 km km2 were identified as promising groundwater potential zones accounting for approximately 1 19 of the landscape 3 1 6 drainage density drainage density describes the relationship between total drainage length and basin area drainage density is highly correlated with permeability and infiltration capacity hence it is a crucial measure for identifying groundwater potential zones furthermore stream density reflects the pace at which precipitation infiltrates relative to surface runoff the infiltration runoff connection is mainly influenced by permeability which is determined by the rock type and fracture of the underlying rock or surface bedrock edet et al 1998 the area with a high drainage density indicates that drainage lines are closer together and vice versa thus high drainage density values encourage surface drainage while reflecting low permeability and groundwater potential pinto et al 2017 patra et al 2018 and vice versa groundwater prospects are poor in very high drainage density regions because the majority of the water poured over them during rainfall is lost as surface runoff with minimal penetration to fulfill groundwater needs low drainage density regions on the other hand allow for higher penetration and recharging of groundwater and hence have a high groundwater potential it is generally recognised that the higher the density of the drainage network lower the recharge rate and vice versa edet et al 1998 the drainage density km km2 expresses the closeness of spacing of stream channels thus providing a quantitative measurement of the average length of stream channels of the whole basin strahler 1964 singh et al 2017 the drainage density has an inverse relationship with the permeability of aquifers and plays a vital role in the run off distribution and level of infiltration edet et al 1998 the drainage density map was prepared using advanced land observation satellite phased array type l band synthetic aperture radar alos palsar data with 12 5 m spatial resolution and sentinel 2 data bands 8 4 and 3 with 10 m spatial resolution from usgs earth explorer for the verification of the drainage generated from alos data the drainage density is categorised into five classes ranging from very low 0 1 km km2 to very high 4 7 km km2 fig 6a table 6 3 1 7 geomorphology geomorphological investigations in conjunction with hydrogeological and structure lineament studies have proven to be quite successful in locating groundwater potential zones bahuguna et al 2003 the geomorphology of an area is an essential factor in determining groundwater potential as it essentially governs the groundwater flow under the earth s surface the majority of the terrain is covered with pediplains followed by pediments in low lying areas and the cuesta landform in higher elevation areas fig 6b table 7 3 2 weight assignment multi criteria decision analysis mcda was employed to determine the respective weights of the determinant thematic maps table 8 the groundwater conditioning factors were weighted based on expert knowledge and literature review of several researchers nampak et al 2014 rahmati et al 2015 ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 yeh et al 2016 naghibi et al 2017 rajaveni et al 2017 the union overlay tool in arc gis was utilized to overlay the thematic maps the pairwise comparison between each thematic layer obtained based on the methods employed by several researchers is presented in table 9 chowdhury et al 2009 2010 machiwal et al 2011 sahoo et al 2015 the normalized weights of the individual themes and their different layers were calculated using the analytical hierarchy process ahp method the pairs of criteria ci in the row and cj in the column were considered based on 1 which criterion was important ci or cj and 2 how much the said criterion is more important relative to the lesser important criterion the normalized weights were determined by dividing each ci row values by the column total table 9 according to the characteristics of the theme feature and its relation to groundwater contribution weights have been assigned the influence percentage and overall weights table 10 were developed based on the assigned weight to each feature and pairwise comparison between the feature classes the weight is assigned looking to the quality and quantity of the available theme within the study area the maximum weight is given to the lithology because the maximum part of the study area is dominated by porous sandstone and siltstones which act as a very good aquifer table 10 further the area is controlled by considerably good numbers of lineaments of various trends and the lineament has given the second highest weightage as the sandstone and siltstone of the study areas are of compact nature in comparison to the other sandstones and siltstones of the kachchh basin hence these lineaments support for infiltration of the surface water and also control the groundwater flow the third most important factor is the slope table 10 conventionally maximum area of the region comprises of low slope angle aiding infiltration of the rain water further the landform controls the surface water and the process of infiltration of the surface hence we have given the fourth highest weightage to the geomorphology theme table 10 likewise looking at the availability and possible role of the features the weightage assigned are mentioned in table 8 3 3 groundwater potential map development the groundwater potential gwp map is developed by overlaying the determinant groundwater contributing thematic layers the groundwater prospect zones were evaluated based on the groundwater potential index gwpi computed from the integration of all groundwater inﬂuencing thematic layers the union overlay in the arc gis tool was used to compute groundwater potential index values using the equation proposed by malczewski 1999 2 g w p i w 1 m j 1 n w j x i where wj is the normalized weight of the jth thematic layer xi is the normalized weight of the ith feature of the thematic layer m is the total number of thematic layers and n is the total number of features of a given theme the gwpi values were used to classify whether an area is excellent very good moderate poor to very poor with respect to groundwater potential chowdhury et al 2010 jha et al 2010 sahoo et al 2015 3 4 validation of groundwater maps the results of the groundwater potential maps were validated using the existing sources of the study area a detailed well inventory was carried out on the khadir island and a total of 30 pumping wells were found the locations of the existing pumping wells were mapped and digitized using arc gis software in the study area the data of pumping well discharge computed using barrel test and groundwater level map of the existing pumping wells were considered to validate the groundwater prospect map of the khadir island for the validation of groundwater potential maps developed using thematic maps cohen s kappa statistic method cohen 1960 was opted several workers have established a well defined relationship between the groundwater potential zonation mapping vulnerability modelling and its validation using cohen s kappa method globally masetti et al 2009 kordestani et al 2019 messier et al 2019 kumar et al 2021 3 5 geographic weighted regression analysis the geographic weighted regression gwr is a tool for analysing the association between variables that varies regionally fotheringham et al 2002 gwr uses explanatory variables with various weights based on their location to generate a regression model for each observation of the dependent variable on space the following equation is used to calculate the weight for an explanatory variable at observation wi g exp d h 2 3 where g is the vector that determines the dependent variable s coordinate d denotes the distance between the dependent variable at g and the explanatory variable at i and h denotes the bandwidth the regression model becomes a global one when h reaches infinite explanatory variables that are closer to the dependent variable have a stronger influence than those that are farther away the geographic weighted regression tool was utilized in the arc gis platform the gwp is considered as the dependent variable and all the above thematic maps lithology slope soil lulc lineament density drainage density and geomorphology as explanatory variables 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater prospect zones the groundwater prospect map showed that majorly the western and eastern sections of the study area have high potential resembling the excellent groundwater prospect zone geomorphologically the excellent potential zones consist of pediplain area with a lower slope gradient away from the rugged topography in the northern part hence it indurates infiltration with a minor rate of runoff further these excellent zones consist of sandstones and siltstones which support the percolation of rain water which might form good aquifer zones however the northern part comprises sandstone lithology but has a relatively higher slope gradient which demarcates higher runoff of rainwater causing a lower infiltration rate hence the northern parts are poor groundwater potential zones moreover the western parts comprise of major lineaments controlling the groundwater flow and infiltration tracts in the area further the lulc map shows a distinctive usage of agricultural land in the excellent potential zones different from the barren scrub land in the northern part as being poor groundwater zones the groundwater potential index gwpi map of the study area has been prepared using mcda fig 7 based on gwpi values groundwater prospect zones are classiﬁed into ﬁve groups table 11 the results of this study show that about 12 24 and 19 41 of the area had an excellent and very good groundwater potential respectively table 11 the overlay analysis results were compared to the sources present in the study area fig 8 pumping well discharge maps and a static water table depth to the groundwater below the ground surface were produced using existing pumping wells fig 9 a fig 9b bevan et al 2005 defined the water table level as the surface at which pore pressure equals atmospheric pressure water table level indicates hydraulic gradients of any point hence it can be useful to identify the area with high groundwater potential the pumping well discharge maps and depth to the groundwater below the ground surface generated from pumping wells using the kriging method of interpolation indicated that the eastern portion of the study area generates the highest discharge and also has the shallowest water level fig 9a fig 9b 4 2 groundwater map validation to validate the groundwater prospect zones the prediction accuracy is calculated and the cohen s kappa statistic was applied by comparing the existing groundwater well locations cohen 1960 cohen s kappa coefficient κ can be defined as follows 3 k o a a c 1 a c where oa is the sum of true positive and true negative divided by the total number of data and ac can be calculated as in equation 4 4 ac p n p n n n n n where p is the sum of true positive and false positive n is the sum of false negative and true negative and p is the sum of true positive and false negative thus the cohen s kappa coefficient shows the strength of agreement between two variables as in table 12 the data from 30 pumping wells were extracted to perform statistical analysis of cohen s kappa statistic the cohen s kappa coefficient computed from the existing well data is 0 767 which falls under the good strength of agreement hence the ahp method is a good technique in terms of groundwater prospects water resource management and engineering studies have used the ahp technique as a structured method of analysing multiple parameters for decisions related to earth environmental issues based on the assigned weights of decision criteria aggarwal et al 2009 bhatnagar and goyal 2012 kaliraj et al 2019 therefore the results of groundwater potential maps obtained using the ahp method have been considered a good prediction 4 3 geographic weighted regression results the geographic weighted regression gwr analysis result is determined in the terms of r square r2 values r2 is a measure of goodness of fit observed vs predicted it may be interpreted as the proportion of dependent variable variance standard deviation accounted for by the regression model brunsdon et al 1996 fotheringham and brunsdon 1999 these studies included mapping of environmental issues robinson et al 2011 estimation of above ground biomass propastin 2012 loss of forest areas pineda jaimes et al 2010 remote sensing kamarianakis et al 2008 and urban studies li et al 2010 its value varies from 0 0 to 1 0 with higher values being preferable brunsdon et al 1996 fotheringham and brunsdon 1999 the gwr analysis in the present research gives a resultant range of r2 from 0 26 to 0 66 supplementary figs 1 7 the dominant determinant factor influencing the groundwater recharge in the khadir region is the soil with a r2 value of 0 66 followed by the slope 0 65 lulc 0 62 geomorphology 0 58 lineament density 0 31 drainage density 0 3 and lithology 0 26 5 conclusion groundwater is a critical resource for the country s long term growth and water resource management remote sensing and gis techniques have been used to evaluate groundwater potential zones in the present study area of the khadir region of kachchh by utilising several thematic maps such as lithology soil land use lineament density drainage density etc the weight of thematic layers was ranked based on their groundwater contribution characteristics and were overlaid and merged for groundwater potential zone construction from our observations the following conclusions can be drawn the groundwater prospect map of the study area showed that majorly the western and eastern part of the study area has high potential in which about 12 24 and 19 41 of the area have an excellent and very good groundwater potential respectively based on the computed values of cohen s kappa coefficient and the analytical hierarchy process ahp method for the existing well data suggests that the 0 767 cohen s kappa coefficient falls under the good strength of agreement which can be implemented as a good technique in terms of groundwater prospect in terms of groundwater recharge the soil theme is the most determinant factor impacting groundwater recharge in the khadir island followed by slope lulc and geomorphology according to the gwr results supplementary figs 1 7 hence groundwater development activities can be carried out in such high groundwater potential zones of the landscape to increase supplementary irrigation and domestic use productivity 5 1 impact of the study this site specific study is very useful for water resources planners by indicating the potential areas for development the methodology can be applied effectively in other parts of the country for the long term utilization of groundwater resources and development purposes as well as for improving groundwater recharge this remote area of northern kachchh holds a significant indus saraswati civilization site of dholavira which was recently declared a world heritage site by unesco considering the infrastructural development and future need for exploration of surface and groundwater with the potential recharge zones this study may prove extremely useful further studies can be carried out on groundwater hydro chemistry and its suitability for domestic and irrigation purposes and also on the groundwater recharge amount and its relation to precipitation amount declaration of competing

11737,the ever increasing presence of microplastics in many environmental components has been a cause of worry for humanity due to their small size and potential health risk since the last decade numerous studies have been conducted on the prevalence and dispersion of microplastics however at present there aren t any systematic studies on fate and transport of microplastics that consider multimedia environmental systems and their mitigation measures also there are limited studies on the routes through which humans are exposed to microplastics in this review about 380 articles were evaluated to uncover the extent of microplastic fate transport and pollution in different environmental components including soil freshwater marine and atmosphere as well as its effect on different ecosystems we gave special attention to understanding many routes and sources of microplastics intended for human consumption and their consequences on human health furthermore we tried to emphasize on the different methods used for sampling extraction identification and characterization of microplastics along with associated benefits and limitations this study highlighted existing knowledge and gaps in the remediation of microplastics on this basis the bottleneck and current challenges have been proposed graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastic pollution quantification of microplastic fate and transport health risk remediation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction plastics are long chain polymers composed of carbon oxygen hydrogen silicon and chloride and are made from natural gas oil and coal shah et al 2008 currently plastics have been used as an excellent material in today s day to day life they are used in almost all applications such as packaging automotive aquaculture fisheries biomedical shipping agriculture building and construction telecommunications furniture transportation plumbing personal care products textiles clothing etc ogunola et al 2018 plastics have even replaced more conventional materials such as glass and metals because of their lightweight nature malleability durability flexibility low cost persistency thermal and electrical insulation corrosion resistance high strength to weight ratio and waterproof properties pellini et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a ram and kumar 2020 the global plastic production reached 359 million tonnes in 2018 an increase of 46 5 compared to 2008 and 3 2 compared to 2017 plastics europe 2019 mao et al 2020 among all the countries china generates the most 30 followed by canada mexico usa 18 and europe 17 tiwari et al 2020 however plastics are emerging persistent and ubiquitous contaminants that could harm the growth and development of organisms induce oxidative stress weaken the immune system reduce lifespan and impact fertility chen et al 2020a microplastics are formed when plastics degrade or break down into smaller fractions under physical chemical mechanical and biological actions plastics europe 2019 lestari et al 2020 these plastics are microscopic and pervasive particles and they have been continuously increasing in the environment due to their continuous production non biodegradable persistent and long life span in the environment chamas et al 2020 thus they have been declared as one of the ten emerging contaminants in the united nation environmental programme unep year book 2014 that could potentially threaten human health and other organisms in all biomes constant et al 2020 therefore the accumulation of microplastics in environmental components is gaining attention and becoming a major concern among global researchers and scientists the abundance of microplastics in lakes rivers estuaries oceans and beaches worldwide has been documented in highly populated areas or areas with intensive anthropogenic activities he et al 2020 because of the small size microplastics can enter the human food chain through the consumption of seafood as well as other terrestrial food items and subsequently can have impact on human health bondelind et al 2020 rist et al 2018 chatterjee and sharma 2017 barboza and gimenez 2015 secondly plastic waste disposal in municipal waste disposal systems produces poisonous leachate which can contaminate water and soil rajmohan et al 2019 kataria et al 2022 unprecedented use of plastic products and improper waste management techniques will continue to increase plastic waste geyer et al 2017 the irresponsible behaviour of people regarding the use of plastics dumping plastic products improper management systems and associated harmful impacts have turned the planet into a plastic planet chatterjee and sharma 2019 despite so many studies on different aspects of microplastics pollution its effect on human health has recently come into the picture humans consume seafood in the form of fish and shellfish marine molluscs oyesters shrimp mussels etc these marine species are contaminated with microplastics thus affecting human health however there is no direct evidence of human health risk due to ingestion of microplastics rahman et al 2020 also there are not many studies on the effects of microplastics on human health and the knowledge regarding the harmful impacts of microplastics on human health and the routes through which humans are exposed are still in their infancy stages moreover plastics release fatal organic pollutants like dioxins and bisphenol a which can cause cancer and other neurological damages including impairment of the reproductive system rajmohan et al 2019 kataria et al 2022 thus microplastics pollution is a great threat to the environment and all living beings a proper understanding of this aspect is crucially needed therefore the present study provides up to date and comprehensive information on the prevalence of the microplastics in various environment matrices including fresh water atmosphere soil marine and food chain the major emphasis was on various sources of microplastics and their routes to humans along with associated possible health risks in addition detailed information on microplastics sampling and quantification techniques as well as updates on various microplastics recovery or removal techniques were covered in order to fully understand the impact of microplastics in soil and aquatic ecosystems this study was concluded with mitigation strategies current challenges and future perspectives of microplastics pollution 1 1 type of plastics different types of commercially available synthetic plastic materials and their uses are shown in table 1 polymers such as polyethene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyvinyl chloride pvc polyurethanes polyethylene terephthalate pet polystyrene ps and polyester pes are examples of virgin plastics plastics europe 2018 andrady and neal 2009 they represent 90 of the total plastic produced worldwide espinosa et al 2016 the polymers such as pet pp pe pes pvc ps polyamide pa and nylon are commonly used to manufacture various plastic items and process food products sutton and sedlak 2017 the most popular plastic polymers used in packaging are pp pet low and high density polyethene ldpe and hdpe plastics europe 2018 pet is a potential human carcinogen but it is still used abundantly in producing packaging material drinking water bottles pipes insulation moulding plastic films etc karbalaei et al 2018 kataria et al 2022 polystyrene which is primarily used in manufacturing of bottles and lids containers and protective packaging has been found to cause chronic toxicity because it translocates in blood and interferes with reproductive disruption processes in marine filter feeders sun et al 2019 phthalates and polybrominated diphenyl ethers used to improve the fire resistance and plasticity of the plastics are also well known endocrine disrupting compounds edcs they have also been found in human bodies due to bioaccumulation sun et al 2019 1 2 type of microplastics microplastics are synthetic long chain and organic polymers that can be found in various ecosystems such as soils subsurface systems rivers lakes wetlands oceans and atmosphere kumar et al 2021a these polymers come in a wide range of particle sizes and densities that can be harmful to aquatic ecosystems animals and human beings razeghi et al 2021 microplastics are typically defined as plastic particles with at least one dimension under 5 mm au 2017 rillig et al 2017 or as any polymer with the largest dimension smaller than 5 mm or within a size smaller than 5 mm eerkes medrano et al 2015 anderson et al 2016 lestari et al 2020 microplastics can be large microplastic particles l mpp 1 5 mm or small microplastic particles s mpp 1 mm as well as microbeads fragments fibres pellets flakes sheets or foams plastics are also classified into different categories based on their size viz giant 1 m large 1 m medium 2 5 cm micro 5 mm and nano 0 1 μm elgarahy et al 2021 they are derived from natural and organic materials such as coal natural gas and crude oil by polymerization or polycondensation processes phuong et al 2016 microplastics are classified into two types based on their source primary and secondary primary microplastics are small plastic particles released directly into the environment by domestic and industrial effluents spills and sewage discharge or indirectly by runoff for example scrubbing agents used in cosmetics and biomedical uses plastic pellets accidently lost during production or handling oecd 2022 they are also manufactured as microbeads in industries and used in personal care products sandblasting media or raw materials for fabricating other products andrady 2017 schessl et al 2019 the secondary microplastics are formed in the environment as a result of the breakdown of larger plastic particles via several degradation mechanisms such as chemical and physical ageing uv radiation photo oxidation mechanical transformation via waves abrasion and biological degradation by microorganisms de sá et al 2018 ogunola et al 2018 they are further divided into two categories 1 those formed during the use of products such as from tyre abrasion and synthetic microfibers from clothing and other textile products and 2 those formed by the degradation and fragmentation of macroplastics that have been released into the environment oecd 2022 one of the primary causes of the global increase in microplastic pollution is the difficulty in removing them from environmental matrices due to their tiny size and low visibility auta et al 2017a 2 source of microplastics microplastics are heterogeneous substances with varying shapes sizes morphology polymer compositions and density duis and coors 2016 auta et al 2017a wang et al 2019 based on origin microplastics are classified into two classes primary and secondary 2 1 primary microplastics the primary microplastic source mainly includes industrial production units and domestic activities that release micro size plastic directly into the environment fig 1 auta et al 2017a primary microplastic levels in terrestrial soils and freshwater systems increase as a result of industrial processes such as the production of pharmaceuticals the blasting of plastics e g thermal cutting tire wear e g cars planes plastic pellets cosmetics insect repellent wastewater treatment hospital industries sewage sludge etc fendall and sewell 2009 guo and wang 2019 however domestic products or activities including hand cleaners nail polish facial cleansers shower bath gels scrubs shaving cream baby products hair colours insect repellents and sunscreen toothpaste etc release microplastics into the environment via domestic sewage or wastewater treatment auta et al 2017a primary microplastics are also produced during air spray or blasting during painting and polishing blasting acrylic melamine or polyester microplastic scrubbers and rust or paint remover hulls release a massive amount of microplastics into the environment 2 2 secondary microplastics secondary microplastics include fibers derived as a result of the deterioration of large plastics on land and in the sea these materials are disintegrated continually and released as microplastics into the environment by the action of solar radiation photodegradation wind waves mechanical water waves hydrolysis acidic and or alkali conditions chemical degradation and microorganism biodegradation huang et al 2020a malankowska et al 2021 sources of secondary microplastics are abundant and heterogeneous horton et al 2017 several factors such as climatic conditions temperature sunlight precipitation etc plastic properties size and density and chemical structure influence the breakdown process of microplastic debris natural weathering is the primary disintegration process which is accelerated by uv light exposure to plastic uv radiation exposure promotes polymer structural oxidation which leads to the breakdown of plastic intermolecular bonds andrady 2011 wagner et al 2014 physical factors such as wind abrasion fluctuation and turbulence also contribute to the production of microplastics barnes et al 2009 in addition parameters such as precipitation chemical composition soil and water ph and chemicals produced by microorganisms all have a role in the oxidative disintegration of large plastic particles law and thompson 2014 shim and thomposon 2015 the microorganisms are also significantly responsible for degrading large plastics into small microplastics by releasing some chemicals in terrestrial ecosystems these processes contribute to fragmentation surface abrasion and oxidative breakdown of microplastics therefore it is not an easy task to identify the exact source of microplastics in different environmental matrices the microplastics are diverse in the environment and their degradation is dynamic zhou et al 2020b low density plastic is widely used in mulching and greenhouse to improve compost quality and crop production these agricultural mulch films and compost formation processes contribute to microplastic accumulation in terrestrial soil huang et al 2020b municipal solid waste and its landfill sites also act as secondary microplastic sources contaminating the soil and groundwater system zhou et al 2020b the presence of microplastics in the aquatic ecosystem cause health problems and toxic impacts on aquatic organisms their persistent nature enhances the leaching accumulation and adsorption in the environmental matrix shim and thomposon 2015 2 3 fate and transport of microplastics in the environment microplastics are transported across vast distances due to their shape size buoyancy lightweight and durability via wind and water several studies have been published in which wwtp effluent wastewater treatment plants has been identified as a key route for directly transporting microplastics into aquatic and soil environments karbalaei et al 2018 large size microplastics and other particles can be retained in the mechanical screen and grit chamber during the early phases of the wwt process during the primary treatment process microplastics fibers settle down by gravity via the coagulation flocculation mechanism zhou et al 2021 in the secondary treatment process the microplastics encounter microbes which can affect microbial activity and are retained on activated sludge sludge generated by wwtps could be another possible route for microplastic transport from wwtps to the soil ecosystem eriksen et al 2014 auta et al 2017a plastic debris contributes significantly to secondary microplastics and transports microplastics in soil and marine ecosystems obbard et al 2014 the plastic debris gradually breaks down into microplastic and accumulates on the soil s top surface microplastics can enter the soil subsurface via agricultural processes precipitation cracks and soil organism activities he et al 2018 because of these processes microplastics may leach and percolate in deep soils with water eventually entering into groundwater rillig et al 2017 moreover soil organisms such as earthworms insects nematodes bacteria fungus algae etc influence microplastics transport and fate via ingestion redox and excretion process wang et al 2020c guo et al 2020 some studies reported that microplastics are also passed from the digestive system gut of soil organisms into the faeces and excreta the research found that microplastics contained in faecal pellets might be an indirect source of microplastics in the marine ecosystem duis and coors 2016 cole et al 2014 surface runoff and wind flow carry microplastic residue from soil into freshwater streams and marine ecosystems cole et al 2011 microplastics of different morphologies are continuously transported and settle in soil or sediment after being released into the atmosphere posing a problem to the human respiratory system microplastics can be found on beaches seabed sediments surface waters and in a wide range of marine creatures including sea birds fish bivalves mammals and crustaceans etc auta et al 2017a hou et al 2021 few studies have reported microplastic presence in remote areas and the continent of the earth where human activity is limited fendall and sewell 2009 guo and wang 2019 microplastics can be transported via marine flow and atmospheric fall its small size and low density play a significant role in the global distribution of microplastics in every ecosystem thus polar ice and marine sediments have become a global sink for microplastics obbard et al 2014 it has been predicted that among 269 million tonnes of particles found globally approximately 92 are microplastics this prediction proved that most microplastics are located in marine sediments as a sink while the amount of microplastics on the surface is less eriksen et al 2014 auta et al 2017a however it is uncertain how much microplastics has entered and is being preserved in the marine ecosystem since the beginning of the anthropogenic era 3 occurrence of microplastics in different environmental components the presence of microplastics has become a serious ecological concern in several environmental compartments on the earth even karst groundwater cannot avoid microplastic pollution panno et al 2019 also scientific studies confirmed the existence of microplastics even in the deepest oceans tallest mountains and poles walkinshaw et al 2020 researchers have emphasized on the detection and distribution of microplastics in diverse ecosystems such as soils land freshwater atmosphere and seas oceans in recent years fig 2 in this regard table 2 summarizes some notable findings on the presence of microplastics fibre fragments and particles in different environmental matrices different detection methods such as atr ftir microscopy nmr fluorescence sem edx etc have played an important role in characterizing microplastics in different components of the environment more details have been explained in section 4 3 1 microplastics in freshwater freshwater which is the primary source of drinking water for people is thought to be the potential source of microplastics exposure to humans novotna et al 2019 primary microplastics sources in freshwater are those of industrial origin and secondary microplastics which result from the breakdown of large plastic debris eerkes medrano et al 2015 horton et al 2017 the microplastics shape can also define the presence in different parts of river for example if microplastics are of fragment shape they easily float and are dominantly found on the water surface whereas if microplastics are fibres and pellets they settle at the bottom and are found in the sediment lestari et al 2020 the great pacific garbage patch also known as the pacific trash vortex is a massive accumulation of plastic on the surface waters of the central north pacific ocean plastic and floating trash come from the pacific rim which includes asia north america and south america the great pacific garbage patch contains 79 000 tons of plastic with large particle sizes from fishing lines nets hard plastics and films among other things rajmohan et al 2019 several factors affect the migration or transport of microplastics in freshwater including the water body size wind currents and particle density eriksen et al 2013 fischer et al 2016 free et al 2014 some investigations verified the existence of microplastics even in remote areas such as antarctica cincinelli et al 2017 and the arctic lusher et al 2015 central atlantic islands martins et al 2020 arabian gulf abayomi et al 2017 even in deep sea arctic sediments kanhai et al 2019 although the studies are limited several researchers have recently documented the presence of microplastic in freshwater including lakes ponds kart water rivers and streams as well as in sediments table 2 in asia especially in china and india microplastics has been reported in surface water in china freshwater studies have mainly focused on the eastern regions of china including the yangtze estuary xu et al 2018 minjiang jiaojiang and oujiang estuary zhao et al 2015 futuanhe river estuary and sha river estuary zhou et al 2018 and the pearl river estuary fok and cheung 2015 yuan et al 2019 investigated the microplastics in surface water and sediment of poyang lake china and the average concentration and estimated particles were 0 2034 g l and 226 particles l respectively ding et al 2019 reported that the average quantity of microplastic and estimated particles were 0 92 g l and 1020 particles l respectively in the wei river in china which was much higher than other lakes or rivers in china similarly some other researchers have also detected microplastics in lakes and rivers of china i e 0 57 g l in the sediment of tibet plateau zhang et al 2016 123 particles l in surface water and sediment of taihu lake su et al 2016 and 0 47 g l in the sediment of pearl river fok and cheung 2015 according to global modelling studies of world rivers the ganges river india is the second largest source of microplastic in coastal seas and oceans lebreton et al 2017 sarkar et al 2019 investigated the occurrence of different microplastics in the ganga river india sediment their abundance in river sediment was found in the range of 107 410 particles kg sruthy and ramasamy 2017 reported approximately 0 027 g l of small size 0 2 1 0 mm microplastics in sediments of vembanad lake india in north american regions microplastics have been found in the freshwater sources and sediments of the usa and canada anderson et al 2017 reported that the surface water of winnipeg lake canada was contaminated with 1 74 g l of microplastics and the estimated microplastics was 1933 particle l the canadian lakes and rivers were also contaminated with 0 50 g l of microplastics as reported by anderson et al 2016 similarly zbyszewski and corcoran 2011 also detected the microplastics in the sediments of lake huron in canada and the usa and their approximate concentration was 3500 particles l eriksen et al 2013 detected microplastics in the surface water 0 02 particles l of the great lake of the usa some researches in european nations revealed that microplastics infiltrate rivers and lakes according to dris et al 2015 the french river seine was polluted with microplastic contamination similarly microplastics have been found in the surface water and sediments of rivers and lakes in other countries including lake chiusi and lake bolsena in italy fischer et al 2016 surface water of flemish rivers in belgium slootmaekers et al 2019 and sediments of the kelvin river in the united kingdom blair et al 2019 the concentration of microplastics varied within different locations on the continent furthermore since microplastics settle in freshwater systems sediments are the principal sink of microplastics in rivers therefore their concentration in sediments are substantially greater than in water wang et al 2017 in aquatic environment microplastics are not biochemically inert and leach chemical additives called plasticizers these plasticizers have been introduced during manufacturing to impart various properties to the product like heat stabilization acid scavenging slip compounds flame retardants etc lechner 2020 although microplastics pollution on land is many times more than in the oceans the aquatic systems have received much scientific attention compared to their terrestrial counterparts de souza machado et al 2017 also microplastics act as a vector or carrier of toxic sponges for transporting chemicals or pollutants by absorbing or adsorbing them amrutha and warrier 2020 microplastics can absorb and concentrate hydrophobic persistent organic pollutants pops in water such as polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs as well as inorganic pollutants such as heavy metals due to their chemical structure talvitie et al 2017 metals and microorganisms have also been reported to attach to microplastics bondelind et al 2020 3 2 microplastics in atmosphere the main sources of microplastics in the air are synthetic textiles erosion of synthetic rubber tires and urban dust prata 2018 other sources may include building materials industrial emissions plastic fragments from house furniture particle resuspension landfills traffic particles waste incineration tumble dryer exhaust synthetic particles used in horticultural soils and sewage sludge as fertilizer dris et al 2016 2017 liebezeit and liebezeit 2014 after being released into the atmosphere the diverse forms of microplastics are continually transported and settled in soil or sediment then there is a possibility of their translocation bioaccumulation and accumulation in trophic levels klein and fischer 2019 total microplastics in the environment are airborne microplastics in wet and dry atmospheric deposition dry deposition is described as gravitational deposits of microplastics floating in the air and gases and being settled by gravitational force they could be deposited on any ground surface or forest canopy that has been washed away by rains schlesinger and bernhardt 2013 wet deposition includes precipitation suspended particulate and dissolved particles separated by rainout and washout and dispersed in an environmental matrix zhang et al 2020d observed high concentration of microplastics in indoor environments 1 60 particles m3 and 1600 11 000 particles m2 day compared to the outdoors dris et al 2017 reported that microplastics concentrations in a paris apartment were between 1 and 60 fibres m3 higher than outdoors 0 3 1 5 fibres m3 the high detected concentrations of microplastics in indoor environments might be attributed to the higher flux of indoor microplastics sources and fewer particles being removed by dispersion processes than in outside environments vianello et al 2019 collected the indoor airborne microplastics samples from three apartments in aarhus denmark and reported that the most abundant types were polyester 59 92 followed by polyethene 5 28 nylon 0 13 and polypropylene 0 4 10 another thing is that the local wind blown debris was majorly involved in adding microplastics to the atmospheric deposits the predominant microplastics present in this atmospheric deposits were fragments fibres and particles dris et al 2016 cai et al 2017 the average concentration of microplastics in outdoor air varied within different regions of the world for example the deposition rate of atmospheric microplastics ranged from 175 to 313 particles m2 day in dongguan china cai et al 2017 however atmospheric transport may also carry microplastics to isolated mountains and marine regions bourzac 2020 a recent study allen et al 2019 on remote and pristine mountain regions french pyrenees confirmed the possibility of atmospheric microplastics being transported from urban regions to other remote areas where there is no anthropogenic activity approximately 366 particles m2 day of microplastics in the atmospheric deposition were observed in remote mountainous regions 3 3 microplastics in soil soil is the second largest depository of microplastics and transport routes through which microplastics pollution occurs in various surface and subsurface environmental matrices horton et al 2017 zhang and liu 2018 rillig 2012 a range of sources including industrial sources residential plastic waste sewage sludge air depositions and wastewater irrigation contaminate the soil ecosystem directly and indirectly zhou et al 2020a blasing and amelung 2018 once accumulated in soil microplastics may naturally breakdown and bioaccumulate in plants soil organisms and biodiversity chae and an 2018 de souza machado et al 2018 microplastics also act as a carrier and transfer various other soil pollutants to soil biota marine systems and other toxins to living organisms he et al 2018 exposed agricultural soil surfaces could be significant contributors of microplastics to the atmosphere or rivers through runoff microplastics in floodplains are likely to enter aquatic systems via heavy rains and floods o connor et al 2019 gao et al 2021 soil microplastics pollution in china requires special attention since large amount of plastics are produced consumed and discharged in china every year zhu et al 2019a microplastics are fragmented in soil depending on type of land application wang et al 2020c in recent years low density plastic has been used for mulching purpose in china s farmland which could be a key source of microplastics in agricultural soil sarker et al 2020 many of these mulches contain plastic waste residues that release harmful additives such as 50 120 mg phthalates kg leading to 74 208 higher phthalate concentrations than in non mulched soils in china kong et al 2012 recently zhou et al 2020a also quantified microplastics in different agricultural sites in the vicinity of hangzhou bay china and their average concentration was 310 items kg mulched soils contain an average of 571 pieces kg higher than non mulched soils i e 263 pieces kg and particle size varied from 1 to 3 mm in soil liu et al 2018 quantified both microplastics and mesoplastics in the deep and shallow soils of farmlands around shanghai china the average microplastics concentration in deep and shallow soil was 62 5 items kg and 78 0 items kg respectively mesoplastics were also prevalent with concentrations of 6 75 items kg and 3 25 items kg in shallow and deep soils respectively according to published research 63 to 430 thousand tons of microplastics are transported annually from farmland to ocean or surface water in europe and 44 300 thousand tonnes in north america guo et al 2020 many studies have shown that microplastics in soil from municipal landfills are due to the progressive disintegration of plastic waste dris et al 2016 guo et al 2020 rochman 2018 recent studies also evidenced microplastics occurrence in terrestrial ecosystems rillig et al 2017 horton et al 2017 fuller and gautam 2016 reported that soils around industrial locations in australia were polluted with 0 03 6 7 microplastics with quantities ranging from 300 to 67 500 mg kg microplastics have also been detected in home garden soils in campeche mexico where the mean concentration was 0 87 1 9 particles g lwanga et al 2017 furthermore scheurer and bigalke 2018 reported microplastics in nearly 90 of swiss floodplain soils at depths ranging from 0 to 5 cm they observed that the average microplastics content was 5 mg kg with the highest value of 55 5 mg kg from the metropolitan area of chennai india it was reported that the street dust samples had an average microplastics abundance of 227 94 91 37 per hundred grams patchaiyappan et al 2021 3 4 microplastics in marine environment microplastics are ubiquitous emerging marine pollutants that pose a global environmental threat shim and thomposon 2015 according to global model calculations 1 15 2 41 million tons of plastic garbage reach the ocean through rivers each year with the top 20 polluting rivers primarily located in asia accounting for 67 of the global total lebreton et al 2017 cosmetics pellets and air blasting media containing microplastics may infiltrate rivers through domestic and industrial drainage systems sharma and chatterjee 2017 wastewater treatment plants wwtps also contribute to the quantity of plastics in the ocean by discharging wastewater directly into the oceans or rivers which then carry them to the sea sun et al 2019 human activities such as tourism recreational and commercial fishing shipping and the marine industry release enormous quantities of plastics microplastics into the ocean in coastal regions cole et al 2011 plastics cannot biodegrade easily and may remain in the marine environment for long periods from the arctic to the antarctic an estimated 5 trillion pieces of plastics are floating in the world s oceans isobe et al 2015 matsuguma et al 2017 their distribution and fate in the ocean still need to be explored since microplastics are challenging to separate mechanically after they reach the environment some studies confirmed the presence of microplastics in surface waters to deep sea desforges et al 2013 sediments matsuguma et al 2017 and freshwater systems sarkar et al 2019 in offshore pacific waters microplastics concentration ranged from 8 to 9200 particles m3 it has been increasing continuously in other regions including west coast vancouver island straits of georgia and queen charlotte sound in british columbia canada desforges et al 2013 fauziah et al 2015 reported the occurrence of microplastics debris in sand beaches in peninsular malaysia a total of 2542 pieces of microplastics debris were found on all the studied beaches bagaev et al 2021 recently made several investigations on the presence of microplastics in russian seas seven of these investigations found that microplastics levels in water ranged from 0 6 to 336 000 items m3 and from 1 3 to 10 179 items kg in sediments other studies have been published on the distribution of microplastics fragments diameters of 5 mm in open seas including arctic polar waters lusher et al 2015 marginal seas isobe et al 2015 and coastal waters isobe et al 2017 lusher et al 2015 reported microplastics presence in surface top 16 cm and sub surface 6 m depth samples of arctic waters south and southwest of svalbard norway la daana et al 2018 reported the presence of microplastics in ice cores from remote areas of the arctic ocean isobe et al 2015 investigated microplastics concentrations in the east asian seas around japan finding a total particle count of about 1 72 million pieces km2 10 times higher than in the north pacific and 27 times higher than in the global oceans nel and froneman 2015 investigated the presence of microplastics in south african beach sediment and seawater where the microplastics concentrations varied from 340 7 to 4757 particles m2 and 204 5 to 1491 7 particles m3 respectively microplastics abundance in sediments was reported to be 37 1 42 7 items kg in the yellow sea china zhu et al 2018 250 300 items kg in edgbaston pool uk vaughan et al 2017 and 45 76 115 items km2 in the balearic islands spain ruiz orejón et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a quantified the amount of microplastics in deep sea ranging from 4601 m to 5732 m sediments in the western pacific ocean where the microplastics abundance averaged 240 items kg dry weight the microplastics were mainly fibrous in shape 52 5 blue 45 0 and less than 1 mm in size 90 0 matsuguma et al 2017 studied microplastics 5 mm in surface sediments from japan thailand and malaysia where the abundance of microplastics ranged from 100 pieces kg gulf of thailand to 1900 pieces kg a canal in tokyo bay microplastics suspended in the atmosphere are distributed in marine air and ocean surface wind movement and air dynamics could carry microplastics pollution from the terrestrial ecosystem to the ocean and marine atmosphere liu et al 2019b investigated the presence of atmospheric microplastics samps in the western pacific ocean for the first time in 2019 the abundance of samps was found to be 0 13 0 24 n m3 in the coastal region and 0 01 0 01 n m3 in the pelagic area samp abundance was 0 46 n m3 during the day and 0 22 0 19 n m3 at night about 90 of the microplastics were present as fibres and fragments microplastics abundance was also found in remote areas northwestern pacific i e 1 0 104 items km2 pan et al 2019 3 5 microplastics in the food chain according to the findings a wide range of aquatic organisms can consume and accumulate microplastics alfaro núñez et al 2021 numerous marine organisms including estuarine crustaceans fish intertidal shellfish mussels barnacles lugworms sea cucumbers amphipods and sea birds have been shown to consume microplastics digka et al 2018 provencher et al 2018 covernton et al 2019 iannilli et al 2019 mohsen et al 2019 xu et al 2020 after accidental or intentional consumption microplastics are transported through the epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract before being retained or egested through faeces microplastics can be fragmented in marine animals into even nanoplastics niederholtmeyer et al 2018 microplastics in the food chain seriously threaten marine ecosystems and human health microplastics contaminated food chains have harmed around 690 marine species carbery et al 2018 rothstein 1973 first reported microplastics pollution in the marine environment and its presence in the marine food chain after that numerous researches on microplastics pollution and microplastics fragment ingestion in marine organisms such as whales turtles fish snails and seabirds among others were published matsuguma et al 2017 retention of microplastics in the gastrointestinal tract can severely affect the organism s health by causing physical abrasions and or perforations decreasing nutrient uptake and reducing feeding activity because of the feeling of false satiety walkinshaw et al 2020 various studies confirmed that microplastics could also enter the food chain of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems most microplastics researches have focused on microplastics ingestion and thier analysis in the stomachs of marine organisms rochman et al 2013 lwanga et al 2018 quantified the microplastics in the terrestrial organisms waste such as earthworms cast and chicken faeces microplastics in earthworms casts and chicken faeces were 14 8 28 8 particles g and 129 8 82 3 particles g respectively the floating particles and microplastics fragments are readily swallowed and absorbed by small marine organisms which are subsequently directly fed by large organisms microplastics may therefore have an impact on the whole food web choy et al 2019 nelms et al 2019 panebianco et al 2019 found that microplastics were present in more than 50 of the snails i e a total of 425 specimens with an average of 0 92 1 2 particles snail the feeding habit of snails and their presence near agricultural fields have enhanced the exposure of microplastics contamination in the snails snails are a part of the human food chain also the reported studies on the microplastics existence in the food chain has become a major human health concern globally according to some studies the chlorinated polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs in tissue was high in birds with microplastics in their stomachs yamashita et al 2011 the larger microplastics can cause internal abrasion clogging of the digestive system and intestinal lesions cole et al 2013 wright et al 2013 ahrendt et al 2020 microplastics also exists in the soft tissues of marine organisms van cauwenberghe and janssen 2014 quantified microplastic in soft tissues of commercially grown bivalves mytilus edulis and crassostrea gigas during human consumption the average quantity of microplastics in m edulis and c gigas was 0 36 0 07 particles g wet weight and 0 47 0 16 particles g respectively 4 sampling identification and quantification of microplastics 4 1 sampling of microplastics one of the crucial procedures in the analysis of microplastics is sampling depending on the goals of the research different sampling techniques can be used for microplastics characterization because microplastics are so tiny accurate sampling methods are essential for producing high quality results as the microplastics distribution is heterogeneous large samples are more representative than small samples and can be further made smaller by homogenization random sampling is a sampling strategy that might be used to identify contamination in a site that is likely to be homogenous systematic grid sampling which divides up sample locations in a regular pattern may be utilized to verify the extent and hotspots of contamination the first point is selected randomly and the rest points are arranged in a well ordered pattern transect sampling is also a one dimensional systematic sampling that may be used to identify and verify the extensiveness of contamination it is used along with linear features such as roads unaligned grid sampling is another approach that integrates the utility of both random and systematic grid sampling a stratified sampling approach may be used to identify the contamination in a delineated sub area of the entire sampling region moller et al 2020 in riverine environments microplastics can be sampled by a dynamic or stationary sampling method in dynamic sampling trawls are pulled by boats the stationary sampling technique collects microplastics samples from small rivers campanale et al 2020 for microplastics sampling in sediments in freshwater bodies sampling is performed manually demonstrating an area and a depth now a days instead of manual sampling a corer with a specific diameter box corer and ekman or van veen grab corer can be referred in a known area for a required volume of material campanale et al 2020 microplastics of different colours sizes and polymers are separated and extracted after sample collection using a variety of techniques including physical separation density separation filtration magnetic separation electrocoagulation etc matrix removal techniques are utilized to take the organic matter out of the microplastics samples in order to get precise findings and cut down on processing time hanvey et al 2017 enzymatic digestion h2o2 oxidation and acid or alkaline digestion are a few typical processes used for organic matter removal from microplastics samples 4 2 identification and quantification of microplastic quantification is the counting and categorizing microplastics based on their size colour and type of polymers moller et al 2020 optical counting of microplastics is usually performed with a microscope but it has some limitations concerning accuracy visual counting may result in misreading microplastics and the risk of identifying non plastic particles as plastic due to the high diversification of polymers specification of the chemical composition of polymers is essential to assure accuracy generally the detection of microplastics can be categorized into two steps the first one is physical i e colour size and the second is chemical i e composition structure identification sun et al 2019 a combination of microscopy and spectroscopy may improve the accuracy of the optical counting some research proposes the hot needle test to reduce the risk of accurate plastic counting zhang et al 2018 suggested a method for identifying soil polymers after density separation with water the residues present in the supernatant are examined by comparing prior microscopic imaging after heating the sample at 130 c for 3 5 s liquefied plastics are recognized as thermoplastics however specific natural polymers melt at particular temperatures which reduces the feasibility of determining the exact polymer time the visual identification has been validated in numerous studies moller et al 2020 however it does not differentiate the type of plastic and is less suitable for particles with a diameter 50 μm zhang et al 2018 the different extraction methods are integrated into a chromatographic unit for quantitative and qualitative identification of plastic polymers pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry and thermal extraction desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry are mass based techniques while raman and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir are particle based techniques used for the identification of microplastics duumichen et al 2017 introduced thermal extraction desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry ted gc ms however ted gc ms is suitable for quick analysis of samples but is a destructive method this method does not require any pretreatment and the time required for the complete measurement of a sample is about 2 h a short time considering the sample mass and the depth of information gel permeation chromatography gpc is another method of size exclusion chromatography that uses organic solvents to separate analytes based on their sizes it is frequently used for the examination of polymers this technique is based on differences in molecular mass in which large molecules are excluded from the pores of the gels and are eluted first in addition to providing a complete assessment of the particles size shape and polymer distribution high temperature gpc also provides a qualitative study of stabilisers without the need for any visual sorting hintersteiner et al 2015 vibrational spectroscopy like raman or ftir is usually used for microplastics analysis as it allows error free identification of plastic polymers their spectra are used to identify several types of plastics by comparison with a spectral library corradini et al 2019 raman microspectroscopy identifies microplastics down to 500 nm pixel resolution it can be increased to 100 nm using silver colloid for surface enhanced raman spectroscopy lv et al 2020 while micro ftir spectroscopy identifies particles from 10 to 500 μm moller et al 2020 according to most studies ftir is an excellent approach for analyzing sediment samples to increase the precision of the data ftir can be combined with an optical microscope raman and ftir are both non destructive techniques atr ftir spectroscopy attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is also a fast and efficient approach for identifying polymers of plastic marine debris in marine water and biota jung et al 2018 scanning electron microscopy sem is also used to determine the polymer s size shape or morphology to overcome the constraints of a stereomicroscope sem is installed for the physical analysis of microplastics sem images of the external surface of microplastics makes it easy to differentiate between synthetic microplastics and many organic materials that can be found with microplastics cooper and corcoran 2010 energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds is used for elementary analysis to determine the chemical compositions of plastic particles however it would not be easy to access sem edx regularly as it is an expensive detection method and requires more time and effort to prepare the sample furthermore sem edx cannot distinguish coloured microplastics advanced and updated microscopic analysis such as plm polarized light microscopy can also be used to analyze pet pp and pe based microplastics a new method for analyzing size independent microplastics is proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy peez et al 2019 this method is capable of quantitative and qualitative analysis of samples containing polyethene polystyrene and polyethene terephthalate however this method is not cost effective as a result this method is inadequate for soil sample analysis microplastics can also be identified via thermogravimetric analysis it can be combined with differential scanning calorimetry or mass spectrometry for better results out of the above mentioned methods ftir microscopy is the most common approach found in microplastic research due to its exceptional reliability and easy application to analyze the microplastics size shape colour and morphology new methods such as sem edx ted gc ms gpc etc can be used alone or in combinations 5 effect of microplastics the worldwide presence of microplastics in the environment is regarded as an ecological hazard and a significant concern by scientists governments and policymakers li et al 2016 vaughan et al 2017 bergmann et al 2019 chen et al 2020a the existence of microplastics in living organisms is influenced by the interaction of biological and non biological factors and ecological security although the exact mechanism is unclear our understanding of the fate and impact of microplastics on the biosphere is critically needed 5 1 effect on soil ecosystem because of the persistent nature in the terrestrial environment microplastics may interact with flora and soil organisms according to kleunen et al 2020 microplastics may harm plants and their growth with concentrations of epdm ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber exceeding 8 v v can cause 50 mortality lc50 at concentration 13 v v the growth of two species leucanthemum ircutianum and prunella vulgaris had also been suppressed during interaction with 5 v v of epdm microparticles in soil microplastics could modify plant structure in various ways including changes in size shoot and root length number of leaves and colour kleunen et al 2020 khalid et al 2020 fig 3 illustrates microplastics exposure in the soil system and their transport and accumulation in plants and microorganisms similarly pflugmacher et al 2020 showed that 3 mm polycarbonate microparticles with 59 items kg concentration reduced lepidium sativum shoots and roots length the negative impact of microplastics on the growth of vigna radiata was reported by chae and an 2020 the seed germination and seedling are more sensitive to the microplastics bosker et al 2019 studied the impact of various microplastics concentrations 107 items ml and 104 items ml on seed germination of lepidium sativum and found that seed germination was significantly affected during the first 8 h of microplastics solution exposure small microplastics exposure can significantly alter the natural ecosystem lozano and rillig 2020 boots et al 2019 reported a remarkable reduction in root growth of lolium perenne with low density microplastics the plant roots directly encounter microplastics when sewage sludge as fertilizer and organic manures are applied watteau et al 2018 microplastics also affects the soil quality and nutrient cycle in the soil system zhou et al 2020b qi et al 2020 reported alteration in soil chemical characteristics including ph conductivity and c n ratio with ldpe and biodegradable microplastics yuanqiao et al 2020 observed a decrease in the water and nitrate holding capacity due to a high dose of microplastics 360 kg h m2 microorganisms such as mycorrhizal fungi phosphate reducing bacteria mineral reducing bacteria and nitrogen fixing bacteria in soil are essential for plant growth in some studies it is observed that microbial activity has been reduced during microplastics exposure which directly affects plant growth and crop production powell and rillig 2018 microplastics could alter mycorrhizal growth of fungi and comparative richness in the plant root system wang et al 2020c similarly chen et al 2020b found that polylactic acid pla affected the interaction between microbial community and soil particles it could also affect the mineralization and nitrogen fixation directly reducing root expansion and plant growth in addition it diminishes enzyme production such as urease glucosidase and phosphatase based on the available literature it can be assumed that exposure to microplastics directly or indirectly alters the natural ecosystem of soil including plants soil microorganisms and crops huang et al 2020b the impact of microplastics exposure and its mechanism is still mysterious due to limited literature notably plant feeder species or herbivores directly ingest atmospheric microplastics from the surface of plant leaves thus leading to a more prominent route to enter the food chain and reaching higher trophic levels dovidat et al 2020 5 2 effect on aquatic ecosystem microplastics and pharmaceuticals are classified as emerging contaminants that threaten aquatic ecosystems in the last few years many pharmaceutical products have been discharged into wastewater streams to enter the natural ecosystem microplastics associated with pharmaceuticals are more toxic to aquatic organisms li et al 2018a microplastics ingestion adsorption and interaction behaviour differ with aquatic organisms such as submerged plants phytoplanktons fishes and other top carnivores in the natural ecosystem allen et al 2017 as microplastics reach the aquatic system microorganisms such as microbial biofilm algae fungus and bacteria fragment them by establishing colonies hoellein et al 2014 wang et al 2020b the accumulated microplastics then colonize in biofilms which serve as a food source for aquatic organisms and eventually contaminate the food chain microplastics properties such as quantity particle size shape origin source and chemical composition are important in interaction and accumulation in the natural ecosystem yuan et al 2019 gutow et al 2016 exposure of zooplanktons to microplastics leads to a decreased growth cycle enhanced mortality ingestion capacity and even disturbing the coming generations besseling et al 2014 one of the studies confirmed that exposure to small sized microplastics caused a more significant toxic effect on various microalgae than large sized microplastics anbumani and kakkar 2018 huang et al 2020a notably larger sized microplastics can reduce the photosynthesis mechanism by blocking the sunlight whereas small sized microplastics affect the cell wall of the algae and destroy their internal structure huang et al 2020a when aquatic organisms consume microplastics laced with allied chemical contaminants these allied toxins are released into their tissues posing potential health risks campanale et al 2020 microplastics can easily capture industrial toxins and soil pollutants carry them to long distances and disperse them in aquatic and marine ecosystems li et al 2018a the mercury can be carried by microplastics to artemia nauplii also known as sea monkeys are small seawater crustaceans belonging to the artemiidae family and then enter the food chain at a higher trophic level tang et al 2019 toxic metal ions can also be transferred to other aquatic organisms including snails fish corals and amphibians via the food chain batel et al 2020 carbery et al 2018 in addition to the toxicity and impacts of microplastics their transport mechanism may affect the bioaccumulation of associated chemical contaminants in the aquatic organisms researchers have begun to understand the transport behaviour of plastic debris in aquatic ecosystems due to increased microplastic pollution teuten et al 2009 recent studies on plastic debris showed that the microplastic additives gradually leaches from waste and contaminates the aquatic system paluselli and kim 2020 it could also create several health problems such as toxicity endocrine disruption and mutations in the aquatic organisms capolupo et al 2020 5 3 effect on humans the exposure of microplastics to human health has become a serious global concern microplastics are ubiquitous in the environment and enters the human body predominantly via two pathways i e ingestion and inhalation its exposure can potentially cause adverse health problems in human beings liu et al 2019a wang et al 2020a humans are being exposed to microplastics pollution due to their packet food habits the exposure to microplastics and its health impacts on humans are currently unclear aquatic food products have been identified as the primary source of microplastics to human exposure huang et al 2020a the amount of microplastics particles in the food source and their transport from the food source to humans must be determined to assess the health risk of microplastics exposure some studies reported the presence of microplastics in different food products and resources including table salt karami et al 2017a beer kosuth et al 2018 wine prata et al 2020 sugar or honey gerd and elisabeth 2015 plastic tea bags hernandez et al 2019a and water bottles mason et al 2018 hernandez et al 2019a reported that a single tea bag releases about 11 6 billion microplastics and 3 1 billion nanoplastics in a cup of tea based on recent studies microplastics have been observed in commercial salts that are available in more than 120 brands worldwide zhang et al 2020c kim et al 2018 microplastics were also detected in drinking water sources such as tap and bottled waters koelmans et al 2019 recently schwabl et al 2019 reported nine types of microplastics in human faeces and their mean abundance was 2 particles g in a size range of 50 500 μm the presence of polyethylene terephthalate pet and polypropylene pp indicated the ingestion of microplastics from diverse food sources walkinshaw et al 2020 bouwmeester et al 2015 airborne microplastics exposure causes respiratory and lung problems in humans vianello et al 2019 reported that humans could inhale approximately 272 particles day from indoor air the inhalation of microplastics depends upon particle size generally 2 5 μm size particles are easily transported to the lung via respiratory tract wang et al 2020d plastics smaller than micro size are more toxic to neurons lungs and respiratory system jeong and choi 2019 wang et al 2020e reported the synergistic toxicity of microplastics and its associated bisphenol a on intestinal epithelial cells microplastics exposure causes cell toxicity by cellular oxidative stress microplastics exposure reduces lipid digestion due to the formation of microplastics oil droplets and inhibits enzyme activity during the digestion process tan et al 2020 human tissue can also uptake microplastics via endocytosis airways surface and gastrointestinal tract wright and kelly 2017 microplastic fibres can cause occupational health problems among workers studies among occupational nylon flock workers indicate that most workers faced several health risks such as increased lung cancer respiratory irritation occupational asthma coughing and lung capacity warheit et al 2001 about 4 of people who work in the nylon industry in the us and canada have these health problems boag et al 1999 wright and kelly 2017 5 4 transportation of microplastics to human the presence of microplastics in various environmental components has been observed worldwide such as surface water marine water freshwater seabed sediments beaches wastewater effluents ice aquatic organisms and their predators food products such as salt honey sugar bottled water plastic containers indoor and outdoor air etc table 2 rahman et al 2020 petersen and hubbart 2020 however their occurrence is not restricted to the source of their availability as microplastics can migrate over long distances via wind and water currents which mark their presence even in remote areas such as polar ice caps arctic and antarctic and mid oceanic islands walkinshaw et al 2020 the direct or indirect sources for microplastics transportation are destined for humans through ingestion and inhalation fig 4 5 4 1 ingestion the ingestion of food and water polluted with microplastics is the primary route for human exposure galloway 2015 and marine organisms top the list among the food microplastics can be ingested by various marine life via different processes barboza et al 2018 microplastics in marine organisms destined for human consumption have been widely reported wang et al 2020b zantis et al 2020 walkinshaw et al 2020 huang et al 2020a yao et al 2021 marine organisms ingest microplastics in two ways directly from their natural surroundings or indirectly via trophic transfer from prey and consuming contaminated feedstock barboza et al 2018 direct ingestion of microplastics is often a consequence of feeding strategy indirect ingestion or trophic transfer occurs when microplastics are confounded with prey barboza et al 2018 walkinshaw et al 2020 e g widely reported microplastics presence in the stomachs of blackmouth catshark galeus melastomus is attributed to bioaccumulation from their microplastics laden prey alomar and deudero 2017 the northern fulmars fulmarus glacialis contain plastic debris in their stomachs and are used as a bio indicator for ocean microplastics pollution terepocki et al 2017 numerous planktons crustaceans molluscs and echinoderms consume microplastics from their surroundings during feeding resulting in microplastics bioaccumulation in fish shrimp crabs and other seafood consumed by humans shichun et al 2019 huang et al 2020a daniel et al 2021 yao et al 2021 the highest concentration of microplastics 0 10 5 microplastics g is found in mollusks followed by crustaceans 0 1 8 6 microplastics g and fish 0 2 9 microplastics g karami et al 2017b numerous studies have found microplastics in a variety of marine life including molluscs crustaceans and finfish destined for human consumption jabeen et al 2017 walkinshaw et al 2020 wang et al 2020b zantis et al 2020 and these are among the most commonly caught marine species and farmed aquaculture species according to food and agriculture organization fao 2020 these data highlighted low biomagnification in the marine food chain and a higher risk to the members of lower trophic levels compared to the higher trophic level walkinshaw et al 2020 the large specific surface area and stability makes microplastics a suitable adsorbent for hazardous substances and pathogenic microorganisms their fine size could allow translocation to other body systems the dispersion throughout the whole body along with hazardous substances is a matter of great concern for human health wright and kelly 2017 pandey et al 2020 caruso 2019 polyethene polypropylene polyester and polystyrene are the topmost generated polymers worldwide plastics europe 2020 fibre and fragments of these microplastics are commonly detected in the digestive tract of fish wang et al 2017 zantis et al 2020 however reports regarding microplastics outside the digestive tract are currently scanty walkinshaw et al 2020 wang et al 2020b recently ragusa et al 2021 observed a diverse range of microplastics in the human placenta unfortunately they could not explain the mechanism of microplastics translocation to the bloodstream such as respiratory or the gastrointestinal system the transfer of microplastics from a lower trophic level to a higher trophic level was reported through the aquatic food chain huang et al 2020a such as waterbirds brookson et al 2019 penguins le guen et al 2020 seals hernandez et al 2019b humpbacked dolphins zhu et al 2019b beluga whales moore et al 2020 sharks maes et al 2020 and even humans schwabl et al 2019 the presence of microplastics in freshwater birds such as geese duck and loons was also confirmed holland et al 2016 reynolds and ryan 2018 another way through which microplastics are destined for humans is sea salt kim and song 2021 drinking water shen et al 2021c cold tea energy drinks beer shruti et al 2020a and food containers du et al 2020 fadare et al 2020 around 28 sea salt brands from 16 countries on six continents showed microplastics presence ranging from 0 to 1674 particles kg and sea salt is more contaminated with microplastics than rock salts and lake salts kim et al 2018 karami et al 2017a observed 1 to 10 microplastics kg of salt of 17 brands from 8 different countries and among the 72 extracted particles polymers share 41 6 followed by pigments 23 6 and amorphous carbon 5 50 and 29 1 remained unidentified recently vidyasakar et al 2021 compared microplastic concentrations in two major salt producing states in india the research found that salt of gujarat origin contained higher microplastics 46 115 particles 200 g than tamil nadu salt 23 101 particles 200 g which were polyethene polyester and polyvinyl chloride the microplastics presence in human drinking water such as raw water koelmans et al 2019 and bottled water makhdoumi et al 2021 is now an emerging issue the highest concentration of microplastics was recorded in beer 28 particles l followed by energy drink 7 particles l and cold tea 6 particles l and the predominant polymer types were polyamide and poly ester amide shruti et al 2020a after direct and hot water flushing du et al 2020 observed that microplastics varied from 3 to 29 pieces per take out food container of different polymer materials microplastics were prevalent in containers with rough surfaces they estimated that those who use take out food containers 4 7 times each week might consume 12 203 microplastics particles duckweed dovidat et al 2020 seagrass goss et al 2018 and mangrove li et al 2018a have all shown the potential to trap microplastics via various mechanisms they provide another route for microplastics to higher trophic levels through the terrestrial food chain cigarette butts comprise over 15 000 detachable strands of plastic fibres their disposal in the open leads to an estimated 0 3 million tonnes of waste entering the oceans yearly belzagui et al 2021 shen et al 2021b recently conti et al 2020 revealed the presence of nanoplastics and microplastics in edible fruits and vegetables purchased from markets in catania and first to evaluate the estimated daily ingestion by adults and children 5 4 2 inhalation more than 50 of secondary microplastics derived from land based anthropogenic activity are retained in the terrestrial environment bullard et al 2021 atmospheric fallout not only acts as the source of microplastics for water bodies ocean and inland and land but also as a direct source for humans by inhalation microplastics deposition rate average were measured in atmospheric fallout in different megacities such as paris france 110 96 m2 day dris et al 2016 dongguan city china 36 7 m2 day cai et al 2017 london uk 575 1008 m2 day wright et al 2020 hamburg germany 136 5 512 0 m2 day klein and fischer 2019 tehran iran 88 605 items 30 g dry dust dehghani et al 2017 and remote areas of the pyrenees mountains 365 m2 day allen et al 2019 this indicates that microplastics pollution has become a global issue mishra et al 2021 stanton et al 2019 observed 2 90 128 42 fibres m2 day in the dust sample collected from the roofs of university campus in nottingham uk and concluded that fibres of atmospheric fallout were of natural origin fibrous microplastics were the most prevalent shape observed in atmospheric fallout and they were preferentially carried over a longer distance more than 95 km than microbeads and they were easily inhaled by humans bullard et al 2021 fibres were dominant in microplastics in indoor 88 0 and outdoor 73 7 dusts from china liu et al 2019a however the physical characteristics of microplastics such as size shape density etc along with different meteorological conditions determined the travelling length of microplastics in the air synthetic textiles synthetic rubber tires and urban dust are the main source of microplastics in the air chen et al 2020a wang et al 2020d other outdoor sources include construction and building materials industrial emissions waste management practices such as incineration landfills and sewage sludge and transportation which is attributed to particles such as rubber tyres and road paints the indoor sources include particle fragments from house furniture paints and domestic use plastic based articles such as plastic containers wang et al 2020d the low dispersal mechanism in the indoor environment causes a higher concentration of microplastics 1600 11 000 particles m2 day than outdoors zhang et al 2020d therefore children are more vulnerable as a result of direct inhalation and ingestion through the mouth via dirty toys and fingers contaminated with settled microplastics and dust carrying microplastics dehghani et al 2017 according to liu et al 2019a children in major chinese cities inhaled an average geometric mean of 17 300 ng kg bw average body weight of microplastics derived from polyethene terephthalate daily zhang et al 2020b collected 286 indoor dust samples from 12 different countries and observed polyethene terephthalate based microplastics ranging from 38 to 120 000 μg g whereas polycarbonate based microplastics ranged from 0 11 1700 μg g the median daily intake of polyethene terephthalate based microplastics by infants was in the range of 4000 150 000 ng kg bw day however the atmospheric transport mechanism of microplastics is still unclear and inhalation of microplastics is the least explored field petersen and hubbart 2020 rahman et al 2020 can güven 2021 wet deposition rainfall and snowfall is a major event associated with atmospheric microplastic accumulation and removal microplastics were elevated with high rainfall i e 2 34 particles m day with 0 0 2 mm of rainfall and 11 355 particles m day with 2 5 mm of rainfall dris et al 2016 xia et al 2020 observed a positive correlation r2 0 94 between rainfall and microplastics concentration in lake donghu china and reported that microplastics ranged from 7 4 to 29 6 items l with a dominance of size 2 mm fibre shape and transparent colour snowfall is responsible for microplastics deposition in urban and remote e g the arctic terrestrial land and the ocean zhang et al 2020e bergmann et al 2019 recently observed microplastics deposition ranging from 190 154 103 particles l and 0 14 4 103 particles l in melted snow collected from europe and the arctic respectively abbasi and turner 2021 recorded 16 000 microplastics retrieved from filtered washes of hand and face skin head hair and saliva of humans n 2000 exposure time of 24 h the maximum microplastics were from head hair 7000 or on an average 3 5 microplastics individual day and minimum from saliva about 650 or on average 0 33 microplastics individual day males had almost twice the amount of microplastics as compared to females a high concentration of microplastics on head hair can be correlated with atmospheric fallout recently covid 19 attributed to the use of facemask which increased their consumption and production across the world and have introduced new risks to human health and environmental challenges by adding vast amounts of polymers such as polypropylene polyurethane polyacrylonitrile polystyrene polycarbonate polyethene or polyester in the environment fadare and okoffo 2020 aragaw 2020 the who estimates that approximately 89 million medical masks are required monthly to respond to covid 19 who 2020 fadare and okoffo 2020 microplastics are now regarded as an emerging component of air pollution due to their inhalation and interaction with other pollutants such as heavy metals mercury lead pahs pesticides ddt hexachlorobenzene pharmaceuticals product etc zhang et al 2020e puckowski et al 2021 6 removal recovery of microplastics when compared to the rural environment the urban environment contains a large amount of microplastics and common practices such as domestic waste disposal street washing and rain runoff transport microplastics into the sewer system where they end up in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps bilgin et al 2020 the removal and or recovery of microplastics from wwtps can significantly reduce their amount to be discharged into the natural environment such as water bodies usually the final disposal site further reducing their availability for bioaccumulation and transfer to higher trophic levels such as a humans 6 1 microplastics recovery from wwtp the recovery rate of microplastics in conventional wwtps including preliminary primary and secondary stages was 88 and can be enhanced to 99 9 by adding tertiary stage in wwtps sun et al 2019 iyare et al 2020 the removal of microplastics is dependent on the type of unit operation and unit process the majority of microplastics in wwtps are removed through screening grit removal grease removal skimming sedimentation preliminary and primary treatment activated sludge secondary treatment and membrane bioreactor mbr rapid sand filter rsf disc filter df dissolved air flotation daf ultrafiltration uf reverse osmosis ro gravity filter etc tertiary treatment fig 5 overall the preliminary treatment for microplastics removal is a function of the nature and functioning of unit operations liu et al 2021 the microplastics removal efficiency of any unit operation is strongly influenced by the microplastics concentration and nature such as shape size and density the removal efficiency of microplastics is low in a single unit operation however the combination may improve removal efficiency generally grit and grease treatment exhibits poor removal efficiency for microplastics liu et al 2021 but a recent study revealed 69 79 removal efficiency by screening and grit treatment ziajahromi et al 2021 the grease skimming process performs better for low density and relatively large microplastics that easily float during flotation sun et al 2019 bilgin et al 2020 aerated grit chamber with primary settling tank exhibited 40 7 removal efficiency liu et al 2019c the combination of screening grit and grease processes skimming and settling removed a considerable portion of microplastics load ranging between 32 to 98 talvitie et al 2015 hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 sun et al 2019 flotation and sedimentation are two popular unit operations used to remove microplastics and their efficacy depends on the microplastics shape size and density the flotation exhibited 59 removal efficiency for microplastics with low material density 1 g cm3 relatively large size 1 5 mm and flat shapes e g films conversely sedimentation rapidly removed the microplastics 91 removal efficiency with high material density 1 1 g cm3 and relatively large structures e g fragments moreover neither flotation nor sedimentation was the primary mechanism for the removal of microplastics with small sizes 1 mm and densities near water 1 g cm3 bilgin et al 2020 the conventional secondary treatment which includes biological reactors aeration tanks trickling filters etc and settling tanks could not reduce the significant microplastic load as they were not developed primarily for microplastics removal iyare et al 2020 zhang and chen 2020 iyare et al 2020 observed that biofiltration was more effective than trickling filters and solids contact tanks the primary sedimentation tank and aeration tank with clarifier showed only 33 75 and 20 07 removal efficiency respectively murphy et al 2016 individual aeration tanks had a removal efficiency of 79 gundogdu et al 2018 which increased to 95 6 when the aeration tank was used as a secondary unit operation in the activated sludge process michielssen et al 2016 the full scale conventional activated sludge process removed 86 of microplastics pittura et al 2021 modern operation units in wwtps such as sequential batch reactor sbr aerobic membrane bioreactor mbr anaerobic membrane bioreactor and disc filter df pore size 20 μm exhibited 99 2 lee and kim 2018 99 9 talvitie et al 2017 99 4 michielssen et al 2016 98 5 talvitie et al 2017 removal efficiency for microplastics respectively the a2o aerobic anoxic aerobic method was unsuitable for microplastics removal due to its poor removal efficiency 16 9 and significant sludge return jiang et al 2020 the tertiary treatment technologies are specific but membrane based technologies for microplastics removal exhibit the best performance some common tertiary techniques which reduce significant microplastics load are rapid sand filter 97 98 9 talvitie et al 2017 hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 granular sand filtration 97 2 michielssen et al 2016 ozone 99 2 hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 and membrane disc filter 99 1 hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 rapid sand filter technology can fragment microplastics into smaller particles sol et al 2020 ziajahromi et al 2017 demonstrated poor microplastics removal efficiency of ultrafiltration 41 6 and reverse osmosis 25 shen et al 2021a demonstrated significant removal efficiency of 96 for granular polyethene microplastics 10 μm and fibrous polyamide microplastics 100 μm by aluminosilicate filter media modified by cationic surfactant the results of a full scale wastewater treatment plant in eastern china using mbr and an oxidation ditch in a parallel system showed that membrane filtration is more efficient in microplastics removal mbr removed 99 5 of microplastics from influent whereas oxidation ditch removed 97 lv et al 2019b mbr effectively removes small microplastics 100 m and nanoplastics however the smaller size of the microplastics makes the filtration process more complex and expensive due to membrane scaling and fouling malankowska et al 2021 which demands improvements in this aspect although daf had a higher removal efficiency for low density microplastics sol et al 2020 the overall removal efficiency was insignificant even when combined with flocculants and surface modifiers sturm et al 2021 the microplastics removed by daf varied from 43 8 to 68 9 wang et al 2021 sarkar et al 2021 used a pulse clarifier to remove more than 85 of microplastics from drinking water treatment plants according to the preceding discussion most of the microplastics in wwtps are removed retained by skimming sedimentation and tertiary filtration however these technologies are not originally developed for microplastics allowing a large portion of microplastics to water bodies furthermore sludge retains more microplastics and serves as a source of microplastics by releasing microplastics into the environment during conventional sludge management practices such as landfilling miri et al 2021 the technologies designed explicitly for microplastics removal are still in the preliminary stages of research developing new technologies and or upgrading existing techniques to address microplastics released into the environment from wwtps might be a viable option ma et al 2019 studied the polyethene based microplastics removal from drinking water systems using coagulation fe based coagulant followed by an ultrafiltration process they found that the individual conventional coagulation process fe based coagulant had a nonsignificant microplastics removal efficiency of 13 indicating that the individual coagulation process was insufficient for microplastics removal however a combination of al based coagulant and polyacrylamide pam enhanced the coagulation performance it increased the removal efficiency from 13 to 91 for particles size 0 5 mm and reduced membrane fouling during ultrafiltration recently zhou et al 2021 reported that polyaluminium chloride pac was better than ferric chloride fecl3 in the removal of polystyrene ps and polyethene pe microplastics ye et al 2021 fabricated two types of bubble propelled iron oxides mno2 core shell micromotors and tested them under the external magnetic field to remove microplastics the fe2o3 mno2 micromotor separates 10 of suspended microplastics from the polluted water in 2 h wang et al 2020f compared the filtration characteristics of four agricultural waste based biochar and sand to immobilize uniformly graded microplastics spheres the findings showed that 10 μm diameter microplastics spheres were immobilized to a greater extent 60 80 on all four biochars than on similar grain sized sand filters after examining sem images they proposed three mechanisms of immobilization of microplastics spheres on biochar stuck trapped and entangled because microplastics are hydrophobic they can be removed using the froth flotation process microplastics with higher density larger size and lower concentration were removed from the waste stream by froth flotation cationic species such as potassium sodium and calcium did not affect the removal of microplastics at an aeration volume of 5 4 ml min and al3 concentrations froth dose of 28 mg l froth flotation removed 100 microplastics zhang et al 2021b 6 2 electrocoagulation currently electrocoagulation has been used to effectively remove dyes heavy metals and clay particles with 80 removal efficiency perren et al 2018 at an initial ph between 3 and 10 about 90 of polyethene microbeads were removed from artificial wastewater and maximum removal efficiency was observed to be 99 24 at a ph of 7 5 perren et al 2018 shen et al 2022 evaluated the efficiency of electrocoagulation for the recovery of four diverse microplastics they observed a maximum recovery of 93 2 for polyethene 91 7 for polymethylmethacrylate 98 2 for cellulose acetate and 98 4 for polypropylene at ph 7 2 the aluminium anode performed better than the iron anode with an overall 80 recovery of microplastics in the ph range of 3 10 the electrocoagulation exhibited appreciable removal efficiency for fibre microplastics than granular microplastics the microplastics removal efficiency positively correlated with electrolyte concentration and applied voltage density the optimized conditions were the electrolyte concentration of 0 05 m ph of 7 2 applied voltage density of 10 v and al anode elkhatib et al 2021 employed electrocoagulation to remove commercial polyester microplastics from synthetic solutions and wastewater samples in synthetic solution the recovery of polyester microplastics was about 99 at ph 4 and 7 and current densities of 2 88 and 8 07 ma cm2 in wastewater samples 96 5 of microplastics 92 2 of chemical oxygen demand and 88 8 of thermotolerant coliform colonies were removed a 30 min of electrocoagulation using aluminium electrodes followed by centrifugation removed 90 of microplastics floc kim and park 2021 microplastics characteristics such as size shape and density as well as electrocoagulation process components such as initial ph coagulant dose coagulant nature and flocculant aids had a significant impact on the electrocoagulation process s efficiency and must be optimized for the practical application of microplastics removal 6 3 sol gel process the sol gel process is a chemical method for producing a highly crosslinked solid of an inorganic organic macromolecule by sequential hydrolysis of the precursor in acidic or basic media followed by polycondensation of the hydrolyzed products n alkyl substituted chlorosilanes are commonly used as precursors due to their high reactivity with water hurkes et al 2014 in 2017 herbort and schuhen proposed a host guest relationship for removing microplastics from water by agglomeration utilizing silicon based precursors the aforementioned technique included the fabrication of an inclusion unit inorganic organic macromolecules and then a capture unit which was then combined to create an inclusion compound and alkoxy silyl presence which provided the necessary 3 d network the sol gel process provides structured composite silica gels which are used to capture micro beads that can be separated by simple separation techniques such as a sand trap these capture units can be further utilized for energy generation the hydrophobic stressors microplastics trapped in hybrid silica gel increased their volume allowing easy filter separation compared to granular activated carbon herbort et al 2018 synthesized diverse bioinspired alkoxy silyl functionalized molecules and subsequently generated agglomerate via sol gel process which was 666 times more in the volume of the original particles that allowed cost effective separation the various alkyl trichlorosilane exhibited different characteristics for localization and fixation of microplastics based on alkyl groups as they significantly influenced the reaction rate and agglomeration behaviour the intermediate alkyl group between 3 and 5 carbon atoms was best suited for polyethene pe and polypropylene pp mixture removal however long alkyl groups 8 or 8 carbon atoms were ineffective to localized microplastics which ultimately caused a reduction in microplastics removal sturm et al 2020 further microplastics chemical composition surface chemistry and physical interaction with the organosilanes play an essential role in the removal process the removal efficiency of microplastics was 76 4 and 46 3 for n butyltrichlorosilane and iso octyltrichlorosilane respectively however large amounts of residues were left dissolved in water pe x abcr eco wasser 3 0 p e x can be employed on a technical scale since no dissolved residue was found removing the risk of organosilanes entering the environment sturm et al 2021 6 4 dynamic membranes and membrane bioreactor in recent years dynamic membranes gained significant attention due to low energy consumption and no demand for extra chemical because pollutants in wastewater itself make the filter layer which is easy to clean and exhibits potential for the removal of low density microplastics lu et al 2016 li et al 2018b li et al 2018b evaluated the practicability of dynamic membranes for microplastics removal and observed that the dynamic membrane was formed in a very short time on the 90 μm supporting mesh and was able to operate in low transmembrane pressure 70 mm 180 mm of water head and total filtration resistance 2 89 10 9 m to 6 52 10 9 m microplastics removal using dynamic membrane technology could be energy efficient however filter blockage construction and operational cost should be thoroughly evaluated when utilizing an extra unit for microplastics removal membrane bioreactor mbr has shown superiority over conventional activated sludge process asp mbr requires less operation space minimum sludge generation significant improvement in the overall efficiency of wastewater treatment and is easy to combine with the conventional biological treatment process and can be a potential replacement for secondary sedimentation and tertiary filtration lares et al 2018 observed better removal of microplastics by mbr 99 3 compared to the conventional activated sludge process 98 3 a combination of upflow granular anaerobic sludge blanket uasb and anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr removed 94 of microplastics with 87 of fibres and 100 of particles pittura et al 2021 lv et al 2019b compared to the membrane bioreactor efficiency with oxidation ditch in a full scale wwtp of eastern china the influent 40 microplastic were of size 500 μm and 29 between 62 5 and 125 μm in terms of plastic mass the membrane bioreactor exhibited 99 5 removal efficiency than the oxidation ditch 97 while based on the numbers for microplastics it was 82 1 for the former and 53 6 for the latter microfiltration membrane modules in mbr eliminated considerable amounts of microplastics 300 μm in size which are the most common microplastics in surface water auta et al 2017a the integration of submerged flat sheet uf membranes with mbr retained up to 99 4 of influent microplastics talvitie et al 2017 lares et al 2018 however mbr process based sludge retains a large amount of microplastics that demand further treatment which increases overall treatment costs membrane fouling is another major hurdle that hurts membrane fibres and increases maintenance costs maliwan et al 2021 operated sequencing batch mbrs for the diverse feed of microplastics for 124 days they observed that the presence of microplastics decreased floc size in sludge floc hydrophobicity and floc negative zeta potential the decrease in molecular size and increase in the extracellular polymeric substance eps concentration further facilitated the divalent cation ca2 and mg2 uptake by microplastics in contrast to the control a 4 month operation of sequencing batch mbrs did not experience severe cake fouling 7 degradation of microplastics microbial degradation of microplastics in different environments is an integrated process with physicochemical factors microplastics serve as a supporting material for the growth as well as carbon and energy source for microbes microbes in their pure culture bacteria and fungi and consortia are commonly studied for microplastics degradation the methods reported for microplastics degradation assessment can be grouped into three categories 1 those focus on the elimination of small molecules 2 those focus on chemical changes hydrophobicity functional groups in the polymer structure and 3 those focus on physical changes tensile strength surface morphology crystallinity etc in material properties mass loss carbon dioxide evolution and gel permeation chromatography methods assess the degradation based on bond cleavage nuclear magnetic resonance nmr infrared ir spectroscopies contact angle assess biodegradation by observing changes in chemical functionality dynamic mechanical analysis dma thermal analysis surface analysis scanning electron microscopy sem and atomic force microscopy afm assess biodegradation based on changes in materials properties chamas et al 2020 7 1 degradation by bacteria bacteria in pure culture at laboratory condition is commonly explored for microbial mediated degradation of microplastics due to easily probe metabolic pathways impacts of environmental variables and changes in microplastics during the degradation process auta et al 2017b observed the degradation ability of bacillus cereus and bacillus gottheilii for polyethylene pe polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp and polystyrene ps isolated from the mangrove sediments in peninsular malaysia the calculated weight loss percentages of the microplastic particles by b cereus after 40 days were 1 6 6 6 and 7 4 for pe pet and ps respectively b gottheilii recorded weight loss percentages of 6 2 3 0 3 6 and 5 8 for pe pet pp and ps respectively the common genus screened for microplastic degradation included bacillus rhodococcus bacillus gottheilii enterobacter asburiae bacillus subtilis chelatococcus comamonas acidovorans pseudomonas paenibacillus amylolyticus ideonella sakaiensis stenotrophomonas maltophilia spingobacterium multivorum lysinibacillus etc however weight loss rate of microplastics during degradation is only around 15 indicating that microplastics are not very biodegradable by a single pure bacterial strain matjašič et al 2021 yuan et al 2020 species of pseudomonas bacillus brevibacillus and streptomyces genus showed high efficiency against different plastic polymers matjašič et al 2021 ali et al 2021 the consortiums of bacterial microorganisms increased biodegradation efficiency either by playing a direct role in biodegradation or removal of toxic intermediates produced during degradation further metabolic cross feeding and the production of metabolites that drive co metabolic breakdown are two additional ways in which individual members of a microbial consortium might indirectly enhance biodegradation yuan et al 2020 the consortium consisting of species of pseudomonas and bacillus genus have widely been explored for microplastics degradation matjašič et al 2021 recently consortia of stenotrophomonas sp and achromobacter sp exhibited ldpe beads degradation ability dey et al 2020 7 2 degradation by fungi fungi especially white rot and brown rot fungi degrade microplastics in more efficient way than bacteria due the deep penetration of mycelia into the surface of polymeric substances and release high amount of extracellular enzymes such as lignin peroxidase manganese peroxidase versatile peroxidase and multi copper oxidase laccase to degrade polymers into their oligomers dimers and monomers ali et al 2021 rose et al 2022 aspergillus sp and penicillium sp are potential strains and aspergillus flavus is the most popular and successful strain for microplastics biodegradation respectively some other species are fusarium solani zahra et al 2010 trichoderma viride munir et al 2018 zalerion maritimum paço et al 2017 eupenicillium hirayamae phialophora alba paecilomyces variotii ojha et al 2017 etc identified for the microplastics degradation hydrophobicity and chemical structure containing non phenolic aromatic rings ether linkages and a carbon skeleton that is oxidised during lignin breakdown are two ways in which lignin resembles plastic ali et al 2020 these properties enable laccase and manganese peroxidase enzymes to easily degrade polyethylene and polypropylene due to structural similarity to lignin jeyakumar et al 2013 however few investigations on the fungal mediated degradation of microplastics have been conducted demonstrating the difficulties in finding fungal strains with good microplastics degrading activity by ectopic screening yuan et al 2020 7 3 degradation by invertebrates recently biodegradation of microplastics specially ps in the guts of invertebrates has gained significant attention the larvae of tenebrio molitor yellow mealworms zophobas atratus superworms plodia interpunctella indian mealmoths galleria mellonella greater waxworms achroia grisella lesser waxworms ingested microplastics and biodegraded it in their guts t molitor and z atratus larvae species of darkling beetle biodegraded ps and ldpe in a matter of hours t molitor larvae could also biodegrade polyvinyl chloride pvc polypropylene and hydrolyzable bioplastic polylactic acid pla yang et al 2015 reported rapid biodegradation of ps in the larval gut of t molitor linnaeus the higher ps degradation ability within the gut of t obscurus 26 03 than t molitor 11 67 was demonstrated by peng et al 2019 yang et al 2021b suggested the intestinal digestive system could perform ldpe depolymerization in t obscurus via enterobacteriaceae enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae at bacterial family s level and spiroplasma sp and enterococcus sp at the genus level biodegradation of eps and ldpe by larvae of z atratus supported gut microbe dependent ldpe and eps biodegradation peng et al 2020b however yang et al 2021a confirm the polypropylene pp biodegradation in both t molitor and z atratus larvae via gut microbe dependent depolymerization with diversified microbiomes polyethylene film pe 100 mg biodegradation in the gut of the larvae of p interpunctella waxworms or indian mealmoths was executed by two bacterial species enterobacter asburiae yt1 6 1 0 3 and bacillus sp yp1 10 7 0 2 over a 60 day of incubation period yang et al 2014 brandon et al 2018 reported that the larvae of t molitor conversed up 49 0 1 4 mass balances of the ingested pe into a putative gas fraction carbon dioxide pvc depolymerization biodegradation by t molitor larvae involve gut microbes further t molitor larvae can undertake extensive depolymerization biodegradation of pvc microplastics but only a little amount of mineralization peng et al 2020a lou et al 2020 revealed that bacillus and serratia were significantly associated with the ps and pe biodegradation in the gut of larvae of galleria mellonella the second generation of pe wc wax comb as co feed fed larvae of a grisella efficiently degrades pe at par with first generation counterparts kundungal et al 2019 bombelli et al 2017 reported fast bio degradation of pe by larvae of the waxmoth galleria mellonella producing ethylene glycol first time achatina fulica land snails ability to degrade ps were tested by song et al 2020 and observed that the gut microorganisms family enterobacteriaceae sphingobacteriaceae and aeromonadaceae were associated with ps biodegradation 8 mitigation strategies for microplastic pollution plastic waste disposal has become a significant concern due to inadequate legislation and lack of inefficient disposal techniques to minimize the adverse effects of microplastics we must efficiently manage plastic waste in an eco friendly and cost effective manner because plastic pollution affects neighbouring countries and international waters mitigation efforts to decrease plastic pollution must be stringent plastic removal from aquatic and terrestrial systems could be considered clean up activities but it is inadequate for this widespread problem some of the mitigation strategies are suggested to tackle microplastic pollution 1 a well established efficient management system adheres to the 5 r s reuse reduce reducing the production of plastic waste at the source recycle reducing the number of plastics released on a daily basis to reduce their deleterious impacts on the environment recover waste conversion to energy refuse and finally eco friendly disposal of plastic waste would result in an environment free of plastic 2 microbeads in cosmetics and other personal care products such as toothpaste face wash and shampoos should be banned immediately chatterjee and sharma 2019 another way to reduce plastics in the environment is to incur a tax on plastic products such as microbeads in the cosmetic industry daily care products and plastic bags for groceries 3 further emphasis should be given on consumer education and awareness reducing plastic discharge in wastewater treatment plants improving plastic product life cycle and end of life management and national and international governance prata et al 2019 4 all industries should adopt extended producer responsibility epr because it is a public policy tool that makes every producer legally and financially responsible for mitigating the environmental impacts of their products throughout their life cycle stages eriksen et al 2018 5 thermoplastics such as polyethene terephthalate pet polyethene pe and polypropylene pp all have the high potential to be recycled mechanically ogunola et al 2018 6 the biggest menace in plastic pollution is the use of single use plastic bags if plastic bags are completely banned or their use is restricted and some user fees are applied to their use then definitely there will be a reduction in their usage and accumulation in the environment 7 ecolabelling could be another measure for controlling plastic pollution the eco labelled products are eco friendly recyclable and consume less energy ogunola et al 2018 the main aim behind the ecolabelling of plastic products is to create awareness among the consumers so that they buy products that pose no harm to the environment on disposal which would create environmentally conscious behaviour in them secondly this scheme would introduce biodegradable plastics that could be composted ogunola et al 2018 bioplastics have gained popularity in recent years due to their eco friendliness and ability to be degraded by microorganisms petroleum starch vegetable fats and oils can all be used to produce these bioplastics ogunola et al 2018 chitosan crustacean shells polysaccharides and insect cuticles are other materials that can be used to produce bioplastics that are biodegradable in the environment within 2 weeks kumar et al 2021b 8 a few pieces of research have appeared that have used bacteria fungus and some worms to degrade plastics karbalaei et al 2018 these include a variety of pseudomonas flavobacterium arthrobacter and agromyces species most of which live in soil or sediment bassi 2017 bombelli et al 2017 found that the larvae of the wax moth galleria mellonella decomposed pe producing ethylene glycol as the end product hadad et al 2005 demonstrated that in the presence of uv light gram positive thermophilic soil bacteria brevibacillus borstelensis degrade branched chain low density polyethene in another study lwanga et al 2018 found that bacteria isolated from the earthworm s gut lumbricus terrestris degraded low density polyethene ldpe scientists have recently attempted to degrade microplastics using various microorganisms bacteria and fungi such as streptomyces setonii pseudomonas aeruginosa rhodococcus ruber pseudomonas stutzeri streptomyces badius aspergillus niger aspergillus flavus fusarium lini tiwari et al 2020 a mutant enzyme has been found by scientists that breaks down the plastic bottles in few days than it takes to do the same in oceans lamichhane et al 2022 biodegradable plastics can be produced from microalgae which could substitute synthetic plastics roy et al 2022 9 there are various social platforms such as plastic pollution coalitions plastics for change plastic oceans surfers against sewage greenpeace by the ocean we unite one more generation one green planet surf rider foundation and earth guardians they are working on the issue of microplastic pollution and contributing substantially chatterjee and sharma 2019 the world economic forum and the ellen macarthur foundation brought a joint initiative in terms of the new plastic economy which proposed redesigning the manufacture of plastic products redesigning means that these products should be biodegradable so that they are not harmful to the environment when disposed of mehmandost et al 2019 in 2015 the united states approved the microbead free waters act 2015 which states that plastic microbeads should not be added to products this legislation came into force in july 2017 for manufacturers and in july 2018 for retail sales masia et al 2020 with the target year of 2016 the netherlands was the first to produce microbead free cosmetic products with this in perspective the delhi plastic bag act 2000 was enacted to stop consuming foods in recycled plastic bags and dispose of nonbiodegradable waste in toilets highways and sites bundela et al 2010 in 2002 india similarly prohibited the use of ultra thin plastic bags in 2017 india also banned disposable plastics in delhi and the national capital region in india just 7 of total plastic gets recycled and 65 of plastic waste ends up in landfills so developing countries like india should focus on material and energy recovery rather than landfilling because landfilling produces toxic leachate contaminating soil and groundwater looking into international efforts to manage plastic waste in 2008 rwanda became a pioneer in banning disposable plastics among developing nations and has been declared the cleanest nation on the globe indonesia introduced a new policy in one of its cities to collect used plastic bottles for free bus rides across the city south korea has launched an emerging practice of precycling bringing own mugs and reusable bags in supermarkets grocery stores and cafes to curb the consumption of disposables santhosh and shrivastav 2019 in 2011 the governments of rwanda kenya uganda south sudan and the united republic of tanzania signed the east africa community polythene material control bill to halt the illegal movement of plastics in cross borders and promote sustainable packaging substitutes santhosh and shrivastav 2019 european union introduced directive 85 339 eec to address the issues of production use recycling and refilling containers for consumption and disposal of post consumer plastic waste the directive such as directive eu 2015 720 2015 and the amendment of directive 94 62 ec define measures how to tackle the problem regarding the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags this directive obliges member states to reduce the per capita consumption of plastic bags to 90 by the end of 2019 santhosh and shrivastav 2019 the plastic waste management rules 2016 in india stipulate that urban local bodies ulbs should ban less than 50 μm thick plastic bags and not allow the usage of recycled plastics for packing food beverage or any other eatables manuja 2020 single use grocery bags shopping bags and plastic bottles have been outlawed in california usa plastic packaging materials in massachusetts usa non biodegradable tableware in france and plastic containing cosmetic products in canada kumar et al 2021b the united nations environment programme unep initiated a global campaign to eliminate primary sources of plastic waste by 2022 llorca et al 2020 10 the most basic and important step in mitigating microplastics pollution is to develop a sanitary waste management system i e sanitary landfills and organise waste collection secondly leakage to the environment can be reduced significantly by banning and taxing most frequently littered items microplastics can be put into the guppyfriend washing bags in order to reduce microfibre shedding during washing after washing the microfibres retained in the bags can be disposed of in the residual waste bin the laundry bag produced from a plastic woven polyamide is user friendly an example of an organisational innovation is loop in which the overall environmental footprint is reduced and the business model for a delivery system is changed to avoid single use packaging loop delivers online orders to households in reusable containers that are collected afterwards cleaned and refilled oecd 2022 in nutshell in order to reduce the ever increasing microplastic pollution stringent national and international laws should be implemented change in human lifestyle and behaviour is the utmost need of the hour in order to deal with this waste the recycling and recovery are some of the basic things which if emphasized upon can really bring a drastic change in handling this pollution as a whole 9 bottleneck and current challenges it is crucial to realize that not all plastic products are the same and not all have the same service life to comprehend the life cycle of plastic products when plastic reaches the end of its useful life it becomes waste primary microplastics are made tiny in size for use in personal care products medicines and industries in contrast secondary microplastics are formed when larger plastic objects are gradually fragmented by mechanical chemical and biological processes the linear economy model associated with single use plastic contributes a significant amount to plastics in the natural environment such as oceans or landfills according to a study cordier and uehara 2019 the production of commercial plastics and products their distribution and consumption cause about 13 billion of damage to the marine environment each year although approximately 95 equal to 80 120 billion of all packaging plastic material is discarded this research also predicted that around 0 7 1 0 of total global gdp in 2017 approximately 492 708 billion euros is required to clean the approximately 135 mt of waste plastic from oceans representing just 15 of total ocean plastics for the years 2020 2030 watt et al 2021 so the cost is always a huge challenge associated with removing plastics and microplastics from the natural environment microplastic is a global threat due to its quantity persistence and widespread distribution with potential geophysical and biological impacts galloway and lewis 2016 microplastics are a cause of concern due to their size range coinciding with the ideal particle size swallowed by creatures of the marine food web detritus suspension and filter feeders easily ingest microplastics resulting in bioaccumulation biomagnification and trophic transfer to the highest food level consumers galloway and lewis 2016 furthermore microplastics serve as a vector or carrier for heavy metals such as cr cd cu ni pb etc and organic contaminants pesticides polychlorinated biphenyl perfluorinated compounds etc the adsorption of these contaminants on microplastic is a complex process that associates the physico chemical properties of microplastics and factors associated with microplastic surface properties including the biofilm attachment and environmental ageing process hou et al 2021 moreover the uptake and transfer of contaminant loaded microplastics still require intensive exploration to understand their behaviour in the living body moreover effective sampling and identification protocols for toxic chemicals related to microplastic pollution are in the developing stages yu et al 2018 the trophic transfer of microplastics to predators has been investigated in laboratory conditions either alone or in combination with xenobiotics which is far from real world scenarios arienzo et al 2021 every stage of microplastic analysis including sampling extraction separation and identification takes time indicating a considerable barrier to large scale monitoring furthermore the methodology used in these processes varies therefore the results are not always comparable because it is difficult to collect enough microplastic particles especially in complex samples for chemical analysis small microplastics have low detection frequencies and high detection limits yu et al 2018 for instance quantifying microplastics in a terrestrial environment is challenging because of sorting them from the huge amount of biomass however methods used to characterize and quantify the microplastics in sediments and water samples were modified and applied to soil samples although various techniques for extracting microplastics are fast cheaper and efficient however standard approach is still missing miri et al 2021 visual identification provides a rapid screening of microplastics based on their type shape size and colour which is often enough to distinguish plastic particles in solid matrices ranging from 5 to 0 25 mm rocha santos and duarte 2017 however below 0 25 mm their identification is based on colour and shape leading to misclassification of the microplastics because of our inability to differentiate them inside the bulk sample lavers et al 2016 however they can be identified using an optical microscope and sem however a pre treatment is necessary to eliminate organic materials from microplastic which might also result in changes in the morphological features of plastics such as color or size leading to microplastic misidentification ruggero et al 2020 surprisingly various factors influence the effectiveness of identification such as plastic additives which hinder the identification of polymers like pigments and interfere during identification due to their small size and widespread in the environment yu et al 2018 furthermore microplastics look similar to non polymeric and sediment materials making the visual procedure more time consuming and error prone miri et al 2021 other approaches such as infrared spectroscopy thermogravimetric analysis differential scanning calorimetry and raman spectroscopy may detect particles as small as 20 μm but they are costly and restricted to certain applications recently the use of micro ftir ftir linked to microscope has increased as it facilitates sample mapping characterization of multiple polymers and identification of irregular shaped microplastic however it is quite an expensive and time consuming process miri et al 2021 there are no standard authorized protocols to determine small microplastic 1 micron in natural environmental samples and the use of large quantities of microplastics in ecotoxicological investigations may only be described as a proof of concept as there is not enough information to estimate the potential risk huvet et al 2016 furthermore to minimize misunderstanding of non ecologically realistic results microplastic concentrations in exposure experiments should be closer to environmentally realistic amounts previous research on microplastic contamination has shown their potential toxicity nevertheless additional information is needed to understand their toxicity and harm to human health previous reports on microplastic pollution demonstrated their potential toxicity however more data should be collected to clarify their toxicity and threat to human health recently a research reported the presence of microplastics in the human placenta ragusa et al 2021 but their presence in the placenta and associated potential harm to human health remains poorly understood the trophic transmission of microplastics is the major challenge in understanding the uncovered possible health hazards on the practical ground the major issue in preventing microplastic contamination in water bodies is the absence of technology that successfully retains microplastic at wastewater treatment plants generally microplastic studies reported the presence of microplastics in the final effluent nevertheless the details on microplastic removal at each step of the wastewater treatment plants wwtps are still inadequate the majority of microplastics in wwtps are removed through screening grit removal grease removal skimming sedimentation preliminary and primary treatment activated sludge secondary treatment and membrane bioreactor mbr rapid sand filter rsf disc filter df dissolved air flotation daf ultrafiltration uf reverse osmosis ro gravity filter etc tertiary treatment moreover the current technologies used in the wastewater treatment plant are not designed to effectively remove microplastic which allows a large portion of microplastics to be discharged into water bodies further sludge retains more microplastics and acts as a microplastics source as it releases microplastics into the environment during conventional sludge management practices such as landfilling the technologies specially targeted for microplastic removal are still in the preliminary stages of research sun et al 2019 furthermore they can be costly difficult to integrate into existing facilities and only employed when high quality standards are necessary e g membrane bioreactors the membrane bioreactor uses cross flow filtration to remove small microparticles but demands high operational energy which increases the operational cost the combination of different unit operations can be effective for microplastic removal but increases the complexity and capital cost of microplastic elimination in wwtps investigations towards boosting enzyme degradation efficiency and developing bioreactors for microplastic enzymic biotic depolymerization are still at the laboratory scale furthermore most bioplastic degradation studies have not considered the formation of microplastics miri et al 2021 recently the united nations environment program unep presented a report which assessed the substantial economic losses caused by plastic contamination in marine ecosystems smith 2014 microplastic contamination in the aquatic environment was also highlighted in the nature journal which called for more attention to these pollutants and their toxicity marris 2014 fortunately along with global climate change ozone depletion and ocean acidification microplastic pollution was identified as one of the biggest environmental challenges in 2015 yu et al 2018 however various laws and policies to control plastic pollution are not enough to regulate plastic production its consumption and finally proper disposal causing a significant increase in microplastics in the natural environment recently the covid 19 pandemic has changed the dynamics of microplastic exposure to humans and created a new source of a huge amount of microplastics in the environment in a short time as a result there is a greater chance of interaction ingestion and hazardous effects across food webs which has become a new challenge to explore the significant and potential impact of reusable face masks on humans and the environment shruti et al 2020b 10 conclusions and future perspectives the degradation of plastics has become an issue of concern because it produces microplastics that are a potential risk to the ecosystem humans animals and plants another area of research could be an evaluation of the potential effects of advanced treatment on microplastic levels in treated water it has been found that wastewater treatment plants wwtps release microplastics into the environment therefore detecting microplastic occurrences in wwtps is highly important for their effective control smaller microplastics of size smaller than 20 μm should be the focus of future studies as these being abundantly present in water enter the circulatory system of aquatic organisms removal of microplastics from wastewater should be the target area as wastewater treatment plants act as pathways for entering microplastics into natural aquatic systems future research should emphasize the fate of plastics in various environments and technology development to reduce plastic pollution more research is required on the formation and degradation of nanoplastics to assess their fate and environmental risks there is a crucial need for appropriate sampling identification and removal methods to detect microplastic pollution the impact of microplastics on humans is not adequately understood and this field needs to be explored further reuse refuse reduce recycle and rethink could be key factors in reducing microplastic pollution plastic products that are harmful to the environment should be banned or taxed the ban offers comprehensive protection against plastic microbead pollution in the nations microplastic production and consumption could be reduced by improving design and using alternative materials resulting in long lasting products that can replace plastics a deeper understanding is required to identify and effectively remove hotspots of plastic pollution in water scientific research should be conducted to minimize their discharge into rivers standard scientific microplastic sampling and extraction techniques should be explored to monitor risk assessment the potential toxicity of contaminants adsorbed on microplastic in the environment needs to be investigated further to understand point non point sources particle interactions and transport mechanisms for modelling and identifying contaminants source and accumulation in the river environment including river toxicity and biodiversity ultimately reducing consumption production and effective waste management is an effective strategy to reduce microplastic pollution the transportation of microplastics in sediments should be investigated to improve risk assessment in aquatic environments microplastic monitoring is essential in areas where the seafood is harvested to develop strategies for future management the cosmetic and beauty products industries have already begun to phase out microplastics and replace these additives with more environmentally benign alternatives some countries have even banned the use and sale of cosmetics containing microplastics positive human behavioural change is highly recommended as it will provide a long lasting solution to the microplastic problem declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11737,the ever increasing presence of microplastics in many environmental components has been a cause of worry for humanity due to their small size and potential health risk since the last decade numerous studies have been conducted on the prevalence and dispersion of microplastics however at present there aren t any systematic studies on fate and transport of microplastics that consider multimedia environmental systems and their mitigation measures also there are limited studies on the routes through which humans are exposed to microplastics in this review about 380 articles were evaluated to uncover the extent of microplastic fate transport and pollution in different environmental components including soil freshwater marine and atmosphere as well as its effect on different ecosystems we gave special attention to understanding many routes and sources of microplastics intended for human consumption and their consequences on human health furthermore we tried to emphasize on the different methods used for sampling extraction identification and characterization of microplastics along with associated benefits and limitations this study highlighted existing knowledge and gaps in the remediation of microplastics on this basis the bottleneck and current challenges have been proposed graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastic pollution quantification of microplastic fate and transport health risk remediation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction plastics are long chain polymers composed of carbon oxygen hydrogen silicon and chloride and are made from natural gas oil and coal shah et al 2008 currently plastics have been used as an excellent material in today s day to day life they are used in almost all applications such as packaging automotive aquaculture fisheries biomedical shipping agriculture building and construction telecommunications furniture transportation plumbing personal care products textiles clothing etc ogunola et al 2018 plastics have even replaced more conventional materials such as glass and metals because of their lightweight nature malleability durability flexibility low cost persistency thermal and electrical insulation corrosion resistance high strength to weight ratio and waterproof properties pellini et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a ram and kumar 2020 the global plastic production reached 359 million tonnes in 2018 an increase of 46 5 compared to 2008 and 3 2 compared to 2017 plastics europe 2019 mao et al 2020 among all the countries china generates the most 30 followed by canada mexico usa 18 and europe 17 tiwari et al 2020 however plastics are emerging persistent and ubiquitous contaminants that could harm the growth and development of organisms induce oxidative stress weaken the immune system reduce lifespan and impact fertility chen et al 2020a microplastics are formed when plastics degrade or break down into smaller fractions under physical chemical mechanical and biological actions plastics europe 2019 lestari et al 2020 these plastics are microscopic and pervasive particles and they have been continuously increasing in the environment due to their continuous production non biodegradable persistent and long life span in the environment chamas et al 2020 thus they have been declared as one of the ten emerging contaminants in the united nation environmental programme unep year book 2014 that could potentially threaten human health and other organisms in all biomes constant et al 2020 therefore the accumulation of microplastics in environmental components is gaining attention and becoming a major concern among global researchers and scientists the abundance of microplastics in lakes rivers estuaries oceans and beaches worldwide has been documented in highly populated areas or areas with intensive anthropogenic activities he et al 2020 because of the small size microplastics can enter the human food chain through the consumption of seafood as well as other terrestrial food items and subsequently can have impact on human health bondelind et al 2020 rist et al 2018 chatterjee and sharma 2017 barboza and gimenez 2015 secondly plastic waste disposal in municipal waste disposal systems produces poisonous leachate which can contaminate water and soil rajmohan et al 2019 kataria et al 2022 unprecedented use of plastic products and improper waste management techniques will continue to increase plastic waste geyer et al 2017 the irresponsible behaviour of people regarding the use of plastics dumping plastic products improper management systems and associated harmful impacts have turned the planet into a plastic planet chatterjee and sharma 2019 despite so many studies on different aspects of microplastics pollution its effect on human health has recently come into the picture humans consume seafood in the form of fish and shellfish marine molluscs oyesters shrimp mussels etc these marine species are contaminated with microplastics thus affecting human health however there is no direct evidence of human health risk due to ingestion of microplastics rahman et al 2020 also there are not many studies on the effects of microplastics on human health and the knowledge regarding the harmful impacts of microplastics on human health and the routes through which humans are exposed are still in their infancy stages moreover plastics release fatal organic pollutants like dioxins and bisphenol a which can cause cancer and other neurological damages including impairment of the reproductive system rajmohan et al 2019 kataria et al 2022 thus microplastics pollution is a great threat to the environment and all living beings a proper understanding of this aspect is crucially needed therefore the present study provides up to date and comprehensive information on the prevalence of the microplastics in various environment matrices including fresh water atmosphere soil marine and food chain the major emphasis was on various sources of microplastics and their routes to humans along with associated possible health risks in addition detailed information on microplastics sampling and quantification techniques as well as updates on various microplastics recovery or removal techniques were covered in order to fully understand the impact of microplastics in soil and aquatic ecosystems this study was concluded with mitigation strategies current challenges and future perspectives of microplastics pollution 1 1 type of plastics different types of commercially available synthetic plastic materials and their uses are shown in table 1 polymers such as polyethene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyvinyl chloride pvc polyurethanes polyethylene terephthalate pet polystyrene ps and polyester pes are examples of virgin plastics plastics europe 2018 andrady and neal 2009 they represent 90 of the total plastic produced worldwide espinosa et al 2016 the polymers such as pet pp pe pes pvc ps polyamide pa and nylon are commonly used to manufacture various plastic items and process food products sutton and sedlak 2017 the most popular plastic polymers used in packaging are pp pet low and high density polyethene ldpe and hdpe plastics europe 2018 pet is a potential human carcinogen but it is still used abundantly in producing packaging material drinking water bottles pipes insulation moulding plastic films etc karbalaei et al 2018 kataria et al 2022 polystyrene which is primarily used in manufacturing of bottles and lids containers and protective packaging has been found to cause chronic toxicity because it translocates in blood and interferes with reproductive disruption processes in marine filter feeders sun et al 2019 phthalates and polybrominated diphenyl ethers used to improve the fire resistance and plasticity of the plastics are also well known endocrine disrupting compounds edcs they have also been found in human bodies due to bioaccumulation sun et al 2019 1 2 type of microplastics microplastics are synthetic long chain and organic polymers that can be found in various ecosystems such as soils subsurface systems rivers lakes wetlands oceans and atmosphere kumar et al 2021a these polymers come in a wide range of particle sizes and densities that can be harmful to aquatic ecosystems animals and human beings razeghi et al 2021 microplastics are typically defined as plastic particles with at least one dimension under 5 mm au 2017 rillig et al 2017 or as any polymer with the largest dimension smaller than 5 mm or within a size smaller than 5 mm eerkes medrano et al 2015 anderson et al 2016 lestari et al 2020 microplastics can be large microplastic particles l mpp 1 5 mm or small microplastic particles s mpp 1 mm as well as microbeads fragments fibres pellets flakes sheets or foams plastics are also classified into different categories based on their size viz giant 1 m large 1 m medium 2 5 cm micro 5 mm and nano 0 1 μm elgarahy et al 2021 they are derived from natural and organic materials such as coal natural gas and crude oil by polymerization or polycondensation processes phuong et al 2016 microplastics are classified into two types based on their source primary and secondary primary microplastics are small plastic particles released directly into the environment by domestic and industrial effluents spills and sewage discharge or indirectly by runoff for example scrubbing agents used in cosmetics and biomedical uses plastic pellets accidently lost during production or handling oecd 2022 they are also manufactured as microbeads in industries and used in personal care products sandblasting media or raw materials for fabricating other products andrady 2017 schessl et al 2019 the secondary microplastics are formed in the environment as a result of the breakdown of larger plastic particles via several degradation mechanisms such as chemical and physical ageing uv radiation photo oxidation mechanical transformation via waves abrasion and biological degradation by microorganisms de sá et al 2018 ogunola et al 2018 they are further divided into two categories 1 those formed during the use of products such as from tyre abrasion and synthetic microfibers from clothing and other textile products and 2 those formed by the degradation and fragmentation of macroplastics that have been released into the environment oecd 2022 one of the primary causes of the global increase in microplastic pollution is the difficulty in removing them from environmental matrices due to their tiny size and low visibility auta et al 2017a 2 source of microplastics microplastics are heterogeneous substances with varying shapes sizes morphology polymer compositions and density duis and coors 2016 auta et al 2017a wang et al 2019 based on origin microplastics are classified into two classes primary and secondary 2 1 primary microplastics the primary microplastic source mainly includes industrial production units and domestic activities that release micro size plastic directly into the environment fig 1 auta et al 2017a primary microplastic levels in terrestrial soils and freshwater systems increase as a result of industrial processes such as the production of pharmaceuticals the blasting of plastics e g thermal cutting tire wear e g cars planes plastic pellets cosmetics insect repellent wastewater treatment hospital industries sewage sludge etc fendall and sewell 2009 guo and wang 2019 however domestic products or activities including hand cleaners nail polish facial cleansers shower bath gels scrubs shaving cream baby products hair colours insect repellents and sunscreen toothpaste etc release microplastics into the environment via domestic sewage or wastewater treatment auta et al 2017a primary microplastics are also produced during air spray or blasting during painting and polishing blasting acrylic melamine or polyester microplastic scrubbers and rust or paint remover hulls release a massive amount of microplastics into the environment 2 2 secondary microplastics secondary microplastics include fibers derived as a result of the deterioration of large plastics on land and in the sea these materials are disintegrated continually and released as microplastics into the environment by the action of solar radiation photodegradation wind waves mechanical water waves hydrolysis acidic and or alkali conditions chemical degradation and microorganism biodegradation huang et al 2020a malankowska et al 2021 sources of secondary microplastics are abundant and heterogeneous horton et al 2017 several factors such as climatic conditions temperature sunlight precipitation etc plastic properties size and density and chemical structure influence the breakdown process of microplastic debris natural weathering is the primary disintegration process which is accelerated by uv light exposure to plastic uv radiation exposure promotes polymer structural oxidation which leads to the breakdown of plastic intermolecular bonds andrady 2011 wagner et al 2014 physical factors such as wind abrasion fluctuation and turbulence also contribute to the production of microplastics barnes et al 2009 in addition parameters such as precipitation chemical composition soil and water ph and chemicals produced by microorganisms all have a role in the oxidative disintegration of large plastic particles law and thompson 2014 shim and thomposon 2015 the microorganisms are also significantly responsible for degrading large plastics into small microplastics by releasing some chemicals in terrestrial ecosystems these processes contribute to fragmentation surface abrasion and oxidative breakdown of microplastics therefore it is not an easy task to identify the exact source of microplastics in different environmental matrices the microplastics are diverse in the environment and their degradation is dynamic zhou et al 2020b low density plastic is widely used in mulching and greenhouse to improve compost quality and crop production these agricultural mulch films and compost formation processes contribute to microplastic accumulation in terrestrial soil huang et al 2020b municipal solid waste and its landfill sites also act as secondary microplastic sources contaminating the soil and groundwater system zhou et al 2020b the presence of microplastics in the aquatic ecosystem cause health problems and toxic impacts on aquatic organisms their persistent nature enhances the leaching accumulation and adsorption in the environmental matrix shim and thomposon 2015 2 3 fate and transport of microplastics in the environment microplastics are transported across vast distances due to their shape size buoyancy lightweight and durability via wind and water several studies have been published in which wwtp effluent wastewater treatment plants has been identified as a key route for directly transporting microplastics into aquatic and soil environments karbalaei et al 2018 large size microplastics and other particles can be retained in the mechanical screen and grit chamber during the early phases of the wwt process during the primary treatment process microplastics fibers settle down by gravity via the coagulation flocculation mechanism zhou et al 2021 in the secondary treatment process the microplastics encounter microbes which can affect microbial activity and are retained on activated sludge sludge generated by wwtps could be another possible route for microplastic transport from wwtps to the soil ecosystem eriksen et al 2014 auta et al 2017a plastic debris contributes significantly to secondary microplastics and transports microplastics in soil and marine ecosystems obbard et al 2014 the plastic debris gradually breaks down into microplastic and accumulates on the soil s top surface microplastics can enter the soil subsurface via agricultural processes precipitation cracks and soil organism activities he et al 2018 because of these processes microplastics may leach and percolate in deep soils with water eventually entering into groundwater rillig et al 2017 moreover soil organisms such as earthworms insects nematodes bacteria fungus algae etc influence microplastics transport and fate via ingestion redox and excretion process wang et al 2020c guo et al 2020 some studies reported that microplastics are also passed from the digestive system gut of soil organisms into the faeces and excreta the research found that microplastics contained in faecal pellets might be an indirect source of microplastics in the marine ecosystem duis and coors 2016 cole et al 2014 surface runoff and wind flow carry microplastic residue from soil into freshwater streams and marine ecosystems cole et al 2011 microplastics of different morphologies are continuously transported and settle in soil or sediment after being released into the atmosphere posing a problem to the human respiratory system microplastics can be found on beaches seabed sediments surface waters and in a wide range of marine creatures including sea birds fish bivalves mammals and crustaceans etc auta et al 2017a hou et al 2021 few studies have reported microplastic presence in remote areas and the continent of the earth where human activity is limited fendall and sewell 2009 guo and wang 2019 microplastics can be transported via marine flow and atmospheric fall its small size and low density play a significant role in the global distribution of microplastics in every ecosystem thus polar ice and marine sediments have become a global sink for microplastics obbard et al 2014 it has been predicted that among 269 million tonnes of particles found globally approximately 92 are microplastics this prediction proved that most microplastics are located in marine sediments as a sink while the amount of microplastics on the surface is less eriksen et al 2014 auta et al 2017a however it is uncertain how much microplastics has entered and is being preserved in the marine ecosystem since the beginning of the anthropogenic era 3 occurrence of microplastics in different environmental components the presence of microplastics has become a serious ecological concern in several environmental compartments on the earth even karst groundwater cannot avoid microplastic pollution panno et al 2019 also scientific studies confirmed the existence of microplastics even in the deepest oceans tallest mountains and poles walkinshaw et al 2020 researchers have emphasized on the detection and distribution of microplastics in diverse ecosystems such as soils land freshwater atmosphere and seas oceans in recent years fig 2 in this regard table 2 summarizes some notable findings on the presence of microplastics fibre fragments and particles in different environmental matrices different detection methods such as atr ftir microscopy nmr fluorescence sem edx etc have played an important role in characterizing microplastics in different components of the environment more details have been explained in section 4 3 1 microplastics in freshwater freshwater which is the primary source of drinking water for people is thought to be the potential source of microplastics exposure to humans novotna et al 2019 primary microplastics sources in freshwater are those of industrial origin and secondary microplastics which result from the breakdown of large plastic debris eerkes medrano et al 2015 horton et al 2017 the microplastics shape can also define the presence in different parts of river for example if microplastics are of fragment shape they easily float and are dominantly found on the water surface whereas if microplastics are fibres and pellets they settle at the bottom and are found in the sediment lestari et al 2020 the great pacific garbage patch also known as the pacific trash vortex is a massive accumulation of plastic on the surface waters of the central north pacific ocean plastic and floating trash come from the pacific rim which includes asia north america and south america the great pacific garbage patch contains 79 000 tons of plastic with large particle sizes from fishing lines nets hard plastics and films among other things rajmohan et al 2019 several factors affect the migration or transport of microplastics in freshwater including the water body size wind currents and particle density eriksen et al 2013 fischer et al 2016 free et al 2014 some investigations verified the existence of microplastics even in remote areas such as antarctica cincinelli et al 2017 and the arctic lusher et al 2015 central atlantic islands martins et al 2020 arabian gulf abayomi et al 2017 even in deep sea arctic sediments kanhai et al 2019 although the studies are limited several researchers have recently documented the presence of microplastic in freshwater including lakes ponds kart water rivers and streams as well as in sediments table 2 in asia especially in china and india microplastics has been reported in surface water in china freshwater studies have mainly focused on the eastern regions of china including the yangtze estuary xu et al 2018 minjiang jiaojiang and oujiang estuary zhao et al 2015 futuanhe river estuary and sha river estuary zhou et al 2018 and the pearl river estuary fok and cheung 2015 yuan et al 2019 investigated the microplastics in surface water and sediment of poyang lake china and the average concentration and estimated particles were 0 2034 g l and 226 particles l respectively ding et al 2019 reported that the average quantity of microplastic and estimated particles were 0 92 g l and 1020 particles l respectively in the wei river in china which was much higher than other lakes or rivers in china similarly some other researchers have also detected microplastics in lakes and rivers of china i e 0 57 g l in the sediment of tibet plateau zhang et al 2016 123 particles l in surface water and sediment of taihu lake su et al 2016 and 0 47 g l in the sediment of pearl river fok and cheung 2015 according to global modelling studies of world rivers the ganges river india is the second largest source of microplastic in coastal seas and oceans lebreton et al 2017 sarkar et al 2019 investigated the occurrence of different microplastics in the ganga river india sediment their abundance in river sediment was found in the range of 107 410 particles kg sruthy and ramasamy 2017 reported approximately 0 027 g l of small size 0 2 1 0 mm microplastics in sediments of vembanad lake india in north american regions microplastics have been found in the freshwater sources and sediments of the usa and canada anderson et al 2017 reported that the surface water of winnipeg lake canada was contaminated with 1 74 g l of microplastics and the estimated microplastics was 1933 particle l the canadian lakes and rivers were also contaminated with 0 50 g l of microplastics as reported by anderson et al 2016 similarly zbyszewski and corcoran 2011 also detected the microplastics in the sediments of lake huron in canada and the usa and their approximate concentration was 3500 particles l eriksen et al 2013 detected microplastics in the surface water 0 02 particles l of the great lake of the usa some researches in european nations revealed that microplastics infiltrate rivers and lakes according to dris et al 2015 the french river seine was polluted with microplastic contamination similarly microplastics have been found in the surface water and sediments of rivers and lakes in other countries including lake chiusi and lake bolsena in italy fischer et al 2016 surface water of flemish rivers in belgium slootmaekers et al 2019 and sediments of the kelvin river in the united kingdom blair et al 2019 the concentration of microplastics varied within different locations on the continent furthermore since microplastics settle in freshwater systems sediments are the principal sink of microplastics in rivers therefore their concentration in sediments are substantially greater than in water wang et al 2017 in aquatic environment microplastics are not biochemically inert and leach chemical additives called plasticizers these plasticizers have been introduced during manufacturing to impart various properties to the product like heat stabilization acid scavenging slip compounds flame retardants etc lechner 2020 although microplastics pollution on land is many times more than in the oceans the aquatic systems have received much scientific attention compared to their terrestrial counterparts de souza machado et al 2017 also microplastics act as a vector or carrier of toxic sponges for transporting chemicals or pollutants by absorbing or adsorbing them amrutha and warrier 2020 microplastics can absorb and concentrate hydrophobic persistent organic pollutants pops in water such as polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs as well as inorganic pollutants such as heavy metals due to their chemical structure talvitie et al 2017 metals and microorganisms have also been reported to attach to microplastics bondelind et al 2020 3 2 microplastics in atmosphere the main sources of microplastics in the air are synthetic textiles erosion of synthetic rubber tires and urban dust prata 2018 other sources may include building materials industrial emissions plastic fragments from house furniture particle resuspension landfills traffic particles waste incineration tumble dryer exhaust synthetic particles used in horticultural soils and sewage sludge as fertilizer dris et al 2016 2017 liebezeit and liebezeit 2014 after being released into the atmosphere the diverse forms of microplastics are continually transported and settled in soil or sediment then there is a possibility of their translocation bioaccumulation and accumulation in trophic levels klein and fischer 2019 total microplastics in the environment are airborne microplastics in wet and dry atmospheric deposition dry deposition is described as gravitational deposits of microplastics floating in the air and gases and being settled by gravitational force they could be deposited on any ground surface or forest canopy that has been washed away by rains schlesinger and bernhardt 2013 wet deposition includes precipitation suspended particulate and dissolved particles separated by rainout and washout and dispersed in an environmental matrix zhang et al 2020d observed high concentration of microplastics in indoor environments 1 60 particles m3 and 1600 11 000 particles m2 day compared to the outdoors dris et al 2017 reported that microplastics concentrations in a paris apartment were between 1 and 60 fibres m3 higher than outdoors 0 3 1 5 fibres m3 the high detected concentrations of microplastics in indoor environments might be attributed to the higher flux of indoor microplastics sources and fewer particles being removed by dispersion processes than in outside environments vianello et al 2019 collected the indoor airborne microplastics samples from three apartments in aarhus denmark and reported that the most abundant types were polyester 59 92 followed by polyethene 5 28 nylon 0 13 and polypropylene 0 4 10 another thing is that the local wind blown debris was majorly involved in adding microplastics to the atmospheric deposits the predominant microplastics present in this atmospheric deposits were fragments fibres and particles dris et al 2016 cai et al 2017 the average concentration of microplastics in outdoor air varied within different regions of the world for example the deposition rate of atmospheric microplastics ranged from 175 to 313 particles m2 day in dongguan china cai et al 2017 however atmospheric transport may also carry microplastics to isolated mountains and marine regions bourzac 2020 a recent study allen et al 2019 on remote and pristine mountain regions french pyrenees confirmed the possibility of atmospheric microplastics being transported from urban regions to other remote areas where there is no anthropogenic activity approximately 366 particles m2 day of microplastics in the atmospheric deposition were observed in remote mountainous regions 3 3 microplastics in soil soil is the second largest depository of microplastics and transport routes through which microplastics pollution occurs in various surface and subsurface environmental matrices horton et al 2017 zhang and liu 2018 rillig 2012 a range of sources including industrial sources residential plastic waste sewage sludge air depositions and wastewater irrigation contaminate the soil ecosystem directly and indirectly zhou et al 2020a blasing and amelung 2018 once accumulated in soil microplastics may naturally breakdown and bioaccumulate in plants soil organisms and biodiversity chae and an 2018 de souza machado et al 2018 microplastics also act as a carrier and transfer various other soil pollutants to soil biota marine systems and other toxins to living organisms he et al 2018 exposed agricultural soil surfaces could be significant contributors of microplastics to the atmosphere or rivers through runoff microplastics in floodplains are likely to enter aquatic systems via heavy rains and floods o connor et al 2019 gao et al 2021 soil microplastics pollution in china requires special attention since large amount of plastics are produced consumed and discharged in china every year zhu et al 2019a microplastics are fragmented in soil depending on type of land application wang et al 2020c in recent years low density plastic has been used for mulching purpose in china s farmland which could be a key source of microplastics in agricultural soil sarker et al 2020 many of these mulches contain plastic waste residues that release harmful additives such as 50 120 mg phthalates kg leading to 74 208 higher phthalate concentrations than in non mulched soils in china kong et al 2012 recently zhou et al 2020a also quantified microplastics in different agricultural sites in the vicinity of hangzhou bay china and their average concentration was 310 items kg mulched soils contain an average of 571 pieces kg higher than non mulched soils i e 263 pieces kg and particle size varied from 1 to 3 mm in soil liu et al 2018 quantified both microplastics and mesoplastics in the deep and shallow soils of farmlands around shanghai china the average microplastics concentration in deep and shallow soil was 62 5 items kg and 78 0 items kg respectively mesoplastics were also prevalent with concentrations of 6 75 items kg and 3 25 items kg in shallow and deep soils respectively according to published research 63 to 430 thousand tons of microplastics are transported annually from farmland to ocean or surface water in europe and 44 300 thousand tonnes in north america guo et al 2020 many studies have shown that microplastics in soil from municipal landfills are due to the progressive disintegration of plastic waste dris et al 2016 guo et al 2020 rochman 2018 recent studies also evidenced microplastics occurrence in terrestrial ecosystems rillig et al 2017 horton et al 2017 fuller and gautam 2016 reported that soils around industrial locations in australia were polluted with 0 03 6 7 microplastics with quantities ranging from 300 to 67 500 mg kg microplastics have also been detected in home garden soils in campeche mexico where the mean concentration was 0 87 1 9 particles g lwanga et al 2017 furthermore scheurer and bigalke 2018 reported microplastics in nearly 90 of swiss floodplain soils at depths ranging from 0 to 5 cm they observed that the average microplastics content was 5 mg kg with the highest value of 55 5 mg kg from the metropolitan area of chennai india it was reported that the street dust samples had an average microplastics abundance of 227 94 91 37 per hundred grams patchaiyappan et al 2021 3 4 microplastics in marine environment microplastics are ubiquitous emerging marine pollutants that pose a global environmental threat shim and thomposon 2015 according to global model calculations 1 15 2 41 million tons of plastic garbage reach the ocean through rivers each year with the top 20 polluting rivers primarily located in asia accounting for 67 of the global total lebreton et al 2017 cosmetics pellets and air blasting media containing microplastics may infiltrate rivers through domestic and industrial drainage systems sharma and chatterjee 2017 wastewater treatment plants wwtps also contribute to the quantity of plastics in the ocean by discharging wastewater directly into the oceans or rivers which then carry them to the sea sun et al 2019 human activities such as tourism recreational and commercial fishing shipping and the marine industry release enormous quantities of plastics microplastics into the ocean in coastal regions cole et al 2011 plastics cannot biodegrade easily and may remain in the marine environment for long periods from the arctic to the antarctic an estimated 5 trillion pieces of plastics are floating in the world s oceans isobe et al 2015 matsuguma et al 2017 their distribution and fate in the ocean still need to be explored since microplastics are challenging to separate mechanically after they reach the environment some studies confirmed the presence of microplastics in surface waters to deep sea desforges et al 2013 sediments matsuguma et al 2017 and freshwater systems sarkar et al 2019 in offshore pacific waters microplastics concentration ranged from 8 to 9200 particles m3 it has been increasing continuously in other regions including west coast vancouver island straits of georgia and queen charlotte sound in british columbia canada desforges et al 2013 fauziah et al 2015 reported the occurrence of microplastics debris in sand beaches in peninsular malaysia a total of 2542 pieces of microplastics debris were found on all the studied beaches bagaev et al 2021 recently made several investigations on the presence of microplastics in russian seas seven of these investigations found that microplastics levels in water ranged from 0 6 to 336 000 items m3 and from 1 3 to 10 179 items kg in sediments other studies have been published on the distribution of microplastics fragments diameters of 5 mm in open seas including arctic polar waters lusher et al 2015 marginal seas isobe et al 2015 and coastal waters isobe et al 2017 lusher et al 2015 reported microplastics presence in surface top 16 cm and sub surface 6 m depth samples of arctic waters south and southwest of svalbard norway la daana et al 2018 reported the presence of microplastics in ice cores from remote areas of the arctic ocean isobe et al 2015 investigated microplastics concentrations in the east asian seas around japan finding a total particle count of about 1 72 million pieces km2 10 times higher than in the north pacific and 27 times higher than in the global oceans nel and froneman 2015 investigated the presence of microplastics in south african beach sediment and seawater where the microplastics concentrations varied from 340 7 to 4757 particles m2 and 204 5 to 1491 7 particles m3 respectively microplastics abundance in sediments was reported to be 37 1 42 7 items kg in the yellow sea china zhu et al 2018 250 300 items kg in edgbaston pool uk vaughan et al 2017 and 45 76 115 items km2 in the balearic islands spain ruiz orejón et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a quantified the amount of microplastics in deep sea ranging from 4601 m to 5732 m sediments in the western pacific ocean where the microplastics abundance averaged 240 items kg dry weight the microplastics were mainly fibrous in shape 52 5 blue 45 0 and less than 1 mm in size 90 0 matsuguma et al 2017 studied microplastics 5 mm in surface sediments from japan thailand and malaysia where the abundance of microplastics ranged from 100 pieces kg gulf of thailand to 1900 pieces kg a canal in tokyo bay microplastics suspended in the atmosphere are distributed in marine air and ocean surface wind movement and air dynamics could carry microplastics pollution from the terrestrial ecosystem to the ocean and marine atmosphere liu et al 2019b investigated the presence of atmospheric microplastics samps in the western pacific ocean for the first time in 2019 the abundance of samps was found to be 0 13 0 24 n m3 in the coastal region and 0 01 0 01 n m3 in the pelagic area samp abundance was 0 46 n m3 during the day and 0 22 0 19 n m3 at night about 90 of the microplastics were present as fibres and fragments microplastics abundance was also found in remote areas northwestern pacific i e 1 0 104 items km2 pan et al 2019 3 5 microplastics in the food chain according to the findings a wide range of aquatic organisms can consume and accumulate microplastics alfaro núñez et al 2021 numerous marine organisms including estuarine crustaceans fish intertidal shellfish mussels barnacles lugworms sea cucumbers amphipods and sea birds have been shown to consume microplastics digka et al 2018 provencher et al 2018 covernton et al 2019 iannilli et al 2019 mohsen et al 2019 xu et al 2020 after accidental or intentional consumption microplastics are transported through the epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract before being retained or egested through faeces microplastics can be fragmented in marine animals into even nanoplastics niederholtmeyer et al 2018 microplastics in the food chain seriously threaten marine ecosystems and human health microplastics contaminated food chains have harmed around 690 marine species carbery et al 2018 rothstein 1973 first reported microplastics pollution in the marine environment and its presence in the marine food chain after that numerous researches on microplastics pollution and microplastics fragment ingestion in marine organisms such as whales turtles fish snails and seabirds among others were published matsuguma et al 2017 retention of microplastics in the gastrointestinal tract can severely affect the organism s health by causing physical abrasions and or perforations decreasing nutrient uptake and reducing feeding activity because of the feeling of false satiety walkinshaw et al 2020 various studies confirmed that microplastics could also enter the food chain of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems most microplastics researches have focused on microplastics ingestion and thier analysis in the stomachs of marine organisms rochman et al 2013 lwanga et al 2018 quantified the microplastics in the terrestrial organisms waste such as earthworms cast and chicken faeces microplastics in earthworms casts and chicken faeces were 14 8 28 8 particles g and 129 8 82 3 particles g respectively the floating particles and microplastics fragments are readily swallowed and absorbed by small marine organisms which are subsequently directly fed by large organisms microplastics may therefore have an impact on the whole food web choy et al 2019 nelms et al 2019 panebianco et al 2019 found that microplastics were present in more than 50 of the snails i e a total of 425 specimens with an average of 0 92 1 2 particles snail the feeding habit of snails and their presence near agricultural fields have enhanced the exposure of microplastics contamination in the snails snails are a part of the human food chain also the reported studies on the microplastics existence in the food chain has become a major human health concern globally according to some studies the chlorinated polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs in tissue was high in birds with microplastics in their stomachs yamashita et al 2011 the larger microplastics can cause internal abrasion clogging of the digestive system and intestinal lesions cole et al 2013 wright et al 2013 ahrendt et al 2020 microplastics also exists in the soft tissues of marine organisms van cauwenberghe and janssen 2014 quantified microplastic in soft tissues of commercially grown bivalves mytilus edulis and crassostrea gigas during human consumption the average quantity of microplastics in m edulis and c gigas was 0 36 0 07 particles g wet weight and 0 47 0 16 particles g respectively 4 sampling identification and quantification of microplastics 4 1 sampling of microplastics one of the crucial procedures in the analysis of microplastics is sampling depending on the goals of the research different sampling techniques can be used for microplastics characterization because microplastics are so tiny accurate sampling methods are essential for producing high quality results as the microplastics distribution is heterogeneous large samples are more representative than small samples and can be further made smaller by homogenization random sampling is a sampling strategy that might be used to identify contamination in a site that is likely to be homogenous systematic grid sampling which divides up sample locations in a regular pattern may be utilized to verify the extent and hotspots of contamination the first point is selected randomly and the rest points are arranged in a well ordered pattern transect sampling is also a one dimensional systematic sampling that may be used to identify and verify the extensiveness of contamination it is used along with linear features such as roads unaligned grid sampling is another approach that integrates the utility of both random and systematic grid sampling a stratified sampling approach may be used to identify the contamination in a delineated sub area of the entire sampling region moller et al 2020 in riverine environments microplastics can be sampled by a dynamic or stationary sampling method in dynamic sampling trawls are pulled by boats the stationary sampling technique collects microplastics samples from small rivers campanale et al 2020 for microplastics sampling in sediments in freshwater bodies sampling is performed manually demonstrating an area and a depth now a days instead of manual sampling a corer with a specific diameter box corer and ekman or van veen grab corer can be referred in a known area for a required volume of material campanale et al 2020 microplastics of different colours sizes and polymers are separated and extracted after sample collection using a variety of techniques including physical separation density separation filtration magnetic separation electrocoagulation etc matrix removal techniques are utilized to take the organic matter out of the microplastics samples in order to get precise findings and cut down on processing time hanvey et al 2017 enzymatic digestion h2o2 oxidation and acid or alkaline digestion are a few typical processes used for organic matter removal from microplastics samples 4 2 identification and quantification of microplastic quantification is the counting and categorizing microplastics based on their size colour and type of polymers moller et al 2020 optical counting of microplastics is usually performed with a microscope but it has some limitations concerning accuracy visual counting may result in misreading microplastics and the risk of identifying non plastic particles as plastic due to the high diversification of polymers specification of the chemical composition of polymers is essential to assure accuracy generally the detection of microplastics can be categorized into two steps the first one is physical i e colour size and the second is chemical i e composition structure identification sun et al 2019 a combination of microscopy and spectroscopy may improve the accuracy of the optical counting some research proposes the hot needle test to reduce the risk of accurate plastic counting zhang et al 2018 suggested a method for identifying soil polymers after density separation with water the residues present in the supernatant are examined by comparing prior microscopic imaging after heating the sample at 130 c for 3 5 s liquefied plastics are recognized as thermoplastics however specific natural polymers melt at particular temperatures which reduces the feasibility of determining the exact polymer time the visual identification has been validated in numerous studies moller et al 2020 however it does not differentiate the type of plastic and is less suitable for particles with a diameter 50 μm zhang et al 2018 the different extraction methods are integrated into a chromatographic unit for quantitative and qualitative identification of plastic polymers pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry and thermal extraction desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry are mass based techniques while raman and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir are particle based techniques used for the identification of microplastics duumichen et al 2017 introduced thermal extraction desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry ted gc ms however ted gc ms is suitable for quick analysis of samples but is a destructive method this method does not require any pretreatment and the time required for the complete measurement of a sample is about 2 h a short time considering the sample mass and the depth of information gel permeation chromatography gpc is another method of size exclusion chromatography that uses organic solvents to separate analytes based on their sizes it is frequently used for the examination of polymers this technique is based on differences in molecular mass in which large molecules are excluded from the pores of the gels and are eluted first in addition to providing a complete assessment of the particles size shape and polymer distribution high temperature gpc also provides a qualitative study of stabilisers without the need for any visual sorting hintersteiner et al 2015 vibrational spectroscopy like raman or ftir is usually used for microplastics analysis as it allows error free identification of plastic polymers their spectra are used to identify several types of plastics by comparison with a spectral library corradini et al 2019 raman microspectroscopy identifies microplastics down to 500 nm pixel resolution it can be increased to 100 nm using silver colloid for surface enhanced raman spectroscopy lv et al 2020 while micro ftir spectroscopy identifies particles from 10 to 500 μm moller et al 2020 according to most studies ftir is an excellent approach for analyzing sediment samples to increase the precision of the data ftir can be combined with an optical microscope raman and ftir are both non destructive techniques atr ftir spectroscopy attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is also a fast and efficient approach for identifying polymers of plastic marine debris in marine water and biota jung et al 2018 scanning electron microscopy sem is also used to determine the polymer s size shape or morphology to overcome the constraints of a stereomicroscope sem is installed for the physical analysis of microplastics sem images of the external surface of microplastics makes it easy to differentiate between synthetic microplastics and many organic materials that can be found with microplastics cooper and corcoran 2010 energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds is used for elementary analysis to determine the chemical compositions of plastic particles however it would not be easy to access sem edx regularly as it is an expensive detection method and requires more time and effort to prepare the sample furthermore sem edx cannot distinguish coloured microplastics advanced and updated microscopic analysis such as plm polarized light microscopy can also be used to analyze pet pp and pe based microplastics a new method for analyzing size independent microplastics is proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy peez et al 2019 this method is capable of quantitative and qualitative analysis of samples containing polyethene polystyrene and polyethene terephthalate however this method is not cost effective as a result this method is inadequate for soil sample analysis microplastics can also be identified via thermogravimetric analysis it can be combined with differential scanning calorimetry or mass spectrometry for better results out of the above mentioned methods ftir microscopy is the most common approach found in microplastic research due to its exceptional reliability and easy application to analyze the microplastics size shape colour and morphology new methods such as sem edx ted gc ms gpc etc can be used alone or in combinations 5 effect of microplastics the worldwide presence of microplastics in the environment is regarded as an ecological hazard and a significant concern by scientists governments and policymakers li et al 2016 vaughan et al 2017 bergmann et al 2019 chen et al 2020a the existence of microplastics in living organisms is influenced by the interaction of biological and non biological factors and ecological security although the exact mechanism is unclear our understanding of the fate and impact of microplastics on the biosphere is critically needed 5 1 effect on soil ecosystem because of the persistent nature in the terrestrial environment microplastics may interact with flora and soil organisms according to kleunen et al 2020 microplastics may harm plants and their growth with concentrations of epdm ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber exceeding 8 v v can cause 50 mortality lc50 at concentration 13 v v the growth of two species leucanthemum ircutianum and prunella vulgaris had also been suppressed during interaction with 5 v v of epdm microparticles in soil microplastics could modify plant structure in various ways including changes in size shoot and root length number of leaves and colour kleunen et al 2020 khalid et al 2020 fig 3 illustrates microplastics exposure in the soil system and their transport and accumulation in plants and microorganisms similarly pflugmacher et al 2020 showed that 3 mm polycarbonate microparticles with 59 items kg concentration reduced lepidium sativum shoots and roots length the negative impact of microplastics on the growth of vigna radiata was reported by chae and an 2020 the seed germination and seedling are more sensitive to the microplastics bosker et al 2019 studied the impact of various microplastics concentrations 107 items ml and 104 items ml on seed germination of lepidium sativum and found that seed germination was significantly affected during the first 8 h of microplastics solution exposure small microplastics exposure can significantly alter the natural ecosystem lozano and rillig 2020 boots et al 2019 reported a remarkable reduction in root growth of lolium perenne with low density microplastics the plant roots directly encounter microplastics when sewage sludge as fertilizer and organic manures are applied watteau et al 2018 microplastics also affects the soil quality and nutrient cycle in the soil system zhou et al 2020b qi et al 2020 reported alteration in soil chemical characteristics including ph conductivity and c n ratio with ldpe and biodegradable microplastics yuanqiao et al 2020 observed a decrease in the water and nitrate holding capacity due to a high dose of microplastics 360 kg h m2 microorganisms such as mycorrhizal fungi phosphate reducing bacteria mineral reducing bacteria and nitrogen fixing bacteria in soil are essential for plant growth in some studies it is observed that microbial activity has been reduced during microplastics exposure which directly affects plant growth and crop production powell and rillig 2018 microplastics could alter mycorrhizal growth of fungi and comparative richness in the plant root system wang et al 2020c similarly chen et al 2020b found that polylactic acid pla affected the interaction between microbial community and soil particles it could also affect the mineralization and nitrogen fixation directly reducing root expansion and plant growth in addition it diminishes enzyme production such as urease glucosidase and phosphatase based on the available literature it can be assumed that exposure to microplastics directly or indirectly alters the natural ecosystem of soil including plants soil microorganisms and crops huang et al 2020b the impact of microplastics exposure and its mechanism is still mysterious due to limited literature notably plant feeder species or herbivores directly ingest atmospheric microplastics from the surface of plant leaves thus leading to a more prominent route to enter the food chain and reaching higher trophic levels dovidat et al 2020 5 2 effect on aquatic ecosystem microplastics and pharmaceuticals are classified as emerging contaminants that threaten aquatic ecosystems in the last few years many pharmaceutical products have been discharged into wastewater streams to enter the natural ecosystem microplastics associated with pharmaceuticals are more toxic to aquatic organisms li et al 2018a microplastics ingestion adsorption and interaction behaviour differ with aquatic organisms such as submerged plants phytoplanktons fishes and other top carnivores in the natural ecosystem allen et al 2017 as microplastics reach the aquatic system microorganisms such as microbial biofilm algae fungus and bacteria fragment them by establishing colonies hoellein et al 2014 wang et al 2020b the accumulated microplastics then colonize in biofilms which serve as a food source for aquatic organisms and eventually contaminate the food chain microplastics properties such as quantity particle size shape origin source and chemical composition are important in interaction and accumulation in the natural ecosystem yuan et al 2019 gutow et al 2016 exposure of zooplanktons to microplastics leads to a decreased growth cycle enhanced mortality ingestion capacity and even disturbing the coming generations besseling et al 2014 one of the studies confirmed that exposure to small sized microplastics caused a more significant toxic effect on various microalgae than large sized microplastics anbumani and kakkar 2018 huang et al 2020a notably larger sized microplastics can reduce the photosynthesis mechanism by blocking the sunlight whereas small sized microplastics affect the cell wall of the algae and destroy their internal structure huang et al 2020a when aquatic organisms consume microplastics laced with allied chemical contaminants these allied toxins are released into their tissues posing potential health risks campanale et al 2020 microplastics can easily capture industrial toxins and soil pollutants carry them to long distances and disperse them in aquatic and marine ecosystems li et al 2018a the mercury can be carried by microplastics to artemia nauplii also known as sea monkeys are small seawater crustaceans belonging to the artemiidae family and then enter the food chain at a higher trophic level tang et al 2019 toxic metal ions can also be transferred to other aquatic organisms including snails fish corals and amphibians via the food chain batel et al 2020 carbery et al 2018 in addition to the toxicity and impacts of microplastics their transport mechanism may affect the bioaccumulation of associated chemical contaminants in the aquatic organisms researchers have begun to understand the transport behaviour of plastic debris in aquatic ecosystems due to increased microplastic pollution teuten et al 2009 recent studies on plastic debris showed that the microplastic additives gradually leaches from waste and contaminates the aquatic system paluselli and kim 2020 it could also create several health problems such as toxicity endocrine disruption and mutations in the aquatic organisms capolupo et al 2020 5 3 effect on humans the exposure of microplastics to human health has become a serious global concern microplastics are ubiquitous in the environment and enters the human body predominantly via two pathways i e ingestion and inhalation its exposure can potentially cause adverse health problems in human beings liu et al 2019a wang et al 2020a humans are being exposed to microplastics pollution due to their packet food habits the exposure to microplastics and its health impacts on humans are currently unclear aquatic food products have been identified as the primary source of microplastics to human exposure huang et al 2020a the amount of microplastics particles in the food source and their transport from the food source to humans must be determined to assess the health risk of microplastics exposure some studies reported the presence of microplastics in different food products and resources including table salt karami et al 2017a beer kosuth et al 2018 wine prata et al 2020 sugar or honey gerd and elisabeth 2015 plastic tea bags hernandez et al 2019a and water bottles mason et al 2018 hernandez et al 2019a reported that a single tea bag releases about 11 6 billion microplastics and 3 1 billion nanoplastics in a cup of tea based on recent studies microplastics have been observed in commercial salts that are available in more than 120 brands worldwide zhang et al 2020c kim et al 2018 microplastics were also detected in drinking water sources such as tap and bottled waters koelmans et al 2019 recently schwabl et al 2019 reported nine types of microplastics in human faeces and their mean abundance was 2 particles g in a size range of 50 500 μm the presence of polyethylene terephthalate pet and polypropylene pp indicated the ingestion of microplastics from diverse food sources walkinshaw et al 2020 bouwmeester et al 2015 airborne microplastics exposure causes respiratory and lung problems in humans vianello et al 2019 reported that humans could inhale approximately 272 particles day from indoor air the inhalation of microplastics depends upon particle size generally 2 5 μm size particles are easily transported to the lung via respiratory tract wang et al 2020d plastics smaller than micro size are more toxic to neurons lungs and respiratory system jeong and choi 2019 wang et al 2020e reported the synergistic toxicity of microplastics and its associated bisphenol a on intestinal epithelial cells microplastics exposure causes cell toxicity by cellular oxidative stress microplastics exposure reduces lipid digestion due to the formation of microplastics oil droplets and inhibits enzyme activity during the digestion process tan et al 2020 human tissue can also uptake microplastics via endocytosis airways surface and gastrointestinal tract wright and kelly 2017 microplastic fibres can cause occupational health problems among workers studies among occupational nylon flock workers indicate that most workers faced several health risks such as increased lung cancer respiratory irritation occupational asthma coughing and lung capacity warheit et al 2001 about 4 of people who work in the nylon industry in the us and canada have these health problems boag et al 1999 wright and kelly 2017 5 4 transportation of microplastics to human the presence of microplastics in various environmental components has been observed worldwide such as surface water marine water freshwater seabed sediments beaches wastewater effluents ice aquatic organisms and their predators food products such as salt honey sugar bottled water plastic containers indoor and outdoor air etc table 2 rahman et al 2020 petersen and hubbart 2020 however their occurrence is not restricted to the source of their availability as microplastics can migrate over long distances via wind and water currents which mark their presence even in remote areas such as polar ice caps arctic and antarctic and mid oceanic islands walkinshaw et al 2020 the direct or indirect sources for microplastics transportation are destined for humans through ingestion and inhalation fig 4 5 4 1 ingestion the ingestion of food and water polluted with microplastics is the primary route for human exposure galloway 2015 and marine organisms top the list among the food microplastics can be ingested by various marine life via different processes barboza et al 2018 microplastics in marine organisms destined for human consumption have been widely reported wang et al 2020b zantis et al 2020 walkinshaw et al 2020 huang et al 2020a yao et al 2021 marine organisms ingest microplastics in two ways directly from their natural surroundings or indirectly via trophic transfer from prey and consuming contaminated feedstock barboza et al 2018 direct ingestion of microplastics is often a consequence of feeding strategy indirect ingestion or trophic transfer occurs when microplastics are confounded with prey barboza et al 2018 walkinshaw et al 2020 e g widely reported microplastics presence in the stomachs of blackmouth catshark galeus melastomus is attributed to bioaccumulation from their microplastics laden prey alomar and deudero 2017 the northern fulmars fulmarus glacialis contain plastic debris in their stomachs and are used as a bio indicator for ocean microplastics pollution terepocki et al 2017 numerous planktons crustaceans molluscs and echinoderms consume microplastics from their surroundings during feeding resulting in microplastics bioaccumulation in fish shrimp crabs and other seafood consumed by humans shichun et al 2019 huang et al 2020a daniel et al 2021 yao et al 2021 the highest concentration of microplastics 0 10 5 microplastics g is found in mollusks followed by crustaceans 0 1 8 6 microplastics g and fish 0 2 9 microplastics g karami et al 2017b numerous studies have found microplastics in a variety of marine life including molluscs crustaceans and finfish destined for human consumption jabeen et al 2017 walkinshaw et al 2020 wang et al 2020b zantis et al 2020 and these are among the most commonly caught marine species and farmed aquaculture species according to food and agriculture organization fao 2020 these data highlighted low biomagnification in the marine food chain and a higher risk to the members of lower trophic levels compared to the higher trophic level walkinshaw et al 2020 the large specific surface area and stability makes microplastics a suitable adsorbent for hazardous substances and pathogenic microorganisms their fine size could allow translocation to other body systems the dispersion throughout the whole body along with hazardous substances is a matter of great concern for human health wright and kelly 2017 pandey et al 2020 caruso 2019 polyethene polypropylene polyester and polystyrene are the topmost generated polymers worldwide plastics europe 2020 fibre and fragments of these microplastics are commonly detected in the digestive tract of fish wang et al 2017 zantis et al 2020 however reports regarding microplastics outside the digestive tract are currently scanty walkinshaw et al 2020 wang et al 2020b recently ragusa et al 2021 observed a diverse range of microplastics in the human placenta unfortunately they could not explain the mechanism of microplastics translocation to the bloodstream such as respiratory or the gastrointestinal system the transfer of microplastics from a lower trophic level to a higher trophic level was reported through the aquatic food chain huang et al 2020a such as waterbirds brookson et al 2019 penguins le guen et al 2020 seals hernandez et al 2019b humpbacked dolphins zhu et al 2019b beluga whales moore et al 2020 sharks maes et al 2020 and even humans schwabl et al 2019 the presence of microplastics in freshwater birds such as geese duck and loons was also confirmed holland et al 2016 reynolds and ryan 2018 another way through which microplastics are destined for humans is sea salt kim and song 2021 drinking water shen et al 2021c cold tea energy drinks beer shruti et al 2020a and food containers du et al 2020 fadare et al 2020 around 28 sea salt brands from 16 countries on six continents showed microplastics presence ranging from 0 to 1674 particles kg and sea salt is more contaminated with microplastics than rock salts and lake salts kim et al 2018 karami et al 2017a observed 1 to 10 microplastics kg of salt of 17 brands from 8 different countries and among the 72 extracted particles polymers share 41 6 followed by pigments 23 6 and amorphous carbon 5 50 and 29 1 remained unidentified recently vidyasakar et al 2021 compared microplastic concentrations in two major salt producing states in india the research found that salt of gujarat origin contained higher microplastics 46 115 particles 200 g than tamil nadu salt 23 101 particles 200 g which were polyethene polyester and polyvinyl chloride the microplastics presence in human drinking water such as raw water koelmans et al 2019 and bottled water makhdoumi et al 2021 is now an emerging issue the highest concentration of microplastics was recorded in beer 28 particles l followed by energy drink 7 particles l and cold tea 6 particles l and the predominant polymer types were polyamide and poly ester amide shruti et al 2020a after direct and hot water flushing du et al 2020 observed that microplastics varied from 3 to 29 pieces per take out food container of different polymer materials microplastics were prevalent in containers with rough surfaces they estimated that those who use take out food containers 4 7 times each week might consume 12 203 microplastics particles duckweed dovidat et al 2020 seagrass goss et al 2018 and mangrove li et al 2018a have all shown the potential to trap microplastics via various mechanisms they provide another route for microplastics to higher trophic levels through the terrestrial food chain cigarette butts comprise over 15 000 detachable strands of plastic fibres their disposal in the open leads to an estimated 0 3 million tonnes of waste entering the oceans yearly belzagui et al 2021 shen et al 2021b recently conti et al 2020 revealed the presence of nanoplastics and microplastics in edible fruits and vegetables purchased from markets in catania and first to evaluate the estimated daily ingestion by adults and children 5 4 2 inhalation more than 50 of secondary microplastics derived from land based anthropogenic activity are retained in the terrestrial environment bullard et al 2021 atmospheric fallout not only acts as the source of microplastics for water bodies ocean and inland and land but also as a direct source for humans by inhalation microplastics deposition rate average were measured in atmospheric fallout in different megacities such as paris france 110 96 m2 day dris et al 2016 dongguan city china 36 7 m2 day cai et al 2017 london uk 575 1008 m2 day wright et al 2020 hamburg germany 136 5 512 0 m2 day klein and fischer 2019 tehran iran 88 605 items 30 g dry dust dehghani et al 2017 and remote areas of the pyrenees mountains 365 m2 day allen et al 2019 this indicates that microplastics pollution has become a global issue mishra et al 2021 stanton et al 2019 observed 2 90 128 42 fibres m2 day in the dust sample collected from the roofs of university campus in nottingham uk and concluded that fibres of atmospheric fallout were of natural origin fibrous microplastics were the most prevalent shape observed in atmospheric fallout and they were preferentially carried over a longer distance more than 95 km than microbeads and they were easily inhaled by humans bullard et al 2021 fibres were dominant in microplastics in indoor 88 0 and outdoor 73 7 dusts from china liu et al 2019a however the physical characteristics of microplastics such as size shape density etc along with different meteorological conditions determined the travelling length of microplastics in the air synthetic textiles synthetic rubber tires and urban dust are the main source of microplastics in the air chen et al 2020a wang et al 2020d other outdoor sources include construction and building materials industrial emissions waste management practices such as incineration landfills and sewage sludge and transportation which is attributed to particles such as rubber tyres and road paints the indoor sources include particle fragments from house furniture paints and domestic use plastic based articles such as plastic containers wang et al 2020d the low dispersal mechanism in the indoor environment causes a higher concentration of microplastics 1600 11 000 particles m2 day than outdoors zhang et al 2020d therefore children are more vulnerable as a result of direct inhalation and ingestion through the mouth via dirty toys and fingers contaminated with settled microplastics and dust carrying microplastics dehghani et al 2017 according to liu et al 2019a children in major chinese cities inhaled an average geometric mean of 17 300 ng kg bw average body weight of microplastics derived from polyethene terephthalate daily zhang et al 2020b collected 286 indoor dust samples from 12 different countries and observed polyethene terephthalate based microplastics ranging from 38 to 120 000 μg g whereas polycarbonate based microplastics ranged from 0 11 1700 μg g the median daily intake of polyethene terephthalate based microplastics by infants was in the range of 4000 150 000 ng kg bw day however the atmospheric transport mechanism of microplastics is still unclear and inhalation of microplastics is the least explored field petersen and hubbart 2020 rahman et al 2020 can güven 2021 wet deposition rainfall and snowfall is a major event associated with atmospheric microplastic accumulation and removal microplastics were elevated with high rainfall i e 2 34 particles m day with 0 0 2 mm of rainfall and 11 355 particles m day with 2 5 mm of rainfall dris et al 2016 xia et al 2020 observed a positive correlation r2 0 94 between rainfall and microplastics concentration in lake donghu china and reported that microplastics ranged from 7 4 to 29 6 items l with a dominance of size 2 mm fibre shape and transparent colour snowfall is responsible for microplastics deposition in urban and remote e g the arctic terrestrial land and the ocean zhang et al 2020e bergmann et al 2019 recently observed microplastics deposition ranging from 190 154 103 particles l and 0 14 4 103 particles l in melted snow collected from europe and the arctic respectively abbasi and turner 2021 recorded 16 000 microplastics retrieved from filtered washes of hand and face skin head hair and saliva of humans n 2000 exposure time of 24 h the maximum microplastics were from head hair 7000 or on an average 3 5 microplastics individual day and minimum from saliva about 650 or on average 0 33 microplastics individual day males had almost twice the amount of microplastics as compared to females a high concentration of microplastics on head hair can be correlated with atmospheric fallout recently covid 19 attributed to the use of facemask which increased their consumption and production across the world and have introduced new risks to human health and environmental challenges by adding vast amounts of polymers such as polypropylene polyurethane polyacrylonitrile polystyrene polycarbonate polyethene or polyester in the environment fadare and okoffo 2020 aragaw 2020 the who estimates that approximately 89 million medical masks are required monthly to respond to covid 19 who 2020 fadare and okoffo 2020 microplastics are now regarded as an emerging component of air pollution due to their inhalation and interaction with other pollutants such as heavy metals mercury lead pahs pesticides ddt hexachlorobenzene pharmaceuticals product etc zhang et al 2020e puckowski et al 2021 6 removal recovery of microplastics when compared to the rural environment the urban environment contains a large amount of microplastics and common practices such as domestic waste disposal street washing and rain runoff transport microplastics into the sewer system where they end up in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps bilgin et al 2020 the removal and or recovery of microplastics from wwtps can significantly reduce their amount to be discharged into the natural environment such as water bodies usually the final disposal site further reducing their availability for bioaccumulation and transfer to higher trophic levels such as a humans 6 1 microplastics recovery from wwtp the recovery rate of microplastics in conventional wwtps including preliminary primary and secondary stages was 88 and can be enhanced to 99 9 by adding tertiary stage in wwtps sun et al 2019 iyare et al 2020 the removal of microplastics is dependent on the type of unit operation and unit process the majority of microplastics in wwtps are removed through screening grit removal grease removal skimming sedimentation preliminary and primary treatment activated sludge secondary treatment and membrane bioreactor mbr rapid sand filter rsf disc filter df dissolved air flotation daf ultrafiltration uf reverse osmosis ro gravity filter etc tertiary treatment fig 5 overall the preliminary treatment for microplastics removal is a function of the nature and functioning of unit operations liu et al 2021 the microplastics removal efficiency of any unit operation is strongly influenced by the microplastics concentration and nature such as shape size and density the removal efficiency of microplastics is low in a single unit operation however the combination may improve removal efficiency generally grit and grease treatment exhibits poor removal efficiency for microplastics liu et al 2021 but a recent study revealed 69 79 removal efficiency by screening and grit treatment ziajahromi et al 2021 the grease skimming process performs better for low density and relatively large microplastics that easily float during flotation sun et al 2019 bilgin et al 2020 aerated grit chamber with primary settling tank exhibited 40 7 removal efficiency liu et al 2019c the combination of screening grit and grease processes skimming and settling removed a considerable portion of microplastics load ranging between 32 to 98 talvitie et al 2015 hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 sun et al 2019 flotation and sedimentation are two popular unit operations used to remove microplastics and their efficacy depends on the microplastics shape size and density the flotation exhibited 59 removal efficiency for microplastics with low material density 1 g cm3 relatively large size 1 5 mm and flat shapes e g films conversely sedimentation rapidly removed the microplastics 91 removal efficiency with high material density 1 1 g cm3 and relatively large structures e g fragments moreover neither flotation nor sedimentation was the primary mechanism for the removal of microplastics with small sizes 1 mm and densities near water 1 g cm3 bilgin et al 2020 the conventional secondary treatment which includes biological reactors aeration tanks trickling filters etc and settling tanks could not reduce the significant microplastic load as they were not developed primarily for microplastics removal iyare et al 2020 zhang and chen 2020 iyare et al 2020 observed that biofiltration was more effective than trickling filters and solids contact tanks the primary sedimentation tank and aeration tank with clarifier showed only 33 75 and 20 07 removal efficiency respectively murphy et al 2016 individual aeration tanks had a removal efficiency of 79 gundogdu et al 2018 which increased to 95 6 when the aeration tank was used as a secondary unit operation in the activated sludge process michielssen et al 2016 the full scale conventional activated sludge process removed 86 of microplastics pittura et al 2021 modern operation units in wwtps such as sequential batch reactor sbr aerobic membrane bioreactor mbr anaerobic membrane bioreactor and disc filter df pore size 20 μm exhibited 99 2 lee and kim 2018 99 9 talvitie et al 2017 99 4 michielssen et al 2016 98 5 talvitie et al 2017 removal efficiency for microplastics respectively the a2o aerobic anoxic aerobic method was unsuitable for microplastics removal due to its poor removal efficiency 16 9 and significant sludge return jiang et al 2020 the tertiary treatment technologies are specific but membrane based technologies for microplastics removal exhibit the best performance some common tertiary techniques which reduce significant microplastics load are rapid sand filter 97 98 9 talvitie et al 2017 hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 granular sand filtration 97 2 michielssen et al 2016 ozone 99 2 hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 and membrane disc filter 99 1 hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 rapid sand filter technology can fragment microplastics into smaller particles sol et al 2020 ziajahromi et al 2017 demonstrated poor microplastics removal efficiency of ultrafiltration 41 6 and reverse osmosis 25 shen et al 2021a demonstrated significant removal efficiency of 96 for granular polyethene microplastics 10 μm and fibrous polyamide microplastics 100 μm by aluminosilicate filter media modified by cationic surfactant the results of a full scale wastewater treatment plant in eastern china using mbr and an oxidation ditch in a parallel system showed that membrane filtration is more efficient in microplastics removal mbr removed 99 5 of microplastics from influent whereas oxidation ditch removed 97 lv et al 2019b mbr effectively removes small microplastics 100 m and nanoplastics however the smaller size of the microplastics makes the filtration process more complex and expensive due to membrane scaling and fouling malankowska et al 2021 which demands improvements in this aspect although daf had a higher removal efficiency for low density microplastics sol et al 2020 the overall removal efficiency was insignificant even when combined with flocculants and surface modifiers sturm et al 2021 the microplastics removed by daf varied from 43 8 to 68 9 wang et al 2021 sarkar et al 2021 used a pulse clarifier to remove more than 85 of microplastics from drinking water treatment plants according to the preceding discussion most of the microplastics in wwtps are removed retained by skimming sedimentation and tertiary filtration however these technologies are not originally developed for microplastics allowing a large portion of microplastics to water bodies furthermore sludge retains more microplastics and serves as a source of microplastics by releasing microplastics into the environment during conventional sludge management practices such as landfilling miri et al 2021 the technologies designed explicitly for microplastics removal are still in the preliminary stages of research developing new technologies and or upgrading existing techniques to address microplastics released into the environment from wwtps might be a viable option ma et al 2019 studied the polyethene based microplastics removal from drinking water systems using coagulation fe based coagulant followed by an ultrafiltration process they found that the individual conventional coagulation process fe based coagulant had a nonsignificant microplastics removal efficiency of 13 indicating that the individual coagulation process was insufficient for microplastics removal however a combination of al based coagulant and polyacrylamide pam enhanced the coagulation performance it increased the removal efficiency from 13 to 91 for particles size 0 5 mm and reduced membrane fouling during ultrafiltration recently zhou et al 2021 reported that polyaluminium chloride pac was better than ferric chloride fecl3 in the removal of polystyrene ps and polyethene pe microplastics ye et al 2021 fabricated two types of bubble propelled iron oxides mno2 core shell micromotors and tested them under the external magnetic field to remove microplastics the fe2o3 mno2 micromotor separates 10 of suspended microplastics from the polluted water in 2 h wang et al 2020f compared the filtration characteristics of four agricultural waste based biochar and sand to immobilize uniformly graded microplastics spheres the findings showed that 10 μm diameter microplastics spheres were immobilized to a greater extent 60 80 on all four biochars than on similar grain sized sand filters after examining sem images they proposed three mechanisms of immobilization of microplastics spheres on biochar stuck trapped and entangled because microplastics are hydrophobic they can be removed using the froth flotation process microplastics with higher density larger size and lower concentration were removed from the waste stream by froth flotation cationic species such as potassium sodium and calcium did not affect the removal of microplastics at an aeration volume of 5 4 ml min and al3 concentrations froth dose of 28 mg l froth flotation removed 100 microplastics zhang et al 2021b 6 2 electrocoagulation currently electrocoagulation has been used to effectively remove dyes heavy metals and clay particles with 80 removal efficiency perren et al 2018 at an initial ph between 3 and 10 about 90 of polyethene microbeads were removed from artificial wastewater and maximum removal efficiency was observed to be 99 24 at a ph of 7 5 perren et al 2018 shen et al 2022 evaluated the efficiency of electrocoagulation for the recovery of four diverse microplastics they observed a maximum recovery of 93 2 for polyethene 91 7 for polymethylmethacrylate 98 2 for cellulose acetate and 98 4 for polypropylene at ph 7 2 the aluminium anode performed better than the iron anode with an overall 80 recovery of microplastics in the ph range of 3 10 the electrocoagulation exhibited appreciable removal efficiency for fibre microplastics than granular microplastics the microplastics removal efficiency positively correlated with electrolyte concentration and applied voltage density the optimized conditions were the electrolyte concentration of 0 05 m ph of 7 2 applied voltage density of 10 v and al anode elkhatib et al 2021 employed electrocoagulation to remove commercial polyester microplastics from synthetic solutions and wastewater samples in synthetic solution the recovery of polyester microplastics was about 99 at ph 4 and 7 and current densities of 2 88 and 8 07 ma cm2 in wastewater samples 96 5 of microplastics 92 2 of chemical oxygen demand and 88 8 of thermotolerant coliform colonies were removed a 30 min of electrocoagulation using aluminium electrodes followed by centrifugation removed 90 of microplastics floc kim and park 2021 microplastics characteristics such as size shape and density as well as electrocoagulation process components such as initial ph coagulant dose coagulant nature and flocculant aids had a significant impact on the electrocoagulation process s efficiency and must be optimized for the practical application of microplastics removal 6 3 sol gel process the sol gel process is a chemical method for producing a highly crosslinked solid of an inorganic organic macromolecule by sequential hydrolysis of the precursor in acidic or basic media followed by polycondensation of the hydrolyzed products n alkyl substituted chlorosilanes are commonly used as precursors due to their high reactivity with water hurkes et al 2014 in 2017 herbort and schuhen proposed a host guest relationship for removing microplastics from water by agglomeration utilizing silicon based precursors the aforementioned technique included the fabrication of an inclusion unit inorganic organic macromolecules and then a capture unit which was then combined to create an inclusion compound and alkoxy silyl presence which provided the necessary 3 d network the sol gel process provides structured composite silica gels which are used to capture micro beads that can be separated by simple separation techniques such as a sand trap these capture units can be further utilized for energy generation the hydrophobic stressors microplastics trapped in hybrid silica gel increased their volume allowing easy filter separation compared to granular activated carbon herbort et al 2018 synthesized diverse bioinspired alkoxy silyl functionalized molecules and subsequently generated agglomerate via sol gel process which was 666 times more in the volume of the original particles that allowed cost effective separation the various alkyl trichlorosilane exhibited different characteristics for localization and fixation of microplastics based on alkyl groups as they significantly influenced the reaction rate and agglomeration behaviour the intermediate alkyl group between 3 and 5 carbon atoms was best suited for polyethene pe and polypropylene pp mixture removal however long alkyl groups 8 or 8 carbon atoms were ineffective to localized microplastics which ultimately caused a reduction in microplastics removal sturm et al 2020 further microplastics chemical composition surface chemistry and physical interaction with the organosilanes play an essential role in the removal process the removal efficiency of microplastics was 76 4 and 46 3 for n butyltrichlorosilane and iso octyltrichlorosilane respectively however large amounts of residues were left dissolved in water pe x abcr eco wasser 3 0 p e x can be employed on a technical scale since no dissolved residue was found removing the risk of organosilanes entering the environment sturm et al 2021 6 4 dynamic membranes and membrane bioreactor in recent years dynamic membranes gained significant attention due to low energy consumption and no demand for extra chemical because pollutants in wastewater itself make the filter layer which is easy to clean and exhibits potential for the removal of low density microplastics lu et al 2016 li et al 2018b li et al 2018b evaluated the practicability of dynamic membranes for microplastics removal and observed that the dynamic membrane was formed in a very short time on the 90 μm supporting mesh and was able to operate in low transmembrane pressure 70 mm 180 mm of water head and total filtration resistance 2 89 10 9 m to 6 52 10 9 m microplastics removal using dynamic membrane technology could be energy efficient however filter blockage construction and operational cost should be thoroughly evaluated when utilizing an extra unit for microplastics removal membrane bioreactor mbr has shown superiority over conventional activated sludge process asp mbr requires less operation space minimum sludge generation significant improvement in the overall efficiency of wastewater treatment and is easy to combine with the conventional biological treatment process and can be a potential replacement for secondary sedimentation and tertiary filtration lares et al 2018 observed better removal of microplastics by mbr 99 3 compared to the conventional activated sludge process 98 3 a combination of upflow granular anaerobic sludge blanket uasb and anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr removed 94 of microplastics with 87 of fibres and 100 of particles pittura et al 2021 lv et al 2019b compared to the membrane bioreactor efficiency with oxidation ditch in a full scale wwtp of eastern china the influent 40 microplastic were of size 500 μm and 29 between 62 5 and 125 μm in terms of plastic mass the membrane bioreactor exhibited 99 5 removal efficiency than the oxidation ditch 97 while based on the numbers for microplastics it was 82 1 for the former and 53 6 for the latter microfiltration membrane modules in mbr eliminated considerable amounts of microplastics 300 μm in size which are the most common microplastics in surface water auta et al 2017a the integration of submerged flat sheet uf membranes with mbr retained up to 99 4 of influent microplastics talvitie et al 2017 lares et al 2018 however mbr process based sludge retains a large amount of microplastics that demand further treatment which increases overall treatment costs membrane fouling is another major hurdle that hurts membrane fibres and increases maintenance costs maliwan et al 2021 operated sequencing batch mbrs for the diverse feed of microplastics for 124 days they observed that the presence of microplastics decreased floc size in sludge floc hydrophobicity and floc negative zeta potential the decrease in molecular size and increase in the extracellular polymeric substance eps concentration further facilitated the divalent cation ca2 and mg2 uptake by microplastics in contrast to the control a 4 month operation of sequencing batch mbrs did not experience severe cake fouling 7 degradation of microplastics microbial degradation of microplastics in different environments is an integrated process with physicochemical factors microplastics serve as a supporting material for the growth as well as carbon and energy source for microbes microbes in their pure culture bacteria and fungi and consortia are commonly studied for microplastics degradation the methods reported for microplastics degradation assessment can be grouped into three categories 1 those focus on the elimination of small molecules 2 those focus on chemical changes hydrophobicity functional groups in the polymer structure and 3 those focus on physical changes tensile strength surface morphology crystallinity etc in material properties mass loss carbon dioxide evolution and gel permeation chromatography methods assess the degradation based on bond cleavage nuclear magnetic resonance nmr infrared ir spectroscopies contact angle assess biodegradation by observing changes in chemical functionality dynamic mechanical analysis dma thermal analysis surface analysis scanning electron microscopy sem and atomic force microscopy afm assess biodegradation based on changes in materials properties chamas et al 2020 7 1 degradation by bacteria bacteria in pure culture at laboratory condition is commonly explored for microbial mediated degradation of microplastics due to easily probe metabolic pathways impacts of environmental variables and changes in microplastics during the degradation process auta et al 2017b observed the degradation ability of bacillus cereus and bacillus gottheilii for polyethylene pe polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp and polystyrene ps isolated from the mangrove sediments in peninsular malaysia the calculated weight loss percentages of the microplastic particles by b cereus after 40 days were 1 6 6 6 and 7 4 for pe pet and ps respectively b gottheilii recorded weight loss percentages of 6 2 3 0 3 6 and 5 8 for pe pet pp and ps respectively the common genus screened for microplastic degradation included bacillus rhodococcus bacillus gottheilii enterobacter asburiae bacillus subtilis chelatococcus comamonas acidovorans pseudomonas paenibacillus amylolyticus ideonella sakaiensis stenotrophomonas maltophilia spingobacterium multivorum lysinibacillus etc however weight loss rate of microplastics during degradation is only around 15 indicating that microplastics are not very biodegradable by a single pure bacterial strain matjašič et al 2021 yuan et al 2020 species of pseudomonas bacillus brevibacillus and streptomyces genus showed high efficiency against different plastic polymers matjašič et al 2021 ali et al 2021 the consortiums of bacterial microorganisms increased biodegradation efficiency either by playing a direct role in biodegradation or removal of toxic intermediates produced during degradation further metabolic cross feeding and the production of metabolites that drive co metabolic breakdown are two additional ways in which individual members of a microbial consortium might indirectly enhance biodegradation yuan et al 2020 the consortium consisting of species of pseudomonas and bacillus genus have widely been explored for microplastics degradation matjašič et al 2021 recently consortia of stenotrophomonas sp and achromobacter sp exhibited ldpe beads degradation ability dey et al 2020 7 2 degradation by fungi fungi especially white rot and brown rot fungi degrade microplastics in more efficient way than bacteria due the deep penetration of mycelia into the surface of polymeric substances and release high amount of extracellular enzymes such as lignin peroxidase manganese peroxidase versatile peroxidase and multi copper oxidase laccase to degrade polymers into their oligomers dimers and monomers ali et al 2021 rose et al 2022 aspergillus sp and penicillium sp are potential strains and aspergillus flavus is the most popular and successful strain for microplastics biodegradation respectively some other species are fusarium solani zahra et al 2010 trichoderma viride munir et al 2018 zalerion maritimum paço et al 2017 eupenicillium hirayamae phialophora alba paecilomyces variotii ojha et al 2017 etc identified for the microplastics degradation hydrophobicity and chemical structure containing non phenolic aromatic rings ether linkages and a carbon skeleton that is oxidised during lignin breakdown are two ways in which lignin resembles plastic ali et al 2020 these properties enable laccase and manganese peroxidase enzymes to easily degrade polyethylene and polypropylene due to structural similarity to lignin jeyakumar et al 2013 however few investigations on the fungal mediated degradation of microplastics have been conducted demonstrating the difficulties in finding fungal strains with good microplastics degrading activity by ectopic screening yuan et al 2020 7 3 degradation by invertebrates recently biodegradation of microplastics specially ps in the guts of invertebrates has gained significant attention the larvae of tenebrio molitor yellow mealworms zophobas atratus superworms plodia interpunctella indian mealmoths galleria mellonella greater waxworms achroia grisella lesser waxworms ingested microplastics and biodegraded it in their guts t molitor and z atratus larvae species of darkling beetle biodegraded ps and ldpe in a matter of hours t molitor larvae could also biodegrade polyvinyl chloride pvc polypropylene and hydrolyzable bioplastic polylactic acid pla yang et al 2015 reported rapid biodegradation of ps in the larval gut of t molitor linnaeus the higher ps degradation ability within the gut of t obscurus 26 03 than t molitor 11 67 was demonstrated by peng et al 2019 yang et al 2021b suggested the intestinal digestive system could perform ldpe depolymerization in t obscurus via enterobacteriaceae enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae at bacterial family s level and spiroplasma sp and enterococcus sp at the genus level biodegradation of eps and ldpe by larvae of z atratus supported gut microbe dependent ldpe and eps biodegradation peng et al 2020b however yang et al 2021a confirm the polypropylene pp biodegradation in both t molitor and z atratus larvae via gut microbe dependent depolymerization with diversified microbiomes polyethylene film pe 100 mg biodegradation in the gut of the larvae of p interpunctella waxworms or indian mealmoths was executed by two bacterial species enterobacter asburiae yt1 6 1 0 3 and bacillus sp yp1 10 7 0 2 over a 60 day of incubation period yang et al 2014 brandon et al 2018 reported that the larvae of t molitor conversed up 49 0 1 4 mass balances of the ingested pe into a putative gas fraction carbon dioxide pvc depolymerization biodegradation by t molitor larvae involve gut microbes further t molitor larvae can undertake extensive depolymerization biodegradation of pvc microplastics but only a little amount of mineralization peng et al 2020a lou et al 2020 revealed that bacillus and serratia were significantly associated with the ps and pe biodegradation in the gut of larvae of galleria mellonella the second generation of pe wc wax comb as co feed fed larvae of a grisella efficiently degrades pe at par with first generation counterparts kundungal et al 2019 bombelli et al 2017 reported fast bio degradation of pe by larvae of the waxmoth galleria mellonella producing ethylene glycol first time achatina fulica land snails ability to degrade ps were tested by song et al 2020 and observed that the gut microorganisms family enterobacteriaceae sphingobacteriaceae and aeromonadaceae were associated with ps biodegradation 8 mitigation strategies for microplastic pollution plastic waste disposal has become a significant concern due to inadequate legislation and lack of inefficient disposal techniques to minimize the adverse effects of microplastics we must efficiently manage plastic waste in an eco friendly and cost effective manner because plastic pollution affects neighbouring countries and international waters mitigation efforts to decrease plastic pollution must be stringent plastic removal from aquatic and terrestrial systems could be considered clean up activities but it is inadequate for this widespread problem some of the mitigation strategies are suggested to tackle microplastic pollution 1 a well established efficient management system adheres to the 5 r s reuse reduce reducing the production of plastic waste at the source recycle reducing the number of plastics released on a daily basis to reduce their deleterious impacts on the environment recover waste conversion to energy refuse and finally eco friendly disposal of plastic waste would result in an environment free of plastic 2 microbeads in cosmetics and other personal care products such as toothpaste face wash and shampoos should be banned immediately chatterjee and sharma 2019 another way to reduce plastics in the environment is to incur a tax on plastic products such as microbeads in the cosmetic industry daily care products and plastic bags for groceries 3 further emphasis should be given on consumer education and awareness reducing plastic discharge in wastewater treatment plants improving plastic product life cycle and end of life management and national and international governance prata et al 2019 4 all industries should adopt extended producer responsibility epr because it is a public policy tool that makes every producer legally and financially responsible for mitigating the environmental impacts of their products throughout their life cycle stages eriksen et al 2018 5 thermoplastics such as polyethene terephthalate pet polyethene pe and polypropylene pp all have the high potential to be recycled mechanically ogunola et al 2018 6 the biggest menace in plastic pollution is the use of single use plastic bags if plastic bags are completely banned or their use is restricted and some user fees are applied to their use then definitely there will be a reduction in their usage and accumulation in the environment 7 ecolabelling could be another measure for controlling plastic pollution the eco labelled products are eco friendly recyclable and consume less energy ogunola et al 2018 the main aim behind the ecolabelling of plastic products is to create awareness among the consumers so that they buy products that pose no harm to the environment on disposal which would create environmentally conscious behaviour in them secondly this scheme would introduce biodegradable plastics that could be composted ogunola et al 2018 bioplastics have gained popularity in recent years due to their eco friendliness and ability to be degraded by microorganisms petroleum starch vegetable fats and oils can all be used to produce these bioplastics ogunola et al 2018 chitosan crustacean shells polysaccharides and insect cuticles are other materials that can be used to produce bioplastics that are biodegradable in the environment within 2 weeks kumar et al 2021b 8 a few pieces of research have appeared that have used bacteria fungus and some worms to degrade plastics karbalaei et al 2018 these include a variety of pseudomonas flavobacterium arthrobacter and agromyces species most of which live in soil or sediment bassi 2017 bombelli et al 2017 found that the larvae of the wax moth galleria mellonella decomposed pe producing ethylene glycol as the end product hadad et al 2005 demonstrated that in the presence of uv light gram positive thermophilic soil bacteria brevibacillus borstelensis degrade branched chain low density polyethene in another study lwanga et al 2018 found that bacteria isolated from the earthworm s gut lumbricus terrestris degraded low density polyethene ldpe scientists have recently attempted to degrade microplastics using various microorganisms bacteria and fungi such as streptomyces setonii pseudomonas aeruginosa rhodococcus ruber pseudomonas stutzeri streptomyces badius aspergillus niger aspergillus flavus fusarium lini tiwari et al 2020 a mutant enzyme has been found by scientists that breaks down the plastic bottles in few days than it takes to do the same in oceans lamichhane et al 2022 biodegradable plastics can be produced from microalgae which could substitute synthetic plastics roy et al 2022 9 there are various social platforms such as plastic pollution coalitions plastics for change plastic oceans surfers against sewage greenpeace by the ocean we unite one more generation one green planet surf rider foundation and earth guardians they are working on the issue of microplastic pollution and contributing substantially chatterjee and sharma 2019 the world economic forum and the ellen macarthur foundation brought a joint initiative in terms of the new plastic economy which proposed redesigning the manufacture of plastic products redesigning means that these products should be biodegradable so that they are not harmful to the environment when disposed of mehmandost et al 2019 in 2015 the united states approved the microbead free waters act 2015 which states that plastic microbeads should not be added to products this legislation came into force in july 2017 for manufacturers and in july 2018 for retail sales masia et al 2020 with the target year of 2016 the netherlands was the first to produce microbead free cosmetic products with this in perspective the delhi plastic bag act 2000 was enacted to stop consuming foods in recycled plastic bags and dispose of nonbiodegradable waste in toilets highways and sites bundela et al 2010 in 2002 india similarly prohibited the use of ultra thin plastic bags in 2017 india also banned disposable plastics in delhi and the national capital region in india just 7 of total plastic gets recycled and 65 of plastic waste ends up in landfills so developing countries like india should focus on material and energy recovery rather than landfilling because landfilling produces toxic leachate contaminating soil and groundwater looking into international efforts to manage plastic waste in 2008 rwanda became a pioneer in banning disposable plastics among developing nations and has been declared the cleanest nation on the globe indonesia introduced a new policy in one of its cities to collect used plastic bottles for free bus rides across the city south korea has launched an emerging practice of precycling bringing own mugs and reusable bags in supermarkets grocery stores and cafes to curb the consumption of disposables santhosh and shrivastav 2019 in 2011 the governments of rwanda kenya uganda south sudan and the united republic of tanzania signed the east africa community polythene material control bill to halt the illegal movement of plastics in cross borders and promote sustainable packaging substitutes santhosh and shrivastav 2019 european union introduced directive 85 339 eec to address the issues of production use recycling and refilling containers for consumption and disposal of post consumer plastic waste the directive such as directive eu 2015 720 2015 and the amendment of directive 94 62 ec define measures how to tackle the problem regarding the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags this directive obliges member states to reduce the per capita consumption of plastic bags to 90 by the end of 2019 santhosh and shrivastav 2019 the plastic waste management rules 2016 in india stipulate that urban local bodies ulbs should ban less than 50 μm thick plastic bags and not allow the usage of recycled plastics for packing food beverage or any other eatables manuja 2020 single use grocery bags shopping bags and plastic bottles have been outlawed in california usa plastic packaging materials in massachusetts usa non biodegradable tableware in france and plastic containing cosmetic products in canada kumar et al 2021b the united nations environment programme unep initiated a global campaign to eliminate primary sources of plastic waste by 2022 llorca et al 2020 10 the most basic and important step in mitigating microplastics pollution is to develop a sanitary waste management system i e sanitary landfills and organise waste collection secondly leakage to the environment can be reduced significantly by banning and taxing most frequently littered items microplastics can be put into the guppyfriend washing bags in order to reduce microfibre shedding during washing after washing the microfibres retained in the bags can be disposed of in the residual waste bin the laundry bag produced from a plastic woven polyamide is user friendly an example of an organisational innovation is loop in which the overall environmental footprint is reduced and the business model for a delivery system is changed to avoid single use packaging loop delivers online orders to households in reusable containers that are collected afterwards cleaned and refilled oecd 2022 in nutshell in order to reduce the ever increasing microplastic pollution stringent national and international laws should be implemented change in human lifestyle and behaviour is the utmost need of the hour in order to deal with this waste the recycling and recovery are some of the basic things which if emphasized upon can really bring a drastic change in handling this pollution as a whole 9 bottleneck and current challenges it is crucial to realize that not all plastic products are the same and not all have the same service life to comprehend the life cycle of plastic products when plastic reaches the end of its useful life it becomes waste primary microplastics are made tiny in size for use in personal care products medicines and industries in contrast secondary microplastics are formed when larger plastic objects are gradually fragmented by mechanical chemical and biological processes the linear economy model associated with single use plastic contributes a significant amount to plastics in the natural environment such as oceans or landfills according to a study cordier and uehara 2019 the production of commercial plastics and products their distribution and consumption cause about 13 billion of damage to the marine environment each year although approximately 95 equal to 80 120 billion of all packaging plastic material is discarded this research also predicted that around 0 7 1 0 of total global gdp in 2017 approximately 492 708 billion euros is required to clean the approximately 135 mt of waste plastic from oceans representing just 15 of total ocean plastics for the years 2020 2030 watt et al 2021 so the cost is always a huge challenge associated with removing plastics and microplastics from the natural environment microplastic is a global threat due to its quantity persistence and widespread distribution with potential geophysical and biological impacts galloway and lewis 2016 microplastics are a cause of concern due to their size range coinciding with the ideal particle size swallowed by creatures of the marine food web detritus suspension and filter feeders easily ingest microplastics resulting in bioaccumulation biomagnification and trophic transfer to the highest food level consumers galloway and lewis 2016 furthermore microplastics serve as a vector or carrier for heavy metals such as cr cd cu ni pb etc and organic contaminants pesticides polychlorinated biphenyl perfluorinated compounds etc the adsorption of these contaminants on microplastic is a complex process that associates the physico chemical properties of microplastics and factors associated with microplastic surface properties including the biofilm attachment and environmental ageing process hou et al 2021 moreover the uptake and transfer of contaminant loaded microplastics still require intensive exploration to understand their behaviour in the living body moreover effective sampling and identification protocols for toxic chemicals related to microplastic pollution are in the developing stages yu et al 2018 the trophic transfer of microplastics to predators has been investigated in laboratory conditions either alone or in combination with xenobiotics which is far from real world scenarios arienzo et al 2021 every stage of microplastic analysis including sampling extraction separation and identification takes time indicating a considerable barrier to large scale monitoring furthermore the methodology used in these processes varies therefore the results are not always comparable because it is difficult to collect enough microplastic particles especially in complex samples for chemical analysis small microplastics have low detection frequencies and high detection limits yu et al 2018 for instance quantifying microplastics in a terrestrial environment is challenging because of sorting them from the huge amount of biomass however methods used to characterize and quantify the microplastics in sediments and water samples were modified and applied to soil samples although various techniques for extracting microplastics are fast cheaper and efficient however standard approach is still missing miri et al 2021 visual identification provides a rapid screening of microplastics based on their type shape size and colour which is often enough to distinguish plastic particles in solid matrices ranging from 5 to 0 25 mm rocha santos and duarte 2017 however below 0 25 mm their identification is based on colour and shape leading to misclassification of the microplastics because of our inability to differentiate them inside the bulk sample lavers et al 2016 however they can be identified using an optical microscope and sem however a pre treatment is necessary to eliminate organic materials from microplastic which might also result in changes in the morphological features of plastics such as color or size leading to microplastic misidentification ruggero et al 2020 surprisingly various factors influence the effectiveness of identification such as plastic additives which hinder the identification of polymers like pigments and interfere during identification due to their small size and widespread in the environment yu et al 2018 furthermore microplastics look similar to non polymeric and sediment materials making the visual procedure more time consuming and error prone miri et al 2021 other approaches such as infrared spectroscopy thermogravimetric analysis differential scanning calorimetry and raman spectroscopy may detect particles as small as 20 μm but they are costly and restricted to certain applications recently the use of micro ftir ftir linked to microscope has increased as it facilitates sample mapping characterization of multiple polymers and identification of irregular shaped microplastic however it is quite an expensive and time consuming process miri et al 2021 there are no standard authorized protocols to determine small microplastic 1 micron in natural environmental samples and the use of large quantities of microplastics in ecotoxicological investigations may only be described as a proof of concept as there is not enough information to estimate the potential risk huvet et al 2016 furthermore to minimize misunderstanding of non ecologically realistic results microplastic concentrations in exposure experiments should be closer to environmentally realistic amounts previous research on microplastic contamination has shown their potential toxicity nevertheless additional information is needed to understand their toxicity and harm to human health previous reports on microplastic pollution demonstrated their potential toxicity however more data should be collected to clarify their toxicity and threat to human health recently a research reported the presence of microplastics in the human placenta ragusa et al 2021 but their presence in the placenta and associated potential harm to human health remains poorly understood the trophic transmission of microplastics is the major challenge in understanding the uncovered possible health hazards on the practical ground the major issue in preventing microplastic contamination in water bodies is the absence of technology that successfully retains microplastic at wastewater treatment plants generally microplastic studies reported the presence of microplastics in the final effluent nevertheless the details on microplastic removal at each step of the wastewater treatment plants wwtps are still inadequate the majority of microplastics in wwtps are removed through screening grit removal grease removal skimming sedimentation preliminary and primary treatment activated sludge secondary treatment and membrane bioreactor mbr rapid sand filter rsf disc filter df dissolved air flotation daf ultrafiltration uf reverse osmosis ro gravity filter etc tertiary treatment moreover the current technologies used in the wastewater treatment plant are not designed to effectively remove microplastic which allows a large portion of microplastics to be discharged into water bodies further sludge retains more microplastics and acts as a microplastics source as it releases microplastics into the environment during conventional sludge management practices such as landfilling the technologies specially targeted for microplastic removal are still in the preliminary stages of research sun et al 2019 furthermore they can be costly difficult to integrate into existing facilities and only employed when high quality standards are necessary e g membrane bioreactors the membrane bioreactor uses cross flow filtration to remove small microparticles but demands high operational energy which increases the operational cost the combination of different unit operations can be effective for microplastic removal but increases the complexity and capital cost of microplastic elimination in wwtps investigations towards boosting enzyme degradation efficiency and developing bioreactors for microplastic enzymic biotic depolymerization are still at the laboratory scale furthermore most bioplastic degradation studies have not considered the formation of microplastics miri et al 2021 recently the united nations environment program unep presented a report which assessed the substantial economic losses caused by plastic contamination in marine ecosystems smith 2014 microplastic contamination in the aquatic environment was also highlighted in the nature journal which called for more attention to these pollutants and their toxicity marris 2014 fortunately along with global climate change ozone depletion and ocean acidification microplastic pollution was identified as one of the biggest environmental challenges in 2015 yu et al 2018 however various laws and policies to control plastic pollution are not enough to regulate plastic production its consumption and finally proper disposal causing a significant increase in microplastics in the natural environment recently the covid 19 pandemic has changed the dynamics of microplastic exposure to humans and created a new source of a huge amount of microplastics in the environment in a short time as a result there is a greater chance of interaction ingestion and hazardous effects across food webs which has become a new challenge to explore the significant and potential impact of reusable face masks on humans and the environment shruti et al 2020b 10 conclusions and future perspectives the degradation of plastics has become an issue of concern because it produces microplastics that are a potential risk to the ecosystem humans animals and plants another area of research could be an evaluation of the potential effects of advanced treatment on microplastic levels in treated water it has been found that wastewater treatment plants wwtps release microplastics into the environment therefore detecting microplastic occurrences in wwtps is highly important for their effective control smaller microplastics of size smaller than 20 μm should be the focus of future studies as these being abundantly present in water enter the circulatory system of aquatic organisms removal of microplastics from wastewater should be the target area as wastewater treatment plants act as pathways for entering microplastics into natural aquatic systems future research should emphasize the fate of plastics in various environments and technology development to reduce plastic pollution more research is required on the formation and degradation of nanoplastics to assess their fate and environmental risks there is a crucial need for appropriate sampling identification and removal methods to detect microplastic pollution the impact of microplastics on humans is not adequately understood and this field needs to be explored further reuse refuse reduce recycle and rethink could be key factors in reducing microplastic pollution plastic products that are harmful to the environment should be banned or taxed the ban offers comprehensive protection against plastic microbead pollution in the nations microplastic production and consumption could be reduced by improving design and using alternative materials resulting in long lasting products that can replace plastics a deeper understanding is required to identify and effectively remove hotspots of plastic pollution in water scientific research should be conducted to minimize their discharge into rivers standard scientific microplastic sampling and extraction techniques should be explored to monitor risk assessment the potential toxicity of contaminants adsorbed on microplastic in the environment needs to be investigated further to understand point non point sources particle interactions and transport mechanisms for modelling and identifying contaminants source and accumulation in the river environment including river toxicity and biodiversity ultimately reducing consumption production and effective waste management is an effective strategy to reduce microplastic pollution the transportation of microplastics in sediments should

the adverse consequences of climate change many nations are predicted to face water shortages by 2050 exergoeconomic analysis of a geothermal 2021 this problem is anticipated to prompt the start of vast desalination plants across the globe particularly in dry regions gude 2018 advancements in seawater desalination for freshwater generation and cost savings have increased the development of desalination plants worldwide in recent years prajapati et al 2021a over 19 000 desalination plants have been established all around the globe in recent decades producing approximately 100 million cubic meters per day of freshwater exergoeconomic analysis of a geothermal 2021 however at this rate of freshwater generation just one percent of world freshwater needs can be met as a result more brackish and seawater desalination plants are needed all around the globe prajapati et al 2021a for desalination procedures seawater supplies unlimited feed water karagiannis and soldatos 2008 the second possible source is brackish water mainly derived from subsurface resources in many areas seawater has a salinity of 35 000 ppm on average ranges between 24 000 and 42 000 ppm depending on the site curto et al 2021 salt content is lower in brackish waters from 2000 to 10 000 ppm some regions such as geothermal reservoirs have been greater salt concentrations than seawater the salinity of geothermal waters can vary from 500 to 120 000 parts per million guidelines for drinking 2006 due to palatability world health organization who potable water recommendations for salinity below 500 ppm however no wellness tds standard value has been recommended prajapati et al 2021a desalination technologies comprise two types membrane and thermal based desalination distillation and evaporation unit operation is used in thermal desalination to remove salt from seawater or brackish water mahmoudi et al 2010a in contrast membrane desalination allows feed water to pass across a membrane while salts are almost totally retained membrane desalination includes electrodialysis ed kuroda et al 1987 ion exchange reverse osmosis ro henthorne and boysen 2015 and thermal desalination includes msf med thermal and vapour mechanical compression mazini et al 2014 the most often used methods in the world are ro and msf thermal desalination can be less expensive if there is sufficient waste heat available as a result thermal desalination units are typically located near fuel based power plants a technique known in the industry as co generation aybar 2004 when msf med and ro are compared it is obvious that when combined with a higher efficiency binary cycle steam power plant all procedures use less specific energy depending on the type gude et al 2010 thermal desalination is advantageous because low pressure steam has reduced exergy with the high salt content of the water source a med with a high performance ratio pr may be competitive with ro aly et al 2022 as shown in fig 1 the majority of desalination plants are located in north africa and the middle east with 4826 plants accounting for 47 5 percent of global desalination capacity followed by central asia and eastern europe with 566 plants accounting for 2 4 percent of global capacity and sub saharan africa with 303 plants accounting for 1 9 percent of global capacity additionally nations like the united arab emirates uae israel and saudi arabia utilize desalinated water to meet more than half of their need used for industrial and residential applications and electricity agriculture defense and other purposes bundschuh et al 2021 desalination plants high dependence on coal and oil for mechanical and thermal energy has resulted in serious environmental problems prajapati et al 2021a this has prompted efforts to combine renewable energy sources into desalination processes to provide some or all of the energy needed geothermal wind and solar energy are the most widespread renewable energy sources european commission 1998 shahzad et al 2017 discussed that energy is produced using renewable energy sources that are usually rechargeable and unlimited desalination technologies powered by renewable forms of energy are expected to supply freshwater with high asset accessibility at a minimal cost papapetrou et al 2017 the expense of producing freshwater through desalination processes is influenced by site specific parameters like tds of feed water local energy prices and water product quality shah et al 2019 the appropriate selection and optimal design of renewable resources in a place on the other hand could significantly lower the cost of freshwater generation from renewable energy desalination plants exergoeconomic analysis of a geothermal 2021 geothermal energy among the different sources of renewable energy can be utilized to satisfy a consistent power requirement such as a cogeneration desalination plant without the need for power storage gude 2018 the amount of energy is constant throughout the year and geothermal energy can be used as an indirect or direct source of freshwater generation when integrated with a desalination plant regions with widely accessible sea brackish water and high quality geothermal energy are suitable options for geothermal desalination huang and liu 2010 the development of geothermal energy systems involves many stages including exploration drilling plant or reservoir development and electrical power generation with recent advancements in geothermal technologies the range and scope of geothermal systems for the home agricultural and industrial sectors have expanded geothermal energy is an environmentally friendly method of generating electricity hot water or dry steam with temperatures usually ranging from 80 to 150 c is collected and supplied to the power plant via drilled wells the temperature at the steam turbine s first or second pass is still high enough in the power plant to run a low temperature desalination technology such as multi effect distillation med or membrane desalination in certain geothermal desalination systems hot water or dry steam is immediately used to make freshwater whereas in others electricity is generated first and then used in the desalination system other types of geothermal based systems include dual and multi generation systems which use geothermal energy integrated with other renewable energy sources to power desalination and other power generation in kimolos island greece a pilot med desalination plant powered by geothermal heat was developed karytsas et al 2004 fytikas et al 2005 the geothermal energy source has a temperature of 61 c and powers the med system which produces freshwater at 75 cubic meters per hour karytsas et al 2004 showed that utilizing low medium temperature geothermal heat can offset 453 600 kg of oil per year another geothermal based med plant was constructed in texas producing an average of 120 m3 of fresh water per day birney et al 2019 in texas the highest temperature underground is approximately 150 c at depths of 3000 4000 m birney et al 2019 show that as the geothermal fluid mass flow rate increases from 30 to 90 kg s the geothermal med system s freshwater production rate increases from 121 to 1132 m3 day missimer et al missimer and maliva 2018 proposed a geothermal power cycle and desalination pilot plant for the cogeneration of energy and freshwater the steam turbine in the system is powered by high pressure high temperature steam approximately 300 c recovered from the production well at a pressure of 6 7 mpa the reverse osmosis desalination uses some of the electricity generated by the steam turbine and for the operation of med and membrane desalination systems steam from the turbine outlet is used this study gives an overview of the geothermal integrated multi effect distillation med desalination system the application of geothermal heat with modern technologies has also been examined the focus of this research is to desalinate saltwater using available geothermal energy while using desalination technology geothermal hot water sources can significantly reduce energy use environmental impact and water costs the first section reviews saltwater quality and desalination techniques ranging from membrane to thermal processes emphasizing critical technical elements and future development possibilities the second portion presents geothermal energy integrated med for freshwater production and the third section discusses future challenges and opportunities in desalination technology 2 seawater desalination technologies it is necessary to desalinate water to separate ordinary salts sodium chloride from saline water to produce potable water karagiannis and soldatos 2008 brackish water with a saline taste typically is not used since it is unfit for human consumption guidelines for drinking 2006 the water that comes into desalination plants sea or brackish splits into two streams fresh water product water and brine by product stream freshwater meets the criteria for drinking or other use whereas brine water has a high salt concentration and is contaminated nafey et al 2006 desalination can be classified based on the desalination technology used or the feedwater source for example seawater sw contributes 61 percent of feedwater followed by brackish water bw which contributes 21 percent and river water provides less than 10 percent esmaeilion 2020 many desalination techniques have been established however not all are dependable and commercially viable the most fundamental desalination methods are categorized into two sections fig 2 ninety seven percent of desalination plants are comprised of thermal and membrane technologies to prevent corrosion foaming biological growth scaling and fouling these procedures need a chemical pre treatment of raw saltwater and chemical post treatment takabatake et al 2021 on average thermal desalination technologies use more energy than membrane based desalination technologies abdelkareem et al 2018 table 1 illustrates that excessive power consumption significantly affects desalination economics and that energy consumption is among the most frequently utilized saline water desalination techniques multi effect distillation and multi stage flash are thermal processes that account for approximately 18 percent and 7 percent of projected global desalination capacity amy et al 2017 desalination technologies under development are very new having recently been researched and developed simultaneously they seem promising but they have not been fully commercialized or scaled up unlike membrane or thermal techniques these sophisticated approaches need new expertise or a combination of thermal and membrane desalination techniques esmaeilion 2020 another type of commercial desalination system utilizes membranes rather than phase change electrodialysis ed and reverse osmosis ro are the two methods ali et al 2018 either shaft power or electricity runs the pump in these cases this raises the saltwater solution s pressure to the desired level for seawater desalination the desired pressure varies depending on the salt present in the saline water supply although it is typically approximately 70 bar the ionization of water purified using appropriate membranes positioned at the two electrodes that are appositively charged is also required for ed lee et al 2011 msf and ro are the most common procedures accounting for 44 and 42 percent of global capacity the msf process accounts for over 93 percent of the thermal process output while the ro process accounts for around 88 percent of the membrane process output prajapati et al 2021b the first desalination process was developed by g and j weir of glasgow scotland in 1885 until world war ii this organization which was afterward renamed weir westgarth had a near monopoly as a manufacturer of seawater desalination weir 2013 charles rajesh kumar and majid charles rajesh kumar and majid 2020 discussed that the 1st desalination project in the arab gulf countries was built in jeddah by a dutch company in 1907 the same plant was modified in 1928 on king abdulaziz al saud s command with two weir westgarth plants net annual production of 135 m3 day kuwait qatar commenced construction of extensive desalination facilities in 1953 in qatar a desalination system with five units and a capacity of 682 0 m3 day was installed whereas kuwait deployed 10 units with a capacity of 4545 4 m3 day in 1955 shuwaikh added ten additional units of the same size kuwait as a result desalination plants have grown in popularity around the globe resulting in the establishment of companies such as società italiana resine in italy krupp in germany and westinghouse in the united states flaccovioeditore 2010 thermal processes typically demand significant heat energy which would be derived from coal and oil whereas membrane activities primarily require electrical power raluy et al 2005 therefore the most crucial issue of future water shortages is supplying energy for these technologies for producing freshwater water desalination of any kind can be combined with renewable energy sources renewable energy sources typically provide electricity and heat for the process geothermal energy available 24 h a day is among the renewable energy options for desalination gude et al 2010 3 geothermal integrated multi effect distillation med system desalination technologies need considerable energy to separate salts from the sea or brackish water this is crucial because it is a recurring expense that only a few of the world s water scarce regions can pay because of their oil revenues several middle eastern nations have the capital to spend in and operate desalination plants however many people in other parts of the world lack the financial and oil resources necessary to operate in the same way the considerable rise in desalinated water supply will result in several issues the most serious linked to energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions produced by fossil fuel usage shahzad et al 2017 renewable energy systems generate energy from naturally occurring resources their key feature is that they are environmentally safe and do not release harmful pollutants mathioulakis et al 2007 desalination technology driven by renewable energy systems is a viable solution to water scarcity in distant places where conventional energy resources like heat and the electrical grid are unavailable several sustainable energy integrated desalination demonstration facilities have been constructed across the globe with most of them successfully running for many years most of them are specifically made for areas and create freshwater using solar wind or geothermal energy fig 3 these units operational data and expertise may improve reliability and save costs however even though renewable energy driven desalination facilities cannot compare with conventional methods when it comes to the cost of producing water they may be useful in some circumstances in the future years they are expected to become more widely accepted choices hasanyüksel 2013 3 1 geothermal energy it has been utilized for power production and direct usage in various regions of the globe for over three decades effectively as one of the natural and ecologically acceptable energy supplies various advantages make geothermal energy a viable alternative to traditional and other renewable energy sources the characteristics of geothermal energy koroneos and roumbas 2012 it is a localized source of energy that may decrease the consumption of petroleum fuels resulting in significant environmental benefits it is both economical and efficient with traditional energy sources unlike other renewable sources of energy geothermal heat is not limited by seasonal changes it includes built in storage and is suitable for base load needs many nations have access to geothermal energy as well the temperatures of geothermal fluid range from 80 to 110 c in the upper layers of the crust to 3251 c at 700 1400 m low temperature geothermal fluids in the top 100 m have been proved in study results to be a viable source of energy for desalination however an economic assessment of geothermal desalination that took into account 110 130 c found that the cost of integrated geothermal desalination is high compared to the expense of larger multi effect dual purpose units koroneos and roumbas 2012 many researchers have described geothermal energy s industrial and economic possibilities and environmental effects table 2 shows how geothermal resources are often categorized based on williams 1975 classification system these renewable sources estimated annual ambient temperature ranges from approximately 20 c to over 300 c in general geothermal resources exceeding 150 c are utilized to produce electricity while chena hot springs resort in alaska employs a 74 c geothermal resource to generate electricity in direct use projects resources below 150 c are often utilized for heating and cooling geothermal heat pumps may offer cooling and heating at temperatures ranging from 5 to 30 c huang and liu 2010 we do not require thermal storage while running desalination facilities on geothermal energy compared to other sustainable sources such as wind and solar power the energy production of this supply is typically more constant many low enthalpy geothermal resources may be accessible within a few hundred meters of the surface the high enthalpy geothermal resources are commonly exploited around 1 and 3 km below the surface tomaszewska et al 2020 less drilling is required for low enthalpy geothermal heat exploration and exploitation accounting for most exploration and exploitation expenditures it s cheaper to use non corrosive plastic pipes less aggressive liquids to pipes and less mineralization and equipment when extracting geothermal heat since lower temperatures equal lower costs kalogirou 2005 it is possible to utilize geothermal energy to directly heat brackish or saline water in the multi effect distillation process houcine et al 1999 and create power for running reverse osmosis systems in desalination plants ophir 1982 kalogirou et al kalogirou 2005 investigated the feasibility of utilizing geothermal sources between 75 c and 90 c to power a multi effect boiling meb system using technical and economic analysis in terms of thermodynamic efficiency the med operation was the first and most efficient desalination technique druetta et al 2013 according to goosen et al 2010 the first med plant in the 1950s a triple effect submerged tube evaporator was installed in kuwait while the first desalination system was developed med failed to attract attention pipe scaling is more common in this procedure than in other thermal desalination methods aliewi et al 2017 in addition evaporators called effects might be used in the med system each of which reduces air pressure mazini et al 2014 using this technique enables the saltwater to heat up again and again without additional heat after being preheated in tubes seawater has entered the first effect and is now permitted to reach its boiling point fig 4 piacentino and cardona 2010 to improve the evaporation rate seawater is sprayed over the tubes ermis et al 2017 the tubes are heated by steam supplied from a steam generation section the condensed steam is recirculated throughout the power plant as boiler source water the number of effects in the multi effect distillation plant determines the unit s steam efficiency the thermal gradient and the minimum temperature difference between effects restrict the total number of effects the seawater that was used for the first effect disappears almost entirely afterward the remaining of the feed water is sent to the second effect which is again supplied to a tube el dessouky et al 1998 the vapours formed in the first effect heat these tubes this vapour had earlier been condensed into a water product generating heat energy and allowing some of the ocean s excess water for evaporation the condensation evaporation systems are continued from effect to effect each at a decreasing temperature and pressure this is continued with various effects with a usual large plant producing 3 20 effects and a 10 17 output ratio fig 4 bamufleh et al 2017 in the first effect some few units have mostly been fitted to function with a tbt of roughly 70 75 c which reduces the risk of seawater scaling despite raising the requirement for greater heat transfer area in the form of a tube a med unit utilizes less energy than an msf unit and its efficiency ratio is also significantly greater piacentino and cardona 2010 consequently in terms of thermodynamics and heat transport med is superior to msf ghaffour et al 2015 the tubes might be vertical horizontal or submerged in med plants the size of low temperature med units has progressively increased two med units in sharjah uae are installed with a capacity of 22 700 m3 day to produce freshwater large med plants have seen the most prospective approaches in the middle east med units are still in the minority compared to msf units but their numbers continuously grow karagiannis and soldatos 2008 for distillation operations like the med geothermal energy is suitable unlike other renewable energy geothermal energy is not constrained by climatic factors it comes with built in storage and is suitable for base load needs the med procedure seems to be excellent for generating drinkable water from low enthalpy geothermal resources during the plant s operation the environmental effect is minimal the med method may be combined with a geothermal powered power plant to improve overall performance by using excess heat as a result the consumption of fossil fuels is drastically decreased resulting in many area sustainability improvements examples of effective geothermal desalination installation have been reported in the literature table 3 in 1996 a geothermal integrated desalination plant with a capacity of approximately three m3 h was developed and operated in south tunisia employing a novel desalination method called aero evapo condensation and supplied with brackish geothermal water of 65 c temperature koroneos and roumbas 2012 a feasibility study for a suggested plan on the greek island of milos which is established in the cyclades islands has revealed that the island s high geothermal possibility can be harnessed through the use of an organic rankine cycle turbogenerator power generation unit with an annual production of 300 kw which is combined to a multi effect distillation unit with a built desalinating water capacity of 80 t h using geothermal heat and an absorption chiller powered by the hot fluid at 85 c the equipment produces a comfortable temperature for the user gude 2018 sephton water technology has created a prototype to simulate process variables for a demonstration project to demonstrate its potential in commercial and industrial applications they employed med to decrease saltiness in the salton sea by using noncommercial low pressure steam at a temperature of 100 c from a geothermal energy station they used a vertical tube evaporator distillation technique the pilot unit med and vte two effects and the demonstration unit med and vtw 15 effects generated 18 91 and 79 51 m3 of product water per day respectively and used 454 and 3402 kg h reddy and ghaffour 2007 tomaszewska et al 2021 investigated the coastline geothermal prospects at la joya and compared msf and med solutions for geothermal seawater desalination the authors created and tested a prototype geothermal desalination system in the lab with all units heated desalination of 20 m3 per day was achieved using 118 m3 of geothermal groundwater heated to 80 c casimiro et al 2014 developed a design for a concurrent feed med tvc combined into a csp plant examining yearly power and water output for various cooling systems in recent decades advances have been made in generating electricity using high temperature geothermal resources demonstrating that this energy might be a viable option for seawater desalination ghaffour et al 2015 the aero evapo condensation technique was used to experiment with a desalination unit a polypropylene falling fill evaporator and condenser make up the system it was developed to operate at low temperatures 70 90 c and utilize geothermal resources bourouni and chaibi 2005 two geothermal powered distillation units were built in france another in tunisia s south with polypropylene evaporators and condensers operating in the 60 90 c range houcine et al 1999 greece and turkey have a significant amount of geothermal energy kilic 2016 especially during the summer months many smaller islands rely on costly water supplies mahmoudi et al 2009 the concept of industrial scale geothermal integrated desalination has not been substantially examined so far despite the abundance of geothermal resources available goosen et al 2010 there is just one geothermal desalination plant at pilot size med two stages erected on kimolos island in 2000 and is now working the unit can generate 80 m3 of freshwater per day from 1440 m3 of geothermal water at 60 61 c tapped at a depth of 188 m although a feasibility study conducted on milos island in the 1990s yielded highly encouraging findings the project has not yet progressed to constructing a geothermal integrated desalination plant the study estimated the availability of geothermal water at temperatures ranging from 55 to 98 c at shallow depths 85 184 m to be 12 840 m3 per day using seven production wells and suggested the design of a geothermal integrated seawater desalination annual production capacity of 75 80 m3 per day of freshwater mahmoudi et al 2010a however identifying geothermal capacity would deliver heat to much larger capacities other feasibility studies have been carried out in sousaki korinthos where the construction of a med or msf unit and low enthalpy geothermal energy might generate around 225 m3 per day on the island of nysyros according to the results of the research mahmoudi et al 2010b reddy and ghaffour 2007 investigated water desalination cost methods in selecting the most suitable technique for a specific area their research took location energy cost and feed water in turkey sanaye et al 2013 created a mathematical model of multi effect distillation that included renewable energy the model included heat and mass transport equations a continuity equation thermodynamic laws and thermodynamic connections for each sub system the simulation program was created in the visual basic programming language khademi rahimpour and jahanmiri khademi et al 2009 simulated optimized a 6 effect evaporator they suggested a model in which each block s equations were stated in the steady state form they offered a simulation optimization of the process using these equations their findings are in line with the outcomes of the experiments abdel jabbar et al 2007 published software that uses visual basic program to simulate single multi effect evaporation desalination their software used the heat transfer area power usage and pricing formulae the program s output was in perfect accord with the dataset darwish et al 2015 investigated many msf med desalination systems they examined the impact of fundamental desalination variables on production cost their findings demonstrated that a multi effect distillation is a promising option using a low temperature heat source reducing the temperature difference between impacts to less than 2 c dramatically enhances the heat transmission aybar 2004 studied a med system that utilizes waste heat from the power plant as a heating source they completed the energy mass balance of system a four effect desalination system uses waste heat from a gas turbine power plant the results showed that the top brine temperature has only a minor effect on the gained output ratio parallel and parallel crossflow multi effect evaporation were examined by el dessouky and ettouney el dessouky et al 2002 according to their findings parallel crossflow has significant efficiency on the other hand the parallel flow has comparable performance characteristics and is easier to build design and operate than the crossflow desalination system bachellerie ijeridi 2012 discussed that desalinated water was generated using low enthalpy geothermal energy in 2013 using different geothermal combined desalination geothermal ro and med desalination the geothermal med and ro procedures use geothermal dual power plant heat to generate 30 000 m3 day of product water traditional energy based desalination technologies are much less effective at supplying freshwater in this situation than a geothermal integrated med ro plant as can be seen both seawater desalination techniques in the gulf cooperation council nations coastal zones keep showing potential for cost effective desalination in 2008 geothermal energy drove a saltwater desalination unit in baja california mexico the plant includes a combination of med msf or hybrid desalination of both technologies called multi flash with heater mfwh system a plant s optimal capacity is roughly 1 m3 day when 4 m3 of seawater is accessible at 150 c a corresponding temperature of 80 c and 14 m3 of geothermal fluid is supplied loutatidou and arafat 2015 desalination was used to produce energy and freshwater on the greek island of milos in 2004 they built a hybrid framework by integrating geothermal with solar energy the plant s capacity is around 80 m3 h to produce freshwater and it employs a med unit this plant produced 470 kw of power using an orc system with a seven percent orc thermal capacity the cost of producing freshwater m3 per unit is about 2 christ et al 2017 michelle et al 2013 discussed a low enthalpy geothermal energy operated desalination plant on the greek island of milos the suggested system links med systems to geothermal groundwater between 80 and 85 c the estimates show that low enthalpy geothermal energy might save 5000 toe per year for a facility that can produce 600 800 m3 of freshwater per day using geothermal energy with med tvc sf and msf thermal desalination may save significant amounts of energy by reducing preheating energy demand gude 2016a discusses a combined med msf system being tested at a proposed geothermal energy plant in baja california mexico at 80 c geothermal sources might be utilized for heating the optimal freshwater to geothermal resource fluid proportion was determined to be 1 14 another review investigated through an msf med geothermal desalination unit on the seashore the framework was developed and tested at 80 c geothermal sources the research claimed a 1 5 9 proportion of freshwater to geothermal energy fig 5 depicts a geothermal integrated desalination system a geothermal based desalination system includes geothermal production well injection well and multi effect distillation units saturated liquid water geofluid is extracted from the production well the geothermal fluid is then flashed in the primary effect and the vapour part leaving at the top and the liquid component leaving at the bottom and being injected back into the well the vapour from the med system s primary effect condenses and provides heat energy for the desalination system before being released into the injection well the condensed steam goes via a heat exchanger reducing its temperature table 4 compares the different desalination plants mentioned earlier from the milos kimolos project has shown that integrated geothermal desalination on a small scale is financially possible because of the region s significant geothermal potential the desalination process may be scaled up to commercial levels and geothermal integrated desalination prices might be further reduced due to economies of scale koroneos and roumbas 2012 med with tvc might be suitable among many desalination processes this is mainly related to a negative pressure distillation condition wherein seawater s boiling point drops considerably the boiling point of various effects within the med tvc desalination process is generally around 323 15 and 343 15 k with the final effect being even below at 313 15 k as a result if the temperature is greater than that of the lowest boiling point different low grade sources of energy might be utilized this way opens up the possibility of utilizing low grade excess heat and sustainable sources to power the med tvc desalination process yilmaz and söylemez 2012 the desalination market is dominated by multi effect distillation med with different configurations of thermal vapour compression med tvc in which motive steam at 3 bar and 140 c induce vapour entrainment at low pressure from the intermediate effect to increase its pressure and use as heating steam in the first effect in a med tvc arrangement tang et al 2018 therefore steam usage is less with tvc than with a traditional med unit yielding a more significant gain output ratio gor which is described as the mass flow rate of the distillate produced divided by the used motive steam flow rate however both motive pressure and compression ratios limit the tvc entrainment capacity as far as the compression ratio rises the expansion pressure ratio will rise with the compression ratio this implies that a considerable amount of motive steam usually about 20 bar is essential to process a large amount of vapour from the final effect on the other hand this high pressure steam is more costly than the low pressure steam at 3 bar alasfour et al 2005 4 future scope and conclusion as a result of fossil fuel burning greenhouse gases such as co2 are released into the atmosphere causing climate change in addition the growth of the world s population and the need for more energy have led to increased fossil fuel depletion consequently both developing and developed countries are searching for alternative energy sources as a result there has been an increase in the importance of sustainable development energy security and low carbon technologies in social and political discussions geothermal energy is a local energy resource that is consistent sustainable has low air pollution and compensates for the high air pollution of oil and coal powered units has minimal environmental consequences is burning free and has significant environmental effects geothermal energy is suitable for distillation processes such as the med unlike other renewable energy sources geothermal energy is unaffected by weather it has built in storage and is appropriate for base load applications the med process seems ideal for producing drinking water from geothermal resources with low enthalpy the environmental impact of the plant is negligible while it is in operation the med approach may be combined with a geothermal powered power plant to increase overall performance by using extra heat the use of fossil fuels has been dramatically reduced resulting in a significant improvement in many areas of sustainability finally it highlights the challenges involved geothermal desalination technologies research must be accelerated a more extensive evaluation of the worldwide possibilities for low to moderate enthalpy geothermal liquids both on and off shore sources the construction of elaborate geothermal integrated desalination on a commercial basis integrating established thermal desalination technologies including such msf med with emerging technologies taking into account all components required for a finished desalination process carrying out extensive economic modeling to analyses all feasible configurations for geothermal combined desalination processes

the adverse consequences of climate change many nations are predicted to face water shortages by 2050 exergoeconomic analysis of a geothermal 2021 this problem is anticipated to prompt the start of vast desalination plants across the globe particularly in dry regions gude 2018 advancements in seawater desalination for freshwater generation and cost savings have increased the development of desalination plants worldwide in recent years prajapati et al 2021a over 19 000 desalination plants have been established all around the globe in recent decades producing approximately 100 million cubic meters per day of freshwater exergoeconomic analysis of a geothermal 2021 however at this rate of freshwater generation just one percent of world freshwater needs can be met as a result more brackish and seawater desalination plants are needed all around the globe prajapati et al 2021a for desalination procedures seawater supplies unlimited feed water karagiannis and soldatos 2008 the second possible source is brackish water mainly derived from subsurface resources in many areas seawater has a salinity of 35 000 ppm on average ranges between 24 000 and 42 000 ppm depending on the site curto et al 2021 salt content is lower in brackish waters from 2000 to 10 000 ppm some regions such as geothermal reservoirs have been greater salt concentrations than seawater the salinity of geothermal waters can vary from 500 to 120 000 parts per million guidelines for drinking 2006 due to palatability world health organization who potable water recommendations for salinity below 500 ppm however no wellness tds standard value has been recommended prajapati et al 2021a desalination technologies comprise two types membrane and thermal based desalination distillation and evaporation unit operation is used in thermal desalination to remove salt from seawater or brackish water mahmoudi et al 2010a in contrast membrane desalination allows feed water to pass across a membrane while salts are almost totally retained membrane desalination includes electrodialysis ed kuroda et al 1987 ion exchange reverse osmosis ro henthorne and boysen 2015 and thermal desalination includes msf med thermal and vapour mechanical compression mazini et al 2014 the most often used methods in the world are ro and msf thermal desalination can be less expensive if there is sufficient waste heat available as a result thermal desalination units are typically located near fuel based power plants a technique known in the industry as co generation aybar 2004 when msf med and ro are compared it is obvious that when combined with a higher efficiency binary cycle steam power plant all procedures use less specific energy depending on the type gude et al 2010 thermal desalination is advantageous because low pressure steam has reduced exergy with the high salt content of the water source a med with a high performance ratio pr may be competitive with ro aly et al 2022 as shown in fig 1 the majority of desalination plants are located in north africa and the middle east with 4826 plants accounting for 47 5 percent of global desalination capacity followed by central asia and eastern europe with 566 plants accounting for 2 4 percent of global capacity and sub saharan africa with 303 plants accounting for 1 9 percent of global capacity additionally nations like the united arab emirates uae israel and saudi arabia utilize desalinated water to meet more than half of their need used for industrial and residential applications and electricity agriculture defense and other purposes bundschuh et al 2021 desalination plants high dependence on coal and oil for mechanical and thermal energy has resulted in serious environmental problems prajapati et al 2021a this has prompted efforts to combine renewable energy sources into desalination processes to provide some or all of the energy needed geothermal wind and solar energy are the most widespread renewable energy sources european commission 1998 shahzad et al 2017 discussed that energy is produced using renewable energy sources that are usually rechargeable and unlimited desalination technologies powered by renewable forms of energy are expected to supply freshwater with high asset accessibility at a minimal cost papapetrou et al 2017 the expense of producing freshwater through desalination processes is influenced by site specific parameters like tds of feed water local energy prices and water product quality shah et al 2019 the appropriate selection and optimal design of renewable resources in a place on the other hand could significantly lower the cost of freshwater generation from renewable energy desalination plants exergoeconomic analysis of a geothermal 2021 geothermal energy among the different sources of renewable energy can be utilized to satisfy a consistent power requirement such as a cogeneration desalination plant without the need for power storage gude 2018 the amount of energy is constant throughout the year and geothermal energy can be used as an indirect or direct source of freshwater generation when integrated with a desalination plant regions with widely accessible sea brackish water and high quality geothermal energy are suitable options for geothermal desalination huang and liu 2010 the development of geothermal energy systems involves many stages including exploration drilling plant or reservoir development and electrical power generation with recent advancements in geothermal technologies the range and scope of geothermal systems for the home agricultural and industrial sectors have expanded geothermal energy is an environmentally friendly method of generating electricity hot water or dry steam with temperatures usually ranging from 80 to 150 c is collected and supplied to the power plant via drilled wells the temperature at the steam turbine s first or second pass is still high enough in the power plant to run a low temperature desalination technology such as multi effect distillation med or membrane desalination in certain geothermal desalination systems hot water or dry steam is immediately used to make freshwater whereas in others electricity is generated first and then used in the desalination system other types of geothermal based systems include dual and multi generation systems which use geothermal energy integrated with other renewable energy sources to power desalination and other power generation in kimolos island greece a pilot med desalination plant powered by geothermal heat was developed karytsas et al 2004 fytikas et al 2005 the geothermal energy source has a temperature of 61 c and powers the med system which produces freshwater at 75 cubic meters per hour karytsas et al 2004 showed that utilizing low medium temperature geothermal heat can offset 453 600 kg of oil per year another geothermal based med plant was constructed in texas producing an average of 120 m3 of fresh water per day birney et al 2019 in texas the highest temperature underground is approximately 150 c at depths of 3000 4000 m birney et al 2019 show that as the geothermal fluid mass flow rate increases from 30 to 90 kg s the geothermal med system s freshwater production rate increases from 121 to 1132 m3 day missimer et al missimer and maliva 2018 proposed a geothermal power cycle and desalination pilot plant for the cogeneration of energy and freshwater the steam turbine in the system is powered by high pressure high temperature steam approximately 300 c recovered from the production well at a pressure of 6 7 mpa the reverse osmosis desalination uses some of the electricity generated by the steam turbine and for the operation of med and membrane desalination systems steam from the turbine outlet is used this study gives an overview of the geothermal integrated multi effect distillation med desalination system the application of geothermal heat with modern technologies has also been examined the focus of this research is to desalinate saltwater using available geothermal energy while using desalination technology geothermal hot water sources can significantly reduce energy use environmental impact and water costs the first section reviews saltwater quality and desalination techniques ranging from membrane to thermal processes emphasizing critical technical elements and future development possibilities the second portion presents geothermal energy integrated med for freshwater production and the third section discusses future challenges and opportunities in desalination technology 2 seawater desalination technologies it is necessary to desalinate water to separate ordinary salts sodium chloride from saline water to produce potable water karagiannis and soldatos 2008 brackish water with a saline taste typically is not used since it is unfit for human consumption guidelines for drinking 2006 the water that comes into desalination plants sea or brackish splits into two streams fresh water product water and brine by product stream freshwater meets the criteria for drinking or other use whereas brine water has a high salt concentration and is contaminated nafey et al 2006 desalination can be classified based on the desalination technology used or the feedwater source for example seawater sw contributes 61 percent of feedwater followed by brackish water bw which contributes 21 percent and river water provides less than 10 percent esmaeilion 2020 many desalination techniques have been established however not all are dependable and commercially viable the most fundamental desalination methods are categorized into two sections fig 2 ninety seven percent of desalination plants are comprised of thermal and membrane technologies to prevent corrosion foaming biological growth scaling and fouling these procedures need a chemical pre treatment of raw saltwater and chemical post treatment takabatake et al 2021 on average thermal desalination technologies use more energy than membrane based desalination technologies abdelkareem et al 2018 table 1 illustrates that excessive power consumption significantly affects desalination economics and that energy consumption is among the most frequently utilized saline water desalination techniques multi effect distillation and multi stage flash are thermal processes that account for approximately 18 percent and 7 percent of projected global desalination capacity amy et al 2017 desalination technologies under development are very new having recently been researched and developed simultaneously they seem promising but they have not been fully commercialized or scaled up unlike membrane or thermal techniques these sophisticated approaches need new expertise or a combination of thermal and membrane desalination techniques esmaeilion 2020 another type of commercial desalination system utilizes membranes rather than phase change electrodialysis ed and reverse osmosis ro are the two methods ali et al 2018 either shaft power or electricity runs the pump in these cases this raises the saltwater solution s pressure to the desired level for seawater desalination the desired pressure varies depending on the salt present in the saline water supply although it is typically approximately 70 bar the ionization of water purified using appropriate membranes positioned at the two electrodes that are appositively charged is also required for ed lee et al 2011 msf and ro are the most common procedures accounting for 44 and 42 percent of global capacity the msf process accounts for over 93 percent of the thermal process output while the ro process accounts for around 88 percent of the membrane process output prajapati et al 2021b the first desalination process was developed by g and j weir of glasgow scotland in 1885 until world war ii this organization which was afterward renamed weir westgarth had a near monopoly as a manufacturer of seawater desalination weir 2013 charles rajesh kumar and majid charles rajesh kumar and majid 2020 discussed that the 1st desalination project in the arab gulf countries was built in jeddah by a dutch company in 1907 the same plant was modified in 1928 on king abdulaziz al saud s command with two weir westgarth plants net annual production of 135 m3 day kuwait qatar commenced construction of extensive desalination facilities in 1953 in qatar a desalination system with five units and a capacity of 682 0 m3 day was installed whereas kuwait deployed 10 units with a capacity of 4545 4 m3 day in 1955 shuwaikh added ten additional units of the same size kuwait as a result desalination plants have grown in popularity around the globe resulting in the establishment of companies such as società italiana resine in italy krupp in germany and westinghouse in the united states flaccovioeditore 2010 thermal processes typically demand significant heat energy which would be derived from coal and oil whereas membrane activities primarily require electrical power raluy et al 2005 therefore the most crucial issue of future water shortages is supplying energy for these technologies for producing freshwater water desalination of any kind can be combined with renewable energy sources renewable energy sources typically provide electricity and heat for the process geothermal energy available 24 h a day is among the renewable energy options for desalination gude et al 2010 3 geothermal integrated multi effect distillation med system desalination technologies need considerable energy to separate salts from the sea or brackish water this is crucial because it is a recurring expense that only a few of the world s water scarce regions can pay because of their oil revenues several middle eastern nations have the capital to spend in and operate desalination plants however many people in other parts of the world lack the financial and oil resources necessary to operate in the same way the considerable rise in desalinated water supply will result in several issues the most serious linked to energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions produced by fossil fuel usage shahzad et al 2017 renewable energy systems generate energy from naturally occurring resources their key feature is that they are environmentally safe and do not release harmful pollutants mathioulakis et al 2007 desalination technology driven by renewable energy systems is a viable solution to water scarcity in distant places where conventional energy resources like heat and the electrical grid are unavailable several sustainable energy integrated desalination demonstration facilities have been constructed across the globe with most of them successfully running for many years most of them are specifically made for areas and create freshwater using solar wind or geothermal energy fig 3 these units operational data and expertise may improve reliability and save costs however even though renewable energy driven desalination facilities cannot compare with conventional methods when it comes to the cost of producing water they may be useful in some circumstances in the future years they are expected to become more widely accepted choices hasanyüksel 2013 3 1 geothermal energy it has been utilized for power production and direct usage in various regions of the globe for over three decades effectively as one of the natural and ecologically acceptable energy supplies various advantages make geothermal energy a viable alternative to traditional and other renewable energy sources the characteristics of geothermal energy koroneos and roumbas 2012 it is a localized source of energy that may decrease the consumption of petroleum fuels resulting in significant environmental benefits it is both economical and efficient with traditional energy sources unlike other renewable sources of energy geothermal heat is not limited by seasonal changes it includes built in storage and is suitable for base load needs many nations have access to geothermal energy as well the temperatures of geothermal fluid range from 80 to 110 c in the upper layers of the crust to 3251 c at 700 1400 m low temperature geothermal fluids in the top 100 m have been proved in study results to be a viable source of energy for desalination however an economic assessment of geothermal desalination that took into account 110 130 c found that the cost of integrated geothermal desalination is high compared to the expense of larger multi effect dual purpose units koroneos and roumbas 2012 many researchers have described geothermal energy s industrial and economic possibilities and environmental effects table 2 shows how geothermal resources are often categorized based on williams 1975 classification system these renewable sources estimated annual ambient temperature ranges from approximately 20 c to over 300 c in general geothermal resources exceeding 150 c are utilized to produce electricity while chena hot springs resort in alaska employs a 74 c geothermal resource to generate electricity in direct use projects resources below 150 c are often utilized for heating and cooling geothermal heat pumps may offer cooling and heating at temperatures ranging from 5 to 30 c huang and liu 2010 we do not require thermal storage while running desalination facilities on geothermal energy compared to other sustainable sources such as wind and solar power the energy production of this supply is typically more constant many low enthalpy geothermal resources may be accessible within a few hundred meters of the surface the high enthalpy geothermal resources are commonly exploited around 1 and 3 km below the surface tomaszewska et al 2020 less drilling is required for low enthalpy geothermal heat exploration and exploitation accounting for most exploration and exploitation expenditures it s cheaper to use non corrosive plastic pipes less aggressive liquids to pipes and less mineralization and equipment when extracting geothermal heat since lower temperatures equal lower costs kalogirou 2005 it is possible to utilize geothermal energy to directly heat brackish or saline water in the multi effect distillation process houcine et al 1999 and create power for running reverse osmosis systems in desalination plants ophir 1982 kalogirou et al kalogirou 2005 investigated the feasibility of utilizing geothermal sources between 75 c and 90 c to power a multi effect boiling meb system using technical and economic analysis in terms of thermodynamic efficiency the med operation was the first and most efficient desalination technique druetta et al 2013 according to goosen et al 2010 the first med plant in the 1950s a triple effect submerged tube evaporator was installed in kuwait while the first desalination system was developed med failed to attract attention pipe scaling is more common in this procedure than in other thermal desalination methods aliewi et al 2017 in addition evaporators called effects might be used in the med system each of which reduces air pressure mazini et al 2014 using this technique enables the saltwater to heat up again and again without additional heat after being preheated in tubes seawater has entered the first effect and is now permitted to reach its boiling point fig 4 piacentino and cardona 2010 to improve the evaporation rate seawater is sprayed over the tubes ermis et al 2017 the tubes are heated by steam supplied from a steam generation section the condensed steam is recirculated throughout the power plant as boiler source water the number of effects in the multi effect distillation plant determines the unit s steam efficiency the thermal gradient and the minimum temperature difference between effects restrict the total number of effects the seawater that was used for the first effect disappears almost entirely afterward the remaining of the feed water is sent to the second effect which is again supplied to a tube el dessouky et al 1998 the vapours formed in the first effect heat these tubes this vapour had earlier been condensed into a water product generating heat energy and allowing some of the ocean s excess water for evaporation the condensation evaporation systems are continued from effect to effect each at a decreasing temperature and pressure this is continued with various effects with a usual large plant producing 3 20 effects and a 10 17 output ratio fig 4 bamufleh et al 2017 in the first effect some few units have mostly been fitted to function with a tbt of roughly 70 75 c which reduces the risk of seawater scaling despite raising the requirement for greater heat transfer area in the form of a tube a med unit utilizes less energy than an msf unit and its efficiency ratio is also significantly greater piacentino and cardona 2010 consequently in terms of thermodynamics and heat transport med is superior to msf ghaffour et al 2015 the tubes might be vertical horizontal or submerged in med plants the size of low temperature med units has progressively increased two med units in sharjah uae are installed with a capacity of 22 700 m3 day to produce freshwater large med plants have seen the most prospective approaches in the middle east med units are still in the minority compared to msf units but their numbers continuously grow karagiannis and soldatos 2008 for distillation operations like the med geothermal energy is suitable unlike other renewable energy geothermal energy is not constrained by climatic factors it comes with built in storage and is suitable for base load needs the med procedure seems to be excellent for generating drinkable water from low enthalpy geothermal resources during the plant s operation the environmental effect is minimal the med method may be combined with a geothermal powered power plant to improve overall performance by using excess heat as a result the consumption of fossil fuels is drastically decreased resulting in many area sustainability improvements examples of effective geothermal desalination installation have been reported in the literature table 3 in 1996 a geothermal integrated desalination plant with a capacity of approximately three m3 h was developed and operated in south tunisia employing a novel desalination method called aero evapo condensation and supplied with brackish geothermal water of 65 c temperature koroneos and roumbas 2012 a feasibility study for a suggested plan on the greek island of milos which is established in the cyclades islands has revealed that the island s high geothermal possibility can be harnessed through the use of an organic rankine cycle turbogenerator power generation unit with an annual production of 300 kw which is combined to a multi effect distillation unit with a built desalinating water capacity of 80 t h using geothermal heat and an absorption chiller powered by the hot fluid at 85 c the equipment produces a comfortable temperature for the user gude 2018 sephton water technology has created a prototype to simulate process variables for a demonstration project to demonstrate its potential in commercial and industrial applications they employed med to decrease saltiness in the salton sea by using noncommercial low pressure steam at a temperature of 100 c from a geothermal energy station they used a vertical tube evaporator distillation technique the pilot unit med and vte two effects and the demonstration unit med and vtw 15 effects generated 18 91 and 79 51 m3 of product water per day respectively and used 454 and 3402 kg h reddy and ghaffour 2007 tomaszewska et al 2021 investigated the coastline geothermal prospects at la joya and compared msf and med solutions for geothermal seawater desalination the authors created and tested a prototype geothermal desalination system in the lab with all units heated desalination of 20 m3 per day was achieved using 118 m3 of geothermal groundwater heated to 80 c casimiro et al 2014 developed a design for a concurrent feed med tvc combined into a csp plant examining yearly power and water output for various cooling systems in recent decades advances have been made in generating electricity using high temperature geothermal resources demonstrating that this energy might be a viable option for seawater desalination ghaffour et al 2015 the aero evapo condensation technique was used to experiment with a desalination unit a polypropylene falling fill evaporator and condenser make up the system it was developed to operate at low temperatures 70 90 c and utilize geothermal resources bourouni and chaibi 2005 two geothermal powered distillation units were built in france another in tunisia s south with polypropylene evaporators and condensers operating in the 60 90 c range houcine et al 1999 greece and turkey have a significant amount of geothermal energy kilic 2016 especially during the summer months many smaller islands rely on costly water supplies mahmoudi et al 2009 the concept of industrial scale geothermal integrated desalination has not been substantially examined so far despite the abundance of geothermal resources available goosen et al 2010 there is just one geothermal desalination plant at pilot size med two stages erected on kimolos island in 2000 and is now working the unit can generate 80 m3 of freshwater per day from 1440 m3 of geothermal water at 60 61 c tapped at a depth of 188 m although a feasibility study conducted on milos island in the 1990s yielded highly encouraging findings the project has not yet progressed to constructing a geothermal integrated desalination plant the study estimated the availability of geothermal water at temperatures ranging from 55 to 98 c at shallow depths 85 184 m to be 12 840 m3 per day using seven production wells and suggested the design of a geothermal integrated seawater desalination annual production capacity of 75 80 m3 per day of freshwater mahmoudi et al 2010a however identifying geothermal capacity would deliver heat to much larger capacities other feasibility studies have been carried out in sousaki korinthos where the construction of a med or msf unit and low enthalpy geothermal energy might generate around 225 m3 per day on the island of nysyros according to the results of the research mahmoudi et al 2010b reddy and ghaffour 2007 investigated water desalination cost methods in selecting the most suitable technique for a specific area their research took location energy cost and feed water in turkey sanaye et al 2013 created a mathematical model of multi effect distillation that included renewable energy the model included heat and mass transport equations a continuity equation thermodynamic laws and thermodynamic connections for each sub system the simulation program was created in the visual basic programming language khademi rahimpour and jahanmiri khademi et al 2009 simulated optimized a 6 effect evaporator they suggested a model in which each block s equations were stated in the steady state form they offered a simulation optimization of the process using these equations their findings are in line with the outcomes of the experiments abdel jabbar et al 2007 published software that uses visual basic program to simulate single multi effect evaporation desalination their software used the heat transfer area power usage and pricing formulae the program s output was in perfect accord with the dataset darwish et al 2015 investigated many msf med desalination systems they examined the impact of fundamental desalination variables on production cost their findings demonstrated that a multi effect distillation is a promising option using a low temperature heat source reducing the temperature difference between impacts to less than 2 c dramatically enhances the heat transmission aybar 2004 studied a med system that utilizes waste heat from the power plant as a heating source they completed the energy mass balance of system a four effect desalination system uses waste heat from a gas turbine power plant the results showed that the top brine temperature has only a minor effect on the gained output ratio parallel and parallel crossflow multi effect evaporation were examined by el dessouky and ettouney el dessouky et al 2002 according to their findings parallel crossflow has significant efficiency on the other hand the parallel flow has comparable performance characteristics and is easier to build design and operate than the crossflow desalination system bachellerie ijeridi 2012 discussed that desalinated water was generated using low enthalpy geothermal energy in 2013 using different geothermal combined desalination geothermal ro and med desalination the geothermal med and ro procedures use geothermal dual power plant heat to generate 30 000 m3 day of product water traditional energy based desalination technologies are much less effective at supplying freshwater in this situation than a geothermal integrated med ro plant as can be seen both seawater desalination techniques in the gulf cooperation council nations coastal zones keep showing potential for cost effective desalination in 2008 geothermal energy drove a saltwater desalination unit in baja california mexico the plant includes a combination of med msf or hybrid desalination of both technologies called multi flash with heater mfwh system a plant s optimal capacity is roughly 1 m3 day when 4 m3 of seawater is accessible at 150 c a corresponding temperature of 80 c and 14 m3 of geothermal fluid is supplied loutatidou and arafat 2015 desalination was used to produce energy and freshwater on the greek island of milos in 2004 they built a hybrid framework by integrating geothermal with solar energy the plant s capacity is around 80 m3 h to produce freshwater and it employs a med unit this plant produced 470 kw of power using an orc system with a seven percent orc thermal capacity the cost of producing freshwater m3 per unit is about 2 christ et al 2017 michelle et al 2013 discussed a low enthalpy geothermal energy operated desalination plant on the greek island of milos the suggested system links med systems to geothermal groundwater between 80 and 85 c the estimates show that low enthalpy geothermal energy might save 5000 toe per year for a facility that can produce 600 800 m3 of freshwater per day using geothermal energy with med tvc sf and msf thermal desalination may save significant amounts of energy by reducing preheating energy demand gude 2016a discusses a combined med msf system being tested at a proposed geothermal energy plant in baja california mexico at 80 c geothermal sources might be utilized for heating the optimal freshwater to geothermal resource fluid proportion was determined to be 1 14 another review investigated through an msf med geothermal desalination unit on the seashore the framework was developed and tested at 80 c geothermal sources the research claimed a 1 5 9 proportion of freshwater to geothermal energy fig 5 depicts a geothermal integrated desalination system a geothermal based desalination system includes geothermal production well injection well and multi effect distillation units saturated liquid water geofluid is extracted from the production well the geothermal fluid is then flashed in the primary effect and the vapour part leaving at the top and the liquid component leaving at the bottom and being injected back into the well the vapour from the med system s primary effect condenses and provides heat energy for the desalination system before being released into the injection well the condensed steam goes via a heat exchanger reducing its temperature table 4 compares the different desalination plants mentioned earlier from the milos kimolos project has shown that integrated geothermal desalination on a small scale is financially possible because of the region s significant geothermal potential the desalination process may be scaled up to commercial levels and geothermal integrated desalination prices might be further reduced due to economies of scale koroneos and roumbas 2012 med with tvc might be suitable among many desalination processes this is mainly related to a negative pressure distillation condition wherein seawater s boiling point drops considerably the boiling point of various effects within the med tvc desalination process is generally around 323 15 and 343 15 k with the final effect being even below at 313 15 k as a result if the temperature is greater than that of the lowest boiling point different low grade sources of energy might be utilized this way opens up the possibility of utilizing low grade excess heat and sustainable sources to power the med tvc desalination process yilmaz and söylemez 2012 the desalination market is dominated by multi effect distillation med with different configurations of thermal vapour compression med tvc in which motive steam at 3 bar and 140 c induce vapour entrainment at low pressure from the intermediate effect to increase its pressure and use as heating steam in the first effect in a med tvc arrangement tang et al 2018 therefore steam usage is less with tvc than with a traditional med unit yielding a more significant gain output ratio gor which is described as the mass flow rate of the distillate produced divided by the used motive steam flow rate however both motive pressure and compression ratios limit the tvc entrainment capacity as far as the compression ratio rises the expansion pressure ratio will rise with the compression ratio this implies that a considerable amount of motive steam usually about 20 bar is essential to process a large amount of vapour from the final effect on the other hand this high pressure steam is more costly than the low pressure steam at 3 bar alasfour et al 2005 4 future scope and conclusion as a result of fossil fuel burning greenhouse gases such as co2 are released into the atmosphere causing climate change in addition the growth of the world s population and the need for more energy have led to increased fossil fuel depletion consequently both developing and developed countries are searching for alternative energy sources as a result there has been an increase in the importance of sustainable development energy security and low carbon technologies in social and political discussions geothermal energy is a local energy resource that is consistent sustainable has low air pollution and compensates for the high air pollution of oil and coal powered units has minimal environmental consequences is burning free and has significant environmental effects geothermal energy is suitable for distillation processes such as the med unlike other renewable energy sources geothermal energy is unaffected by weather it has built in storage and is appropriate for base load applications the med process seems ideal for producing drinking water from geothermal resources with low enthalpy the environmental impact of the plant is negligible while it is in operation the med approach may be combined with a geothermal powered power plant to increase overall performance by using extra heat the use of fossil fuels has been dramatically reduced resulting in a significant improvement in many areas of sustainability finally it highlights the challenges involved geothermal desalination technologies research must be accelerated a more extensive evaluation of the worldwide possibilities for low to moderate enthalpy geothermal liquids both on and off shore sources the construction of elaborate geothermal integrated desalination on a commercial basis integrating established thermal desalination technologies including such msf med with emerging technologies taking into account all components required for a finished desalination process carrying out extensive economic modeling to analyses all feasible configurations for geothermal combined desalination processes

groundwater represents 97 of the world s available freshwater resources achieving groundwater sustainability marks a central issue in this effort the given systematic review provides a synthesis of current practice in groundwater capacity development drawing from international literature we provide a groundwater specific panorama of the three central components of a capacity development cycle namely stakeholder dependent capacity assessment capacity development implementation as well as success verification and monitoring mechanisms generic capacity development responses were observed to run the risk of being ineffective in the framework of the review an overview of field proven groundwater capacity development modules is developed synthesizing underlying learning processes outputs

smith et al 2017 the un water sdg 6 global acceleration framework launched in 2020 emphasizes the strategic role capacity development holds for ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water un water 2020 capacity development was here identified as one of five accelerators for the expedited implementation of the sustainable development goal 6 on water sdg 6 as groundwater represents 97 of the world s available freshwater resources achieving groundwater sustainability marks a most central issue in this effort iah 2017 guppy et al 2018 igrac 2018 elshall et al 2020 gleeson et al 2020 and is an indispensable prerequisite for achieving a set of other interlinked sdgs velis et al 2017 igrac 2018 bocanegra 2021 in this context groundwater sustainability must be understood as a transdisciplinary challenge elshall et al 2020 it can be defined as the development and exploitation of groundwater resources to meet current and future beneficial uses without causing unacceptable environmental or socioeconomic impacts while involving participatory and adaptive governance processes alley et al 1999 elshall et al 2020 the common rationale that justifies capacity development for groundwater sustainability is that groundwater degradation is in many cases driven by inadequate behavior and management of relevant stakeholders and or a lack of institutional accountability more fundamentally those drivers can be traced back to a lack of knowledge skill leadership unfavorable attitudes and inefficient institutional arrangements fig 1 capacity development responses are therefore intended to provide a nourishing environment that makes conscious use of suitable learning formats and stakeholder interactions for cultivating respective capacities pahl wostl 2002 pahl wostl et al 2007 fowler et al 2010 lebel et al 2010 ibisch et al 2016 alaerts and kaspersma 2022 on the institutional and societal level it involves the revision of institutional arrangements and relevant policies in this manner capacity development that promotes groundwater sustainability intends to inform and change the behavior of involved actors lead to expedient institutional performance and foster policies that incentive desired behavioral changes outcomes alaerts 2008 ibisch et al 2016 brauer et al 2017 alpizar et al 2019 fig 1 empowering capacity in the context of groundwater sustainability comes with certain intrinsic challenges that differ from other environmental fields groundwater is a common pool resource whose access and use is in large parts of the world of imperative importance albrecht et al 2017 castilla rho et al 2020 foster et al 2020 yet it is a hidden invisible resource which means that groundwater stakeholders and beneficiaries frequently lack an adequate understanding of groundwater fluxes groundwater surface interactions and groundwater vulnerability re and misstear 2017 foster 2020 fraser et al 2020 foster and macdonald 2021 mannix et al 2021 nolte et al 2021 misstear et al 2022 the mismanagement of groundwater in turn can have adverse effects on human health and well being water supply and food security groundwater reliant ecosystems and can even negatively impact local and regional climates barlage et al 2015 watto and mugera 2016 ameur et al 2017 alfarrah and walraevens 2018 scheihing and tröger 2018 makarigakis and jimenez cisneros 2019 karunanidhi et al 2021 scheihing et al 2022 due to these topic specific constraints globally reported capacity development responses for achieving groundwater sustainability merit a self contained systematic review with the given review on groundwater capacity development we follow the objective of fostering reciprocal learning among practitioners stimulate the debate in the community concerning best practices and promote groundwater capacity development in its role as an sdg 6 accelerator for this purpose we apply a systematic search and review methodology examining groundwater capacity development interventions that were documented internationally during the past decade we lay our focus on the three central aspects of an ideal capacity development cycle fig 1 1 capacity gaps and assets of different stakeholder groups 2 types of modules for capacity development implementation and 3 current success and sustainability verification practice drawing from international literature we identify recurring stakeholder dependent capacity gaps and assets and summarize reported drawbacks that the encountered capacity gaps typically entail for groundwater management the compilation of capacity gaps and assets of different stakeholders can help practitioners to contextualize capacity development issues in their particular practice further as a support for practitioners to adequately address eventual capacity gaps in their working environment we provide an overview of field proven modules for capacity development implementation synthesizing underlying learning processes involved stakeholder interactions as well as outcomes appraising respective capacity development modules and instruments follows the intention of working towards a modular construction kit for the dynamic and case dependent design of groundwater capacity development programs such capacity development programs could comprise academic community and institutional levels or integrated mixtures of these finally the synthesis is closed by reviewing existing approaches for evaluating the success and sustainability of groundwater capacity development responses this last aspect of the capacity development cycle is often found to be neglected requiring stronger attention from the groundwater community the findings are of interest for capacity development practice in environmental sciences in general 2 methods we applied a systematic search and review methodology moher et al 2009 to synthesize global peer reviewed scientific and grey literature on capacity development in the field of groundwater management we limited our search to anglophone literature that was published in the period from january 01 2010 to november 01 2021 conference proceedings were explicitly excluded from the search process the literature search was executed from october 26 2021 to november 15 2021 on the scientific online databases scopus and web of science additionally matching grey literature as well as peer reviewed articles were identified by using the google scholar platform respectively considered sources were limited to the first 150 results fig 2 eleven articles were added from our personal library because of their high thematic relevance of which seven do not comply with the temporal restriction the search criteria for the databases scopus and web of science were directed to the abstracts of potential sources and included the following search commands capacity building and hydrogeology or aquifer or groundwater capacity development and hydrogeology or aquifer or groundwater education and hydrogeology or aquifer or groundwater the search criteria used on google scholar referred to the full text of the literature and were defined as capacity building or capacity development or education and aquifer or hydrogeology or groundwater the respective procedure yielded 338 results including 152 duplicates after excluding duplicates the remaining 186 items were preliminarily screened by searching the respective full texts for the keywords listed above in this manner 72 sources that made no significant contributions to the field of capacity development for groundwater sustainability were identified and removed all of these excluded sources only incidentally mentioned the terms capacity development or capacity building but did not specifically relate capacity development requirements or practice to the subject of the respective publication thus by this exclusion mechanism the number of potentially significant studies was limited to 114 a closer review excluded a further 32 topically distant titles that had no specific relevance for the field of groundwater capacity development but at the same time yielded 21 additional sources by backward citation check that were thematically indeed of importance following this procedure the number of sources included in the presented narrative synthesis was reduced to 103 3 results and discussion 3 1 overview of included studies the systematic search methodology yielded 103 titles to be included in the given review of these 103 studies 93 represent peer reviewed sources and 10 are grey literature table 1 half of the studies exhibit a clear focus on capacity development issues linked to groundwater the other half involves capacity development and groundwater but has in principle another thematic focus the latter half often consists of studies that describe encountered capacity gaps in the context of research projects in total 61 of the 103 titles touch on capacity development in low and middle income countries and 22 titles concern high income settings 3 2 stakeholder dependent capacity gaps and assets in accord with the capacity development rationale fig 1 indicators of missing groundwater capacity can embark unfavorable behavior of stakeholders poor institutional performance and inconsistent policies that in sum lead to groundwater degradation the cause of these shortcomings can be specified as 1 a lack of knowledge and groundwater system understanding 2 unfavorable attitudes and roles towards groundwater 3 a lack of experience and skill in groundwater monitoring and assessment 4 missing leadership or 5 inappropriate institutional arrangements and policies van hofwegen 2004 alaerts 2008 undp 2015 ibisch et al 2016 capacity assets can consistently be described as the opposite of each of those categories overall a capacity gap describes the discrepancy between a required threshold of capacity and the actual capacity of stakeholder groups or institutions assuming that the required threshold assures behaviors and performances promoting groundwater sustainability james and menachery 2019 here presented stakeholder dependent capacity gaps were derived from the reviewed bulk of literature and summarize repeatedly reported shortcomings in the field of groundwater without being exhaustive they intend to provide a sound experience based orientation of common groundwater capacity gaps capacity assets were reported much less frequently compared to capacity gaps but are included in this chapter as well where applicable when the method for assessing capacity gaps and assets was reported respective authors almost exclusively referred to questionnaires semi structured interviews or surveys involving concerned stakeholders braune et al 2010 sloots 2010 nussbaumer et al 2016 yohannes et al 2017 undp 2020 a brief overview of the findings of this chapter is presented in table 2 3 2 1 small communities and farmers the majority of reported capacity gaps for groundwater dependent small communities and farmers refer to gaps in knowledge and system understanding and a lesser extent to a lack of skill and unfavorable attitudes a general notion is that there persists a lack of adaptive capacity to face changing environmental conditions such as increased frequency of droughts e g as a consequence of climate change or water scarcity e g due to overexploitation yohannes et al 2017 jadeja et al 2018 christen e w 2020 bhangaonkar and fennell 2021 carrión mero et al 2021 such a lack of adaptive capacity is most of the time associated with missing local groundwater system understanding and a consequent inability of anticipating future scenarios including unfavorable attitudes such as myopic thinking e g by preferring water intensive cash crops meinzen dick et al 2016 bhangaonkar and fennell 2021 carrión mero et al 2021 missing basic knowledge on groundwater including groundwater policy frameworks is further found to hamper required community level action and participation kulkarni et al 2015 gomes et al 2018 hermans et al 2019 other research highlights the high attitudinal diversity that can persist throughout communities and the necessity to respect these differences for successfully fostering sustainable groundwater management varua et al 2016 ward et al 2016 overall the mentioned capacity gaps drive the overuse of local aquifers lead to decreased crop yields and finally threaten the source of income of small farmers and communities pascuala et al 2010 yohannes et al 2017 gomes et al 2018 christen e w 2020 bhangaonkar and fennell 2021 in some cases missing knowledge and skill on groundwater quality and treatment are also associated with increased health risks from contaminated groundwater hynds et al 2013 mcintyre et al 2015 murray and sharmin 2015 re et al 2017 however in a rare case from australia indigenous knowledge has been found to be an asset to better inform water management decisions liedloff et al 2013 this example calls to attention that community based traditional knowledge could be regarded in other cases as well as an asset to build on when executing groundwater capacity development interventions 3 2 2 public the anticipated capacity level of the public to which a capacity gap could be formulated is generally low baldwin et al 2012 describe that a lack of hydrogeological understanding concerning groundwater dependent ecosystems and impacts of anthropogenic activities hinders public participations processes ballester and mott lacroix 2016 and kulkarni et al 2015 further state that knowledge gaps among the public can lead to distrust toward water boards and water councils both conditions can aggravate achieving groundwater sustainability in the case of involving citizens in groundwater related citizen science further application specific knowledge and skills are required little et al 2016 3 2 3 managerial and professional staff of water institutions a common thread regarding capacity deficiencies of staff of water institutions is data management data utilization and data analysis particularly for sub saharan africa and parts of asia it is reported that respective professionals lack hydrogeological knowledge for utilizing fundamental groundwater data such as water levels or salinity and borehole data mcintyre et al 2015 nussbaumer et al 2016 gheuens et al 2019 rivett et al 2019 rossetto et al 2019 serele et al 2020 undp 2020 this is one of the reasons why the collection and management of respective data are sometimes considered useless and negligible by respective staff members unfavorable attitude nussbaumer et al 2016 the lack of well trained groundwater professionals knowledge and skill and related poor data management in water institutions have four principle consequences 1 groundwater is not made use of at its full potential to foster development braune et al 2010 gaye and tindimugaya 2019 2 well drilling programs are ineffective resulting in low yields poor quality of well water and loss of financial resources rivett et al 2019 serele et al 2020 3 undetected adverse impacts on groundwater by heavy users and polluters like industry and agriculture undp 2020 and 4 a low adaptation capacity concerning changing environmental or societal conditions bassi et al 2021 shortcomings in the leadership of managerial staff on the other hand is found to hamper the implementation of reliable groundwater management frameworks water stewardship and data management in several developing and transitional countries mcintyre et al 2015 alpizar et al 2019 undp 2020 a lack of managerial leadership can also reflect by a lack of strategic foresight which includes settings where assigned staff see no incentives for taking over technical leadership limiting institutional accomplishments onencan et al 2016 brauer et al 2017 undp 2020 further share the notion of technical staff of cambodian governmental departments that hold that instead of missing knowledge and skill a lack of financial means is the actual cause of inefficient groundwater management 3 2 4 water institutions comments on institutional capacity deficiencies and policy failure can be divided into three main areas 1 poor institutional data collection and management as well as closed data philosophies 2 insufficient institutional arrangements and administrative procedures and 3 insufficient or contradictory policies kulkarni et al 2015 mcevoy 2015 shen 2015 hoogesteger and wester 2017 mengistu et al 2019 xu et al 2019 those conditions are observed to lead to poor institutional performance and contribute to weak enabling environments hindering groundwater sustainability a common notion is that incapacitated water institutions are a principal reason for a lack of reliable groundwater information including fundamental monitoring data and meaningful data products such as relevant maps this condition impedes expedient institutional communication and decision making and ultimately leads back to a lack of institutionalized knowledge and skill vassolo 2012 foster and garduño 2013 kulkarni et al 2015 ibisch et al 2016 undp 2020 associated with that are poor groundwater monitoring programs with low station density and scattered institutional data silos which counteract data integration kulkarni et al 2015 shen 2015 ibisch et al 2016 undp 2020 a lack of data availability also due to closed data philosophies is for example reported to result in poorly calibrated groundwater models in china hampering good management practice shen 2015 data silos are as well an indicator of a lack of horizontal and vertical interplay among different environmental institutions ibisch et al 2016 having said that unfavorable institutional arrangements and a lack of hydrogeological knowledge and skill further aggravate the sustainable management of transboundary aquifers fried et al 2011 vassolo 2012 puri and villholth 2017 kileshye et al 2020 insufficient institutional arrangements are described as well by braune et al 2010 regarding south africa they state that a national institutional groundwater champion was missing in consequence a failure of registering and verifying existing groundwater uses very long groundwater licensing processes with no single streamlined procedure and poor groundwater data management was described mengistu et al 2019 and gomes et al 2018 make very similar observations for ethiopia and bangladesh respectively and add that a resulting lack of institutional accountability hindered enforcement of groundwater development regulations the central reason called into play for these conditions apart from missing capacity is a lack of systematic investments which in part can be traced back to an undervaluing of groundwater at the decision making level unfavorable attitude braune et al 2010 kiparsky et al 2017 gaye and tindimugaya 2019 pavelic and villholth 2020 sousa and fussi 2021 insufficient funds were sometimes also linked to high staff turnover and thus a draining of institutional capacity braune et al 2010 alpizar et al 2019 kileshye et al 2020 3 2 5 academia and ngos in africa and india most commonly a lack of scientifically trained hydrogeologists is cited with the need to gain regional groundwater system understanding and assess impacts of climate change on subsurface surface water systems amani et al 2015 kulkarni et al 2015 banda et al 2019 gaye and tindimugaya 2019 xu et al 2019 apart from that mcintyre et al 2015 conclude based on case studies in peru colombia ghana zambia indonesia philippines and mongolia that research is putting too little effort into outreach attitude type of capacity gap ortigara et al 2018 are in line with this argument and summarize that water researchers and professionals are repeatedly falsely assuming a linear pathway from scientific inside to practice and policy neglecting the interplay of power and politics on the ground alpizar et al 2019 on the other hand demand from researchers to consistently apply a scientific lens to the subject of capacity development also in groundwater related contexts finding that few scientifically sound studies assess the actual effectiveness of differing capacity development approaches inappropriate attitude similarly hasan et al 2020 find that ngos in bangladesh who were working with communities to support the maintenance of locally managed aquifer recharge systems are largely unaware of methodological progress in current capacity development practice this gap in knowledge and skill resulted in generic and ineffective capacity building activities as well as a lack of vision for cultivating collective action among participants hasan et al 2020 hasan et al 2020 further describe that some of the assessed ngos have a clear bias towards working with relatively prospective users and communities who are likely to respond more favorably to their support potentially unfavorable attitude besides capacity gaps of students and pupils involve a lack of simple conceptual hydrogeological system understanding which goes along with undifferentiated views of the effects of e g mining activities on groundwater and reduced concerns regarding groundwater related environmental problems mcintyre et al 2015 unterbruner et al 2016 pan and liu 2018 arthurs 2019 3 3 learning modules of capacity development programs for achieving groundwater sustainability as outlined in the introduction successful capacity development is a dynamic learning process that considers capacity assets and gaps of the target group and is tailored to their socio environmental context fig 1 a central success factor for impactful capacity development is the usage of suitable learning formats that address the different settings and needs of the target group adequately as will be outlined below there is currently a wide range of different capacity development approaches that are being entertained in case studies on groundwater capacity development worldwide yet there has been no attempt to make an inventory of these different approaches this can result in a lack of awareness about possible learning formats and their outcomes which potentially limits the capability of instructors to dynamically adapt groundwater capacity development programs for tackling this shortcoming we gather in the given section a catalogue of field proven learning modules for groundwater capacity development based on a thorough systematic literature review the presented catalogue is intended to support concerned actors in tailoring groundwater related capacity development responses by synthesizing for each module the underlying learning processes the involved stakeholder interactions as well as principal outputs and outcomes fig 1 in total we identified 13 fundamental learning modules as a means of visual conceptualization they are schematically gathered in fig 3 while all presented learning modules cultivate simultaneously different capacities they are being ordered here by the suggested principal type of capacity output knowledge skill attitude or leadership 3 3 1 learning modules for the development of knowledge and system understanding 3 3 1 1 educational material and knowledge management platforms textbooks form the primary source for academic hydrogeological knowledge with well defined core contents and usually long shelf lives post 2013 but they are directed to a specialized or specializing academic audience and provide only very limited applications for capacity development activities in multi actor contexts handbooks and leaflets on the other hand that are specially designed as a reference for knowledge internalized during groundwater capacity development interventions can be of great value guo and jiang 2011 escalante et al 2013 agw net 2014 however hermans et al 2019 remind us that respective texts intended for conveying knowledge are sometimes too abstract and hence useless for users capacity facilitators should be aware of this problem and thus emphasize a practical and applied style of writing when drafting educational material in general it is recommendable to adapt the style of educational material to the social cultural and environmental background of the target group including local groundwater conditions if possible re and misstear 2017 houben 2019 that is because the internalization of new knowledge is considered to work best when it is linked to personal meaning baldwin et al 2012 houben 2019 for example describes the use of an educational comic book tailored to pupils of primary schools in paraguay for successfully teaching groundwater issues when addressing adult readerships however facilitating access to required knowledge via online knowledge management platforms instead of printed or digital handbooks has sometimes turned out to be a better solution ibisch et al 2016 knowledge management platforms have the advantage that apart from organizing knowledge their contents can be adapted dynamically respecting for example new aspects that arose during capacity development activities they can further facilitate a forum for communication cooperation and hence peer to peer learning among participants ibisch et al 2016 3 3 1 2 conventional courses workshops and e learning courses and e learning formats for groundwater capacity development should be adjusted to the socio economic and environmental contexts that hold personal meaning for the target group leidel et al 2013 ibisch et al 2016 reimann et al 2019 academic courses on groundwater are generally recommended to balance lectures laboratory computer based exercises and field campaigns gleeson et al 2012 hakoun et al 2013 reimann et al 2019 advocate in this context blending established lecture formats with e learning tools however that requires having access to relevant equipment and facilities bethune and ryan 2010 while best practices from academia can be of interest to other international capacity development settings they surely cannot be applied universally as they follow the particular aim of instilling academic excellence however the blending of different learning formats is generally recommendable for not running the risk of being ineffective alpizar et al 2019 for example describe the fruitlessness of a simple lecture based workshop for provoking behavioral change among costa rican water organizations interactive learning software supporting groundwater system understanding are an example of an additional learning format for diversifying workshop settings unterbruner et al 2016 present a learning software that guides users interactively through the water cycle including conceptual hydrogeological aspects penny and mullen 2021 on the other hand outline a web based platform that allows users to design a hydrogeological system including aquifer properties and pumping wells and simulate respective hydraulic head behavior and particle movement apart from those examples there is also older but still valuable educational groundwater software hsieh 2001 3 3 1 3 developing media content reported groundwater capacity development practices involving different media types such as radio video or social media are not very common re and misstear 2017 discuss the pros and cons of social media platforms for raising awareness of groundwater issues and conclude that it can support outreach and awareness campaigns a case study from brazil for example describes how water capacity development in schools provided incentives for students to start their own awareness campaigns on water conservation via social media da silva et al 2020 apart from that amani et al 2015 report that periodic radio programs in conjunction with other capacity development interventions helped to successfully sensitize local communities regarding groundwater pollution in ghana moreover students from laos developed a short video on enhancing agricultural water management as part of their training to publicly raise awareness of the issue pavelic and villholth 2020 learners that use media to prepare educational content for broader audiences have the opportunity to autonomously revise and conceptualize their understanding and anticipate the perspective of audiences that are new to the subject engaging learners in developing modern media content can help to multiply awareness of groundwater da silva et al 2020 3 3 1 4 physical and digital aquifer models and drawing baldwin et al 2012 successfully deployed both small 3d physical models and digital 3d models of local groundwater systems to convey system understanding to communities in the context of public participation processes also other authors describe the utility of physical aquifer models for educational purposes as they provide a tangible presentation of an otherwise invisible system rodhe 2012 houben 2019 another well suited tool for visualizing groundwater systems and at the same time comprehending participants preconceptions of groundwater systems is drawing unterbruner et al 2016 arthurs and elwonger 2018 pan and liu 2018 in two educational studies participants were asked to draw two dimensional cross sections of simple groundwater systems including surface features like trees and rivers according to their understanding arthurs and elwonger 2018 pan and liu 2018 consequently the sketches were compared with educational material and discussed among participants and instructors in this manner initially incorrect mental models of groundwater systems could be revised in a cooperative process however drawing as a tool for revising groundwater system understanding could also be merged with the consequent presentation of small 3d physical groundwater models computer animated groundwater system models or simple software tools unterbruner et al 2016 blending these learning elements provides a predict observe discuss setting that is commonly regarded as a best practice for stimulating learning processes arthurs 2019 instructors could likewise join the initial drawing exercise for creating a level field of interaction which is often regarded as favorable for following discussion rounds hermans et al 2019 3 3 1 5 participation processes while participation processes are not per se understood as a capacity development format several research examples demonstrate that participation is a very good framework for developing capacity baldwin et al 2012 kulkarni et al 2015 ballester and mott lacroix 2016 hermans et al 2019 not seldomly participation processes reveal knowledge or attitudinal capacity gaps among stakeholders that could be addressed in accompanying capacity development responses ballester and mott lacroix 2016 ibisch et al 2016 hermans et al 2019 argue in line with that and add that a common ground of understanding is essential to assure just negotiations in participation processes a straightforward approach to involve stakeholders of participation formats in learning processes is a joint fact finding mission baldwin et al 2012 joint fact finding missions allow each stakeholder or stakeholder group to autonomously inquire into a given subject and present their findings to the concerned audience finally leading to a sound basis for further discussions of the matter another fruitful learning format hosted by participation processes is active on site consultation and deliberation which can support the building of required interdisciplinary perspectives maheshwari et al 2014 ballester and mott lacroix 2016 the given examples foster particularly peer to peer learning and a shift from prescribing action to learning in actions baldwin et al 2012 3 3 2 learning modules for revising roles and attitudes 3 3 2 1 serious games different types of well thought games were successfully applied in groundwater capacity development contexts typical formats of serious games are role games where groundwater stakeholders are asked to take over the viewpoint of another stakeholder while having to achieve a team decision ferrero et al 2018 gomes et al 2018 goodspeed et al 2020 in another example the problem of overdrawing groundwater as a function of crop choice is framed within a gaming context meinzen dick et al 2016 2018 serious games typically require to be accompanied by well prepared moderators and involve a post play discussion for reflecting the event serious games are reported to increase the awareness of interdependence among groundwater stakeholders and help to revise previous attitudes goodspeed et al 2020 they can foster strategic foresight meinzen dick et al 2016 onencan et al 2016 help convey new strategies for managing groundwater more sustainably and motivate collective action meinzen dick et al 2016 2018 gomes et al 2018 ferrero et al 2018 hold that serious games are an asset for capacity development practices because they introduce the participants to a learning cycle involving concrete experience reflective observation conceptualization and active experimentation 3 3 2 2 questionnaires surveys and interviews embedded into other capacity development activities also questionnaires surveys and interviews can provoke the revision of attitudes by exposing participants to self reflective questions including the consequent discussion of survey wide results nussbaumer et al 2016 wong and yelderman 2016 re et al 2021 nussbaumer et al 2016 report that semi structured interviews with staff of water institutions in zambia supported behavioral changes regarding groundwater monitoring and data management 3 3 3 learning modules for developing experience and skill 3 3 3 1 field campaigns for linking theoretical and conceptual hydrogeological understanding with personal experience guided field campaigns are essential gleeson et al 2012 hakoun et al 2013 banks et al 2021 carrión mero et al 2021 field campaigns serve the development of different methodological skills for the collection of groundwater related data such as spring and stream discharge data groundwater level data physio chemical water parameters as well as data from hydraulic and tracer experiments geological outcrops and hydrogeophysical campaigns guo and jiang 2011 hakoun et al 2013 maheshwari et al 2014 wong and yelderman 2016 poudel and duex 2017 banks et al 2021 carrión mero et al 2021 banda et al 2019 describe how guided field campaigns and laboratory works successfully promoted the appropriation of skills in the field of isotope hydrology in malawi carrión mero et al 2021 use field campaigns to strengthen a community university partnership in ecuador they execute hydrogeological field campaigns under the umbrella of community service projects which likewise improve the groundwater related capacity of involved citizens guo and jiang 2011 on the other hand use a groundwater polluting accident as a tracer test in a karst system to increase understanding of groundwater vulnerability among involved stakeholders in china groundwater related field campaigns for capacity development could however also involve on site questionnaires and interviews of well owners and groundwater users for learning about socio hydrogeological aspects hynds et al 2013 re et al 2017 2021 3 3 3 2 training and application of specialized groundwater software training on groundwater related software such as modelling suits aims at developing specialist skills that form an asset for generating knowledge from data mays 2010 filippis et al 2020 pavelic and villholth 2020 mays 2010 describes a one week course on stochastic groundwater modelling and verify how software exercises permit the application and transfer of fundamental hydrogeological knowledge to new challenges hakoun et al 2013 point out that self reliant experimentation with groundwater software can foster the development of conceptualization and problem solving skills another example provide pavelic and villholth 2020 they integrate on site collected water level data for calibrating groundwater models during class exercises for achieving an active learning environment 3 3 3 3 internships and on the job training many sources advocate internships and on the job training as an expedient form of developing capacity because it links the appropriation of knowledge with experience building activities braune et al 2010 hlophe and hillie 2014 undp 2015 ibisch et al 2016 james and menachery 2019 pavelic and villholth 2020 hlophe and hillie 2014 describe how the involvement of master students in establishing a water treatment and supply plant for purifying brackish groundwater in rural south africa helped to form technological multipliers the respective students were encouraged to write their master s thesis on technological and chemical issues around the project braune et al 2010 on the other hand advocate institutional internship programs for forming lacking human capital specialized in groundwater 3 3 3 4 using technical facilities for on site capacity development there are some examples where groundwater related technical facilities were adapted for capacity development purposes including technology demonstration and experiments nestmann et al 2016 set forth their capacity development experiences with a pump as turbine driven groundwater supply facility as installed on a university campus in indonesia their learning targets are conveying technical functionality proper utilization and added value of the technology through on site training nestmann et al 2016 similar approaches can be found for capacity development around managed aquifer recharge facilities in india jadeja et al 2018 christen e w 2020 hasan et al 2020 ibisch et al 2016 further explain how eco technologically constructed wetland models can be used to experiment and teach about percolation and filtration processes by creating waste water with safe ingredients they demonstrate how pollutants can be retained during percolation by sedimentary layers ibisch et al 2016 pavelic and villholth 2020 on the other hand use a field experiment facility on a university campus in laos to teach agricultural water management using suited technical facilities for capacity development in this manner can provide an experimental learning setting that promotes learning processes 3 3 3 5 citizen science involving citizens in groundwater and drinking water monitoring programs can help strengthen the databases for sound hydro environmental management thornton and leahy 2012 little et al 2016 brouwer et al 2018 prajapati et al 2021 an indispensable part of successful citizen science formats are capacity development and outreach activities that convey system understanding and skills to lay scientists little et al 2016 jamieson et al 2020 manda et al 2021 due to the practical nature of citizen science approaches respective capacity development activities are predestined to link field practice and learning by doing with on site deliberation citizen science approaches should engage local lay scientists that have a personal relation to the studied environment then respective participants are enabled to contribute to the co production of data and knowledge at a scale that holds personal meaning to them which promotes learning lebel et al 2010 baldwin et al 2012 haywood 2016 walker et al 2021 beyond the acquisition of knowledge and skill citizen science in the groundwater sector is found to increase the trust of participants in water institutions research and data quality thornton and leahy 2012 brouwer et al 2018 walker et al 2021 where sufficient incentives are provided citizen science can even function as a gateway for individuals to continue specialization moving from being citizen scientists to being citizen scientist trainers or local groundwater champions flores díaz et al 2018 jadeja et al 2018 christen e w 2020 3 3 4 learning module for developing leadership 3 3 4 1 training groundwater champions individuals that act as beneficial change agents and or capacity multipliers in their socio cultural and political environment are sometimes termed champions taylor et al 2012 undp 2015 jadeja et al 2018 ortigara et al 2018 jamieson et al 2020 groundwater champions necessarily require leadership skills for establishing a shared vision aligning resources and generating motivation among colleagues and fellows taylor et al 2012 an institutionally focused water champion program is described by taylor et al 2012 it addressed primarily professionals in australian water agencies and was meant to foster organizational bottom up innovation it involved pre training reading and exercises individual weakness and strength assessments and the generation of leadership development plans jadeja et al 2018 and christen 2020 in turn describe an approach that centers around forming local groundwater champions in rural contexts for enhancing community level groundwater management in india their groundwater champions are supposed to develop a level of local system understanding skill and leadership that enables them to monitor and evaluate the status of groundwater in their reach and share their findings with associated communities for steering adaptation measures for achieving that the authors used classroom lectures on site deliberation mapping and data collection in the field but also simple data management applications that permit the remote submission of measured water levels via sms other key interventions that contribute to the strengthening of groundwater champions are the creation of stakeholder networks and the initiation of groundwater forums amani et al 2015 yohannes et al 2017 hermans et al 2019 christen e w 2020 bhangaonkar and fennell 2021 respective studies find that such groundwater champions can successfully act as an intermediary between communities and other groundwater stakeholders and foster adaptation capabilities on a micro watershed level jadeja et al 2018 christen e w 2020 bhangaonkar and fennell 2021 3 4 success verification and monitoring of capacity development interventions the recommended capacity development cycle involves a success verification and sustainability assessment of capacity development activities undp 2015 ibisch et al 2016 indicators for determining the success of capacity development responses could be directed to the level of descriptive data the output level the outcome level as well as their final target the degree of enhancement of the state of groundwater resources fig 4 complementary to a timely isolated success verification assessment the degree of success over time can be understood as a measure of the sustainability of a capacity development intervention descriptive data of a capacity development intervention could involve for example the types of participants numbers of graduations and involved thesis among others pavelic and villholth 2020 for example deploy such numbers as basic success indicators the output level of success evaluation in turn refers to the level of acquired capacities such as knowledge skills changed attitudes or leadership jadeja et al 2018 indicate applying a two day post training workshop to test the skills and knowledge of trained groundwater champions in rural india further measuring success on the outcome level involves the assessment of changes in professional behavior and performance and the degree of adoption of new workflows reporting systems or data management systems kileshye et al 2020 report that they used surveys and third party feedback to evaluate post intervention professional performance over time finally also the change in the state of groundwater resources could be used to evaluate capacity development success if causal relationships can be established amani et al 2015 for example cite river water quality enhancements over a set of years as evidence for successful capacity development interventions in a watershed in ghana previous publications on the subject suggest that instead of descriptive data and mere formal testing of post intervention knowledge and skills of participants output level monitoring of behavioral changes and performance outcome level is more reliable for measuring actual intervention success horton 2003 however we argue that in the best case all of the four mentioned evaluation levels should be respected for success verification this is because the reliability of a capacity development success verification mechanism is highest if causal relationships between all four levels of success evaluation can be established and a concrete impact on the target level e g enhancement of the state of groundwater resources can be confirmed fig 4 deciding on specific indicators for measuring intervention success on the data output outcome and target level might take place partly during the intervention itself for being able to respect the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable dimension that respective change processes encompass but also for allowing a co creative definition of intervention success which depends likewise on input from the target group vallejo and wehn 2016 repeating success verification mechanisms over time could provide a suitable measure of capacity development intervention sustainability fig 4 to foster objectivity in post intervention success evaluation auditing mechanisms including third parties could be pursued ferrero et al 2019 a central constraint in evaluating the lasting success sustainability of capacity development responses is that for its evaluation there must pass a long time after the end of a capacity development measure gunawardana et al 2013 the timely restricted funding periods for capacity development measures often exclude the possibility of realistic long term capacity development success evaluation this finding suggests that donors should consider adjusting their funding schemes and explicitly cover the full capacity development cycle fig 1 including sound studies on capacity development success evaluation fig 4 particularly donors should be interested in enhancing the knowledge on the long term efficacy of capacity development interventions and related success factors for optimizing their return of investment however additional factors that complicate capacity development sustainability verification are co evolving socio economic and environmental boundary conditions that could interfere with intervention successes ibisch et al 2016 a rare example of a fully documented groundwater related capacity development success evaluation is provided by alpizar et al 2019 who intended to stimulate changes in pricing and management practice of 233 community based water management organizations in costa rica involving interviews and surveys two years after the targeted workshop they find no impact on behavioral changes when compared with a control group this underlines the need to systematically study how the design of capacity development programs influences their success for not running the risk of being inefficient however most of the reviewed literature which focused on capacity development for groundwater sustainability table 1 did not mention outcomes of success or sustainability verification mechanisms in cases where such evaluations were reported respective authors comment on their outcomes mostly in an informal fashion lacking a scientific lens alpizar et al 2019 this is reflected by the fact that there are very few studies that provide methodological details regarding success verification at the same time if results are reported they are not being related to potential causes such as the design of the associated capacity development intervention considering socio cultural and governance frameworks enabling environment as well as stakeholder capacity gaps and assets the results of the review suggest in this regard that success evaluation in the field of groundwater capacity development tends to be in large parts subjective poorly documented or not readily accessible this condition indicates a lack of attention among the respective community concerning capacity development success evaluation and marks a central deficit that limits the ability to derive case dependent best practice recommendations for upscaling and increasing capacity development impacts as capacity development is identified as an sdg 6 accelerator by un water tackling the question of groundwater capacity development success and sustainability is crucial for efficiently pursuing sdg 6 while accompanying capacity development processes by sound scientific routines is not useful for all contexts there are settings especially when involving academic institutions where mid term and long term benefits can be expected from systematically applying a scientific lens there is however an open methodological debate regarding how capacity development success verification is best designed in international cooperation vallejo and wehn 2016 currently applied single path approaches used to capture capacity development successes in international cooperation contexts are for example cost benefit analysis cba strengths weakness opportunities problem analysis swop and control group assessments vallejo and wehn 2016 vallejo and wehn 2016 however underline the need for new multi path approaches for reliably capturing the success of capacity development interventions a common notion among reviewed case studies is that as long as funding and hence guidance is provided during capacity development activities behavioral changes can be observed but once the funding and the external guidance ends existing structures tend to fall back to old behavioral patterns requiring long lasting dedication for achieving sustainable changes baldwin et al 2012 ballester and mott lacroix 2016 hermans et al 2019 christen e w 2020 hasan et al 2020 beyond enforcement of legislation benefit generation and incentive mechanisms are known to support the steering and sustaining of behavioral changes in different water contexts aga et al 2018 novak et al 2018 renzaho et al 2018 project funding can provide an initial incentive for stakeholders to engage in capacity development processes including the investment of personal time and resources but the sustainability of capacity development responses beyond the project timeline will often depend on the question of whether new system inherent incentive mechanisms can be tapped or set up that support behavioral changes independent of project funding in this regard incentive structures can be understood as part of the underlying sometimes latent enabling environment into which groundwater capacity development efforts must be consciously interlinked if instructors achieve to demonstrate how participants can maximize also personal benefits from applying acquired capacities while contributing to groundwater sustainability there is a higher chance for process ownership and long term behavioral change aga et al 2018 hermans et al 2019 depending on the societal context possible incentives for involved actors could be societal recognition and increased self esteem jadeja et al 2018 hermans et al 2019 christen e w 2020 avoidance of health risks and water scarcity murray and sharmin 2015 meinzen dick et al 2018 thematically suited career and job opportunities taylor et al 2012 jadeja et al 2018 or financial compensations for for example adjusted agricultural practices and water conservation ibisch et al 2016 alyaarbi et al 2019 scheihing et al 2020 bhangaonkar and fennell 2021 likewise self organized local water management rules between competing users can provide an incentivizing framework for sustaining behavioral change ostrom and gardner 1993 the question of which system s inherent incentive structure will be pursued during a capacity development cycle and how it will be achieved that participants buy in should be addressed at the beginning of a groundwater capacity development process 4 conclusions the given groundwater specific review focuses on the three central aspects of a typical capacity development cycle capacity gap and asset assessment capacity development implementation and success verification the international groundwater literature lays a strong focus on identifying capacity gaps while capacity assets are seldomly reported capacity gaps in the groundwater sector are manyfold and dependent on the assessed circle of actors a recurring thread among the capacity gaps of groundwater professionals and groundwater related institutions concern knowledge skills and attitudes regarding data collection data management and data processing this lack of data stewardship is aggravated by closed data philosophies and missing horizontal and vertical institutional interplay neglected groundwater data stewardship undermines respective adaptation capacities and was observed to contribute to the underestimation of the importance of groundwater for sustainable development on the decision making level a condition that not seldomly leads to insufficient systematic investments into groundwater generic content centered groundwater capacity development interventions run the risk of being ineffective capacity development responses require case dependent tailoring and should make conscious use of suited learning formats for addressing actor specific capacity needs a lack of awareness of existing capacity development concepts and learning processes potentially limits the capability of instructors to appropriately adapt groundwater capacity development programs a catalogue of field proven groundwater capacity development modules as developed in this study can lower the barriers for a case dependent design of capacity development measures potentially increasing impacts capacity development success verification is an indispensable part of the capacity development cycle there is however widely missing a scientific approach to the subject of groundwater capacity development success verification success verification results are seldomly reported and if addressed the methodological description of the study design and the analysis of results are often insufficient this condition marks a central deficit that limits the ability to objectively derive case dependent best practice recommendations for upscaling and increasing groundwater capacity development impacts in the field of international cooperation in general there is an ongoing debate regarding how capacity development success verification is best designed methodologically there is a need for new multi path approaches that reliably capture the success of capacity development interventions while suitable indicators must be identified depending on each case respective indicators should involve at best all four relevant dimensions of intervention impact namely basic intervention statistics intervention output intervention outcome as well as the degree of enhancement of the state of groundwater resources beyond intervention success it is argued that intervention sustainability is more likely to be achieved when capacity development activities involve a strategy of how to connect participants to local system inherent incentive structures as part of the respective enabling environment that support desired behavioral changes further research is required on success and sustainability verification mechanisms in groundwater capacity development contexts for developing reliable procedures to quantify and monitor intervention success beyond academia the issue likewise concerns international donors and networks it is necessary to develop suitable funding schemes that cover the full capacity development cycle including success evaluation if we expect groundwater capacity development to unfold its full potential as an sdg 6 accelerator it is indispensable to systematically infer lessons learned from each case by a scientifically sound success and sustainability assessment for adjusting respective practice accordingly the discussion of the topic should find its way on the agenda of the concerned international community declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this research was partly funded by a postdoctoral scholarship from the german academic exchange

11739,the un water sdg 6 global acceleration framework launched in 2020 emphasizes the strategic role capacity development holds for ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water as groundwater represents 97 of the world s available freshwater resources achieving groundwater sustainability marks a central issue in this effort the given systematic review provides a synthesis of current practice in groundwater capacity development drawing from international literature we provide a groundwater specific panorama of the three central components of a capacity development cycle namely stakeholder dependent capacity assessment capacity development implementation as well as success verification and monitoring mechanisms generic capacity development responses were observed to run the risk of being ineffective in the framework of the review an overview of field proven groundwater capacity development modules is developed synthesizing underlying learning processes outputs and outcomes providing such an inventory is expected to help overcome generic approaches and to lower the barriers to case dependent tailoring of groundwater capacity development interventions further we find that current groundwater capacity development success evaluation is in large part missing a rigorous scientific lens this condition limits the ability to objectively derive case dependent best practice recommendations for upscaling and increasing groundwater capacity development impacts possible ways ahead are discussed with the given review we intend to foster reciprocal learning among practitioners and promote capacity development in its role as an sdg 6 accelerator the results are of interest for capacity development practice in sustainable development in general graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater sustainability capacity development sdg 6 learning 1 introduction in the context of international cooperation capacity development refers to a process that enables individuals organizations and societies to obtain strengthen and maintain capabilities for understanding their development issues and for setting and achieving their own development targets alaerts 2008 undp 2015 ibisch et al 2016 capacity development involves the appropriation of knowledge skills and leadership as well as the revision and adaption of roles attitudes and accountabilities among concerned actors horton 2003 van hofwegen 2004 fowler et al 2010 undp 2015 ibisch et al 2016 successful capacity development acknowledges the socio cultural legal and political environment in which it takes place van der voorn 2008 ferrero et al 2019 in line with the 2030 agenda for sustainable development of the united nations un the ideal capacity development process is described as an iterating and inclusive cycle that integrates the following five steps 1 stakeholder engagement 2 joint assessment of capacity assets and gaps 3 joint elaboration of a capacity development program 4 implementation of capacity development responses and 5 success evaluation and sustainability monitoring fig 1 alaerts and kaspersma 2009 undp 2015 ibisch et al 2016 leal filho et al 2019 stafford

97 of the world s available freshwater resources achieving groundwater sustainability marks a most central issue in this effort iah 2017 guppy et al 2018 igrac 2018 elshall et al 2020 gleeson et al 2020 and is an indispensable prerequisite for achieving a set of other interlinked sdgs velis et al 2017 igrac 2018 bocanegra 2021 in this context groundwater sustainability must be understood as a transdisciplinary challenge elshall et al 2020 it can be defined as the development and exploitation of groundwater resources to meet current and future beneficial uses without causing unacceptable environmental or socioeconomic impacts while involving participatory and adaptive governance processes alley et al 1999 elshall et al 2020 the common rationale that justifies capacity development for groundwater sustainability is that groundwater degradation is in many cases driven by inadequate behavior and management of relevant stakeholders and or a lack of institutional accountability more fundamentally those drivers can be traced back to a lack of knowledge skill leadership unfavorable attitudes and inefficient institutional arrangements fig 1 capacity development responses are therefore intended to provide a nourishing environment that makes conscious use of suitable learning formats and stakeholder interactions for cultivating respective capacities pahl wostl 2002 pahl wostl et al 2007 fowler et al 2010 lebel et al 2010 ibisch et al 2016 alaerts and kaspersma 2022 on the institutional and societal level it involves the revision of institutional arrangements and relevant policies in this manner capacity development that promotes groundwater sustainability intends to inform and change the behavior of involved actors lead to expedient institutional performance and foster policies that incentive desired behavioral changes outcomes alaerts 2008 ibisch et al 2016 brauer et al 2017 alpizar et al 2019 fig 1 empowering capacity in the context of groundwater sustainability comes with certain intrinsic challenges that differ from other environmental fields groundwater is a common pool resource whose access and use is in large parts of the world of imperative importance albrecht et al 2017 castilla rho et al 2020 foster et al 2020 yet it is a hidden invisible resource which means that groundwater stakeholders and beneficiaries frequently lack an adequate understanding of groundwater fluxes groundwater surface interactions and groundwater vulnerability re and misstear 2017 foster 2020 fraser et al 2020 foster and macdonald 2021 mannix et al 2021 nolte et al 2021 misstear et al 2022 the mismanagement of groundwater in turn can have adverse effects on human health and well being water supply and food security groundwater reliant ecosystems and can even negatively impact local and regional climates barlage et al 2015 watto and mugera 2016 ameur et al 2017 alfarrah and walraevens 2018 scheihing and tröger 2018 makarigakis and jimenez cisneros 2019 karunanidhi et al 2021 scheihing et al 2022 due to these topic specific constraints globally reported capacity development responses for achieving groundwater sustainability merit a self contained systematic review with the given review on groundwater capacity development we follow the objective of fostering reciprocal learning among practitioners stimulate the debate in the community concerning best practices and promote groundwater capacity development in its role as an sdg 6 accelerator for this purpose we apply a systematic search and review methodology examining groundwater capacity development interventions that were documented internationally during the past decade we lay our focus on the three central aspects of an ideal capacity development cycle fig 1 1 capacity gaps and assets of different stakeholder groups 2 types of modules for capacity development implementation and 3 current success and sustainability verification practice drawing from international literature we identify recurring stakeholder dependent capacity gaps and assets and summarize reported drawbacks that the encountered capacity gaps typically entail for groundwater management the compilation of capacity gaps and assets of different stakeholders can help practitioners to contextualize capacity development issues in their particular practice further as a support for practitioners to adequately address eventual capacity gaps in their working environment we provide an overview of field proven modules for capacity development implementation synthesizing underlying learning processes involved stakeholder interactions as well as outcomes appraising respective capacity development modules and instruments follows the intention of working towards a modular construction kit for the dynamic and case dependent design of groundwater capacity development programs such capacity development programs could comprise academic community and institutional levels or integrated mixtures of these finally the synthesis is closed by reviewing existing approaches for evaluating the success and sustainability of groundwater capacity development responses this last aspect of the capacity development cycle is often found to be neglected requiring stronger attention from the groundwater community the findings are of interest for capacity development practice in environmental sciences in general 2 methods we applied a systematic search and review methodology moher et al 2009 to synthesize global peer reviewed scientific and grey literature on capacity development in the field of groundwater management we limited our search to anglophone literature that was published in the period from january 01 2010 to november 01 2021 conference proceedings were explicitly excluded from the search process the literature search was executed from october 26 2021 to november 15 2021 on the scientific online databases scopus and web of science additionally matching grey literature as well as peer reviewed articles were identified by using the google scholar platform respectively considered sources were limited to the first 150 results fig 2 eleven articles were added from our personal library because of their high thematic relevance of which seven do not comply with the temporal restriction the search criteria for the databases scopus and web of science were directed to the abstracts of potential sources and included the following search commands capacity building and hydrogeology or aquifer or groundwater capacity development and hydrogeology or aquifer or groundwater education and hydrogeology or aquifer or groundwater the search criteria used on google scholar referred to the full text of the literature and were defined as capacity building or capacity development or education and aquifer or hydrogeology or groundwater the respective procedure yielded 338 results including 152 duplicates after excluding duplicates the remaining 186 items were preliminarily screened by searching the respective full texts for the keywords listed above in this manner 72 sources that made no significant contributions to the field of capacity development for groundwater sustainability were identified and removed all of these excluded sources only incidentally mentioned the terms capacity development or capacity building but did not specifically relate capacity development requirements or practice to the subject of the respective publication thus by this exclusion mechanism the number of potentially significant studies was limited to 114 a closer review excluded a further 32 topically distant titles that had no specific relevance for the field of groundwater capacity development but at the same time yielded 21 additional sources by backward citation check that were thematically indeed of importance following this procedure the number of sources included in the presented narrative synthesis was reduced to 103 3 results and discussion 3 1 overview of included studies the systematic search methodology yielded 103 titles to be included in the given review of these 103 studies 93 represent peer reviewed sources and 10 are grey literature table 1 half of the studies exhibit a clear focus on capacity development issues linked to groundwater the other half involves capacity development and groundwater but has in principle another thematic focus the latter half often consists of studies that describe encountered capacity gaps in the context of research projects in total 61 of the 103 titles touch on capacity development in low and middle income countries and 22 titles concern high income settings 3 2 stakeholder dependent capacity gaps and assets in accord with the capacity development rationale fig 1 indicators of missing groundwater capacity can embark unfavorable behavior of stakeholders poor institutional performance and inconsistent policies that in sum lead to groundwater degradation the cause of these shortcomings can be specified as 1 a lack of knowledge and groundwater system understanding 2 unfavorable attitudes and roles towards groundwater 3 a lack of experience and skill in groundwater monitoring and assessment 4 missing leadership or 5 inappropriate institutional arrangements and policies van hofwegen 2004 alaerts 2008 undp 2015 ibisch et al 2016 capacity assets can consistently be described as the opposite of each of those categories overall a capacity gap describes the discrepancy between a required threshold of capacity and the actual capacity of stakeholder groups or institutions assuming that the required threshold assures behaviors and performances promoting groundwater sustainability james and menachery 2019 here presented stakeholder dependent capacity gaps were derived from the reviewed bulk of literature and summarize repeatedly reported shortcomings in the field of groundwater without being exhaustive they intend to provide a sound experience based orientation of common groundwater capacity gaps capacity assets were reported much less frequently compared to capacity gaps but are included in this chapter as well where applicable when the method for assessing capacity gaps and assets was reported respective authors almost exclusively referred to questionnaires semi structured interviews or surveys involving concerned stakeholders braune et al 2010 sloots 2010 nussbaumer et al 2016 yohannes et al 2017 undp 2020 a brief overview of the findings of this chapter is presented in table 2 3 2 1 small communities and farmers the majority of reported capacity gaps for groundwater dependent small communities and farmers refer to gaps in knowledge and system understanding and a lesser extent to a lack of skill and unfavorable attitudes a general notion is that there persists a lack of adaptive capacity to face changing environmental conditions such as increased frequency of droughts e g as a consequence of climate change or water scarcity e g due to overexploitation yohannes et al 2017 jadeja et al 2018 christen e w 2020 bhangaonkar and fennell 2021 carrión mero et al 2021 such a lack of adaptive capacity is most of the time associated with missing local groundwater system understanding and a consequent inability of anticipating future scenarios including unfavorable attitudes such as myopic thinking e g by preferring water intensive cash crops meinzen dick et al 2016 bhangaonkar and fennell 2021 carrión mero et al 2021 missing basic knowledge on groundwater including groundwater policy frameworks is further found to hamper required community level action and participation kulkarni et al 2015 gomes et al 2018 hermans et al 2019 other research highlights the high attitudinal diversity that can persist throughout communities and the necessity to respect these differences for successfully fostering sustainable groundwater management varua et al 2016 ward et al 2016 overall the mentioned capacity gaps drive the overuse of local aquifers lead to decreased crop yields and finally threaten the source of income of small farmers and communities pascuala et al 2010 yohannes et al 2017 gomes et al 2018 christen e w 2020 bhangaonkar and fennell 2021 in some cases missing knowledge and skill on groundwater quality and treatment are also associated with increased health risks from contaminated groundwater hynds et al 2013 mcintyre et al 2015 murray and sharmin 2015 re et al 2017 however in a rare case from australia indigenous knowledge has been found to be an asset to better inform water management decisions liedloff et al 2013 this example calls to attention that community based traditional knowledge could be regarded in other cases as well as an asset to build on when executing groundwater capacity development interventions 3 2 2 public the anticipated capacity level of the public to which a capacity gap could be formulated is generally low baldwin et al 2012 describe that a lack of hydrogeological understanding concerning groundwater dependent ecosystems and impacts of anthropogenic activities hinders public participations processes ballester and mott lacroix 2016 and kulkarni et al 2015 further state that knowledge gaps among the public can lead to distrust toward water boards and water councils both conditions can aggravate achieving groundwater sustainability in the case of involving citizens in groundwater related citizen science further application specific knowledge and skills are required little et al 2016 3 2 3 managerial and professional staff of water institutions a common thread regarding capacity deficiencies of staff of water institutions is data management data utilization and data analysis particularly for sub saharan africa and parts of asia it is reported that respective professionals lack hydrogeological knowledge for utilizing fundamental groundwater data such as water levels or salinity and borehole data mcintyre et al 2015 nussbaumer et al 2016 gheuens et al 2019 rivett et al 2019 rossetto et al 2019 serele et al 2020 undp 2020 this is one of the reasons why the collection and management of respective data are sometimes considered useless and negligible by respective staff members unfavorable attitude nussbaumer et al 2016 the lack of well trained groundwater professionals knowledge and skill and related poor data management in water institutions have four principle consequences 1 groundwater is not made use of at its full potential to foster development braune et al 2010 gaye and tindimugaya 2019 2 well drilling programs are ineffective resulting in low yields poor quality of well water and loss of financial resources rivett et al 2019 serele et al 2020 3 undetected adverse impacts on groundwater by heavy users and polluters like industry and agriculture undp 2020 and 4 a low adaptation capacity concerning changing environmental or societal conditions bassi et al 2021 shortcomings in the leadership of managerial staff on the other hand is found to hamper the implementation of reliable groundwater management frameworks water stewardship and data management in several developing and transitional countries mcintyre et al 2015 alpizar et al 2019 undp 2020 a lack of managerial leadership can also reflect by a lack of strategic foresight which includes settings where assigned staff see no incentives for taking over technical leadership limiting institutional accomplishments onencan et al 2016 brauer et al 2017 undp 2020 further share the notion of technical staff of cambodian governmental departments that hold that instead of missing knowledge and skill a lack of financial means is the actual cause of inefficient groundwater management 3 2 4 water institutions comments on institutional capacity deficiencies and policy failure can be divided into three main areas 1 poor institutional data collection and management as well as closed data philosophies 2 insufficient institutional arrangements and administrative procedures and 3 insufficient or contradictory policies kulkarni et al 2015 mcevoy 2015 shen 2015 hoogesteger and wester 2017 mengistu et al 2019 xu et al 2019 those conditions are observed to lead to poor institutional performance and contribute to weak enabling environments hindering groundwater sustainability a common notion is that incapacitated water institutions are a principal reason for a lack of reliable groundwater information including fundamental monitoring data and meaningful data products such as relevant maps this condition impedes expedient institutional communication and decision making and ultimately leads back to a lack of institutionalized knowledge and skill vassolo 2012 foster and garduño 2013 kulkarni et al 2015 ibisch et al 2016 undp 2020 associated with that are poor groundwater monitoring programs with low station density and scattered institutional data silos which counteract data integration kulkarni et al 2015 shen 2015 ibisch et al 2016 undp 2020 a lack of data availability also due to closed data philosophies is for example reported to result in poorly calibrated groundwater models in china hampering good management practice shen 2015 data silos are as well an indicator of a lack of horizontal and vertical interplay among different environmental institutions ibisch et al 2016 having said that unfavorable institutional arrangements and a lack of hydrogeological knowledge and skill further aggravate the sustainable management of transboundary aquifers fried et al 2011 vassolo 2012 puri and villholth 2017 kileshye et al 2020 insufficient institutional arrangements are described as well by braune et al 2010 regarding south africa they state that a national institutional groundwater champion was missing in consequence a failure of registering and verifying existing groundwater uses very long groundwater licensing processes with no single streamlined procedure and poor groundwater data management was described mengistu et al 2019 and gomes et al 2018 make very similar observations for ethiopia and bangladesh respectively and add that a resulting lack of institutional accountability hindered enforcement of groundwater development regulations the central reason called into play for these conditions apart from missing capacity is a lack of systematic investments which in part can be traced back to an undervaluing of groundwater at the decision making level unfavorable attitude braune et al 2010 kiparsky et al 2017 gaye and tindimugaya 2019 pavelic and villholth 2020 sousa and fussi 2021 insufficient funds were sometimes also linked to high staff turnover and thus a draining of institutional capacity braune et al 2010 alpizar et al 2019 kileshye et al 2020 3 2 5 academia and ngos in africa and india most commonly a lack of scientifically trained hydrogeologists is cited with the need to gain regional groundwater system understanding and assess impacts of climate change on subsurface surface water systems amani et al 2015 kulkarni et al 2015 banda et al 2019 gaye and tindimugaya 2019 xu et al 2019 apart from that mcintyre et al 2015 conclude based on case studies in peru colombia ghana zambia indonesia philippines and mongolia that research is putting too little effort into outreach attitude type of capacity gap ortigara et al 2018 are in line with this argument and summarize that water researchers and professionals are repeatedly falsely assuming a linear pathway from scientific inside to practice and policy neglecting the interplay of power and politics on the ground alpizar et al 2019 on the other hand demand from researchers to consistently apply a scientific lens to the subject of capacity development also in groundwater related contexts finding that few scientifically sound studies assess the actual effectiveness of differing capacity development approaches inappropriate attitude similarly hasan et al 2020 find that ngos in bangladesh who were working with communities to support the maintenance of locally managed aquifer recharge systems are largely unaware of methodological progress in current capacity development practice this gap in knowledge and skill resulted in generic and ineffective capacity building activities as well as a lack of vision for cultivating collective action among participants hasan et al 2020 hasan et al 2020 further describe that some of the assessed ngos have a clear bias towards working with relatively prospective users and communities who are likely to respond more favorably to their support potentially unfavorable attitude besides capacity gaps of students and pupils involve a lack of simple conceptual hydrogeological system understanding which goes along with undifferentiated views of the effects of e g mining activities on groundwater and reduced concerns regarding groundwater related environmental problems mcintyre et al 2015 unterbruner et al 2016 pan and liu 2018 arthurs 2019 3 3 learning modules of capacity development programs for achieving groundwater sustainability as outlined in the introduction successful capacity development is a dynamic learning process that considers capacity assets and gaps of the target group and is tailored to their socio environmental context fig 1 a central success factor for impactful capacity development is the usage of suitable learning formats that address the different settings and needs of the target group adequately as will be outlined below there is currently a wide range of different capacity development approaches that are being entertained in case studies on groundwater capacity development worldwide yet there has been no attempt to make an inventory of these different approaches this can result in a lack of awareness about possible learning formats and their outcomes which potentially limits the capability of instructors to dynamically adapt groundwater capacity development programs for tackling this shortcoming we gather in the given section a catalogue of field proven learning modules for groundwater capacity development based on a thorough systematic literature review the presented catalogue is intended to support concerned actors in tailoring groundwater related capacity development responses by synthesizing for each module the underlying learning processes the involved stakeholder interactions as well as principal outputs and outcomes fig 1 in total we identified 13 fundamental learning modules as a means of visual conceptualization they are schematically gathered in fig 3 while all presented learning modules cultivate simultaneously different capacities they are being ordered here by the suggested principal type of capacity output knowledge skill attitude or leadership 3 3 1 learning modules for the development of knowledge and system understanding 3 3 1 1 educational material and knowledge management platforms textbooks form the primary source for academic hydrogeological knowledge with well defined core contents and usually long shelf lives post 2013 but they are directed to a specialized or specializing academic audience and provide only very limited applications for capacity development activities in multi actor contexts handbooks and leaflets on the other hand that are specially designed as a reference for knowledge internalized during groundwater capacity development interventions can be of great value guo and jiang 2011 escalante et al 2013 agw net 2014 however hermans et al 2019 remind us that respective texts intended for conveying knowledge are sometimes too abstract and hence useless for users capacity facilitators should be aware of this problem and thus emphasize a practical and applied style of writing when drafting educational material in general it is recommendable to adapt the style of educational material to the social cultural and environmental background of the target group including local groundwater conditions if possible re and misstear 2017 houben 2019 that is because the internalization of new knowledge is considered to work best when it is linked to personal meaning baldwin et al 2012 houben 2019 for example describes the use of an educational comic book tailored to pupils of primary schools in paraguay for successfully teaching groundwater issues when addressing adult readerships however facilitating access to required knowledge via online knowledge management platforms instead of printed or digital handbooks has sometimes turned out to be a better solution ibisch et al 2016 knowledge management platforms have the advantage that apart from organizing knowledge their contents can be adapted dynamically respecting for example new aspects that arose during capacity development activities they can further facilitate a forum for communication cooperation and hence peer to peer learning among participants ibisch et al 2016 3 3 1 2 conventional courses workshops and e learning courses and e learning formats for groundwater capacity development should be adjusted to the socio economic and environmental contexts that hold personal meaning for the target group leidel et al 2013 ibisch et al 2016 reimann et al 2019 academic courses on groundwater are generally recommended to balance lectures laboratory computer based exercises and field campaigns gleeson et al 2012 hakoun et al 2013 reimann et al 2019 advocate in this context blending established lecture formats with e learning tools however that requires having access to relevant equipment and facilities bethune and ryan 2010 while best practices from academia can be of interest to other international capacity development settings they surely cannot be applied universally as they follow the particular aim of instilling academic excellence however the blending of different learning formats is generally recommendable for not running the risk of being ineffective alpizar et al 2019 for example describe the fruitlessness of a simple lecture based workshop for provoking behavioral change among costa rican water organizations interactive learning software supporting groundwater system understanding are an example of an additional learning format for diversifying workshop settings unterbruner et al 2016 present a learning software that guides users interactively through the water cycle including conceptual hydrogeological aspects penny and mullen 2021 on the other hand outline a web based platform that allows users to design a hydrogeological system including aquifer properties and pumping wells and simulate respective hydraulic head behavior and particle movement apart from those examples there is also older but still valuable educational groundwater software hsieh 2001 3 3 1 3 developing media content reported groundwater capacity development practices involving different media types such as radio video or social media are not very common re and misstear 2017 discuss the pros and cons of social media platforms for raising awareness of groundwater issues and conclude that it can support outreach and awareness campaigns a case study from brazil for example describes how water capacity development in schools provided incentives for students to start their own awareness campaigns on water conservation via social media da silva et al 2020 apart from that amani et al 2015 report that periodic radio programs in conjunction with other capacity development interventions helped to successfully sensitize local communities regarding groundwater pollution in ghana moreover students from laos developed a short video on enhancing agricultural water management as part of their training to publicly raise awareness of the issue pavelic and villholth 2020 learners that use media to prepare educational content for broader audiences have the opportunity to autonomously revise and conceptualize their understanding and anticipate the perspective of audiences that are new to the subject engaging learners in developing modern media content can help to multiply awareness of groundwater da silva et al 2020 3 3 1 4 physical and digital aquifer models and drawing baldwin et al 2012 successfully deployed both small 3d physical models and digital 3d models of local groundwater systems to convey system understanding to communities in the context of public participation processes also other authors describe the utility of physical aquifer models for educational purposes as they provide a tangible presentation of an otherwise invisible system rodhe 2012 houben 2019 another well suited tool for visualizing groundwater systems and at the same time comprehending participants preconceptions of groundwater systems is drawing unterbruner et al 2016 arthurs and elwonger 2018 pan and liu 2018 in two educational studies participants were asked to draw two dimensional cross sections of simple groundwater systems including surface features like trees and rivers according to their understanding arthurs and elwonger 2018 pan and liu 2018 consequently the sketches were compared with educational material and discussed among participants and instructors in this manner initially incorrect mental models of groundwater systems could be revised in a cooperative process however drawing as a tool for revising groundwater system understanding could also be merged with the consequent presentation of small 3d physical groundwater models computer animated groundwater system models or simple software tools unterbruner et al 2016 blending these learning elements provides a predict observe discuss setting that is commonly regarded as a best practice for stimulating learning processes arthurs 2019 instructors could likewise join the initial drawing exercise for creating a level field of interaction which is often regarded as favorable for following discussion rounds hermans et al 2019 3 3 1 5 participation processes while participation processes are not per se understood as a capacity development format several research examples demonstrate that participation is a very good framework for developing capacity baldwin et al 2012 kulkarni et al 2015 ballester and mott lacroix 2016 hermans et al 2019 not seldomly participation processes reveal knowledge or attitudinal capacity gaps among stakeholders that could be addressed in accompanying capacity development responses ballester and mott lacroix 2016 ibisch et al 2016 hermans et al 2019 argue in line with that and add that a common ground of understanding is essential to assure just negotiations in participation processes a straightforward approach to involve stakeholders of participation formats in learning processes is a joint fact finding mission baldwin et al 2012 joint fact finding missions allow each stakeholder or stakeholder group to autonomously inquire into a given subject and present their findings to the concerned audience finally leading to a sound basis for further discussions of the matter another fruitful learning format hosted by participation processes is active on site consultation and deliberation which can support the building of required interdisciplinary perspectives maheshwari et al 2014 ballester and mott lacroix 2016 the given examples foster particularly peer to peer learning and a shift from prescribing action to learning in actions baldwin et al 2012 3 3 2 learning modules for revising roles and attitudes 3 3 2 1 serious games different types of well thought games were successfully applied in groundwater capacity development contexts typical formats of serious games are role games where groundwater stakeholders are asked to take over the viewpoint of another stakeholder while having to achieve a team decision ferrero et al 2018 gomes et al 2018 goodspeed et al 2020 in another example the problem of overdrawing groundwater as a function of crop choice is framed within a gaming context meinzen dick et al 2016 2018 serious games typically require to be accompanied by well prepared moderators and involve a post play discussion for reflecting the event serious games are reported to increase the awareness of interdependence among groundwater stakeholders and help to revise previous attitudes goodspeed et al 2020 they can foster strategic foresight meinzen dick et al 2016 onencan et al 2016 help convey new strategies for managing groundwater more sustainably and motivate collective action meinzen dick et al 2016 2018 gomes et al 2018 ferrero et al 2018 hold that serious games are an asset for capacity development practices because they introduce the participants to a learning cycle involving concrete experience reflective observation conceptualization and active experimentation 3 3 2 2 questionnaires surveys and interviews embedded into other capacity development activities also questionnaires surveys and interviews can provoke the revision of attitudes by exposing participants to self reflective questions including the consequent discussion of survey wide results nussbaumer et al 2016 wong and yelderman 2016 re et al 2021 nussbaumer et al 2016 report that semi structured interviews with staff of water institutions in zambia supported behavioral changes regarding groundwater monitoring and data management 3 3 3 learning modules for developing experience and skill 3 3 3 1 field campaigns for linking theoretical and conceptual hydrogeological understanding with personal experience guided field campaigns are essential gleeson et al 2012 hakoun et al 2013 banks et al 2021 carrión mero et al 2021 field campaigns serve the development of different methodological skills for the collection of groundwater related data such as spring and stream discharge data groundwater level data physio chemical water parameters as well as data from hydraulic and tracer experiments geological outcrops and hydrogeophysical campaigns guo and jiang 2011 hakoun et al 2013 maheshwari et al 2014 wong and yelderman 2016 poudel and duex 2017 banks et al 2021 carrión mero et al 2021 banda et al 2019 describe how guided field campaigns and laboratory works successfully promoted the appropriation of skills in the field of isotope hydrology in malawi carrión mero et al 2021 use field campaigns to strengthen a community university partnership in ecuador they execute hydrogeological field campaigns under the umbrella of community service projects which likewise improve the groundwater related capacity of involved citizens guo and jiang 2011 on the other hand use a groundwater polluting accident as a tracer test in a karst system to increase understanding of groundwater vulnerability among involved stakeholders in china groundwater related field campaigns for capacity development could however also involve on site questionnaires and interviews of well owners and groundwater users for learning about socio hydrogeological aspects hynds et al 2013 re et al 2017 2021 3 3 3 2 training and application of specialized groundwater software training on groundwater related software such as modelling suits aims at developing specialist skills that form an asset for generating knowledge from data mays 2010 filippis et al 2020 pavelic and villholth 2020 mays 2010 describes a one week course on stochastic groundwater modelling and verify how software exercises permit the application and transfer of fundamental hydrogeological knowledge to new challenges hakoun et al 2013 point out that self reliant experimentation with groundwater software can foster the development of conceptualization and problem solving skills another example provide pavelic and villholth 2020 they integrate on site collected water level data for calibrating groundwater models during class exercises for achieving an active learning environment 3 3 3 3 internships and on the job training many sources advocate internships and on the job training as an expedient form of developing capacity because it links the appropriation of knowledge with experience building activities braune et al 2010 hlophe and hillie 2014 undp 2015 ibisch et al 2016 james and menachery 2019 pavelic and villholth 2020 hlophe and hillie 2014 describe how the involvement of master students in establishing a water treatment and supply plant for purifying brackish groundwater in rural south africa helped to form technological multipliers the respective students were encouraged to write their master s thesis on technological and chemical issues around the project braune et al 2010 on the other hand advocate institutional internship programs for forming lacking human capital specialized in groundwater 3 3 3 4 using technical facilities for on site capacity development there are some examples where groundwater related technical facilities were adapted for capacity development purposes including technology demonstration and experiments nestmann et al 2016 set forth their capacity development experiences with a pump as turbine driven groundwater supply facility as installed on a university campus in indonesia their learning targets are conveying technical functionality proper utilization and added value of the technology through on site training nestmann et al 2016 similar approaches can be found for capacity development around managed aquifer recharge facilities in india jadeja et al 2018 christen e w 2020 hasan et al 2020 ibisch et al 2016 further explain how eco technologically constructed wetland models can be used to experiment and teach about percolation and filtration processes by creating waste water with safe ingredients they demonstrate how pollutants can be retained during percolation by sedimentary layers ibisch et al 2016 pavelic and villholth 2020 on the other hand use a field experiment facility on a university campus in laos to teach agricultural water management using suited technical facilities for capacity development in this manner can provide an experimental learning setting that promotes learning processes 3 3 3 5 citizen science involving citizens in groundwater and drinking water monitoring programs can help strengthen the databases for sound hydro environmental management thornton and leahy 2012 little et al 2016 brouwer et al 2018 prajapati et al 2021 an indispensable part of successful citizen science formats are capacity development and outreach activities that convey system understanding and skills to lay scientists little et al 2016 jamieson et al 2020 manda et al 2021 due to the practical nature of citizen science approaches respective capacity development activities are predestined to link field practice and learning by doing with on site deliberation citizen science approaches should engage local lay scientists that have a personal relation to the studied environment then respective participants are enabled to contribute to the co production of data and knowledge at a scale that holds personal meaning to them which promotes learning lebel et al 2010 baldwin et al 2012 haywood 2016 walker et al 2021 beyond the acquisition of knowledge and skill citizen science in the groundwater sector is found to increase the trust of participants in water institutions research and data quality thornton and leahy 2012 brouwer et al 2018 walker et al 2021 where sufficient incentives are provided citizen science can even function as a gateway for individuals to continue specialization moving from being citizen scientists to being citizen scientist trainers or local groundwater champions flores díaz et al 2018 jadeja et al 2018 christen e w 2020 3 3 4 learning module for developing leadership 3 3 4 1 training groundwater champions individuals that act as beneficial change agents and or capacity multipliers in their socio cultural and political environment are sometimes termed champions taylor et al 2012 undp 2015 jadeja et al 2018 ortigara et al 2018 jamieson et al 2020 groundwater champions necessarily require leadership skills for establishing a shared vision aligning resources and generating motivation among colleagues and fellows taylor et al 2012 an institutionally focused water champion program is described by taylor et al 2012 it addressed primarily professionals in australian water agencies and was meant to foster organizational bottom up innovation it involved pre training reading and exercises individual weakness and strength assessments and the generation of leadership development plans jadeja et al 2018 and christen 2020 in turn describe an approach that centers around forming local groundwater champions in rural contexts for enhancing community level groundwater management in india their groundwater champions are supposed to develop a level of local system understanding skill and leadership that enables them to monitor and evaluate the status of groundwater in their reach and share their findings with associated communities for steering adaptation measures for achieving that the authors used classroom lectures on site deliberation mapping and data collection in the field but also simple data management applications that permit the remote submission of measured water levels via sms other key interventions that contribute to the strengthening of groundwater champions are the creation of stakeholder networks and the initiation of groundwater forums amani et al 2015 yohannes et al 2017 hermans et al 2019 christen e w 2020 bhangaonkar and fennell 2021 respective studies find that such groundwater champions can successfully act as an intermediary between communities and other groundwater stakeholders and foster adaptation capabilities on a micro watershed level jadeja et al 2018 christen e w 2020 bhangaonkar and fennell 2021 3 4 success verification and monitoring of capacity development interventions the recommended capacity development cycle involves a success verification and sustainability assessment of capacity development activities undp 2015 ibisch et al 2016 indicators for determining the success of capacity development responses could be directed to the level of descriptive data the output level the outcome level as well as their final target the degree of enhancement of the state of groundwater resources fig 4 complementary to a timely isolated success verification assessment the degree of success over time can be understood as a measure of the sustainability of a capacity development intervention descriptive data of a capacity development intervention could involve for example the types of participants numbers of graduations and involved thesis among others pavelic and villholth 2020 for example deploy such numbers as basic success indicators the output level of success evaluation in turn refers to the level of acquired capacities such as knowledge skills changed attitudes or leadership jadeja et al 2018 indicate applying a two day post training workshop to test the skills and knowledge of trained groundwater champions in rural india further measuring success on the outcome level involves the assessment of changes in professional behavior and performance and the degree of adoption of new workflows reporting systems or data management systems kileshye et al 2020 report that they used surveys and third party feedback to evaluate post intervention professional performance over time finally also the change in the state of groundwater resources could be used to evaluate capacity development success if causal relationships can be established amani et al 2015 for example cite river water quality enhancements over a set of years as evidence for successful capacity development interventions in a watershed in ghana previous publications on the subject suggest that instead of descriptive data and mere formal testing of post intervention knowledge and skills of participants output level monitoring of behavioral changes and performance outcome level is more reliable for measuring actual intervention success horton 2003 however we argue that in the best case all of the four mentioned evaluation levels should be respected for success verification this is because the reliability of a capacity development success verification mechanism is highest if causal relationships between all four levels of success evaluation can be established and a concrete impact on the target level e g enhancement of the state of groundwater resources can be confirmed fig 4 deciding on specific indicators for measuring intervention success on the data output outcome and target level might take place partly during the intervention itself for being able to respect the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable dimension that respective change processes encompass but also for allowing a co creative definition of intervention success which depends likewise on input from the target group vallejo and wehn 2016 repeating success verification mechanisms over time could provide a suitable measure of capacity development intervention sustainability fig 4 to foster objectivity in post intervention success evaluation auditing mechanisms including third parties could be pursued ferrero et al 2019 a central constraint in evaluating the lasting success sustainability of capacity development responses is that for its evaluation there must pass a long time after the end of a capacity development measure gunawardana et al 2013 the timely restricted funding periods for capacity development measures often exclude the possibility of realistic long term capacity development success evaluation this finding suggests that donors should consider adjusting their funding schemes and explicitly cover the full capacity development cycle fig 1 including sound studies on capacity development success evaluation fig 4 particularly donors should be interested in enhancing the knowledge on the long term efficacy of capacity development interventions and related success factors for optimizing their return of investment however additional factors that complicate capacity development sustainability verification are co evolving socio economic and environmental boundary conditions that could interfere with intervention successes ibisch et al 2016 a rare example of a fully documented groundwater related capacity development success evaluation is provided by alpizar et al 2019 who intended to stimulate changes in pricing and management practice of 233 community based water management organizations in costa rica involving interviews and surveys two years after the targeted workshop they find no impact on behavioral changes when compared with a control group this underlines the need to systematically study how the design of capacity development programs influences their success for not running the risk of being inefficient however most of the reviewed literature which focused on capacity development for groundwater sustainability table 1 did not mention outcomes of success or sustainability verification mechanisms in cases where such evaluations were reported respective authors comment on their outcomes mostly in an informal fashion lacking a scientific lens alpizar et al 2019 this is reflected by the fact that there are very few studies that provide methodological details regarding success verification at the same time if results are reported they are not being related to potential causes such as the design of the associated capacity development intervention considering socio cultural and governance frameworks enabling environment as well as stakeholder capacity gaps and assets the results of the review suggest in this regard that success evaluation in the field of groundwater capacity development tends to be in large parts subjective poorly documented or not readily accessible this condition indicates a lack of attention among the respective community concerning capacity development success evaluation and marks a central deficit that limits the ability to derive case dependent best practice recommendations for upscaling and increasing capacity development impacts as capacity development is identified as an sdg 6 accelerator by un water tackling the question of groundwater capacity development success and sustainability is crucial for efficiently pursuing sdg 6 while accompanying capacity development processes by sound scientific routines is not useful for all contexts there are settings especially when involving academic institutions where mid term and long term benefits can be expected from systematically applying a scientific lens there is however an open methodological debate regarding how capacity development success verification is best designed in international cooperation vallejo and wehn 2016 currently applied single path approaches used to capture capacity development successes in international cooperation contexts are for example cost benefit analysis cba strengths weakness opportunities problem analysis swop and control group assessments vallejo and wehn 2016 vallejo and wehn 2016 however underline the need for new multi path approaches for reliably capturing the success of capacity development interventions a common notion among reviewed case studies is that as long as funding and hence guidance is provided during capacity development activities behavioral changes can be observed but once the funding and the external guidance ends existing structures tend to fall back to old behavioral patterns requiring long lasting dedication for achieving sustainable changes baldwin et al 2012 ballester and mott lacroix 2016 hermans et al 2019 christen e w 2020 hasan et al 2020 beyond enforcement of legislation benefit generation and incentive mechanisms are known to support the steering and sustaining of behavioral changes in different water contexts aga et al 2018 novak et al 2018 renzaho et al 2018 project funding can provide an initial incentive for stakeholders to engage in capacity development processes including the investment of personal time and resources but the sustainability of capacity development responses beyond the project timeline will often depend on the question of whether new system inherent incentive mechanisms can be tapped or set up that support behavioral changes independent of project funding in this regard incentive structures can be understood as part of the underlying sometimes latent enabling environment into which groundwater capacity development efforts must be consciously interlinked if instructors achieve to demonstrate how participants can maximize also personal benefits from applying acquired capacities while contributing to groundwater sustainability there is a higher chance for process ownership and long term behavioral change aga et al 2018 hermans et al 2019 depending on the societal context possible incentives for involved actors could be societal recognition and increased self esteem jadeja et al 2018 hermans et al 2019 christen e w 2020 avoidance of health risks and water scarcity murray and sharmin 2015 meinzen dick et al 2018 thematically suited career and job opportunities taylor et al 2012 jadeja et al 2018 or financial compensations for for example adjusted agricultural practices and water conservation ibisch et al 2016 alyaarbi et al 2019 scheihing et al 2020 bhangaonkar and fennell 2021 likewise self organized local water management rules between competing users can provide an incentivizing framework for sustaining behavioral change ostrom and gardner 1993 the question of which system s inherent incentive structure will be pursued during a capacity development cycle and how it will be achieved that participants buy in should be addressed at the beginning of a groundwater capacity development process 4 conclusions the given groundwater specific review focuses on the three central aspects of a typical capacity development cycle capacity gap and asset assessment capacity development implementation and success verification the international groundwater literature lays a strong focus on identifying capacity gaps while capacity assets are seldomly reported capacity gaps in the groundwater sector are manyfold and dependent on the assessed circle of actors a recurring thread among the capacity gaps of groundwater professionals and groundwater related institutions concern knowledge skills and attitudes regarding data collection data management and data processing this lack of data stewardship is aggravated by closed data philosophies and missing horizontal and vertical institutional interplay neglected groundwater data stewardship undermines respective adaptation capacities and was observed to contribute to the underestimation of the importance of groundwater for sustainable development on the decision making level a condition that not seldomly leads to insufficient systematic investments into groundwater generic content centered groundwater capacity development interventions run the risk of being ineffective capacity development responses require case dependent tailoring and should make conscious use of suited learning formats for addressing actor specific capacity needs a lack of awareness of existing capacity development concepts and learning processes potentially limits the capability of instructors to appropriately adapt groundwater capacity development programs a catalogue of field proven groundwater capacity development modules as developed in this study can lower the barriers for a case dependent design of capacity development measures potentially increasing impacts capacity development success verification is an indispensable part of the capacity development cycle there is however widely missing a scientific approach to the subject of groundwater capacity development success verification success verification results are seldomly reported and if addressed the methodological description of the study design and the analysis of results are often insufficient this condition marks a central deficit that limits the ability to objectively derive case dependent best practice recommendations for upscaling and increasing groundwater capacity development impacts in the field of international cooperation in general there is an ongoing debate regarding how capacity development success verification is best designed methodologically there is a need for new multi path approaches that reliably capture the success of capacity development interventions while suitable indicators must be identified depending on each case respective indicators should involve at best all four relevant dimensions of intervention impact namely basic intervention statistics intervention output intervention outcome as well as the degree of enhancement of the state of groundwater resources beyond intervention success it is argued that intervention sustainability is more likely to be achieved when capacity development activities involve a strategy of how to connect participants to local system inherent incentive structures as part of the respective enabling environment that support desired behavioral changes further research is required on success and sustainability verification mechanisms in groundwater capacity development contexts for developing reliable procedures to quantify and monitor intervention success beyond academia the issue likewise concerns international donors and networks it is necessary to develop suitable funding schemes that cover the full capacity development cycle including success evaluation if we expect groundwater capacity development to unfold its full potential as an sdg 6 accelerator it is indispensable to systematically infer lessons learned from each case by a scientifically sound success and sustainability assessment for adjusting respective practice accordingly the discussion of the topic should find its way on the agenda of the concerned international community declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this research was partly funded by a postdoctoral scholarship from the german academic exchange service to the first author the first author thanks igrac for hosting the given research
