8335,study region this study analyzes the impact of land use changes on the hydrology of kolar district in the state of karnataka india kolar receives on average 565 mm σ 130 rainfall during june to october and has a wide gap between its water supply and demand study focus this research identifies the reasons and causes of the gap a water balance model was successfully calibrated and validated against measurements of groundwater level recharge and surface runoff new hydrological insights for the region the study revealed that between 1972 and 2011 there was a major shift from grass and rainfed crop lands to eucalyptus plantation and irrigated cultivation about 17 7 and 18 of the district area converted into eucalyptus plantation and irrigated lands during this period respectively eucalyptus plantations tended to cause large losses by et leading to increase in soil moisture deficit and reduction in the recharge to groundwater and in surface runoff approx 30 the irrigation demand of the district increased from 57 mm 1972 to 140 mm 2011 which resulted in increased groundwater abstraction by 145 the expansion of the irrigated area is the major contributing factor for widening the demand supply gap 62 of the freshwater availability results could help various stakeholders including district and national authorities to develop the most suitable water management strategies in order to close the gap between water supply and demand keywords water balance groundwater recharge water table depletion groundwater resilience land use change eucalyptus 1 introduction globally freshwater availability is declining coupled with increasing population pressure land use change industrial growth and urbanization vörösmarty et al 2000 gordon et al 2005 gerten et al 2011 2013 haddeland et al 2014 there is increasing concern among different sectors stakeholders for their water share at local regional and national scale punjabi and johnson 2016 stefano et al 2017 avellán et al 2017 atef et al 2019 veise et al 2020 globally agriculture consumes about 80 of fresh water resources and more than 570 million farm families are dependent on the agriculture sector lowder et al 2016 and are vulnerable to increasing water scarcity recanati et al 2017 climate change has worsened the situation further with uncertainty in freshwater availability and its sustainability wada et al 2011 feng et al 2013 elmeddahi et al 2016 mousivand and arsanjani 2018 rodell et al 2018 huang et al 2019 this also has become critical to meet food security and poverty eradication according to the united nations agenda 2030 schleicher et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 globally about 480 million ha of land was brought under crop and grazing land use since 1960 to feed an increasing population with changing food habits gibbs et al 2010 lambin and meyfroidt 2010 the change in land use has affected hydrological cycle at regional scale and has crossed the critical level of safe operation rockström et al 2009 dearing et al 2014 cole et al 2014 hossain et al 2017 steffen et al 2015 with increasing crop land pressure on water resource especially groundwater has increased globally about 982 billion cubic meter bcm groundwater is abstracted annually and out of which 70 is used for agriculture siebert et al 2010 gleeson et al 2016 the crop land under irrigation is about 301 million ha of which 38 is dependent on groundwater sources siebert et al 2010 gleeson et al 2016 india ranks number one in groundwater use for meeting its demand from domestic industrial and agricultural sectors groundwater extraction in india has accelerated from 25 bcm in the 1960 to 250 bcm by 2015 gleeson et al 2016 goi 2019 the increase in water utilization was linked to the need to ensure the food security of the country however it resulted in depletion of groundwater resources especially in dry regions reddy 2005 palanisami et al 2008 anantha 2013 in addition groundwater assessment in india showed that annual groundwater recharge has decreased from 447 bcm to 432 bcm due to multiple factors e g urbanization crop intensification etc goi 2019 about 17 of the india has been categorized as overexploited indicating groundwater extraction exceeds the annual replenishable groundwater recharge and 5 are critical where the state of groundwater extraction is equal to annual replenishable groundwater recharge goi 2019 this situation raises serious concerns about the future of the groundwater resources pertaining to water availability food and livelihood security and sustainability of the dependent ecosystems rodríguez suárez et al 2011 southern indian states are rapidly growing in terms of economic development including agriculture akram and rath 2020 to sustain this growth this region is exploiting available resources which lead to overexploitation of certain resources such as groundwater in this context there is a need to understand the changing pattern of resource utilization and its impact on hydrological processes kolar district in the state of karnataka has undergone substantial change in terms of land use due to number of anthropogenic activities and one of the water stressed district in southern india srinivasan et al 2015 penny et al 2018 there are no comprehensive studies that attempted to understand the changes in hydrological processes given that this district has a gap between its water supply and demand srinivasan et al 2015 this research aims to identify reasons and causes of the gap with the following objectives i analyze changes in water balance components of the kolar district since 1970 and ii assess the causes of groundwater and surface water depletion 2 material and methods 2 1 study area karnataka is the eighth largest state in india accounting for 5 13 of country s total population gok 2011 karnataka has variable rainfall diverse soil types and cropping patterns wani et al 2017 based on this diversity the state has been divided into ten agro climatic zones gok 2018a among these agro climatic zones the southern dry zone is vulnerable in terms of climate change mujumdar 2013 rao et al 2013 changes in land use and declining available natural resources ramachandra et al 2004 kolar district is located 13 135745 n 78 132561 e in the southeast of karnataka state and has a total geographical area of 4012 km² and a population of 1 54 million goi 2011 agriculture and associated activities are the major livelihood source in the district nearly 30 of the geographical area in the district is covered by pasture trees and shrubland which was largely planted with eucalyptus in the last two to three decades and 66 of the area is under agriculture nagaraj et al 2003 reddy 2005 out of 2651 km2 agriculture land 59 of the area is rainfed in which millet and cereal are the dominant crops gok 2018b the remaining 41 of the area is irrigated fruits vegetables and mulberry which require year round irrigation gok 2018b kolar district fig 1 was known for its ancient surface water reservoirs commonly known as tanks the tanks were excavated by ancient dynasties in order to address water scarcity of the dryland areas with nearly 3000 such reservoirs kolar district had the highest number of tanks in the state gok 1975 the tanks had multiple uses such as domestic livestock agriculture and groundwater recharge they were located in villages across the district and were designed in topographical sequence such that generated runoff was harvested from upstream to downstream reservoirs in a cascading manner some of the tanks had a connecting infrastructure of canal networks that have been established by various development agencies lars engberg pedersen 2011 the submergence area water spread area for most of the tanks is 5 10 ha but a few have a submergence area as large as 100 ha or more reddy et al 2018 at its full capacity historically the major part of the irrigated area was next to these tanks the district is currently operates the highest number of wells around 30 000 borehole wells in 2012 for irrigation purpose cgwb 2012 the major portion of the aquifer is made up of fractured rocks of granites gneisses and schists that are characterized by a low storage 0 005 to 0 03 capacity poor storability cgwb 2012 the occurrence and movement of groundwater is controlled by the weathered zone fractures and fissures that exist in hard rocks in the district groundwater occurs in phreatic and semi confined to confined conditions cgwb 2012 gok 2018b the weathered thickness varies from 6 to 18 m in most of the area the depth of irrigation borehole wells ranges from 100 m to 300 m below the surface the yield of borehole wells in hard rock areas varies generally from 15 to 200 m3 day cgwb 2009 the kolar district has also witnessed declining groundwater levels since 1990 nagaraj et al 2003 reddy 2005 the cropping system has changed from low water requiring crops e g finger millet to high water requiring and water intensive crops vegetables mulberry etc 2 2 data and analysis fig 2 shows a flow diagram of the adopted methodology steps to quantify the water balance components at district level are described in the following sections i section 2 2 1 describes the collection of primary and secondary data of soil physical properties observation wells storage capacity and submerged area of a few selected tanks ii groundwater trend analysis and estimation of groundwater recharge using difference in water table levels as described in section 2 2 2 iii land use change analysis using remote sensing section 2 2 3 all these data were used as input into one dimensional water balance model to parameterize the hydrological processes validate the results and compute water balance components at district scale for two different periods section 2 2 4 2 2 1 data collection data of 35 monitored wells distributed across the kolar district was collected from the department of mines and geology government of karnataka fig 1 the data included monthly observation of groundwater levels between 1973 and 2013 40 years a one degree resolution gridded dataset of daily rainfall and maximum and minimum temperature was obtained from the india meteorological department imd pune for the period 1971 2007 reference crop evapotranspiration eto was computed on a daily basis using the hargreaves samani method hargreaves and samani 1985 land use land cover lulc cropping pattern and source of irrigation details tank borehole and dug well irrigated area were collected for the period of 1970 2007 from the directorate of economics and statistics icrisat has collected surface runoff at a micro watershed of 300 ha in huthur village in the kolar district over a three year period during 2006 08 under world bank supported sujala watershed program sreedevi et al 2008 world bank 2009 an automatic runoff recorder measured surface runoff at every 30 min intervals in addition soil samples were collected from 3 micro watersheds profile samples up to 120 cm depth at 2 locations in each watershed under sujala program and analysed for soil physical properties soil texture water retention location of these three watersheds are shown in fig 1 moreover a detailed survey of four selected tank locations for storage capacity and submergence area was undertaken to analyze the depth of water harvesting 2 2 2 groundwater historic trends in kolar studying the historic groundwater trend is important to understand the changes in recharge pattern extraction and the current availability as well as to predict the future groundwater availability nune et al 2014 trend a statistical tool developed by the cooperative research centre for catchment hydrology crcch was used to facilitate both parametric and non parametric tests for detecting the trend change and randomness in hydrological and other time series data kundzewicz and robson 2000 grayson et al 1996 trends in groundwater levels hydraulic head and annual rainfall were analyzed using mann kendall spearman s rho test and linear regression the water table fluctuation wtf method is a well accepted technique for estimating groundwater recharge in hard rock regions sharda et al 2006 dewandel et al 2010 glendenning and vervoort 2010 pavelic et al 2012 garg and wani 2013 tilahun et al 2020 however there are difficulties in defining and evaluating the specific yield which may vary with depth healy and cook 2002 the water balance equation can be presented as follows 1 r δ h s 100 w where r is the net groundwater recharge mm δh is the change in hydraulic head before and after the monsoon period m s is the specific yield w is the water withdrawal during the monsoon period mm the hydraulic head in open wells over time was obtained from water level data based on previous studies the value of storability specific yield for a shallow and weathered zone is considered as 0 03 σ 0 01 and 0 005 σ 0 004 for deep aquifers for peninsular india dewandel et al 2010 garg and wani 2013 maréchal et al 2006 massuel et al 2006 subrahmanyam and khan 2008 pavelic et al 2012 the amount of water pumped and used for agriculture is calculated for each year under different cropping systems using a simulation model the one dimensional water balance model wic described below was used the auto irrigation module is built in in the model to provide supplemental irrigation whenever the soil moisture levels drop below the defined threshold in respective seasons cropping systems this model was validated in field scale studies in different cropping systems and soil types in semi arid regions garg et al 2016 2 2 3 land use change using remote sensing technique time series satellite data for the years 1972 1992 and 2011 were used to analyse the land use change in the study area landsat images were downloaded from earth explorer for respective years geological survey eros data center 1900 the digital numbers were converted to reflectance values to normalize the multi date effect thenkabail et al 2004 the images were converted into top of atmosphere toa reflectance using a reflectance model built in erdas imagine thenkabail et al 2004 velpuri et al 2009 gumma et al 2011b the normalization was based on the meta data available in the header files we used unsupervised classification due to many unknown classes and limited data unsupervised isoclass cluster k means classification was used to capture the range of variability in phenology in the image as discussed by thenkabail et al 2004 and gumma et al 2011a various datasets such as bi spectral plots ground data google high resolution imagery and landsat time series ndvi signatures were used for class identification and labeling bi spectral plots were prepared based on spectral properties of red and nir bands extracted from unsupervised classification the diagonal line in bi spectral plots represents the soil line differentiating the vegetation classes water bodies and shrub lands trees have large variation in vegetation and were easily identified and labeled further to verify major classes ground truthing data were collected and accuracy analysis producer accuracy was carried out which showed less than 10 of uncertainty in classification 2 2 4 district scale water balance components 2 2 4 1 description of water impact calculator this study uses a one dimensional water balance model water impact calculator wic developed by icrisat to analyze the water balance components garg et al 2016 the wic is a generic decision making tool which could be applied to any land use and cropping system by providing minimum sets of biophysical details and management inputs garg et al 2014 2016 wic requires soil water retention properties and soil layer thickness weather reference evapotranspiration eto and rainfall crop growth biomass crop coefficient kc and root growth function topography land slope landform conditions and crop management crop sowing and harvesting dates irrigation method details as an input the model calculates the daily water balance as 2 r i r o δ d e t δ s where r is rainfall mm i is irrigation mm ro is surface runoff generated by the rainfall mm δd is the change in groundwater storage due to recharge and deep percolation mm et is evapotranspiration mm and δ s is the change in soil moisture storage mm in wic runoff is estimated based on curve number technique the soil conservation service curve number scs cn is a simple but popular method for predicting surface runoff and is widely used in many hydrological applications such as flood estimation and water balance models abon et al 2011 steenhuis et al 1995 van dijk 2010 it is sensitive to changes in values of curve number parameter cn and the antecedent moisture conditions hawkins 1993 mccuen 2002 michel et al 2005 ponce and hawkins 1996 soulis and valiantzas 2012 in wic the amount of water in excess of infiltration after satisfying the soil moisture deficit is considered deep percolation garg et al 2016 evaporation and transpiration values are estimated based on the surface boundary conditions and moisture accessibility between surface soil layer and the root zone water available in the top 10 cm layer is considered the main layer that is satisfying the bare soil evaporative demand whereas moisture available within the root zone is used to meet crop water uptake transpiration demand the crop water requirement cwr for a given day is calculated as 3 c w r k c e t o where kc is the crop coefficient and eto mm day is the reference crop evapotranspiration the root zone depth is a dynamic variable and is controlled by crop growth stage days after sowing as defined by allen et al 1998 usually evaporation from soil surface is inversely proportional to vegetative growth stage thus after achieving full vegetative crop growth kc 1 0 evaporation from the bare soil surface becomes insignificant if moisture in the root zone was not sufficient to meet cwr then wic declares that the crop is under water stress condition a detailed description of wic model development testing and validation procedure is given by garg et al 2016 2 2 4 2 model parameterization the data collected from huthur micro watershed on surface runoff was used to calibrate the curve number and same cn values were used for district scale analysis subsequently wic was used to estimate the district level water balance the entire district is divided into four major land use classes 1 forest and eucalyptus 2 shrub land or grassland 3 rainfed and 4 irrigated agriculture and further divided into seven hydrological response units hrus as per land use classification and cropping system table 1 hrus are the areas with similar biophysical topography soils and land use characteristics and therefore their hydrological response is expected to be similar as defined by arnold and fohrer 2005 the hru concept is widely used in water balance studies catchment regional scale modeling and in soil and water assessment studies arnold and fohrer 2005 flugel 1995 li et al 2009 garg et al 2012a 2012b abbaspour et al 2015 in the current study wic was run for each hru by providing historic weather data and crop management details using 37 years of rainfall data table 2a table 2b showed the model parameters used in wic for different hrus root depth of eucalyptus measured from 10 years old plantation at icrisat heritage experiments was used as an input into the model similarly effective root zone depth for other crops such as millets were also retrieved from literature icrisat 1990 keeping the land use unchanged for 1972 and 2011 respectively the water balance components were derived for these two periods table 1 hru results were analysed to assess i total freshwater availability harvested surface water in tanks and groundwater ii total irrigation demand for the respective land use scenario 2 2 4 3 uncertainties of the model results landscape hydrology is highly complex as is driven by various biophysical topography and soil types and land management factors in the current study the model simulation was based on major selected hrus that have soil hydraulic and moisture retention data table 2a auto irrigation was considered for tomato mulberry and maize crops however farmers commonly follow a range of irrigation practices which usually lead to under or over irrigation compared to the actual requirement moreover the model calibration was restricted to the micro scale catchment and it was validated using the groundwater system due to unavailability of runoff data at catchment scale for this study 3 results 3 1 groundwater trend in kolar fig 3 shows the yearly variation in hydraulic head mean with standard deviation in borehole wells and dug wells between 1972 and 2013 a total of 28 borehole wells and 7 dug wells were monitored hydraulic head in borehole wells during 1970 and 1980 ranged from 15 m to 60 m depending on borehole well depth and its location in the topo sequence the hydraulic head in all the borehole wells has declined as the hydraulic head in 2013 was below 20 m in all the observation wells similarly the hydraulic head in dug wells has also declined to below 2 m by 2013 trend analysis indicated that there is no change in total rainfall during the study period table 3 1973 2013 however groundwater levels during pre monsoon may and post monsoon november seasons showed a decreasing trend table 3 the month of may had the least groundwater head in respective wells whereas november which falls immediately after the monsoon period generally had the highest groundwater head therefore the trend analysis was shown for these two months trends a 0 01 z statistic 2 5 see footnote below table 3 for definition showed that hydraulic head in open wells dropped down drastically after 1995 and most of the open wells in the kolar district became out of use in the past 10 15 years similarly the water table in borehole wells also dropped down drastically a 0 01 z statistic 2 5 from 1980 onwards fig 3 the average rainfall received during the monsoon period over the past four decades was similar i e 533 556 566 570 mm respectively though there is no significant difference in monsoon rainfall amount a slight increasing trend was observed in total annual rainfall amount received during the study period 1973 2013 fig 4 shows a decadal rate of change in water level in different observation wells the figure also indicates location of observation wells along with stream network within the district the rate of change in water levels during the first 1974 83 and second 1984 1993 decades does not show any trend whereas out of total 35 observation wells 11 31 of total showed a drop of more than one meter per year during the third 1994 2003 decade further 17 wells out of 35 47 have shown a drop of more than one meter during the fourth 2004 2013 decade in addition the number of wells with more than two meter drop has doubled during fourth decade compared to third decade one also should note that few of the wells between 1994 2003 and 2004 2013 do not indicate any declining pattern which might be due to their location near the tanks 3 2 change in land use the population of kolar district increased from 0 83 million in 1972 to 1 54 million in 2011 indicating 86 growth in four decades table 4 there was a significant change in land use in the district between 1972 and 2011 remote sensing analysis showed that area under plantation crops i e eucalyptus increased from 64 km2 to 775 km2 converted 17 7 of total district area and the irrigated cropland increased from 366 km2 to 1089 km2 converted 18 of total district area during the same period on the other hand shrub grasslands were reduced from 1022 km2 to 160 km2 i e reduced by 21 5 of total district area further the analysis revealed that 30 of water bodies have disappeared their area reduced from 195 km2 to 132 km2 fig 5 and table 4 the data on the source of irrigation indicated that major irrigation sources during 1970 and 1980 were the open wells and minor irrigation tanks gok government of karnataka 2011 fig 6 shows that minor irrigation tanks and open wells were the predominant source of irrigation water until 1985 with diminishing outflows from irrigation tanks and depleted groundwater in open wells farmers started extracting groundwater from deeper aquifers to irrigate their lands the irrigation in the district predominantly depends on borehole wells since 2000 nagaraj et al 2009 2011 3 3 model calibration and validation rainfall received in huthur micro watershed during 2006 2007 and 2008 was 547 mm 370 mm and 882 mm respectively measured surface runoff from the micro watershed of 300 ha was 22 mm 18 mm and 52 mm respectively table 5 the land use in this watershed was agriculture 60 and eucalyptus 40 the total available water fc pwp depth for this soil is 125 mm m 1 wic simulated surface runoff was 38 mm 15 mm and 43 mm for 2006 2007 and 2008 respectively the curve number was modified to fit modeled value with observed value fig 7 highlight that on a daily time scale wic simulated runoff is comparable with measured values table 5 however there was no basin scale observed runoff data for district scale comparison the model was validated using the simulated groundwater recharge and compared with observed water table level data the observed head differences between june and october were converted into depth unit mm by multiplying them with specific yield as shown in eq 4 the groundwater withdrawal for agriculture during this period was considered negligible as irrigation in the rainy season except during dry spells dry years due to hard rock geology water moves between fissures and fractures in addition to soil strata the district also has evidence of quick recharge during the wet season sekhar et al 2013 2018 therefore we consider that the amount of recharge within the region contributes eventually to the deeper aquifers during the monsoon season simulated groundwater recharge was compared with the difference in measured groundwater head between pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons both for dug wells fig 8 a and borehole wells fig 8b these variables represent the groundwater status but in different units and therefore each variable is shown on the primary and secondary y axis comparison shows that both variables follow a similar trend indicating that the model is capturing the groundwater recharge trend reasonably well pearson correlations r 0 80 3 4 water balance components of grass crop land gcl and eucalyptus 3 4 1 rainfall versus water balance components fig 9 compares the simulated hydrological relationships rainfall versus water balance components in different years for gcl and eucalyptus fields surface runoff increased with increasing rainfall the generated runoff from gcl was 20 higher than from eucalyptus the largest hydrological impact simulated of land use change from gcl to eucalyptus was noticed on groundwater recharge represented as deep percolation there was no predicted deep percolation for rainfall up to 500 mm in eucalyptus fields deep percolation in eucalyptus fields for about 800 mm rainfall was just 50 mm compared to 200 250 mm in gcl evapotranspiration et increased linearly with increasing rainfall in eucalyptus fields in different years the et in gcl increased up to 600 mm but for high rainfall years et remained nearly the same 3 4 2 monthly variation the predicted monthly water balance of gcl and eucalyptus fields is presented for a selected normal year between 20 and 20 of long term average rainfall fig 10 about 72 of the rainfall 565 mm occurred during monsoon season june to october et was generally high during the monsoon season groundwater recharge occurred predominantly in september and october and runoff occurred largely in august and september in the simulation the rainfall received in june and july was utilized completely by the crop as water uptake and then transpiration once the soil water storage reached its maximum capacity the rainfall generates blue water runoff and deep percolation which occurred after august rainfall during the non monsoon period november to may was nearly 28 212 mm of total rainfall the non monsoonal rainfall is largely partitioned between the soil moisture store and the deep percolation fig 10a on the other hand more than 90 of the received rainfall during the monsoonal and post monsoonal period in eucalyptus field appears to be used up by the tree crops et and some of the rainfall high intensity rainfall was converted into surface runoff especially during august and september comparison of water balance components of gcl with eucalyptus clearly showed that the fraction of water which was simulated as deep percolation in gcl was utilized by eucalyptus fig 10b due to the deep rooting system 2 m effective root zone as validated through field monitoring at icrisat micro watershed and high water demand the root zone of eucalyptus frequently reached low soil moisture content despite the good amount of the received rain under such conditions percolation was low 3 4 3 variation in water balance among dry normal and wet years the water partitioning differs for dry rainfall less than 20 of the long term average normal rainfall between 20 and 20 of the long term average and wet years rainfall greater than 20 of long term average fig 11 in wet years in gcl nearly 55 410 mm of the total rainfall is lost by et the remaining amount was partitioned into deep percolation 26 and surface runoff 18 on the other hand 77 of the total rainfall in normal years was lost by eucalyptus et and the remaining amount was partitioned into surface runoff 16 and deep percolation 6 in dry years predicted et of eucalyptus amounted to nearly 92 of total monsoonal rainfall and left very little for surface runoff 9 and there was no deep percolation below the root zone it is worth noting that even in normal years estimated deep percolation is almost nil under the eucalyptus whereas about 80 mm 14 was estimated to be available for deep percolation under gcl 3 4 4 irrigation demand of different crops during dry normal and wet years table 6 summarizes simulated irrigation demand for different irrigated crops irrigation demand of maize vegetables and mulberry was 65 190 mm 230 550 mm and 730 1050 mm respectively two to three irrigation was suggested by the model for maize crops which was cultivated during kharif season if the available soil moisture was lower than the crop water requirement thus irrigation demand was found dependent on rainfall variability its distribution and amount from year to year irrigation demand for vegetables and mulberry was significantly higher as crop duration of these crops extends up to the dry periods and frequent irrigation was essential for crop survival and production 3 5 impact of land use change on water availability at district scale 3 5 1 change in fresh water availability between 1972 and 2011 water balance components of kolar district for 1972 2011 period are summarized in tables 7a 7d these results are based on 37 years of model simulation out of 37 years 7 years were dry 22 years were normal and 8 years were wet due to differences in land use there is a significant change in the hydrological processes at district level et for 1972 scenario was 370 mm which increased to 435 mm during the 2011 whereas runoff reduced from 108 mm to 72 mm and groundwater recharge reduced from 87 mm to 58 mm the surface runoff during dry years was reduced by 34 from 77 mm to 51 mm further the groundwater recharge reduced by 30 even in wet years from 192 mm to 134 mm table 7c further describes the change in storage capacity of the available tanks during 1972 and 2011 considering an average height of 1 5 m storage capacity based on ground truth data the tank volume in 1972 at full capacity was estimated to be 293 mcm which was reduced to 198 mcm during 2011 this amount is equivalent to 71 mm and 48 mm water depth harvesting capacity at the district scale respectively 3 5 2 demand supply gap the estimated groundwater withdrawal of the entire district for 1972 and 2011 is presented in tables 7a and 7b this estimation is based on weighted average of different hrus which includes soil and groundwater variation within the hrus the results are based on model simulation in 1972 the total pumping kharif rabi and summer for agricultural use was 57 mm and groundwater recharge was 87 mm total irrigation requirements even in dry years were met with available groundwater resources and water from the tank storage system generated runoff from fields was harvested in nearby tanks harvested water in tanks was source of freshwater in addition to groundwater average annual groundwater recharge in dry years under the natural condition was estimated to be 8 mm however harvested runoff in tanks was 71 mm which largely met the irrigation requirements of 1972 s cropping system it is to be noted that varietal change of simulated crops over the period was not considered in this analysis surplus availability of freshwater during normal average and wet years were keeping tanks and shallow dug wells in functioning condition during 1972 on the other hand during 2011 the simulated groundwater extraction 140 mm was higher than the total blue water availability 106 mm which resulted into an annual net water deficit of 34 mm water balance analysis showed that there was a negative water balance deficit status both for dry and normal years however the water balance during wet years was found to be positive total blue water availability in wet years was estimated to be 182 mm compared to 105 mm of water use leaving a 77 mm surplus as there was no difference in rainfall pattern from 1973 to 2013 described in section 3 1 groundwater depletion could be from two major factors i change in land use gcl to eucalyptus leading to reduced recharge and ii higher pumping rate due to increased irrigated area the contributing factors to the groundwater depletion at district level are summarized in table 7d the negative demand supply gap i e 101 mm of 1972 indicated that there was sustainable ecosystem with surplus blue water resource availability whereas this difference was estimated to be positive i e 34 mm during 2011 table 7b shows the simulated annual average reduction of surface runoff and groundwater the blue water availability was estimated to be reduced by 52 mm in 2011 compared to 1972 whereas et losses mainly from irrigation application increased from 57 mm to 140 mm net increase by 145 from 1972 to 2011 out of this 38 estimated to be a reduction in blue water availability which is due to change in land use from gcl to eucalyptus and 62 is estimated to be due to increased irrigation requirements 4 discussion district scale freshwater demand and supply analysis revealed that on the one hand district has reduced water availability due to increased area under eucalyptus and on the other hand gross irrigated area has increased multiple folds widening the demand supply gap increased irrigation water demand with change in land use and crop intensification was largely driven by population pressure the freshwater demand increased by 150 but blue water availability reduced by 30 in 2011 compared to 1972 there was expansion of commercial crops such as mulberry about 40 of irrigated land table 1 which is a perennial shrub requires frequent irrigation it is also to be noted that out of total blue water consumption 30 50 is required only in summer mar may to support mulberry growth millets are resilient to the extreme climatic and soil conditions prevalent under the rainfed dryland system other cereals such as maize requires two to three supplemental irrigations of total 50 200 mm depending on rainfall amount and its distribution cultivating long duration crops require significant amount of irrigation support as the potential evaporative demand of the region is relatively high 1800 mm annually crop intensification however is inevitable with increasing population pressure but following the water balance approach could help to decide permissible threshold on freshwater use the study showed that change in land use and irrigation management both are important factors impacting sustainable water management similar observations were made by srinivasan et al 2015 for arkavathy catchment 1440 km2 near to the study area the study revealed that groundwater pumping and expansion of eucalyptus plantation was the main driving factor for declined surface flow to the downstream water bodies further they found that the variation in the temperature and rainfall did not influence catchment hydrology srinivasan et al 2015 mass scale land use conversion from gcl to eucalyptus in kolar is suggested to have led to a depletion of groundwater and reduced surface runoff the model results indicated that a large quantity of monsoonal and post monsoonal rainfall on eucalyptus fields was largely converted into increased soil moisture and subsequently utilized by the trees and only a limited quantity was left for deep percolation recharge and surface runoff gcl used the green water rainwater effectively within the 0 6 m soil depth icrisat 1974 1990 during its growth season from july to october soil moisture of gcl reached field capacity level rapidly and the excess rainfall was partitioned into surface runoff and deep percolation after saturating the root zone the excess rainfall was partitioned into runoff and gw recharge whereas soil moisture was consistently being utilized by vegetation crop or plantation plantations such as eucalyptus trees can develop roots more than 2 m deep as these are perennial ever green tree species the modeled water demand is relatively high based on the crop coefficient kc ratio of crop et to reference et ranging from 0 85 to 1 1 al jamal et al 2002 alves et al 2013 however the increased eucalyptus area in kolar explain only part of the changes in surface runoff and deep percolation which would have affected groundwater recharge and tank inflow water harvested in tanks helps to enhance local recharge especially during monsoon palanisami et al 2012 and improved groundwater availability supports baseflow during the post monsoon season kumar et al 2016 when the groundwater table had depleted much below the tank elevation the groundwater driven baseflow declined kumar et al 2016 srinivasan et al 2015 fig 4 highlights farmers had become dependent on borehole well irrigation after 1985 the source of irrigation in kolar during 1970 85 was largely from dug wells and tanks which depleted significantly after 1985 and are out of use since 2000 rao et al 2006 this has various socio economic implication and sustainability issues of the number of ecosystem services for example increasing groundwater depletion resulted in high rate of well failure and capital investment by farmers anantha 2013 cost of cultivation including energy requirement was also increased sidhu et al 2020 with the increasing depletion of groundwater resource equity and management aspects are of greater importance to build the resource resilience chandrakanth and nagraj 1997 chaitra and chandrakanth 2005 in this situation small and marginal farmers who cannot afford to invest on deepening borehole wells are bearing the brunt of declining water table anantha 2013 there are only less than 30 of farmers who are able to invest on groundwater extraction from deep aquifers chaitra and chandrakanth 2005 this has led to inequality in resource accessibility anantha 2013 to sustain the groundwater resources water policies should aim at integrating all water sources in the regional context rather than treating them in isolation demand management is equally important especially in the context of resource scarcity situation as the supplies are limited it helps in efficient and sustainable use of the resources when compared to supply side regulations 5 conclusions this paper analyzes water balance components and change in hydrological processes due to land use change between 1972 and 2011 in kolar district of karnataka this district has a gap between its water supply and demand change in land use from grass cropped land gcl to eucalyptus and high extraction of groundwater resources in kolar was found to be the main reason for the depleting groundwater resource nearly 75 of the total rainfall received during the monsoon period i e 560 mm was partitioned into evapotranspiration et surface runoff and groundwater recharge conversion of gcl to plantations mainly eucalyptus reduces groundwater recharge by 33 from 87 mm to 58 mm while the expansion of the irrigated area increased net groundwater withdrawal abstraction by 145 from 57 mm to 140 mm this has altered hydrological processes of the district and might explain why dug wells and tank systems have gone out of use from 2000 onwards the main factors contributing to widening the demand supply gap in kolar were land use change 38 and over pumping 62 these results will eventually help the various stakeholders including district and national authorities to revisit the land allocation for different land uses and to decide on the optimum allocation of land uses to close the gap between water supply and demand author statement below are contribution by different authors in this study kaushal k garg conceptualization data analysis and manuscript writing

8335,study region this study analyzes the impact of land use changes on the hydrology of kolar district in the state of karnataka india kolar receives on average 565 mm σ 130 rainfall during june to october and has a wide gap between its water supply and demand study focus this research identifies the reasons and causes of the gap a water balance model was successfully calibrated and validated against measurements of groundwater level recharge and surface runoff new hydrological insights for the region the study revealed that between 1972 and 2011 there was a major shift from grass and rainfed crop lands to eucalyptus plantation and irrigated cultivation about 17 7 and 18 of the district area converted into eucalyptus plantation and irrigated lands during this period respectively eucalyptus plantations tended to cause large losses by et leading to increase in soil moisture deficit and reduction in the recharge to groundwater and in surface runoff approx 30 the irrigation demand of the district increased from 57 mm 1972 to 140 mm 2011 which resulted in increased groundwater abstraction by 145 the expansion of the irrigated area is the major contributing factor for widening the demand supply gap 62 of the freshwater availability results could help various stakeholders including district and national authorities to develop the most suitable water management strategies in order to close the gap between water supply and demand keywords water balance groundwater recharge water table depletion groundwater resilience land use change eucalyptus 1 introduction

avellán et al 2017 atef et al 2019 veise et al 2020 globally agriculture consumes about 80 of fresh water resources and more than 570 million farm families are dependent on the agriculture sector lowder et al 2016 and are vulnerable to increasing water scarcity recanati et al 2017 climate change has worsened the situation further with uncertainty in freshwater availability and its sustainability wada et al 2011 feng et al 2013 elmeddahi et al 2016 mousivand and arsanjani 2018 rodell et al 2018 huang et al 2019 this also has become critical to meet food security and poverty eradication according to the united nations agenda 2030 schleicher et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 globally about 480 million ha of land was brought under crop and grazing land use since 1960 to feed an increasing population with changing food habits gibbs et al 2010 lambin and meyfroidt 2010 the change in land use has affected hydrological cycle at regional scale and has crossed the critical level of safe operation rockström et al 2009 dearing et al 2014 cole et al 2014 hossain et al 2017 steffen et al 2015 with increasing crop land pressure on water resource especially groundwater has increased globally about 982 billion cubic meter bcm groundwater is abstracted annually and out of which 70 is used for agriculture siebert et al 2010 gleeson et al 2016 the crop land under irrigation is about 301 million ha of which 38 is dependent on groundwater sources siebert et al 2010 gleeson et al 2016 india ranks number one in groundwater use for meeting its demand from domestic industrial and agricultural sectors groundwater extraction in india has accelerated from 25 bcm in the 1960 to 250 bcm by 2015 gleeson et al 2016 goi 2019 the increase in water utilization was linked to the need to ensure the food security of the country however it resulted in depletion of groundwater resources especially in dry regions reddy 2005 palanisami et al 2008 anantha 2013 in addition groundwater assessment in india showed that annual groundwater recharge has decreased from 447 bcm to 432 bcm due to multiple factors e g urbanization crop intensification etc goi 2019 about 17 of the india has been categorized as overexploited indicating groundwater extraction exceeds the annual replenishable groundwater recharge and 5 are critical where the state of groundwater extraction is equal to annual replenishable groundwater recharge goi 2019 this situation raises serious concerns about the future of the groundwater resources pertaining to water availability food and livelihood security and sustainability of the dependent ecosystems rodríguez suárez et al 2011 southern indian states are rapidly growing in terms of economic development including agriculture akram and rath 2020 to sustain this growth this region is exploiting available resources which lead to overexploitation of certain resources such as groundwater in this context there is a need to understand the changing pattern of resource utilization and its impact on hydrological processes kolar district in the state of karnataka has undergone substantial change in terms of land use due to number of anthropogenic activities and one of the water stressed district in southern india srinivasan et al 2015 penny et al 2018 there are no comprehensive studies that attempted to understand the changes in hydrological processes given that this district has a gap between its water supply and demand srinivasan et al 2015 this research aims to identify reasons and causes of the gap with the following objectives i analyze changes in water balance components of the kolar district since 1970 and ii assess the causes of groundwater and surface water depletion 2 material and methods 2 1 study area karnataka is the eighth largest state in india accounting for 5 13 of country s total population gok 2011 karnataka has variable rainfall diverse soil types and cropping patterns wani et al 2017 based on this diversity the state has been divided into ten agro climatic zones gok 2018a among these agro climatic zones the southern dry zone is vulnerable in terms of climate change mujumdar 2013 rao et al 2013 changes in land use and declining available natural resources ramachandra et al 2004 kolar district is located 13 135745 n 78 132561 e in the southeast of karnataka state and has a total geographical area of 4012 km² and a population of 1 54 million goi 2011 agriculture and associated activities are the major livelihood source in the district nearly 30 of the geographical area in the district is covered by pasture trees and shrubland which was largely planted with eucalyptus in the last two to three decades and 66 of the area is under agriculture nagaraj et al 2003 reddy 2005 out of 2651 km2 agriculture land 59 of the area is rainfed in which millet and cereal are the dominant crops gok 2018b the remaining 41 of the area is irrigated fruits vegetables and mulberry which require year round irrigation gok 2018b kolar district fig 1 was known for its ancient surface water reservoirs commonly known as tanks the tanks were excavated by ancient dynasties in order to address water scarcity of the dryland areas with nearly 3000 such reservoirs kolar district had the highest number of tanks in the state gok 1975 the tanks had multiple uses such as domestic livestock agriculture and groundwater recharge they were located in villages across the district and were designed in topographical sequence such that generated runoff was harvested from upstream to downstream reservoirs in a cascading manner some of the tanks had a connecting infrastructure of canal networks that have been established by various development agencies lars engberg pedersen 2011 the submergence area water spread area for most of the tanks is 5 10 ha but a few have a submergence area as large as 100 ha or more reddy et al 2018 at its full capacity historically the major part of the irrigated area was next to these tanks the district is currently operates the highest number of wells around 30 000 borehole wells in 2012 for irrigation purpose cgwb 2012 the major portion of the aquifer is made up of fractured rocks of granites gneisses and schists that are characterized by a low storage 0 005 to 0 03 capacity poor storability cgwb 2012 the occurrence and movement of groundwater is controlled by the weathered zone fractures and fissures that exist in hard rocks in the district groundwater occurs in phreatic and semi confined to confined conditions cgwb 2012 gok 2018b the weathered thickness varies from 6 to 18 m in most of the area the depth of irrigation borehole wells ranges from 100 m to 300 m below the surface the yield of borehole wells in hard rock areas varies generally from 15 to 200 m3 day cgwb 2009 the kolar district has also witnessed declining groundwater levels since 1990 nagaraj et al 2003 reddy 2005 the cropping system has changed from low water requiring crops e g finger millet to high water requiring and water intensive crops vegetables mulberry etc 2 2 data and analysis fig 2 shows a flow diagram of the adopted methodology steps to quantify the water balance components at district level are described in the following sections i section 2 2 1 describes the collection of primary and secondary data of soil physical properties observation wells storage capacity and submerged area of a few selected tanks ii groundwater trend analysis and estimation of groundwater recharge using difference in water table levels as described in section 2 2 2 iii land use change analysis using remote sensing section 2 2 3 all these data were used as input into one dimensional water balance model to parameterize the hydrological processes validate the results and compute water balance components at district scale for two different periods section 2 2 4 2 2 1 data collection data of 35 monitored wells distributed across the kolar district was collected from the department of mines and geology government of karnataka fig 1 the data included monthly observation of groundwater levels between 1973 and 2013 40 years a one degree resolution gridded dataset of daily rainfall and maximum and minimum temperature was obtained from the india meteorological department imd pune for the period 1971 2007 reference crop evapotranspiration eto was computed on a daily basis using the hargreaves samani method hargreaves and samani 1985 land use land cover lulc cropping pattern and source of irrigation details tank borehole and dug well irrigated area were collected for the period of 1970 2007 from the directorate of economics and statistics icrisat has collected surface runoff at a micro watershed of 300 ha in huthur village in the kolar district over a three year period during 2006 08 under world bank supported sujala watershed program sreedevi et al 2008 world bank 2009 an automatic runoff recorder measured surface runoff at every 30 min intervals in addition soil samples were collected from 3 micro watersheds profile samples up to 120 cm depth at 2 locations in each watershed under sujala program and analysed for soil physical properties soil texture water retention location of these three watersheds are shown in fig 1 moreover a detailed survey of four selected tank locations for storage capacity and submergence area was undertaken to analyze the depth of water harvesting 2 2 2 groundwater historic trends in kolar studying the historic groundwater trend is important to understand the changes in recharge pattern extraction and the current availability as well as to predict the future groundwater availability nune et al 2014 trend a statistical tool developed by the cooperative research centre for catchment hydrology crcch was used to facilitate both parametric and non parametric tests for detecting the trend change and randomness in hydrological and other time series data kundzewicz and robson 2000 grayson et al 1996 trends in groundwater levels hydraulic head and annual rainfall were analyzed using mann kendall spearman s rho test and linear regression the water table fluctuation wtf method is a well accepted technique for estimating groundwater recharge in hard rock regions sharda et al 2006 dewandel et al 2010 glendenning and vervoort 2010 pavelic et al 2012 garg and wani 2013 tilahun et al 2020 however there are difficulties in defining and evaluating the specific yield which may vary with depth healy and cook 2002 the water balance equation can be presented as follows 1 r δ h s 100 w where r is the net groundwater recharge mm δh is the change in hydraulic head before and after the monsoon period m s is the specific yield w is the water withdrawal during the monsoon period mm the hydraulic head in open wells over time was obtained from water level data based on previous studies the value of storability specific yield for a shallow and weathered zone is considered as 0 03 σ 0 01 and 0 005 σ 0 004 for deep aquifers for peninsular india dewandel et al 2010 garg and wani 2013 maréchal et al 2006 massuel et al 2006 subrahmanyam and khan 2008 pavelic et al 2012 the amount of water pumped and used for agriculture is calculated for each year under different cropping systems using a simulation model the one dimensional water balance model wic described below was used the auto irrigation module is built in in the model to provide supplemental irrigation whenever the soil moisture levels drop below the defined threshold in respective seasons cropping systems this model was validated in field scale studies in different cropping systems and soil types in semi arid regions garg et al 2016 2 2 3 land use change using remote sensing technique time series satellite data for the years 1972 1992 and 2011 were used to analyse the land use change in the study area landsat images were downloaded from earth explorer for respective years geological survey eros data center 1900 the digital numbers were converted to reflectance values to normalize the multi date effect thenkabail et al 2004 the images were converted into top of atmosphere toa reflectance using a reflectance model built in erdas imagine thenkabail et al 2004 velpuri et al 2009 gumma et al 2011b the normalization was based on the meta data available in the header files we used unsupervised classification due to many unknown classes and limited data unsupervised isoclass cluster k means classification was used to capture the range of variability in phenology in the image as discussed by thenkabail et al 2004 and gumma et al 2011a various datasets such as bi spectral plots ground data google high resolution imagery and landsat time series ndvi signatures were used for class identification and labeling bi spectral plots were prepared based on spectral properties of red and nir bands extracted from unsupervised classification the diagonal line in bi spectral plots represents the soil line differentiating the vegetation classes water bodies and shrub lands trees have large variation in vegetation and were easily identified and labeled further to verify major classes ground truthing data were collected and accuracy analysis producer accuracy was carried out which showed less than 10 of uncertainty in classification 2 2 4 district scale water balance components 2 2 4 1 description of water impact calculator this study uses a one dimensional water balance model water impact calculator wic developed by icrisat to analyze the water balance components garg et al 2016 the wic is a generic decision making tool which could be applied to any land use and cropping system by providing minimum sets of biophysical details and management inputs garg et al 2014 2016 wic requires soil water retention properties and soil layer thickness weather reference evapotranspiration eto and rainfall crop growth biomass crop coefficient kc and root growth function topography land slope landform conditions and crop management crop sowing and harvesting dates irrigation method details as an input the model calculates the daily water balance as 2 r i r o δ d e t δ s where r is rainfall mm i is irrigation mm ro is surface runoff generated by the rainfall mm δd is the change in groundwater storage due to recharge and deep percolation mm et is evapotranspiration mm and δ s is the change in soil moisture storage mm in wic runoff is estimated based on curve number technique the soil conservation service curve number scs cn is a simple but popular method for predicting surface runoff and is widely used in many hydrological applications such as flood estimation and water balance models abon et al 2011 steenhuis et al 1995 van dijk 2010 it is sensitive to changes in values of curve number parameter cn and the antecedent moisture conditions hawkins 1993 mccuen 2002 michel et al 2005 ponce and hawkins 1996 soulis and valiantzas 2012 in wic the amount of water in excess of infiltration after satisfying the soil moisture deficit is considered deep percolation garg et al 2016 evaporation and transpiration values are estimated based on the surface boundary conditions and moisture accessibility between surface soil layer and the root zone water available in the top 10 cm layer is considered the main layer that is satisfying the bare soil evaporative demand whereas moisture available within the root zone is used to meet crop water uptake transpiration demand the crop water requirement cwr for a given day is calculated as 3 c w r k c e t o where kc is the crop coefficient and eto mm day is the reference crop evapotranspiration the root zone depth is a dynamic variable and is controlled by crop growth stage days after sowing as defined by allen et al 1998 usually evaporation from soil surface is inversely proportional to vegetative growth stage thus after achieving full vegetative crop growth kc 1 0 evaporation from the bare soil surface becomes insignificant if moisture in the root zone was not sufficient to meet cwr then wic declares that the crop is under water stress condition a detailed description of wic model development testing and validation procedure is given by garg et al 2016 2 2 4 2 model parameterization the data collected from huthur micro watershed on surface runoff was used to calibrate the curve number and same cn values were used for district scale analysis subsequently wic was used to estimate the district level water balance the entire district is divided into four major land use classes 1 forest and eucalyptus 2 shrub land or grassland 3 rainfed and 4 irrigated agriculture and further divided into seven hydrological response units hrus as per land use classification and cropping system table 1 hrus are the areas with similar biophysical topography soils and land use characteristics and therefore their hydrological response is expected to be similar as defined by arnold and fohrer 2005 the hru concept is widely used in water balance studies catchment regional scale modeling and in soil and water assessment studies arnold and fohrer 2005 flugel 1995 li et al 2009 garg et al 2012a 2012b abbaspour et al 2015 in the current study wic was run for each hru by providing historic weather data and crop management details using 37 years of rainfall data table 2a table 2b showed the model parameters used in wic for different hrus root depth of eucalyptus measured from 10 years old plantation at icrisat heritage experiments was used as an input into the model similarly effective root zone depth for other crops such as millets were also retrieved from literature icrisat 1990 keeping the land use unchanged for 1972 and 2011 respectively the water balance components were derived for these two periods table 1 hru results were analysed to assess i total freshwater availability harvested surface water in tanks and groundwater ii total irrigation demand for the respective land use scenario 2 2 4 3 uncertainties of the model results landscape hydrology is highly complex as is driven by various biophysical topography and soil types and land management factors in the current study the model simulation was based on major selected hrus that have soil hydraulic and moisture retention data table 2a auto irrigation was considered for tomato mulberry and maize crops however farmers commonly follow a range of irrigation practices which usually lead to under or over irrigation compared to the actual requirement moreover the model calibration was restricted to the micro scale catchment and it was validated using the groundwater system due to unavailability of runoff data at catchment scale for this study 3 results 3 1 groundwater trend in kolar fig 3 shows the yearly variation in hydraulic head mean with standard deviation in borehole wells and dug wells between 1972 and 2013 a total of 28 borehole wells and 7 dug wells were monitored hydraulic head in borehole wells during 1970 and 1980 ranged from 15 m to 60 m depending on borehole well depth and its location in the topo sequence the hydraulic head in all the borehole wells has declined as the hydraulic head in 2013 was below 20 m in all the observation wells similarly the hydraulic head in dug wells has also declined to below 2 m by 2013 trend analysis indicated that there is no change in total rainfall during the study period table 3 1973 2013 however groundwater levels during pre monsoon may and post monsoon november seasons showed a decreasing trend table 3 the month of may had the least groundwater head in respective wells whereas november which falls immediately after the monsoon period generally had the highest groundwater head therefore the trend analysis was shown for these two months trends a 0 01 z statistic 2 5 see footnote below table 3 for definition showed that hydraulic head in open wells dropped down drastically after 1995 and most of the open wells in the kolar district became out of use in the past 10 15 years similarly the water table in borehole wells also dropped down drastically a 0 01 z statistic 2 5 from 1980 onwards fig 3 the average rainfall received during the monsoon period over the past four decades was similar i e 533 556 566 570 mm respectively though there is no significant difference in monsoon rainfall amount a slight increasing trend was observed in total annual rainfall amount received during the study period 1973 2013 fig 4 shows a decadal rate of change in water level in different observation wells the figure also indicates location of observation wells along with stream network within the district the rate of change in water levels during the first 1974 83 and second 1984 1993 decades does not show any trend whereas out of total 35 observation wells 11 31 of total showed a drop of more than one meter per year during the third 1994 2003 decade further 17 wells out of 35 47 have shown a drop of more than one meter during the fourth 2004 2013 decade in addition the number of wells with more than two meter drop has doubled during fourth decade compared to third decade one also should note that few of the wells between 1994 2003 and 2004 2013 do not indicate any declining pattern which might be due to their location near the tanks 3 2 change in land use the population of kolar district increased from 0 83 million in 1972 to 1 54 million in 2011 indicating 86 growth in four decades table 4 there was a significant change in land use in the district between 1972 and 2011 remote sensing analysis showed that area under plantation crops i e eucalyptus increased from 64 km2 to 775 km2 converted 17 7 of total district area and the irrigated cropland increased from 366 km2 to 1089 km2 converted 18 of total district area during the same period on the other hand shrub grasslands were reduced from 1022 km2 to 160 km2 i e reduced by 21 5 of total district area further the analysis revealed that 30 of water bodies have disappeared their area reduced from 195 km2 to 132 km2 fig 5 and table 4 the data on the source of irrigation indicated that major irrigation sources during 1970 and 1980 were the open wells and minor irrigation tanks gok government of karnataka 2011 fig 6 shows that minor irrigation tanks and open wells were the predominant source of irrigation water until 1985 with diminishing outflows from irrigation tanks and depleted groundwater in open wells farmers started extracting groundwater from deeper aquifers to irrigate their lands the irrigation in the district predominantly depends on borehole wells since 2000 nagaraj et al 2009 2011 3 3 model calibration and validation rainfall received in huthur micro watershed during 2006 2007 and 2008 was 547 mm 370 mm and 882 mm respectively measured surface runoff from the micro watershed of 300 ha was 22 mm 18 mm and 52 mm respectively table 5 the land use in this watershed was agriculture 60 and eucalyptus 40 the total available water fc pwp depth for this soil is 125 mm m 1 wic simulated surface runoff was 38 mm 15 mm and 43 mm for 2006 2007 and 2008 respectively the curve number was modified to fit modeled value with observed value fig 7 highlight that on a daily time scale wic simulated runoff is comparable with measured values table 5 however there was no basin scale observed runoff data for district scale comparison the model was validated using the simulated groundwater recharge and compared with observed water table level data the observed head differences between june and october were converted into depth unit mm by multiplying them with specific yield as shown in eq 4 the groundwater withdrawal for agriculture during this period was considered negligible as irrigation in the rainy season except during dry spells dry years due to hard rock geology water moves between fissures and fractures in addition to soil strata the district also has evidence of quick recharge during the wet season sekhar et al 2013 2018 therefore we consider that the amount of recharge within the region contributes eventually to the deeper aquifers during the monsoon season simulated groundwater recharge was compared with the difference in measured groundwater head between pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons both for dug wells fig 8 a and borehole wells fig 8b these variables represent the groundwater status but in different units and therefore each variable is shown on the primary and secondary y axis comparison shows that both variables follow a similar trend indicating that the model is capturing the groundwater recharge trend reasonably well pearson correlations r 0 80 3 4 water balance components of grass crop land gcl and eucalyptus 3 4 1 rainfall versus water balance components fig 9 compares the simulated hydrological relationships rainfall versus water balance components in different years for gcl and eucalyptus fields surface runoff increased with increasing rainfall the generated runoff from gcl was 20 higher than from eucalyptus the largest hydrological impact simulated of land use change from gcl to eucalyptus was noticed on groundwater recharge represented as deep percolation there was no predicted deep percolation for rainfall up to 500 mm in eucalyptus fields deep percolation in eucalyptus fields for about 800 mm rainfall was just 50 mm compared to 200 250 mm in gcl evapotranspiration et increased linearly with increasing rainfall in eucalyptus fields in different years the et in gcl increased up to 600 mm but for high rainfall years et remained nearly the same 3 4 2 monthly variation the predicted monthly water balance of gcl and eucalyptus fields is presented for a selected normal year between 20 and 20 of long term average rainfall fig 10 about 72 of the rainfall 565 mm occurred during monsoon season june to october et was generally high during the monsoon season groundwater recharge occurred predominantly in september and october and runoff occurred largely in august and september in the simulation the rainfall received in june and july was utilized completely by the crop as water uptake and then transpiration once the soil water storage reached its maximum capacity the rainfall generates blue water runoff and deep percolation which occurred after august rainfall during the non monsoon period november to may was nearly 28 212 mm of total rainfall the non monsoonal rainfall is largely partitioned between the soil moisture store and the deep percolation fig 10a on the other hand more than 90 of the received rainfall during the monsoonal and post monsoonal period in eucalyptus field appears to be used up by the tree crops et and some of the rainfall high intensity rainfall was converted into surface runoff especially during august and september comparison of water balance components of gcl with eucalyptus clearly showed that the fraction of water which was simulated as deep percolation in gcl was utilized by eucalyptus fig 10b due to the deep rooting system 2 m effective root zone as validated through field monitoring at icrisat micro watershed and high water demand the root zone of eucalyptus frequently reached low soil moisture content despite the good amount of the received rain under such conditions percolation was low 3 4 3 variation in water balance among dry normal and wet years the water partitioning differs for dry rainfall less than 20 of the long term average normal rainfall between 20 and 20 of the long term average and wet years rainfall greater than 20 of long term average fig 11 in wet years in gcl nearly 55 410 mm of the total rainfall is lost by et the remaining amount was partitioned into deep percolation 26 and surface runoff 18 on the other hand 77 of the total rainfall in normal years was lost by eucalyptus et and the remaining amount was partitioned into surface runoff 16 and deep percolation 6 in dry years predicted et of eucalyptus amounted to nearly 92 of total monsoonal rainfall and left very little for surface runoff 9 and there was no deep percolation below the root zone it is worth noting that even in normal years estimated deep percolation is almost nil under the eucalyptus whereas about 80 mm 14 was estimated to be available for deep percolation under gcl 3 4 4 irrigation demand of different crops during dry normal and wet years table 6 summarizes simulated irrigation demand for different irrigated crops irrigation demand of maize vegetables and mulberry was 65 190 mm 230 550 mm and 730 1050 mm respectively two to three irrigation was suggested by the model for maize crops which was cultivated during kharif season if the available soil moisture was lower than the crop water requirement thus irrigation demand was found dependent on rainfall variability its distribution and amount from year to year irrigation demand for vegetables and mulberry was significantly higher as crop duration of these crops extends up to the dry periods and frequent irrigation was essential for crop survival and production 3 5 impact of land use change on water availability at district scale 3 5 1 change in fresh water availability between 1972 and 2011 water balance components of kolar district for 1972 2011 period are summarized in tables 7a 7d these results are based on 37 years of model simulation out of 37 years 7 years were dry 22 years were normal and 8 years were wet due to differences in land use there is a significant change in the hydrological processes at district level et for 1972 scenario was 370 mm which increased to 435 mm during the 2011 whereas runoff reduced from 108 mm to 72 mm and groundwater recharge reduced from 87 mm to 58 mm the surface runoff during dry years was reduced by 34 from 77 mm to 51 mm further the groundwater recharge reduced by 30 even in wet years from 192 mm to 134 mm table 7c further describes the change in storage capacity of the available tanks during 1972 and 2011 considering an average height of 1 5 m storage capacity based on ground truth data the tank volume in 1972 at full capacity was estimated to be 293 mcm which was reduced to 198 mcm during 2011 this amount is equivalent to 71 mm and 48 mm water depth harvesting capacity at the district scale respectively 3 5 2 demand supply gap the estimated groundwater withdrawal of the entire district for 1972 and 2011 is presented in tables 7a and 7b this estimation is based on weighted average of different hrus which includes soil and groundwater variation within the hrus the results are based on model simulation in 1972 the total pumping kharif rabi and summer for agricultural use was 57 mm and groundwater recharge was 87 mm total irrigation requirements even in dry years were met with available groundwater resources and water from the tank storage system generated runoff from fields was harvested in nearby tanks harvested water in tanks was source of freshwater in addition to groundwater average annual groundwater recharge in dry years under the natural condition was estimated to be 8 mm however harvested runoff in tanks was 71 mm which largely met the irrigation requirements of 1972 s cropping system it is to be noted that varietal change of simulated crops over the period was not considered in this analysis surplus availability of freshwater during normal average and wet years were keeping tanks and shallow dug wells in functioning condition during 1972 on the other hand during 2011 the simulated groundwater extraction 140 mm was higher than the total blue water availability 106 mm which resulted into an annual net water deficit of 34 mm water balance analysis showed that there was a negative water balance deficit status both for dry and normal years however the water balance during wet years was found to be positive total blue water availability in wet years was estimated to be 182 mm compared to 105 mm of water use leaving a 77 mm surplus as there was no difference in rainfall pattern from 1973 to 2013 described in section 3 1 groundwater depletion could be from two major factors i change in land use gcl to eucalyptus leading to reduced recharge and ii higher pumping rate due to increased irrigated area the contributing factors to the groundwater depletion at district level are summarized in table 7d the negative demand supply gap i e 101 mm of 1972 indicated that there was sustainable ecosystem with surplus blue water resource availability whereas this difference was estimated to be positive i e 34 mm during 2011 table 7b shows the simulated annual average reduction of surface runoff and groundwater the blue water availability was estimated to be reduced by 52 mm in 2011 compared to 1972 whereas et losses mainly from irrigation application increased from 57 mm to 140 mm net increase by 145 from 1972 to 2011 out of this 38 estimated to be a reduction in blue water availability which is due to change in land use from gcl to eucalyptus and 62 is estimated to be due to increased irrigation requirements 4 discussion district scale freshwater demand and supply analysis revealed that on the one hand district has reduced water availability due to increased area under eucalyptus and on the other hand gross irrigated area has increased multiple folds widening the demand supply gap increased irrigation water demand with change in land use and crop intensification was largely driven by population pressure the freshwater demand increased by 150 but blue water availability reduced by 30 in 2011 compared to 1972 there was expansion of commercial crops such as mulberry about 40 of irrigated land table 1 which is a perennial shrub requires frequent irrigation it is also to be noted that out of total blue water consumption 30 50 is required only in summer mar may to support mulberry growth millets are resilient to the extreme climatic and soil conditions prevalent under the rainfed dryland system other cereals such as maize requires two to three supplemental irrigations of total 50 200 mm depending on rainfall amount and its distribution cultivating long duration crops require significant amount of irrigation support as the potential evaporative demand of the region is relatively high 1800 mm annually crop intensification however is inevitable with increasing population pressure but following the water balance approach could help to decide permissible threshold on freshwater use the study showed that change in land use and irrigation management both are important factors impacting sustainable water management similar observations were made by srinivasan et al 2015 for arkavathy catchment 1440 km2 near to the study area the study revealed that groundwater pumping and expansion of eucalyptus plantation was the main driving factor for declined surface flow to the downstream water bodies further they found that the variation in the temperature and rainfall did not influence catchment hydrology srinivasan et al 2015 mass scale land use conversion from gcl to eucalyptus in kolar is suggested to have led to a depletion of groundwater and reduced surface runoff the model results indicated that a large quantity of monsoonal and post monsoonal rainfall on eucalyptus fields was largely converted into increased soil moisture and subsequently utilized by the trees and only a limited quantity was left for deep percolation recharge and surface runoff gcl used the green water rainwater effectively within the 0 6 m soil depth icrisat 1974 1990 during its growth season from july to october soil moisture of gcl reached field capacity level rapidly and the excess rainfall was partitioned into surface runoff and deep percolation after saturating the root zone the excess rainfall was partitioned into runoff and gw recharge whereas soil moisture was consistently being utilized by vegetation crop or plantation plantations such as eucalyptus trees can develop roots more than 2 m deep as these are perennial ever green tree species the modeled water demand is relatively high based on the crop coefficient kc ratio of crop et to reference et ranging from 0 85 to 1 1 al jamal et al 2002 alves et al 2013 however the increased eucalyptus area in kolar explain only part of the changes in surface runoff and deep percolation which would have affected groundwater recharge and tank inflow water harvested in tanks helps to enhance local recharge especially during monsoon palanisami et al 2012 and improved groundwater availability supports baseflow during the post monsoon season kumar et al 2016 when the groundwater table had depleted much below the tank elevation the groundwater driven baseflow declined kumar et al 2016 srinivasan et al 2015 fig 4 highlights farmers had become dependent on borehole well irrigation after 1985 the source of irrigation in kolar during 1970 85 was largely from dug wells and tanks which depleted significantly after 1985 and are out of use since 2000 rao et al 2006 this has various socio economic implication and sustainability issues of the number of ecosystem services for example increasing groundwater depletion resulted in high rate of well failure and capital investment by farmers anantha 2013 cost of cultivation including energy requirement was also increased sidhu et al 2020 with the increasing depletion of groundwater resource equity and management aspects are of greater importance to build the resource resilience chandrakanth and nagraj 1997 chaitra and chandrakanth 2005 in this situation small and marginal farmers who cannot afford to invest on deepening borehole wells are bearing the brunt of declining water table anantha 2013 there are only less than 30 of farmers who are able to invest on groundwater extraction from deep aquifers chaitra and chandrakanth 2005 this has led to inequality in resource accessibility anantha 2013 to sustain the groundwater resources water policies should aim at integrating all water sources in the regional context rather than treating them in isolation demand management is equally important especially in the context of resource scarcity situation as the supplies are limited it helps in efficient and sustainable use of the resources when compared to supply side regulations 5 conclusions this paper analyzes water balance components and change in hydrological processes due to land use change between 1972 and 2011 in kolar district of karnataka this district has a gap between its water supply and demand change in land use from grass cropped land gcl to eucalyptus and high extraction of groundwater resources in kolar was found to be the main reason for the depleting groundwater resource nearly 75 of the total rainfall received during the monsoon period i e 560 mm was partitioned into evapotranspiration et surface runoff and groundwater recharge conversion of gcl to plantations mainly eucalyptus reduces groundwater recharge by 33 from 87 mm to 58 mm while the expansion of the irrigated area increased net groundwater withdrawal abstraction by 145 from 57 mm to 140 mm this has altered hydrological processes of the district and might explain why dug wells and tank systems have gone out of use from 2000 onwards the main factors contributing to widening the demand supply gap in kolar were land use change 38 and over pumping 62 these results will eventually help the various stakeholders including district and national authorities to revisit the land allocation for different land uses and to decide on the optimum allocation of land uses to close the gap between water supply and demand author statement below are contribution by different authors in this study kaushal k garg conceptualization data analysis and manuscript writing

8336,study region this paper provides a summary of findings from temporal and spatial studies of soil water content on planar hillslopes across the equatorial island of san cristóbal galápagos ecuador study focus soil water content swc was measured to generate temporal and spatial records to determine seasonal variation and to investigate how the behavior of surface and near surface root zone soil water may support island wide hydrogeology models swc probes were installed at four weather stations in a climosequence to generate a temporal record and spatial surveys of shallow swc across the selected sites were completed during wet and dry seasons temporal differences in swc were driven by seasonal variations in rainfall and evapotranspiration while spatial variability remained high during both wet and dry seasons unsaturated hydraulic conductivity determined by mini disk infiltrometers was highly variable across the slopes as were other hydrologic variables new hydrological insights for the region the high heterogeneity of soil water and hydrologic characteristics provides a means to explain why little runoff is observed at the study sites soils do not saturate uniformly across hillslopes allowing for runoff generated in one part of the hillslope to be conducted into the soil in adjacent parts of the hillslope the lack of connected surface runoff helps explain how water enters the groundwater system of the island keywords temporal soil water record spatial soil water distributions hillslope soil water connectivity runoff generation galápagos climosequence 1 introduction knowledge of near surface soil water content and the amount of water in pore spaces in the top of a soil 0 15 centimeters contributes to the understanding of climate energy balance and plant health soil water content distributions across hillslopes can affect energy fluxes by 1 controlling the partitioning of rainfall into evapotranspiration runoff and recharge mirus and loague 2013 rasmussen et al 2011 2 facilitating soil development and changes in chemistry by serving as a means of solute transport and changing the oxidation state of soils bailey et al 2014 and 3 serving as the source of water for soil microbiota graham et al 2010 soil water content distributions also affect hydrologic processes at varying scales western and blöschl 1999 ranging from centimeters e g capillary flow versus macropore flow solute transport to kilometers e g surface atmosphere interactions large scale flooding the distribution of soil water across hillslopes is affected by a number of factors including season martinez et al 2008 western and grayson 2000 topography beven and kirkby 1979 flora chandler et al 2018 metzger et al 2017 land use foster et al 2003 and physical properties of the soil dong and ochsner 2018 zhu and mohanty 2003 we investigated the effect of seasonal variations in rainfall and evapotranspiration on the temporal and spatial distributions of soil water on san cristóbal a tropical ocean island located in the galápagos archipelago in the equatorial pacific fig 1 previous work on soil moisture patterns and dynamics has largely focused on subtropical or temperate landscapes where a hillslope s aspect affects the soil water content not just through evapotranspiration but by fundamental changes to the hillslope s hydrology slope aspect affects the types of plants growing on the hillslope the amount of solar radiation that each side of the slope receives during the summer and the winter and the shape of the slopes pelletier et al 2018 authors have noted that polar facing slopes south facing in the southern hemisphere and north facing in the northern hemisphere are usually cooler wetter and steeper while equator facing slopes are drier and more likely to approach wilting point and less steep ebel 2013 low elevation equatorial sites like those on san cristóbal are largely unaffected by aspect because solar radiation is direction independent providing an opportunity to explore the seasonal change at constant aspect in the distribution of soil water the relationship between temporal and spatial variability in soil water content based on season has been extensively studied in subtropical and temperate climates the shale hills critical zone observatory pennsylvania usa has served as the site of numerous spatial and temporal soil water surveys the results of the temporal studies show that while root zone and shallow soil water probes less than 0 3 m deep recorded strong seasonal differences in the distributions of soil moisture deeper soil moisture probes inserted to depths between 0 3 and 1 1 m showed greater temporal persistence takagi and lin 2012 at the wüstebach catchment in germany authors noted that seasonal and even event driven variations in precipitation affected the topsoil s soil moisture content while deeper soil water content was affected by the depth to the water table more than the local precipitation rosenbaum et al 2012 a study of soils in france spain and tunisia found that while precipitation caused the mean soil water content across a field to change the distribution of soil water especially minima and maxima remained constant through time vachaud et al 1985 other authors have noted similar examples of spatially heterogeneous soil water distributions that are stable inter or intra annually brocca et al 2009 and references therein grayson et al 1997 at all these sites an extensive network of soil moisture monitoring probes weather stations and groundwater observation wells and piezometers were in place facilitating detailed quantitative understanding of the temporal and spatial dynamics of soil moisture tropical sites like the galápagos often lack the scientific infrastructure to support studies like those carried out in subtropical and temperate climates despite the importance of the temporal behavior and spatial distribution of soil water to the island wide hydrology previous studies have used electromagnetic resistivity d ozouville et al 2008a seismic refraction adelinet et al 2018 numerical modeling domínguez et al 2016 2017 and noble gas and stable isotope geochemistry warrier et al 2012 to create a conceptual model for the behavior of water as it enters the groundwater system summarized in percy et al 2016 in general the current conceptual models of the island s hydrogeological system require that water infiltrates through soils and into perched aquifers that either drain via springs to the surface or deeper into the island s groundwater system however little work has been done to understand the behavior of shallow soil water across the island s planar hillslopes san cristóbal s seasonal variability in precipitation amounts and type percy et al 2016 schmitt et al 2018 makes it a prime study site to understand how seasonal variability affects the temporal and spatial behavior and distribution of soil water across hillslopes on a tropical island this study uses new data collected from soil moisture and weather monitoring stations at four different altitudes on san cristóbal coupled with intensive spatial sampling of shallow soil water content distributions across these four hillslopes during two different seasons to address three primary questions 1 does the soil water saturation differ seasonally on the studied hillslopes 2 do we observe differences in the spatial patterns of near surface soil water content across these hillslopes based on seasonal differences in stochastic variables like rainfall and evapotranspiration 3 could spatial patterns of shallow soil water affect runoff generation through geostatistical analysis of spatial patterns time series analysis of the hydrologic response monitoring across the hillslopes and characterization of soil hydraulic properties we provide further insights into variations in the hillslope scale water balance across a climosequence in a tropical equatorial island setting 2 methods and materials 2 1 site selection and description san cristóbal island a basaltic volcanic island that is part of the galápagos archipelago fig 1 is estimated to have emerged from the pacific around 2 4 ma geist et al 2014 and the youngest dated eruption on the southwest side of the island where our study sites are located occurred 0 65 ma ago the bedrock across the archipelago is basaltic and ranges from tholeiitic to alkaline in nature across san cristóbal at least six mineralogically and chemically distinct basalts were identified that range in age between 2 35 0 03 and 0 7 ma on the southwest side of the island to nearly modern on the northeast side of the island geist et al 1986 despite its equatorial latitude san cristóbal experiences seasons due to the latitudinal migration of the intertropical convergence zone trueman and d ozouville 2010 from january through may san cristóbal generally experiences weather typical of the tropics with large convective rainstorms across the entire island from june until december southeast trade winds blow across cool upwelled ocean water to create an inversion layer resulting in a dry and sunny coastal zone while the summit at roughly 700 m above sea level receives rainfall and is often cloudy see schmitt et al 2018 for details of upland climate the seasonal shift from highly variable island wide precipitation to consistent highland only precipitation has resulted in a climosequence that is strongly dependent on elevation ranging from very arid at the coastline to very humid at the summit colinvaux 1972 vegetation ranges from native scrub and cacti at the coastline to grassy pastures broadleaf shrubs and trees at middle elevations and native herbs and shrubs at the highest elevations huttel 1986 we selected four hillslope sites across the island co located with weather stations deployed in 2015 fig 1 two on the windward side and two on the leeward side the weather stations were installed to capture as many climate zones as possible while facilitating routine maintenance instrument security and data downloads el junco ej is the highest site on the windward side of the island and is located in the very humid zone the hillslope is convex linear see classification of schoeneberger et al 2012 for explanation of slope shapes and is bounded on the east side by a bedrock outcrop the studied portion of the slope covers an area of 48 50 m2 sitio mirador sm and cerro alto ca are located on the leeward side of the island and span the transition zone between dry sm and humid ca climates ca s slope shape is convex concave and has cow paths that we observed to affect runoff at the site the studied portion of the slope is 54 40 m2 sm with a study area of 96 40 m2 is the most gently sloping of the sites and is bounded on three sides by bedrock cliffs finca merceditas fm is the lowest site but because it is on the windward side of the island it remains in the transition zone between the dry and humid climate zones the slope shape at fm is linear linear and was partially covered by a study area of 75 50 m2 with these four sites we have hillslopes in most of san cristóbal s climate zones except for the arid zone the arid coastal zone s soils are thin and unevenly distributed found mostly in cracks in lava flows and so are not included in this study we visited the sites during the galápagos wet season of 2015 and the dry season of 2016 wet season 2015 was during an el niño and was wet 161 mm of measured precipitation at ej over five weeks of the study period from the weather station at each site while the study during 2016 occurred during an eight month drought 46 mm of precipitation measured over the eight week study period at ej summary details about each site are provided in table 1 between the field seasons a wildfire affected ca and sm probably in july according to farmers at ca the majority of the sampling points were unaffected by the wildfire and the site remained a pasture only the downslope points experienced the fire sm s land use changed following the fire from a carefully maintained natural area that served as a nursery for native plants to a garden with little ground cover 2 2 measurement of climate variables and temporal soil water data the deployed weather stations collected data on rainfall wind speed and direction relative humidity temperature and solar radiation and were co located with soil moisture probes at three depths data gaps at the stations were the result of inclement weather and biological activity that resulted in the failure of instruments to record the volumetric soil water content we installed soil water sensors model cs616 campbell scientific inc utah united states horizontally at depths of 10 20 and 40 cm at ej and 10 20 and 30 cm at the other three sites however because of equipment failure after deployment continuous soil moisture data at sm are not available the data were recorded every 15 min with the exception of the station at fm which recorded data every 5 min for the first 300 days a complete description of the equipment used to measure climate variables is found in schmitt et al 2018 to calculate the reference evapotranspiration rates we used the fao penman monteith method zotarelli et al 2010 because of the available weather station data we used the grass reference surface in our calculations because none of the weather stations were installed under trees and because three of the four sites were grassy while the last site ej is characterized by low herbs 2 3 physical properties and site characterization we made hillslope scale and point measurements to describe the physical properties of the studied hillslopes we recorded physical variables at each point for which near surface soil water content was collected as described below digital elevation models available for san cristóbal were insufficient because their resolution was too coarse for this study 20 m from envisat d ozouville et al 2008b so we surveyed the four hillslopes across the 2 m grid via tape and compass measurements fig s1 from the generated 2 m resolution dem we calculated the slopes and upslope accumulation area for each site using arcgis esri 2011 we noted the overlying plant type bramble fern herb grass tree and bare soil at the point at which we inserted the soil water content probe and recorded the presence of trees tree roots or rocky outcrops within 2 m of each measurement point we present maps of the plants at each measurement point for both seasons in figure s2 we used a soil step probe 33 plated step probe with handle ams idaho united states to measure the depth of soil hereafter depth to refusal after measuring the soil water content at each point excavations show that the depth to refusal is the depth to a clay rich horizon or rock and provide an adequate proxy for the depth to which soils are heavily rooted maps of the depth to refusal are presented in fig s3 2 4 soil water content and hydrologic properties during the field seasons we measured the near surface soil water content using a hydrosense ii hs2 cs659 portable soil water content probe 12 cm rods campbell scientific inc utah united states with a support volume the volume of soil over which the soil water content is measured of approximately 460 cm3 the output from the hs2 is electrical period microseconds μs and a conversion is used to calculate volumetric water content volume the period is strongly related to the dielectric permittivity of the material around the probe rods campbell scientific hydrosense ii user guide tropical soils on volcanic parent material can have a range of clay and amorphous material contents that will affect the calibration of soil water content probes noborio 2001 regalado et al 2003 so we noted both period and calculated soil water content we calibrated the hs2 in the laboratory using minimally disturbed soil core samples collected in 130 cm3 metal cylinders in the 2015 wet season we took at least 100 shallow soil moisture measurements within a 20 20 m2 grid to provide adequate spatial coverage on the small hillslopes we made additional measurements down slopes in transects extending from grid lines the dry season campaign in 2016 included the same 100 points measured during the 2015 campaign we measured additional points during both field campaigns that are included in the geospatial analysis we collected measurements over several days at each site during the wet season campaign the weather stations were not yet operational at ej ca and fm but field notes indicate that it rained every day at ej and for one of the six measurement days at ca during the dry season only ej received rain during data collection fig s4 we also measured hydraulic properties of the soils to support the temporal and spatial observations of the soil s volumetric water content to measure the hydraulic properties of the soils on the four hillslopes we used in situ experiments to quantify the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and laboratory analyses to measure bulk density grain size distributions ph and the weight percentage of amorphous material in the soils in the field we measured the sorptivity of water and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity using meter group mini disk infiltrometers mdi with an applied suction of 2 cm for sites ca sm and fm and 0 5 cm for site ej due to slow infiltration across the site we applied the mdi to the soil after clearing the leaf litter and made at least two measurements of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity within 1 m of each other at sm and fm we used the excel macro provided by the manufacturer to calculate the sorptivity and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity we measured the bulk density of the soils using the saran method blake and hartge 1986 to aid in the calibration of the hydrosense ii as well as estimate what the maximum volumetric water content could be we calculated the bulk porosity in samples from the sites using an average particle density value of 2 60 g cm3 the average density of kaolinite gibbsite halloysite and illite all of which are expected to be important components of the soil porosity 1 bulk density particle density in the laboratory we measured grain size distributions from each site by dry sieving the fine earth fraction 2 mm particles on a shaker followed by gravimetric determination to yield the percent of the total weight of the sample with chemical dispersion of clays accomplished using sodium hexametaphosphate soil survey staff 2014 the ph of the mineral soil was measured by combining 5 g of fine earth mixed in 20 ml of distilled water and allowed to equilibrate for at least one hour before allowing the particles to settle and measuring the ph of the supernatant pansu and gautheyrou 2006 naturally occurring amorphous materials in soils are noncrystalline and poorly crystalline material usually composed of compounds of si fe and al that coordinate with free oxides and hydroxides we measured the weight percentage of amorphous material in the bulk soil using the ammonium oxalate extraction method jackson et al 1986 at least once per site because amorphous materials can adsorb water and affect the hydrophobicity of soil 2 5 data processing we analyzed the soil water content and climate time series data using r computing software r core team 2017 to examine relative temporal changes in soil moisture we normalized the measured volumetric water content to the maximum observed values during saturation to calculate relative soil saturations to examine the observations spatially we used semivariogram analysis to calculate the autocorrelation distance across the four sites during each season semivariograms show the autocorrelation over distance across hillslopes and can be used to understand the distributions of soil water western et al 2004 understanding autocorrelation distance at the four sites provides a quantitative metric for the degree of hillslope connectivity which is important to the understanding of runoff generation on the hillslopes we input our gridded data into the geor package in r ribeiro and diggle 2001 to test omnidirectional exponential western et al 2004 and spherical models bi et al 2009 different studies have found that the exponential or spherical models fit data better in different landscape types the exponential model s covariance along the sill asymptotically approaches zero variance while the spherical model s sill represents where the covariance is zero we compared the raw output data from the hs2 period and the calculated soil water content to complete the semivariogram analysis using the different models we tested correlation relationships between soil water content and topographic measures including slope and upslope accumulation area and the depth to refusal we also analyzed the relationship between hillslope averaged variables like bulk density ph fraction of amorphous material unsaturated infiltration rates soil texture and the mean soil moisture and standard deviation of the soil water content for the wet and dry seasons 3 results 3 1 temporal record of soil moisture the temporal record of rainfall soil moisture and evapotranspiration is presented in fig 2 for sites ej ca and fm summary data from the weather stations at all four sites are in table 2 the wet season on san cristóbal usually falls between january and may and the dry season falls between june and december with interannual variability in the beginning and end of the seasons however the beginning of the study fell within the strong 2015 2016 el niño which ended in may june 2016 hu and fedorov 2019 resulting in very wet conditions throughout the first part of the study as shown in fig 2a almost 65 of the precipitation at ej fell between october 2015 and february 2016 during this period the wind was at its most variable and the solar radiation was lower than during dryer parts of the year on the island of santa cruz researchers found that fog can account for approximately 20 of the net precipitation at high elevation sites at comparable elevations to ej pryet et al 2012b because of the configuration of the weather station we did not measure the amount of occult precipitation at ej which means that an important source of water into the hillslope is not considered within the precipitation data within the soil the deepest soil moisture probe 40 cm recorded soil moisture levels that regularly approached saturation the data show that soil moisture decreased more slowly from saturation than the shallow soil moisture the dry period february 2016 until the end of the data record january 2017 had fewer rainstorms and the reference evapotranspiration was higher due to both higher windspeeds and greater solar radiation this corresponds with a decline in the recorded soil moisture through the season with rainstorms resulting in sudden increases in the shallower soil moisture data 10 and 20 cm and much smaller increases in the deep soil moisture data 40 cm ca fig 2b located on the drier leeward side of the island receives precipitation from large convective storms rather than the fog that characterizes the dry season at ej in calculating the reference et for site ca the solar radiation term of et was consistent across the year but the wind term was highly variable and was the dominant control of the calculated reference evapotranspiration for the site the data recorded by the soil moisture probes at ca show that the deepest soil moisture probe 30 cm most often approached saturation and the 20 cm deep probe was only slightly drier the shallow probe 10 cm recorded the greatest percent change in measured soil water content after precipitation events compared to the deeper soil probes and also indicated that the soil dried most quickly near the surface at the low elevation windward site fm the average reference et remained around 2 40 mm day throughout the seasons in part because the windspeed remained consistent throughout the seasons changes in the daily reference et are due to changes in radiation fluxes the soil moisture data show that the shallowest soil moisture probe 10 cm recorded the highest saturation across the study period while the two deeper soil moisture probes 20 and 30 cm had similar saturation values recorded through time at all of the sites the temporal soil moisture record reflects different responses to precipitation events for example at ej fig 3 a the surface soil moisture probe at 10 cm showed a daily decline in the percent saturation until a large event at which point the record reflects an increase to 100 saturation the 10 and 20 cm probes first responded to the storm event at the same time however the 20 cm deep probe did not record as steep of a rate in the increase of saturation the 40 cm probe had the highest percent saturation prior to the storm event and did not respond to the storm event until hours after the surface soil probes several days after the precipitation event the 40 cm deep probe reached saturation during smaller precipitation events while the 10 and 20 cm soils had lower percent saturation values fig 3b shows the response in percent saturation at ca to two storm events the first storm event resulted in a nearly simultaneous increase in the percent saturation at all three probe depths within 30 min after the start of the event indicative of preferential flow in the surface soil which may be an important mechanism at this site the second storm event was recorded by all three soil probes simultaneously within the same 15 minute measurement period at ca the surface soil dried most quickly at fm fig 3c the 10 cm deep probe recorded the highest percent saturation throughout the considered time period while the 20 and 30 cm deep probes recorded very similar percent saturations the shallowest probe recorded an increase in the percent saturation approximately 50 min before the 20 and 30 cm root zone probes began to record an increase in the percent saturation the second smaller event did not affect the 30 cm deep probe and only marginally increased the percent saturation for the 20 cm deep probe but resulted in a 3 increase in the percent saturation for the surface probe from 92 saturation to 94 8 saturation 3 2 spatial soil water patterns and statistics the number of sampling points and summary statistics of the spatial soil water survey measurements table 3 show that the mean maximum and minimum measured values of soil water content during the wet seasons are not surprisingly higher than during the dry season the standard deviation and coefficient of variation a measure of the relative variability of the soil water content are higher for the dry period than they are for the wet period at all four sites while changes in soil water between field seasons are associated with the precipitation the cross site relationship between site wide precipitation and mean soil water content is not linear likely because of differences in physical properties of soils at the sites for example despite its location in the very humid highlands and the highest annual precipitation record ej has the lowest mean of spatial soil water content for the wet season and the second highest mean of spatial soil water content for the dry season ca s mean of spatial soil water content is the second highest during the wet season but has a low mean of spatial soil water content during the dry season sm and fm display similar means of spatial soil water values during the wet season but because sm is on the leeward side of the island and fm is on the windward side the mean of the spatial soil water content during the dry season is higher at fm than sm there are no easily discernible spatial patterns in the distribution of near surface soil moisture across the hillslopes fig 4 at ej the most humid site neither of the spatial surveys show a relationship between soil moisture distribution and topography across the hillslope although the lower portion of the slope for the dry season was slightly wetter than the upper portion of the slope collected the day before because of a rainstorm that occurred on the day we made the measurements on the low slope segment supplementary fig 4 any possible pattern present at ca is difficult to identify because of the rock faces and thin soils that dominate the middle of the hillslope at this site in the areas with spatially continuous data soil moisture increased slightly in the middle of the saddle at the top of the hill at ca at a point with the greatest convergence at the study site for sm the distribution of soil moisture appears random during both the wet and dry season although less data were collected during the wet season the noticeably wet area at sm during the wet season occurred where taller trees and thick herbs shaded the ground at fm the distribution of soil moisture appears random during both the wet and dry seasons the distribution of the soil water content data varies from site to site with the shapiro wilk test of normality indicating that none of the sites soil water content distributions are normal previous authors used the gamma distribution e g kaiser and mcglynn 2018 to describe the probability distribution of data because it resembles the positive skewness often observed with soil pore size distributions tuller and or 2005 and it has been experimentally tested in a variety of catchments e g mcguire et al 2005 we examined histograms of the soil water content for each site and applied gamma distributions fig 5 for all but fm the dry season s distributions are positively skewed while for all of the sites the wet season s distributions are negatively skewed other studies note that negative skewness is observed when the bounded function approaches the upper bound of porosity and the soil water content has reached saturation kaiser and mcglynn 2018 western et al 2002 whereas positive skewness corresponds to the soil water content approaching the wilting point we tested the temporal stability of the soil moisture spatial distributions by ranking the soil moisture values and comparing the ranks of the points that we measured during both seasons across the four sites there was no temporal stability in the spatial distribution of soil moisture however it is crucial to note that other studies that have observed temporal stability of soil moisture distribution patterns incorporated significantly more time points including studies that collected soil moisture data over years dari et al 2019 gao et al 2019 starks et al 2006 western et al 1999 additional interpretations of the temporal stability of soil moisture distributions across our hillslopes would require additional spatial surveys of the slopes to capture not just wet and dry seasons but the transition between the seasons 3 3 geostatistical analysis we used semivariogram analysis at each site to evaluate spatial correlations between measured soil moisture we made the models of semivariance using the directly measured period μs rather than the calculated soil water content because the hydrosense ii does not report volumetric water content values above 52 2 due to internal calibration within the sensor while the measured period is reported from the sensor for every point the soil s electrical response is affected by soil moisture but also by the clay content organic material content and soil salinity topp et al 1980 while the use of period rather than volumetric water content affected the autocorrelation distances calculated with the semivariogram analysis this introduced less error into the interpretations of the results because of greater spatial coverage across the hillslopes we tested a range of input values for the nugget the partial sill and the range parameter selected based on the measured data for each model semivariogram and reported the model with the lowest sum of squares fit the values used for each of the best fit models are in table 4 the spherical model type provided a lower sum of squares fit than does the exponential model for all but four of the models for three models ca during the dry season and fm during the wet and dry seasons the type of model did not affect the sum of squares fit and is listed as sph exp for sm during the dry season the exponential model had a lower sum of squares fit we also tested whether the model required a nugget for all of the models setting a nugget provided a better model fit than reducing the nugget to zero beyond the presence of a nugget the semivariogram models lines show no consistent trends in autocorrelation related to either season or site wetness and do not fit the calculated semivariance of the measured data well fig 6 in the wet season right panel the wet sites semivariance does not reach a plateau suggesting that the autocorrelation distance is longer than the measured length of the hillslopes for the dry season left panel the models of the semivariance lines fail to capture the calculated semivariance at ca and fm because there is no spatial correlation across the hillslopes 3 4 soil hydrologic properties the results of the mdi experiments measured over the course of one day at each site show that the soils sorptivity and measured unsaturated hydraulic conductivity hereafter k unsat were heterogeneous during both wet and dry field seasons we report both values in table 5 because the sorptivity which represents a soil s ability to draw water stewart et al 2013 does not depend upon the soil wetness when measured unlike unsaturated hydraulic conductivity measurements because the mdi experiments are completed over very small areas the diameter of the steel disk applied to the soil surface is 4 5 cm this heterogeneity is expected but even in settings with massive spatial variability in hydraulic conductivity enough measurements with a mini disk can be used to provide useful estimates of effective infiltration capacity at the catchment scale mcguire et al 2018 regardless of the mean soil water content for each hillslope the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity did not exhibit patterns based on the distance downslope from the datum at each site suggesting that shallow soil water was not accumulating downslope we measured the soil saturation at each point prior to running the mdi experiments and saw no relationship between shallow soil saturation the soil sorptivity and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity other hydrologic properties at the four sites including bulk density and calculated porosity grain size distributions ph and the weight percentage of amorphous material are reported along with the results of the mdi experiments in table 5 because we made all of the soil moisture measurements in the upper soil layer only topsoil 0 15 cm samples from the o or ah horizons lasso and espinosa 2018 properties are included during the dry field season we collected surface bulk density samples at the same location we made the mdi measurements at fm and ej however there is no apparent relationship between the two properties the other measured hydrologic properties at fm and ej have no correlation with the mdi measured k unsat values at fm and ej we compared the k unsat data to the intensity of rainfall during the field seasons for all of the sites fig 7 at all of the sites the range of measured unsaturated hydraulic conductivity spanned orders of magnitude the smallest values measured for the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at each site are within the same order of magnitude of rainfall intensity table 5 while the largest values are much higher than the measured rainfall intensity however because we avoided obvious macropores observed at sitio mirador the only site at which surficial expression of the presence of macropores was clear and adjusted the suction for the mdi to exclude macropore flow the calculated k unsat values only apply to the soil matrix because we did not account for macropore flow in our measurements of k unsat the precipitation and k unsat values may not overlap at all if macropore flow is important and rapid infiltration through macropores dominates infiltration additionally we calculated the rainfall intensities from the total precipitation collected in a tipping bucket rain gauge and integrated over the data logger s recording time 5 15 min likely some of the instantaneous rainfall intensities were slightly higher than the values integrated over the relatively short measurement periods while in the field we excavated soil pits across the hillslopes at ej we observed water exfiltrating along the o and a horizon boundary in the profile wall between 8 and 15 cm deep across the entire hillslope when there was heavy rain every day during the wet season one day during the dry season at ca we observed water moving along a boundary between less clay rich and clay rich layers only during the wet season at sm and fm we did not observe water exfiltration from the exposed face of the soil pits although numerous studies indicate that saprolite that underlies many tropical sites may have bimodal pore size distributions navarre sitchler et al 2013 we observed no evidence of such a distribution within the saprolites from the soil pits 4 discussion 4 1 do the soil water saturation states differ seasonally at the three study sites with temporally continuous records of soil saturation ej ca and fm we observed changes in the percent saturation for all depths between the wet season and the dry season table 6 this shift in the seasonal percent saturation was unsurprisingly supported by changes in the mean soil saturation measured by the two areal studies ej had one rain event during the dry season for which there are both temporal and spatial data over the course of the event the soil water saturation of the areal study increased by a percent change of 18 5 and the soil water saturation measured by the weather station increased by a percent change of 20 3 with additional spatial surveys and in situ soil moisture probes determining if the weather stations provide a representative measurement of the change in the percent saturation would be possible because this study fell during an el niño the seasonal changes that we described represent extreme cases of wet and dry the highest intensity and amount of precipitation measured at ej corresponds to the record of the greatest saturation of soils at all depths when rainfall declined during the dry season the calculated reference evapotranspiration was higher and more variable reflecting an increase in solar radiation and windspeed el niño usually results in more convective rainfall and less fog in the galápagos trueman and d ozouville 2010 so it is possible that during non el niño years the soils at ej do not dry as much as they did during our study period which occurred during an intense el niño year at ca the rainy periods corresponded to the highest measured soil saturation while the reference evapotranspiration was variable throughout the year reflecting the site s leeward position and the fact that it receives less consistent rainfall and fog during dry seasons compared to the windward sites because island wide convective storms are more common during el niño years the high soil saturation observed during this study at ca may be uncharacteristic of the site fm also has a distinct rainy and dry season although it received more dry season precipitation than the leeward ca higher soil saturation was associated with the rainy seasons but the reference evapotranspiration stayed consistent throughout the year reflecting the fact that the site receives less precipitation than ej but more than ca we examined the change in variance in the temporal soil water content record and observed shifts through time the sites showed different relationships between the saturation state and the variance with higher measured variance during the dry season at ej and lower variance during the dry season at ca the variance around the mean percent saturation at fm remains nearly the same for both seasons many authors have observed that the highest variance in soil moisture is associated with mid range mean soil moisture measurements in near surface soils choi et al 2007 famiglietti et al 2008 although researchers have also noted that variance can both increase or decrease with changes in the mean soil moisture pan and peters lidard 2008 for example at a temperate site in virginia usa it was noted that the lowest variance around mean soil moisture is associated with extreme wet and dry periods lawrence and hornberger 2007 the authors determined that during dry periods the variance is controlled by the wilting point of plants during temperate periods the variance is dictated by the hydraulic conductivity of soils and during wet periods the variance is controlled by the soil porosity in the case where authors working in sodic soils observed that while the highest variance was associated with mid range soil moisture measurements at depths below 20 cm they still observed that the shallowest soil moisture measurements 0 6 cm exhibited the highest variance associated with the extreme wet and dry soil moisture periods peterson et al 2019 additionally their observation of high variance associated with extreme wet and dry values in deeper soils is likely the result of the chemical properties of the soils affecting the conductivity of clay pans at depths greater than 20 cm the depth to the point of refusal which is generally the depth to a clay rich horizon is deeper than the shallowest soil moisture probe at each weather station and the chemistry of the soils do not display sodic characteristics percy 2020 so we assume that the sites variance decreases as conditions approach extreme wet and dry conditions to this end we compared the wet and dry seasons to understand what possible factors may affect the percent saturation at the sites using lawrence and hornberger s 2007 drivers of variance for different saturation states at ej we observed a shift between the wet and dry seasons from lower to higher variance suggesting a possible shift from the control of soil saturation by maximum soil porosity to the control of the soil saturation by hydraulic conductivity and other hydrologic properties ej s surface soil remained more saturated than any of the other sites throughout the year table 2 resulting in the plants on the planar hillslope unlikely to demonstrate water stress during any part of the study period conversely the variance in ca declined between the wet and the dry periods suggesting that ca shifted from a state where soil saturation was controlled by hydrologic factors to a point where the plants wilting points were being reached field observations of dried grasses and herbs support this hypothesis although matric pressure was not measured so this hypothesis cannot be further tested the lack of a statistically significant change in the variance at fm led us to conclude that there was not a major shift in what factors are controlling the soil saturation at this site conversely it is possible that the control of the saturation of soils at fm had shifted from porosity to the wilting point of plants but we find this to be unlikely based on field observations at fm during the dry season when grasses and herbs were still green and because the deeper probes rarely recorded full saturation values further field campaigns would benefit from a longer temporal record and the installation of additional in situ soil moisture probes to account for variable changes in the percent saturation across the sites 4 2 do the spatial patterns of near surface soil water shift seasonally with the spatial surveys of soil moisture we intended to test whether observable differences in the spatial patterns of near surface soil moisture 12 cm across the hillslopes are based on the season our findings indicate that the heterogeneity of soil water across the hillslopes remained high during both wet and dry seasons but based on only two spatial surveys determining the temporal stability of the heterogeneity is not yet possible the semivariogram analysis indicates that the autocorrelation distance was longer than the length of the studied hillslopes the lack of spatial autocorrelation on our measured scales may reflect the size of the hillslopes their planar morphology or the heterogeneity of soil properties across the hillslopes we used simple regressions to test whether topography depth to refusal or slope could be used to predict the percent saturation but no relationship was observed between any of these variables and the spatial soil moisture measurements we used wilcoxan signed rank tests to test whether plant type led to distinguishable differences in percent saturation but differences between plant types were not statistically significant at any of the sites this suggests that at the scales of the plots in which we worked a combination of these variables affects the surface soil moisture in addition to the microclimatic conditions associated with each measurement point previous studies noted that plot scale variability in soil moisture can be very high when compared to landscape scale variability kaiser and mcglynn 2018 because this study was limited to the hillslopes at which weather stations were installed we did not measure catchment scale variability in soil water content we noted from the temporal soil moisture record that ej s variance in percent saturation was higher in the dry season than in the wet season while ca s variance was lower in the dry season than in the wet season and fm s variance was the same throughout the seasons section 4 1 however the variance from the spatial soil moisture measurements from the seasonal surveys was consistently higher during the dry season compared to the wet season although the temporal and spatial variance are not directly comparable because of the nature of the study design the dry season s higher spatial variance may be due to surface soils drying and approaching wilting points reasons why the spatial patterns of soil water remained highly heterogeneous throughout both seasons are numerous despite differences in stochastic variables like precipitation and evapotranspiration previous work completed across a much larger catchment at tarrawarra victoria australia noted a change in the heterogeneity of spatial soil moisture observations between the wet and dry season with soil water content increasing in the convergent portions of the catchment during wet periods western and grayson 1998 2000 the planar nature of the studied hillslopes coupled with their small size make it unlikely that we captured sufficient data in convergent areas where flowlines meet possibly explaining the lack of recorded seasonal reorganization of soil water additionally the interpretation of the spatial distribution of soil water is convoluted by the fact that each site s soil water survey took several days to complete the weather stations were installed after we completed the spatial surveys in the wet season so we are unable to show the change in soil water content through time for the first spatial survey however we can show how the soil moisture changed during the dry season over the course of the surveys fig s4 at fm and ca the weather station recorded a mean value of volumetric water content of 29 7 and 25 4 respectively with a standard deviation of 0 2 over the time period during which we collected spatial data however a rainstorm at ej on one of our measurement days caused the soil water content to rise and the resulting standard deviation of the soil water measured at the weather station during the four days of the spatial survey is an order of magnitude higher at ej 2 3 compared to fm and ca further surveys of spatial distributions of soil water will benefit from single day collection which was not possible with the limited resources and narrow scope of this project 4 3 do spatial patterns of soil water affect runoff generation despite intense rainfall at all of the sites during the rainy season we did not observe evidence of connected surface runoff across the studied hillslopes at ej sm and fm including little evidence of gully formation at the agricultural sites or bottom slope wetness the only runoff that we observed was at ca along a cow trail and then only when the trail passed beneath a basalt bluff based on the spatial distribution of soil moisture across the hillslopes and the semivariogram analyses of the spatial distributions we propose that the lack of runoff at the four sites is due to low spatial connectivity across each hillslope and variable responses to wetting and drying at different depths of the soil coupled with generally high hydraulic conductivity in surface soils the low spatial connectivity of the surface soil water identified using semivariogram analysis affected runoff because the amount of water in soils varied spatially from the temporal record of soil water content we noted variable responses to wetting and drying between the surface soil probes 10 cm and the deeper soil moisture measurements made within the root zone the delays between the arrival of water at the surface soil probe and the deeper probes suggest vertical infiltration is largely matrix flow dominated we also observed a large range of sorptivity and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity fig 7 table 5 the range of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivities table 5 suggests that some parts of the hillslopes were more conductive than others from the mdi experiments we know these areas may be very close to one another within 1 m incorporating the observations of spatial and vertical heterogeneity we propose two possible explanations for the lack of runoff observed at the sites the first is that highly permeable unsealed surface material distributed across the hillslopes allows water to vertically infiltrate into the soil column previous authors modeling arid and semiarid catchments found that the sealing status of the shallowest portions of a soil profile were a more important factor in generating runoff than spatial heterogeneity assouline and mualem 2006 they showed that simulations of catchments with no surface seal formation generated little cumulative runoff however this explanation does not fit our observations as we did not observe soil sealing on any of the hillslopes and the hydrologic properties and soil water distributions are highly heterogeneous at each site instead of uniform highly permeable soil surfaces we suggest that surface soil that becomes saturated simply becomes a source of soil water to adjacent soil that is less saturated and can accommodate the excess water by serving as a sink the high variability in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity provides further evidence that intense precipitation does not saturate a soil and start flowing overland because areas with lower soil moisture and higher hydraulic conductivity are nearby and can serve as sinks for excess water this supports the hypothesis of more transmissive and retentive parts of the hillslopes that prevent the accumulation of observable and measurable overland flow across hillslopes thus any patches of runoff are not connected with another downslope and limit the occurrence and impacts of overland flow transmissive soils conduct water more easily when wet higher hydraulic conductivities while retentive soils conduct water poorly when wet lower hydraulic conductivities but can retain soil moisture for longer periods of time high intensity rainfall may produce localized runoff from retentive soils that infiltrates into adjacent parcels of more transmissive soil nimmo et al 2009 on san cristóbal this model may explain the lack of runoff on the planar hillslopes because of the high heterogeneity in hillslope scale characteristics like soil texture and the amount of amorphous material both of which affect hydraulic conductivity parcels of transmissive and retentive soils may be adjacent to each other the lack of autocorrelation across small distances less than 100 m on the hillslopes provides support for this model of a patchwork of transmissive and retentive soils runoff generation at temperate sites may depend on whether lateral or vertical flow paths are dominant along the hillslopes where the presence of lateral flow paths depends on the morphology of the landscape elsenbeer 2001 fitzjohn et al 1998 for our study none of the studied slopes featured gullies or other areas of high convergence fig s1 so it is unlikely that large amounts of surface lateral flow were driven by hillslope morphology at ca the uppermost portion of the site was saddle shaped and crisscrossed by cow paths soil water may have accumulated due to lateral flow in the slightly convergent portion of the saddle fig 4 but the remainder of the data from the spatial survey at the site demonstrated no similar accumulation most soil water evaporates directly from the soil surface is used by plants or infiltrates vertically until the water reaches an aquitard and begins to flow laterally in excavated soil pits during the wet season we observed water seeping out of the upslope walls along the horizon boundaries supporting lateral redistribution of water at depth at ca also a water meadow at the base of a nearby hillslope wetted after small rain events despite no evidence of runoff along the hillslope supporting the idea that water may be laterally redistributed deeper within the soil our hypothesis to explain the lack of observed surface runoff on the hillslopes corroborates work completed on other tropical ocean islands on the island of santa cruz galápagos to the west of san cristóbal soil profiles were instrumented with tensiometers to measure the pressure head within soil profiles under two different land cover types forest pasture domínguez et al 2016 those data were then incorporated into a soil water transfer model which showed that runoff was negligible because the soil water input never exceeded the infiltration capacity of the soils as we observed at the sites on san cristóbal based on the model deep percolation into the groundwater system occurred in both land use regimes suggesting that vertical flow paths through the soil results in groundwater recharge previous work on hawaii observed a similar phenomenon the surface soil had little connectivity resulting in negligible runoff but after vertical infiltration lateral redistribution of soil water was observed at horizon boundaries due to the change in the hydraulic conductivity between different horizons lohse and dietrich 2005 future work on san cristóbal should include the measurement of hydraulic conductivity across broader areas and in different horizons to better characterize spatial variations in conductivity that control runoff and groundwater recharge 4 4 soil water and island wide hydrogeology previous work on the hydrogeology of san cristóbal has related the island s groundwater system to that of hawaii violette et al 2014 consecutive lava flows separated by baked paleosols or tuffs have led to a complicated groundwater system of perched aquifers some of which drain to a basalt aquifer and some that result in springs this is similar to the hydrogeology of many other basalt systems including continental basalts like those found on the snake river plain mirus et al 2011 and other ocean islands like piton de la fournaise on la reúnion violette et al 1997 san cristóbal is the only island in the archipelago with multiple perennial streams maintained by springs that drain the perched aquifers this understanding has come through geophysical adelinet et al 2018 auken et al 2009 pryet et al 2012a and geochemical warrier et al 2012 observations little research has previously connected inputs into the island s hydrologic system with the groundwater system from this study we propose that water that has been transmitted through the soil s root zone and into the deeper horizons of the soil will either flow laterally along horizons of low hydraulic conductivity resulting in high soil water contents and seeps that emerge in areas of convergence like the water meadow at the base of ca or will infiltrate further through the unconsolidated saprolite to enter the deeper groundwater system due to the lack of monitoring wells on san cristóbal exact determination of the amount of infiltrated water that enters the groundwater system is unknown but the research on the behavior of surface and root zone soil water helps provide an important step in further understanding water cycling on san cristóbal this study is far from comprehensive but the data provide ample opportunities for further testing of conceptual and numerical models of hillslope hydrologic response on san cristóbal and similar tropical island settings additional efforts must also be made to improve instrumentation of hillslopes in diverse climates across san cristóbal to track how seasonality affects the distribution and behavior of soil water 5 conclusions we have compared the temporal and spatial records of soil water on four planar hillslopes on san cristóbal galápagos to develop a qualitative model of water in near surface soils in different climate zones this work aims to provide a component of our understanding of the hydrogeology of san cristóbal and possibly other ocean islands we initially sought to answer three questions 1 does soil water differ seasonally 2 does the spatial distribution of soil water differ through time and 3 could spatial patterns of soil water affect runoff generation the findings of this study confirm that temporal differences in saturation states on the studied hillslopes are driven by seasonal differences in precipitation and evapotranspiration and the position of the hillslopes on san cristóbal s climosequence and their windward leeward position thus our dataset is a valuable resource for future hydrologic and soil atmosphere modeling efforts we complemented the temporal differences in saturation state with surveys of the spatial variability of the soil water across the studied hillslopes showing that during both wet and dry seasons the soil water content was highly variable spatially and randomly distributed across the hillslope this spatial variability is likely the result of the heterogeneity of a number of factors including physical and hydrologic characteristics of the soil and the microclimate and microtopography around each of the measurement points while in the field we did not observe evidence of runoff at most of the sites except along the cow path at ca despite numerous heavy rain events because near surface soil moisture was not spatially connected and the hydraulic conductivity is higher than rainfall intensity we conclude that retentive patches of soil which can generate runoff are adjacent to transmissive patches of soil transmissive soils have higher hydraulic conductivities and can transmit potential runoff into deeper horizons of the soil system this may explain observations that uncultivated hillslopes on san cristóbal have little surface runoff connectivity as well as explaining how water enters the shallow groundwater system that is drained by numerous springs fieldwork in the galápagos remains challenging and our measurement and monitoring campaigns were restricted by access and resources our results confirm what might be presumed based on initial site assessments and field trips namely that seasonal changes in precipitation and elevation dependent precipitation inputs affect the soil saturation across the sites however our study provides concrete evidence to support the conceptual model for hillslope hydrology on san cristóbal these baseline data can be expanded to improve our understanding of the behavior of water through the surface soil across san cristóbal s climate gradient additional fieldwork on the hillslopes can capture the spatial distribution of soil water across the hillslopes with different precipitation inputs to accurately model the temporal stability of soil moisture distributions the installation of more research infrastructure especially piezometers and additional soil water probes at different points across the currently instrumented sites will yield valuable information to help track the fate of soil water that infiltrates beneath the clay layer at each site testing soil water models using the data presented in this paper can also facilitate improved quantitative understanding of factors affecting the distribution of soil water across the hillslopes as well as predict the fate of the soil water through the water cycle on the island acknowledgments this work was supported by a nsf graduate research fellowship grant dge 1650116 a

8336,study region this paper provides a summary of findings from temporal and spatial studies of soil water content on planar hillslopes across the equatorial island of san cristóbal galápagos ecuador study focus soil water content swc was measured to generate temporal and spatial records to determine seasonal variation and to investigate how the behavior of surface and near surface root zone soil water may support island wide hydrogeology models swc probes were installed at four weather stations in a climosequence to generate a temporal record and spatial surveys of shallow swc across the selected sites were completed during wet and dry seasons temporal differences in swc were driven by seasonal variations in rainfall and evapotranspiration while spatial variability remained high during both wet and dry seasons unsaturated hydraulic conductivity determined by mini disk infiltrometers was highly variable across the slopes as were other hydrologic variables new hydrological insights for the region the high heterogeneity of soil water and hydrologic characteristics provides a means to explain why little runoff is observed at the study sites soils do not saturate uniformly across hillslopes allowing for runoff generated in one part of the hillslope to be conducted into the soil in adjacent parts of the hillslope the lack of connected surface runoff helps explain how

introduction knowledge of near surface soil water content and the amount of water in pore spaces in the top of a soil 0 15 centimeters contributes to the understanding of climate energy balance and plant health soil water content distributions across hillslopes can affect energy fluxes by 1 controlling the partitioning of rainfall into evapotranspiration runoff and recharge mirus and loague 2013 rasmussen et al 2011 2 facilitating soil development and changes in chemistry by serving as a means of solute transport and changing the oxidation state of soils bailey et al 2014 and 3 serving as the source of water for soil microbiota graham et al 2010 soil water content distributions also affect hydrologic processes at varying scales western and blöschl 1999 ranging from centimeters e g capillary flow versus macropore flow solute transport to kilometers e g surface atmosphere interactions large scale flooding the distribution of soil water across hillslopes is affected by a number of factors including season martinez et al 2008 western and grayson 2000 topography beven and kirkby 1979 flora chandler et al 2018 metzger et al 2017 land use foster et al 2003 and physical properties of the soil dong and ochsner 2018 zhu and mohanty 2003 we investigated the effect of seasonal variations in rainfall and evapotranspiration on the temporal and spatial distributions of soil water on san cristóbal a tropical ocean island located in the galápagos archipelago in the equatorial pacific fig 1 previous work on soil moisture patterns and dynamics has largely focused on subtropical or temperate landscapes where a hillslope s aspect affects the soil water content not just through evapotranspiration but by fundamental changes to the hillslope s hydrology slope aspect affects the types of plants growing on the hillslope the amount of solar radiation that each side of the slope receives during the summer and the winter and the shape of the slopes pelletier et al 2018 authors have noted that polar facing slopes south facing in the southern hemisphere and north facing in the northern hemisphere are usually cooler wetter and steeper while equator facing slopes are drier and more likely to approach wilting point and less steep ebel 2013 low elevation equatorial sites like those on san cristóbal are largely unaffected by aspect because solar radiation is direction independent providing an opportunity to explore the seasonal change at constant aspect in the distribution of soil water the relationship between temporal and spatial variability in soil water content based on season has been extensively studied in subtropical and temperate climates the shale hills critical zone observatory pennsylvania usa has served as the site of numerous spatial and temporal soil water surveys the results of the temporal studies show that while root zone and shallow soil water probes less than 0 3 m deep recorded strong seasonal differences in the distributions of soil moisture deeper soil moisture probes inserted to depths between 0 3 and 1 1 m showed greater temporal persistence takagi and lin 2012 at the wüstebach catchment in germany authors noted that seasonal and even event driven variations in precipitation affected the topsoil s soil moisture content while deeper soil water content was affected by the depth to the water table more than the local precipitation rosenbaum et al 2012 a study of soils in france spain and tunisia found that while precipitation caused the mean soil water content across a field to change the distribution of soil water especially minima and maxima remained constant through time vachaud et al 1985 other authors have noted similar examples of spatially heterogeneous soil water distributions that are stable inter or intra annually brocca et al 2009 and references therein grayson et al 1997 at all these sites an extensive network of soil moisture monitoring probes weather stations and groundwater observation wells and piezometers were in place facilitating detailed quantitative understanding of the temporal and spatial dynamics of soil moisture tropical sites like the galápagos often lack the scientific infrastructure to support studies like those carried out in subtropical and temperate climates despite the importance of the temporal behavior and spatial distribution of soil water to the island wide hydrology previous studies have used electromagnetic resistivity d ozouville et al 2008a seismic refraction adelinet et al 2018 numerical modeling domínguez et al 2016 2017 and noble gas and stable isotope geochemistry warrier et al 2012 to create a conceptual model for the behavior of water as it enters the groundwater system summarized in percy et al 2016 in general the current conceptual models of the island s hydrogeological system require that water infiltrates through soils and into perched aquifers that either drain via springs to the surface or deeper into the island s groundwater system however little work has been done to understand the behavior of shallow soil water across the island s planar hillslopes san cristóbal s seasonal variability in precipitation amounts and type percy et al 2016 schmitt et al 2018 makes it a prime study site to understand how seasonal variability affects the temporal and spatial behavior and distribution of soil water across hillslopes on a tropical island this study uses new data collected from soil moisture and weather monitoring stations at four different altitudes on san cristóbal coupled with intensive spatial sampling of shallow soil water content distributions across these four hillslopes during two different seasons to address three primary questions 1 does the soil water saturation differ seasonally on the studied hillslopes 2 do we observe differences in the spatial patterns of near surface soil water content across these hillslopes based on seasonal differences in stochastic variables like rainfall and evapotranspiration 3 could spatial patterns of shallow soil water affect runoff generation through geostatistical analysis of spatial patterns time series analysis of the hydrologic response monitoring across the hillslopes and characterization of soil hydraulic properties we provide further insights into variations in the hillslope scale water balance across a climosequence in a tropical equatorial island setting 2 methods and materials 2 1 site selection and description san cristóbal island a basaltic volcanic island that is part of the galápagos archipelago fig 1 is estimated to have emerged from the pacific around 2 4 ma geist et al 2014 and the youngest dated eruption on the southwest side of the island where our study sites are located occurred 0 65 ma ago the bedrock across the archipelago is basaltic and ranges from tholeiitic to alkaline in nature across san cristóbal at least six mineralogically and chemically distinct basalts were identified that range in age between 2 35 0 03 and 0 7 ma on the southwest side of the island to nearly modern on the northeast side of the island geist et al 1986 despite its equatorial latitude san cristóbal experiences seasons due to the latitudinal migration of the intertropical convergence zone trueman and d ozouville 2010 from january through may san cristóbal generally experiences weather typical of the tropics with large convective rainstorms across the entire island from june until december southeast trade winds blow across cool upwelled ocean water to create an inversion layer resulting in a dry and sunny coastal zone while the summit at roughly 700 m above sea level receives rainfall and is often cloudy see schmitt et al 2018 for details of upland climate the seasonal shift from highly variable island wide precipitation to consistent highland only precipitation has resulted in a climosequence that is strongly dependent on elevation ranging from very arid at the coastline to very humid at the summit colinvaux 1972 vegetation ranges from native scrub and cacti at the coastline to grassy pastures broadleaf shrubs and trees at middle elevations and native herbs and shrubs at the highest elevations huttel 1986 we selected four hillslope sites across the island co located with weather stations deployed in 2015 fig 1 two on the windward side and two on the leeward side the weather stations were installed to capture as many climate zones as possible while facilitating routine maintenance instrument security and data downloads el junco ej is the highest site on the windward side of the island and is located in the very humid zone the hillslope is convex linear see classification of schoeneberger et al 2012 for explanation of slope shapes and is bounded on the east side by a bedrock outcrop the studied portion of the slope covers an area of 48 50 m2 sitio mirador sm and cerro alto ca are located on the leeward side of the island and span the transition zone between dry sm and humid ca climates ca s slope shape is convex concave and has cow paths that we observed to affect runoff at the site the studied portion of the slope is 54 40 m2 sm with a study area of 96 40 m2 is the most gently sloping of the sites and is bounded on three sides by bedrock cliffs finca merceditas fm is the lowest site but because it is on the windward side of the island it remains in the transition zone between the dry and humid climate zones the slope shape at fm is linear linear and was partially covered by a study area of 75 50 m2 with these four sites we have hillslopes in most of san cristóbal s climate zones except for the arid zone the arid coastal zone s soils are thin and unevenly distributed found mostly in cracks in lava flows and so are not included in this study we visited the sites during the galápagos wet season of 2015 and the dry season of 2016 wet season 2015 was during an el niño and was wet 161 mm of measured precipitation at ej over five weeks of the study period from the weather station at each site while the study during 2016 occurred during an eight month drought 46 mm of precipitation measured over the eight week study period at ej summary details about each site are provided in table 1 between the field seasons a wildfire affected ca and sm probably in july according to farmers at ca the majority of the sampling points were unaffected by the wildfire and the site remained a pasture only the downslope points experienced the fire sm s land use changed following the fire from a carefully maintained natural area that served as a nursery for native plants to a garden with little ground cover 2 2 measurement of climate variables and temporal soil water data the deployed weather stations collected data on rainfall wind speed and direction relative humidity temperature and solar radiation and were co located with soil moisture probes at three depths data gaps at the stations were the result of inclement weather and biological activity that resulted in the failure of instruments to record the volumetric soil water content we installed soil water sensors model cs616 campbell scientific inc utah united states horizontally at depths of 10 20 and 40 cm at ej and 10 20 and 30 cm at the other three sites however because of equipment failure after deployment continuous soil moisture data at sm are not available the data were recorded every 15 min with the exception of the station at fm which recorded data every 5 min for the first 300 days a complete description of the equipment used to measure climate variables is found in schmitt et al 2018 to calculate the reference evapotranspiration rates we used the fao penman monteith method zotarelli et al 2010 because of the available weather station data we used the grass reference surface in our calculations because none of the weather stations were installed under trees and because three of the four sites were grassy while the last site ej is characterized by low herbs 2 3 physical properties and site characterization we made hillslope scale and point measurements to describe the physical properties of the studied hillslopes we recorded physical variables at each point for which near surface soil water content was collected as described below digital elevation models available for san cristóbal were insufficient because their resolution was too coarse for this study 20 m from envisat d ozouville et al 2008b so we surveyed the four hillslopes across the 2 m grid via tape and compass measurements fig s1 from the generated 2 m resolution dem we calculated the slopes and upslope accumulation area for each site using arcgis esri 2011 we noted the overlying plant type bramble fern herb grass tree and bare soil at the point at which we inserted the soil water content probe and recorded the presence of trees tree roots or rocky outcrops within 2 m of each measurement point we present maps of the plants at each measurement point for both seasons in figure s2 we used a soil step probe 33 plated step probe with handle ams idaho united states to measure the depth of soil hereafter depth to refusal after measuring the soil water content at each point excavations show that the depth to refusal is the depth to a clay rich horizon or rock and provide an adequate proxy for the depth to which soils are heavily rooted maps of the depth to refusal are presented in fig s3 2 4 soil water content and hydrologic properties during the field seasons we measured the near surface soil water content using a hydrosense ii hs2 cs659 portable soil water content probe 12 cm rods campbell scientific inc utah united states with a support volume the volume of soil over which the soil water content is measured of approximately 460 cm3 the output from the hs2 is electrical period microseconds μs and a conversion is used to calculate volumetric water content volume the period is strongly related to the dielectric permittivity of the material around the probe rods campbell scientific hydrosense ii user guide tropical soils on volcanic parent material can have a range of clay and amorphous material contents that will affect the calibration of soil water content probes noborio 2001 regalado et al 2003 so we noted both period and calculated soil water content we calibrated the hs2 in the laboratory using minimally disturbed soil core samples collected in 130 cm3 metal cylinders in the 2015 wet season we took at least 100 shallow soil moisture measurements within a 20 20 m2 grid to provide adequate spatial coverage on the small hillslopes we made additional measurements down slopes in transects extending from grid lines the dry season campaign in 2016 included the same 100 points measured during the 2015 campaign we measured additional points during both field campaigns that are included in the geospatial analysis we collected measurements over several days at each site during the wet season campaign the weather stations were not yet operational at ej ca and fm but field notes indicate that it rained every day at ej and for one of the six measurement days at ca during the dry season only ej received rain during data collection fig s4 we also measured hydraulic properties of the soils to support the temporal and spatial observations of the soil s volumetric water content to measure the hydraulic properties of the soils on the four hillslopes we used in situ experiments to quantify the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and laboratory analyses to measure bulk density grain size distributions ph and the weight percentage of amorphous material in the soils in the field we measured the sorptivity of water and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity using meter group mini disk infiltrometers mdi with an applied suction of 2 cm for sites ca sm and fm and 0 5 cm for site ej due to slow infiltration across the site we applied the mdi to the soil after clearing the leaf litter and made at least two measurements of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity within 1 m of each other at sm and fm we used the excel macro provided by the manufacturer to calculate the sorptivity and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity we measured the bulk density of the soils using the saran method blake and hartge 1986 to aid in the calibration of the hydrosense ii as well as estimate what the maximum volumetric water content could be we calculated the bulk porosity in samples from the sites using an average particle density value of 2 60 g cm3 the average density of kaolinite gibbsite halloysite and illite all of which are expected to be important components of the soil porosity 1 bulk density particle density in the laboratory we measured grain size distributions from each site by dry sieving the fine earth fraction 2 mm particles on a shaker followed by gravimetric determination to yield the percent of the total weight of the sample with chemical dispersion of clays accomplished using sodium hexametaphosphate soil survey staff 2014 the ph of the mineral soil was measured by combining 5 g of fine earth mixed in 20 ml of distilled water and allowed to equilibrate for at least one hour before allowing the particles to settle and measuring the ph of the supernatant pansu and gautheyrou 2006 naturally occurring amorphous materials in soils are noncrystalline and poorly crystalline material usually composed of compounds of si fe and al that coordinate with free oxides and hydroxides we measured the weight percentage of amorphous material in the bulk soil using the ammonium oxalate extraction method jackson et al 1986 at least once per site because amorphous materials can adsorb water and affect the hydrophobicity of soil 2 5 data processing we analyzed the soil water content and climate time series data using r computing software r core team 2017 to examine relative temporal changes in soil moisture we normalized the measured volumetric water content to the maximum observed values during saturation to calculate relative soil saturations to examine the observations spatially we used semivariogram analysis to calculate the autocorrelation distance across the four sites during each season semivariograms show the autocorrelation over distance across hillslopes and can be used to understand the distributions of soil water western et al 2004 understanding autocorrelation distance at the four sites provides a quantitative metric for the degree of hillslope connectivity which is important to the understanding of runoff generation on the hillslopes we input our gridded data into the geor package in r ribeiro and diggle 2001 to test omnidirectional exponential western et al 2004 and spherical models bi et al 2009 different studies have found that the exponential or spherical models fit data better in different landscape types the exponential model s covariance along the sill asymptotically approaches zero variance while the spherical model s sill represents where the covariance is zero we compared the raw output data from the hs2 period and the calculated soil water content to complete the semivariogram analysis using the different models we tested correlation relationships between soil water content and topographic measures including slope and upslope accumulation area and the depth to refusal we also analyzed the relationship between hillslope averaged variables like bulk density ph fraction of amorphous material unsaturated infiltration rates soil texture and the mean soil moisture and standard deviation of the soil water content for the wet and dry seasons 3 results 3 1 temporal record of soil moisture the temporal record of rainfall soil moisture and evapotranspiration is presented in fig 2 for sites ej ca and fm summary data from the weather stations at all four sites are in table 2 the wet season on san cristóbal usually falls between january and may and the dry season falls between june and december with interannual variability in the beginning and end of the seasons however the beginning of the study fell within the strong 2015 2016 el niño which ended in may june 2016 hu and fedorov 2019 resulting in very wet conditions throughout the first part of the study as shown in fig 2a almost 65 of the precipitation at ej fell between october 2015 and february 2016 during this period the wind was at its most variable and the solar radiation was lower than during dryer parts of the year on the island of santa cruz researchers found that fog can account for approximately 20 of the net precipitation at high elevation sites at comparable elevations to ej pryet et al 2012b because of the configuration of the weather station we did not measure the amount of occult precipitation at ej which means that an important source of water into the hillslope is not considered within the precipitation data within the soil the deepest soil moisture probe 40 cm recorded soil moisture levels that regularly approached saturation the data show that soil moisture decreased more slowly from saturation than the shallow soil moisture the dry period february 2016 until the end of the data record january 2017 had fewer rainstorms and the reference evapotranspiration was higher due to both higher windspeeds and greater solar radiation this corresponds with a decline in the recorded soil moisture through the season with rainstorms resulting in sudden increases in the shallower soil moisture data 10 and 20 cm and much smaller increases in the deep soil moisture data 40 cm ca fig 2b located on the drier leeward side of the island receives precipitation from large convective storms rather than the fog that characterizes the dry season at ej in calculating the reference et for site ca the solar radiation term of et was consistent across the year but the wind term was highly variable and was the dominant control of the calculated reference evapotranspiration for the site the data recorded by the soil moisture probes at ca show that the deepest soil moisture probe 30 cm most often approached saturation and the 20 cm deep probe was only slightly drier the shallow probe 10 cm recorded the greatest percent change in measured soil water content after precipitation events compared to the deeper soil probes and also indicated that the soil dried most quickly near the surface at the low elevation windward site fm the average reference et remained around 2 40 mm day throughout the seasons in part because the windspeed remained consistent throughout the seasons changes in the daily reference et are due to changes in radiation fluxes the soil moisture data show that the shallowest soil moisture probe 10 cm recorded the highest saturation across the study period while the two deeper soil moisture probes 20 and 30 cm had similar saturation values recorded through time at all of the sites the temporal soil moisture record reflects different responses to precipitation events for example at ej fig 3 a the surface soil moisture probe at 10 cm showed a daily decline in the percent saturation until a large event at which point the record reflects an increase to 100 saturation the 10 and 20 cm probes first responded to the storm event at the same time however the 20 cm deep probe did not record as steep of a rate in the increase of saturation the 40 cm probe had the highest percent saturation prior to the storm event and did not respond to the storm event until hours after the surface soil probes several days after the precipitation event the 40 cm deep probe reached saturation during smaller precipitation events while the 10 and 20 cm soils had lower percent saturation values fig 3b shows the response in percent saturation at ca to two storm events the first storm event resulted in a nearly simultaneous increase in the percent saturation at all three probe depths within 30 min after the start of the event indicative of preferential flow in the surface soil which may be an important mechanism at this site the second storm event was recorded by all three soil probes simultaneously within the same 15 minute measurement period at ca the surface soil dried most quickly at fm fig 3c the 10 cm deep probe recorded the highest percent saturation throughout the considered time period while the 20 and 30 cm deep probes recorded very similar percent saturations the shallowest probe recorded an increase in the percent saturation approximately 50 min before the 20 and 30 cm root zone probes began to record an increase in the percent saturation the second smaller event did not affect the 30 cm deep probe and only marginally increased the percent saturation for the 20 cm deep probe but resulted in a 3 increase in the percent saturation for the surface probe from 92 saturation to 94 8 saturation 3 2 spatial soil water patterns and statistics the number of sampling points and summary statistics of the spatial soil water survey measurements table 3 show that the mean maximum and minimum measured values of soil water content during the wet seasons are not surprisingly higher than during the dry season the standard deviation and coefficient of variation a measure of the relative variability of the soil water content are higher for the dry period than they are for the wet period at all four sites while changes in soil water between field seasons are associated with the precipitation the cross site relationship between site wide precipitation and mean soil water content is not linear likely because of differences in physical properties of soils at the sites for example despite its location in the very humid highlands and the highest annual precipitation record ej has the lowest mean of spatial soil water content for the wet season and the second highest mean of spatial soil water content for the dry season ca s mean of spatial soil water content is the second highest during the wet season but has a low mean of spatial soil water content during the dry season sm and fm display similar means of spatial soil water values during the wet season but because sm is on the leeward side of the island and fm is on the windward side the mean of the spatial soil water content during the dry season is higher at fm than sm there are no easily discernible spatial patterns in the distribution of near surface soil moisture across the hillslopes fig 4 at ej the most humid site neither of the spatial surveys show a relationship between soil moisture distribution and topography across the hillslope although the lower portion of the slope for the dry season was slightly wetter than the upper portion of the slope collected the day before because of a rainstorm that occurred on the day we made the measurements on the low slope segment supplementary fig 4 any possible pattern present at ca is difficult to identify because of the rock faces and thin soils that dominate the middle of the hillslope at this site in the areas with spatially continuous data soil moisture increased slightly in the middle of the saddle at the top of the hill at ca at a point with the greatest convergence at the study site for sm the distribution of soil moisture appears random during both the wet and dry season although less data were collected during the wet season the noticeably wet area at sm during the wet season occurred where taller trees and thick herbs shaded the ground at fm the distribution of soil moisture appears random during both the wet and dry seasons the distribution of the soil water content data varies from site to site with the shapiro wilk test of normality indicating that none of the sites soil water content distributions are normal previous authors used the gamma distribution e g kaiser and mcglynn 2018 to describe the probability distribution of data because it resembles the positive skewness often observed with soil pore size distributions tuller and or 2005 and it has been experimentally tested in a variety of catchments e g mcguire et al 2005 we examined histograms of the soil water content for each site and applied gamma distributions fig 5 for all but fm the dry season s distributions are positively skewed while for all of the sites the wet season s distributions are negatively skewed other studies note that negative skewness is observed when the bounded function approaches the upper bound of porosity and the soil water content has reached saturation kaiser and mcglynn 2018 western et al 2002 whereas positive skewness corresponds to the soil water content approaching the wilting point we tested the temporal stability of the soil moisture spatial distributions by ranking the soil moisture values and comparing the ranks of the points that we measured during both seasons across the four sites there was no temporal stability in the spatial distribution of soil moisture however it is crucial to note that other studies that have observed temporal stability of soil moisture distribution patterns incorporated significantly more time points including studies that collected soil moisture data over years dari et al 2019 gao et al 2019 starks et al 2006 western et al 1999 additional interpretations of the temporal stability of soil moisture distributions across our hillslopes would require additional spatial surveys of the slopes to capture not just wet and dry seasons but the transition between the seasons 3 3 geostatistical analysis we used semivariogram analysis at each site to evaluate spatial correlations between measured soil moisture we made the models of semivariance using the directly measured period μs rather than the calculated soil water content because the hydrosense ii does not report volumetric water content values above 52 2 due to internal calibration within the sensor while the measured period is reported from the sensor for every point the soil s electrical response is affected by soil moisture but also by the clay content organic material content and soil salinity topp et al 1980 while the use of period rather than volumetric water content affected the autocorrelation distances calculated with the semivariogram analysis this introduced less error into the interpretations of the results because of greater spatial coverage across the hillslopes we tested a range of input values for the nugget the partial sill and the range parameter selected based on the measured data for each model semivariogram and reported the model with the lowest sum of squares fit the values used for each of the best fit models are in table 4 the spherical model type provided a lower sum of squares fit than does the exponential model for all but four of the models for three models ca during the dry season and fm during the wet and dry seasons the type of model did not affect the sum of squares fit and is listed as sph exp for sm during the dry season the exponential model had a lower sum of squares fit we also tested whether the model required a nugget for all of the models setting a nugget provided a better model fit than reducing the nugget to zero beyond the presence of a nugget the semivariogram models lines show no consistent trends in autocorrelation related to either season or site wetness and do not fit the calculated semivariance of the measured data well fig 6 in the wet season right panel the wet sites semivariance does not reach a plateau suggesting that the autocorrelation distance is longer than the measured length of the hillslopes for the dry season left panel the models of the semivariance lines fail to capture the calculated semivariance at ca and fm because there is no spatial correlation across the hillslopes 3 4 soil hydrologic properties the results of the mdi experiments measured over the course of one day at each site show that the soils sorptivity and measured unsaturated hydraulic conductivity hereafter k unsat were heterogeneous during both wet and dry field seasons we report both values in table 5 because the sorptivity which represents a soil s ability to draw water stewart et al 2013 does not depend upon the soil wetness when measured unlike unsaturated hydraulic conductivity measurements because the mdi experiments are completed over very small areas the diameter of the steel disk applied to the soil surface is 4 5 cm this heterogeneity is expected but even in settings with massive spatial variability in hydraulic conductivity enough measurements with a mini disk can be used to provide useful estimates of effective infiltration capacity at the catchment scale mcguire et al 2018 regardless of the mean soil water content for each hillslope the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity did not exhibit patterns based on the distance downslope from the datum at each site suggesting that shallow soil water was not accumulating downslope we measured the soil saturation at each point prior to running the mdi experiments and saw no relationship between shallow soil saturation the soil sorptivity and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity other hydrologic properties at the four sites including bulk density and calculated porosity grain size distributions ph and the weight percentage of amorphous material are reported along with the results of the mdi experiments in table 5 because we made all of the soil moisture measurements in the upper soil layer only topsoil 0 15 cm samples from the o or ah horizons lasso and espinosa 2018 properties are included during the dry field season we collected surface bulk density samples at the same location we made the mdi measurements at fm and ej however there is no apparent relationship between the two properties the other measured hydrologic properties at fm and ej have no correlation with the mdi measured k unsat values at fm and ej we compared the k unsat data to the intensity of rainfall during the field seasons for all of the sites fig 7 at all of the sites the range of measured unsaturated hydraulic conductivity spanned orders of magnitude the smallest values measured for the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at each site are within the same order of magnitude of rainfall intensity table 5 while the largest values are much higher than the measured rainfall intensity however because we avoided obvious macropores observed at sitio mirador the only site at which surficial expression of the presence of macropores was clear and adjusted the suction for the mdi to exclude macropore flow the calculated k unsat values only apply to the soil matrix because we did not account for macropore flow in our measurements of k unsat the precipitation and k unsat values may not overlap at all if macropore flow is important and rapid infiltration through macropores dominates infiltration additionally we calculated the rainfall intensities from the total precipitation collected in a tipping bucket rain gauge and integrated over the data logger s recording time 5 15 min likely some of the instantaneous rainfall intensities were slightly higher than the values integrated over the relatively short measurement periods while in the field we excavated soil pits across the hillslopes at ej we observed water exfiltrating along the o and a horizon boundary in the profile wall between 8 and 15 cm deep across the entire hillslope when there was heavy rain every day during the wet season one day during the dry season at ca we observed water moving along a boundary between less clay rich and clay rich layers only during the wet season at sm and fm we did not observe water exfiltration from the exposed face of the soil pits although numerous studies indicate that saprolite that underlies many tropical sites may have bimodal pore size distributions navarre sitchler et al 2013 we observed no evidence of such a distribution within the saprolites from the soil pits 4 discussion 4 1 do the soil water saturation states differ seasonally at the three study sites with temporally continuous records of soil saturation ej ca and fm we observed changes in the percent saturation for all depths between the wet season and the dry season table 6 this shift in the seasonal percent saturation was unsurprisingly supported by changes in the mean soil saturation measured by the two areal studies ej had one rain event during the dry season for which there are both temporal and spatial data over the course of the event the soil water saturation of the areal study increased by a percent change of 18 5 and the soil water saturation measured by the weather station increased by a percent change of 20 3 with additional spatial surveys and in situ soil moisture probes determining if the weather stations provide a representative measurement of the change in the percent saturation would be possible because this study fell during an el niño the seasonal changes that we described represent extreme cases of wet and dry the highest intensity and amount of precipitation measured at ej corresponds to the record of the greatest saturation of soils at all depths when rainfall declined during the dry season the calculated reference evapotranspiration was higher and more variable reflecting an increase in solar radiation and windspeed el niño usually results in more convective rainfall and less fog in the galápagos trueman and d ozouville 2010 so it is possible that during non el niño years the soils at ej do not dry as much as they did during our study period which occurred during an intense el niño year at ca the rainy periods corresponded to the highest measured soil saturation while the reference evapotranspiration was variable throughout the year reflecting the site s leeward position and the fact that it receives less consistent rainfall and fog during dry seasons compared to the windward sites because island wide convective storms are more common during el niño years the high soil saturation observed during this study at ca may be uncharacteristic of the site fm also has a distinct rainy and dry season although it received more dry season precipitation than the leeward ca higher soil saturation was associated with the rainy seasons but the reference evapotranspiration stayed consistent throughout the year reflecting the fact that the site receives less precipitation than ej but more than ca we examined the change in variance in the temporal soil water content record and observed shifts through time the sites showed different relationships between the saturation state and the variance with higher measured variance during the dry season at ej and lower variance during the dry season at ca the variance around the mean percent saturation at fm remains nearly the same for both seasons many authors have observed that the highest variance in soil moisture is associated with mid range mean soil moisture measurements in near surface soils choi et al 2007 famiglietti et al 2008 although researchers have also noted that variance can both increase or decrease with changes in the mean soil moisture pan and peters lidard 2008 for example at a temperate site in virginia usa it was noted that the lowest variance around mean soil moisture is associated with extreme wet and dry periods lawrence and hornberger 2007 the authors determined that during dry periods the variance is controlled by the wilting point of plants during temperate periods the variance is dictated by the hydraulic conductivity of soils and during wet periods the variance is controlled by the soil porosity in the case where authors working in sodic soils observed that while the highest variance was associated with mid range soil moisture measurements at depths below 20 cm they still observed that the shallowest soil moisture measurements 0 6 cm exhibited the highest variance associated with the extreme wet and dry soil moisture periods peterson et al 2019 additionally their observation of high variance associated with extreme wet and dry values in deeper soils is likely the result of the chemical properties of the soils affecting the conductivity of clay pans at depths greater than 20 cm the depth to the point of refusal which is generally the depth to a clay rich horizon is deeper than the shallowest soil moisture probe at each weather station and the chemistry of the soils do not display sodic characteristics percy 2020 so we assume that the sites variance decreases as conditions approach extreme wet and dry conditions to this end we compared the wet and dry seasons to understand what possible factors may affect the percent saturation at the sites using lawrence and hornberger s 2007 drivers of variance for different saturation states at ej we observed a shift between the wet and dry seasons from lower to higher variance suggesting a possible shift from the control of soil saturation by maximum soil porosity to the control of the soil saturation by hydraulic conductivity and other hydrologic properties ej s surface soil remained more saturated than any of the other sites throughout the year table 2 resulting in the plants on the planar hillslope unlikely to demonstrate water stress during any part of the study period conversely the variance in ca declined between the wet and the dry periods suggesting that ca shifted from a state where soil saturation was controlled by hydrologic factors to a point where the plants wilting points were being reached field observations of dried grasses and herbs support this hypothesis although matric pressure was not measured so this hypothesis cannot be further tested the lack of a statistically significant change in the variance at fm led us to conclude that there was not a major shift in what factors are controlling the soil saturation at this site conversely it is possible that the control of the saturation of soils at fm had shifted from porosity to the wilting point of plants but we find this to be unlikely based on field observations at fm during the dry season when grasses and herbs were still green and because the deeper probes rarely recorded full saturation values further field campaigns would benefit from a longer temporal record and the installation of additional in situ soil moisture probes to account for variable changes in the percent saturation across the sites 4 2 do the spatial patterns of near surface soil water shift seasonally with the spatial surveys of soil moisture we intended to test whether observable differences in the spatial patterns of near surface soil moisture 12 cm across the hillslopes are based on the season our findings indicate that the heterogeneity of soil water across the hillslopes remained high during both wet and dry seasons but based on only two spatial surveys determining the temporal stability of the heterogeneity is not yet possible the semivariogram analysis indicates that the autocorrelation distance was longer than the length of the studied hillslopes the lack of spatial autocorrelation on our measured scales may reflect the size of the hillslopes their planar morphology or the heterogeneity of soil properties across the hillslopes we used simple regressions to test whether topography depth to refusal or slope could be used to predict the percent saturation but no relationship was observed between any of these variables and the spatial soil moisture measurements we used wilcoxan signed rank tests to test whether plant type led to distinguishable differences in percent saturation but differences between plant types were not statistically significant at any of the sites this suggests that at the scales of the plots in which we worked a combination of these variables affects the surface soil moisture in addition to the microclimatic conditions associated with each measurement point previous studies noted that plot scale variability in soil moisture can be very high when compared to landscape scale variability kaiser and mcglynn 2018 because this study was limited to the hillslopes at which weather stations were installed we did not measure catchment scale variability in soil water content we noted from the temporal soil moisture record that ej s variance in percent saturation was higher in the dry season than in the wet season while ca s variance was lower in the dry season than in the wet season and fm s variance was the same throughout the seasons section 4 1 however the variance from the spatial soil moisture measurements from the seasonal surveys was consistently higher during the dry season compared to the wet season although the temporal and spatial variance are not directly comparable because of the nature of the study design the dry season s higher spatial variance may be due to surface soils drying and approaching wilting points reasons why the spatial patterns of soil water remained highly heterogeneous throughout both seasons are numerous despite differences in stochastic variables like precipitation and evapotranspiration previous work completed across a much larger catchment at tarrawarra victoria australia noted a change in the heterogeneity of spatial soil moisture observations between the wet and dry season with soil water content increasing in the convergent portions of the catchment during wet periods western and grayson 1998 2000 the planar nature of the studied hillslopes coupled with their small size make it unlikely that we captured sufficient data in convergent areas where flowlines meet possibly explaining the lack of recorded seasonal reorganization of soil water additionally the interpretation of the spatial distribution of soil water is convoluted by the fact that each site s soil water survey took several days to complete the weather stations were installed after we completed the spatial surveys in the wet season so we are unable to show the change in soil water content through time for the first spatial survey however we can show how the soil moisture changed during the dry season over the course of the surveys fig s4 at fm and ca the weather station recorded a mean value of volumetric water content of 29 7 and 25 4 respectively with a standard deviation of 0 2 over the time period during which we collected spatial data however a rainstorm at ej on one of our measurement days caused the soil water content to rise and the resulting standard deviation of the soil water measured at the weather station during the four days of the spatial survey is an order of magnitude higher at ej 2 3 compared to fm and ca further surveys of spatial distributions of soil water will benefit from single day collection which was not possible with the limited resources and narrow scope of this project 4 3 do spatial patterns of soil water affect runoff generation despite intense rainfall at all of the sites during the rainy season we did not observe evidence of connected surface runoff across the studied hillslopes at ej sm and fm including little evidence of gully formation at the agricultural sites or bottom slope wetness the only runoff that we observed was at ca along a cow trail and then only when the trail passed beneath a basalt bluff based on the spatial distribution of soil moisture across the hillslopes and the semivariogram analyses of the spatial distributions we propose that the lack of runoff at the four sites is due to low spatial connectivity across each hillslope and variable responses to wetting and drying at different depths of the soil coupled with generally high hydraulic conductivity in surface soils the low spatial connectivity of the surface soil water identified using semivariogram analysis affected runoff because the amount of water in soils varied spatially from the temporal record of soil water content we noted variable responses to wetting and drying between the surface soil probes 10 cm and the deeper soil moisture measurements made within the root zone the delays between the arrival of water at the surface soil probe and the deeper probes suggest vertical infiltration is largely matrix flow dominated we also observed a large range of sorptivity and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity fig 7 table 5 the range of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivities table 5 suggests that some parts of the hillslopes were more conductive than others from the mdi experiments we know these areas may be very close to one another within 1 m incorporating the observations of spatial and vertical heterogeneity we propose two possible explanations for the lack of runoff observed at the sites the first is that highly permeable unsealed surface material distributed across the hillslopes allows water to vertically infiltrate into the soil column previous authors modeling arid and semiarid catchments found that the sealing status of the shallowest portions of a soil profile were a more important factor in generating runoff than spatial heterogeneity assouline and mualem 2006 they showed that simulations of catchments with no surface seal formation generated little cumulative runoff however this explanation does not fit our observations as we did not observe soil sealing on any of the hillslopes and the hydrologic properties and soil water distributions are highly heterogeneous at each site instead of uniform highly permeable soil surfaces we suggest that surface soil that becomes saturated simply becomes a source of soil water to adjacent soil that is less saturated and can accommodate the excess water by serving as a sink the high variability in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity provides further evidence that intense precipitation does not saturate a soil and start flowing overland because areas with lower soil moisture and higher hydraulic conductivity are nearby and can serve as sinks for excess water this supports the hypothesis of more transmissive and retentive parts of the hillslopes that prevent the accumulation of observable and measurable overland flow across hillslopes thus any patches of runoff are not connected with another downslope and limit the occurrence and impacts of overland flow transmissive soils conduct water more easily when wet higher hydraulic conductivities while retentive soils conduct water poorly when wet lower hydraulic conductivities but can retain soil moisture for longer periods of time high intensity rainfall may produce localized runoff from retentive soils that infiltrates into adjacent parcels of more transmissive soil nimmo et al 2009 on san cristóbal this model may explain the lack of runoff on the planar hillslopes because of the high heterogeneity in hillslope scale characteristics like soil texture and the amount of amorphous material both of which affect hydraulic conductivity parcels of transmissive and retentive soils may be adjacent to each other the lack of autocorrelation across small distances less than 100 m on the hillslopes provides support for this model of a patchwork of transmissive and retentive soils runoff generation at temperate sites may depend on whether lateral or vertical flow paths are dominant along the hillslopes where the presence of lateral flow paths depends on the morphology of the landscape elsenbeer 2001 fitzjohn et al 1998 for our study none of the studied slopes featured gullies or other areas of high convergence fig s1 so it is unlikely that large amounts of surface lateral flow were driven by hillslope morphology at ca the uppermost portion of the site was saddle shaped and crisscrossed by cow paths soil water may have accumulated due to lateral flow in the slightly convergent portion of the saddle fig 4 but the remainder of the data from the spatial survey at the site demonstrated no similar accumulation most soil water evaporates directly from the soil surface is used by plants or infiltrates vertically until the water reaches an aquitard and begins to flow laterally in excavated soil pits during the wet season we observed water seeping out of the upslope walls along the horizon boundaries supporting lateral redistribution of water at depth at ca also a water meadow at the base of a nearby hillslope wetted after small rain events despite no evidence of runoff along the hillslope supporting the idea that water may be laterally redistributed deeper within the soil our hypothesis to explain the lack of observed surface runoff on the hillslopes corroborates work completed on other tropical ocean islands on the island of santa cruz galápagos to the west of san cristóbal soil profiles were instrumented with tensiometers to measure the pressure head within soil profiles under two different land cover types forest pasture domínguez et al 2016 those data were then incorporated into a soil water transfer model which showed that runoff was negligible because the soil water input never exceeded the infiltration capacity of the soils as we observed at the sites on san cristóbal based on the model deep percolation into the groundwater system occurred in both land use regimes suggesting that vertical flow paths through the soil results in groundwater recharge previous work on hawaii observed a similar phenomenon the surface soil had little connectivity resulting in negligible runoff but after vertical infiltration lateral redistribution of soil water was observed at horizon boundaries due to the change in the hydraulic conductivity between different horizons lohse and dietrich 2005 future work on san cristóbal should include the measurement of hydraulic conductivity across broader areas and in different horizons to better characterize spatial variations in conductivity that control runoff and groundwater recharge 4 4 soil water and island wide hydrogeology previous work on the hydrogeology of san cristóbal has related the island s groundwater system to that of hawaii violette et al 2014 consecutive lava flows separated by baked paleosols or tuffs have led to a complicated groundwater system of perched aquifers some of which drain to a basalt aquifer and some that result in springs this is similar to the hydrogeology of many other basalt systems including continental basalts like those found on the snake river plain mirus et al 2011 and other ocean islands like piton de la fournaise on la reúnion violette et al 1997 san cristóbal is the only island in the archipelago with multiple perennial streams maintained by springs that drain the perched aquifers this understanding has come through geophysical adelinet et al 2018 auken et al 2009 pryet et al 2012a and geochemical warrier et al 2012 observations little research has previously connected inputs into the island s hydrologic system with the groundwater system from this study we propose that water that has been transmitted through the soil s root zone and into the deeper horizons of the soil will either flow laterally along horizons of low hydraulic conductivity resulting in high soil water contents and seeps that emerge in areas of convergence like the water meadow at the base of ca or will infiltrate further through the unconsolidated saprolite to enter the deeper groundwater system due to the lack of monitoring wells on san cristóbal exact determination of the amount of infiltrated water that enters the groundwater system is unknown but the research on the behavior of surface and root zone soil water helps provide an important step in further understanding water cycling on san cristóbal this study is far from comprehensive but the data provide ample opportunities for further testing of conceptual and numerical models of hillslope hydrologic response on san cristóbal and similar tropical island settings additional efforts must also be made to improve instrumentation of hillslopes in diverse climates across san cristóbal to track how seasonality affects the distribution and behavior of soil water 5 conclusions we have compared the temporal and spatial records of soil water on four planar hillslopes on san cristóbal galápagos to develop a qualitative model of water in near surface soils in different climate zones this work aims to provide a component of our understanding of the hydrogeology of san cristóbal and possibly other ocean islands we initially sought to answer three questions 1 does soil water differ seasonally 2 does the spatial distribution of soil water differ through time and 3 could spatial patterns of soil water affect runoff generation the findings of this study confirm that temporal differences in saturation states on the studied hillslopes are driven by seasonal differences in precipitation and evapotranspiration and the position of the hillslopes on san cristóbal s climosequence and their windward leeward position thus our dataset is a valuable resource for future hydrologic and soil atmosphere modeling efforts we complemented the temporal differences in saturation state with surveys of the spatial variability of the soil water across the studied hillslopes showing that during both wet and dry seasons the soil water content was highly variable spatially and randomly distributed across the hillslope this spatial variability is likely the result of the heterogeneity of a number of factors including physical and hydrologic characteristics of the soil and the microclimate and microtopography around each of the measurement points while in the field we did not observe evidence of runoff at most of the sites except along the cow path at ca despite numerous heavy rain events because near surface soil moisture was not spatially connected and the hydraulic conductivity is higher than rainfall intensity we conclude that retentive patches of soil which can generate runoff are adjacent to transmissive patches of soil transmissive soils have higher hydraulic conductivities and can transmit potential runoff into deeper horizons of the soil system this may explain observations that uncultivated hillslopes on san cristóbal have little surface runoff connectivity as well as explaining how water enters the shallow groundwater system that is drained by numerous springs fieldwork in the galápagos remains challenging and our measurement and monitoring campaigns were restricted by access and resources our results confirm what might be presumed based on initial site assessments and field trips namely that seasonal changes in precipitation and elevation dependent precipitation inputs affect the soil saturation across the sites however our study provides concrete evidence to support the conceptual model for hillslope hydrology on san cristóbal these baseline data can be expanded to improve our understanding of the behavior of water through the surface soil across san cristóbal s climate gradient additional fieldwork on the hillslopes can capture the spatial distribution of soil water across the hillslopes with different precipitation inputs to accurately model the temporal stability of soil moisture distributions the installation of more research infrastructure especially piezometers and additional soil water probes at different points across the currently instrumented sites will yield valuable information to help track the fate of soil water that infiltrates beneath the clay layer at each site testing soil water models using the data presented in this paper can also facilitate improved quantitative understanding of factors affecting the distribution of soil water across the hillslopes as well as predict the fate of the soil water through the water cycle on the island acknowledgments this work was supported by a nsf graduate research fellowship grant dge 1650116 a

8337,study region the karst system of the syemareh dam site with the reservoir capacity of 3 2 b m 3 located in the zagros fold belt southwestern of iran was studied under two conditions before and after the reservoir impoundment as pre reservoir and post reservoir conditions respectively study focus despite a mixing of several water resources including the dam reservoir contributed to the flow rate of the downstream springs the number of end members was still unknown and their mixing ratio was unquantified in this study firstly a statistical approach e g loading plot and matrix plot was utilized to identify possible chemical reactions then end member mixing analysis emma was used to determine the number of end members lastly the mix code was utilized to quantify the mixing ratios three scenarios i e assuming three four and five end members were compared to find a reliable mixing model based on the best match between the observed and estimated values of species concentration in order to improve the calibration of the reliable mixing model the species concentrations were corrected by deduction of the effect of plausible chemical reactions new hydrological insights for the region the five end members mixing model consisted of three aquifers deep groundwater and the reservoir was suggested as the dominant mixing process leakage from the reservoir as an end member was

12 of the earth s continental area hartmann et al 2014 in particular 11 of iran s land surface covered by karst limestone raeisi and kowsar 1997 large fractures and conduits are the main pathways of groundwater flow in karst aquifers which cause rapid response to hydrological stresses such as heavy rainfall events and impoundment of dam reservoirs in addition man made stresses such as elevated water pressure by a dam reservoir provides favorable conditions for leakage through karst features which potentially change the hydrogeological setting of the downstream aquifers mohammadi et al 2007a b battaglia et al 2016 behrouj et al 2018 milanovic 2018 increasing discharge at downstream springs and groundwater level as well as variations of hydrochemical composition contreras and hernandez 2013 are indications of leakage and probably mixing of dam reservoir water with surrounding aquifers leakage from dam sites has been reported in numerous dams in karst areas over the world see for example milanovic 2018 a few conventional methods such as geophysical and tracer tests boleve et al 2011 a combination of geological and hydrogeological techniques kamble et al 2014 and numerical modeling cheshomi et al 2014 were utilized to evaluate the leakage amount through dam sites however no studies have applied mixing modeling to calculate the reservoir leakage in order to quantify the contribution i e mixing ratio of a dam reservoir in the surrounding aquifers mixing modeling is a potential approach although mixing models have not been particularly used to assess the leakage from a dam site they have been implemented to determine the age distribution of groundwater jurgens et al 2014 to assess the mechanisms that control stream water chemistry katsuyama et al 2001 to quantify the chemical processes that affect the organic pollutants in an urban aquifer jurado et al 2015 to locate the water inrush in mining industry gu et al 2017 and to quantify the proportion of different water sources in mining scheiber et al 2018 amongst others mixing process defines interaction between two or more sources of water as end members calculation of mixing ratio usually consists of several steps which mainly start by distinguishing end members followed by mixing modeling end member mixing analysis emma has been widely used to identify the number of end members hooper et al 1990 christophersen et al 1990 hooper 2003 vázquez suñé et al 2010 tubau et al 2014 pelizardi et al 2017 emma utilizes principle component analysis pca as a multivariate statistical method to find the minimum number of end members christophersen and hooper 1992 mohammadi 2009 valder et al 2012 chen et al 2014 sun and gui 2015 following the delineation of end members a mixing model implemented to quantify the mixing ratios conventional mixing models are handled based on some common approaches such as linear mixing and least square the linear mixing model of n end members considering continuity and solute and water mass balance assumes linear contribution of the end members to the mixed samples based on the following equations carrera et al 2004 1 x 1 q 1 x 2 q 2 x n q n y o q o 2 q 1 q 2 q n q o where x 1 to x n are the concentrations of inflow waters i e end members q 1 to q n are the corresponding rates y o is the concentration of outflow water i e mixed water and q o is its rate by dividing 1 and 2 by q o and defining δ as the mixing ratio 3 x 1 δ 1 x 2 δ 2 x n δ n y o 4 i 1 i n δ i 1 on the other hand the following equation was introduced for computation of mixing ratio based on least squares and is a general form of eq 1 carrera et al 2004 5 y p s e 1 n e δ p s x e s ε p s where y p s and x e s are the concentrations of species s in sample p and end member e respectively δ p s is the mixing ratio of end member e in mixture p and ε p s is an error which might arise from measurements the aforementioned methods assume that the composition of end members despite reality is well known joerin et al 2002 applied monte carlo analysis to specify the uncertainty of a three end member mixing model rueedi et al 2005 has presented a statistical multi parameter procedure to calculate mixing ratios and their uncertainties using a set of chemical and isotopic parameters carrera et al 2004 has presented an algorithm to quantify the mixing ratios using a maximum likelihood method considering this fact that the composition of end members is not well known the following likelihood equation has to be maximized 6 l p e x p 1 2 y p f δ p t a p 1 y p f δ p subject to δ p t l n e 1 where δ p is the vector of mixing ratios l n e is a one dimensional vector of l s y p is the vector of all species measured in the pth sample a p is covariance matrix of them and f x e s is a matrix of all chemical analyses of end members the algorithm has been named the mix code and applied in several studies vázquez suñé et al 2010 tubau et al 2014 jurado et al 2015 scheiber et al 2018 to run mixing models geochemical tracers can be used to quantify mixing ratios crandall et al 1999 in a two end members mixing model the proportion of the two unmixed sites in the mixed site is easy to be calculated by measuring the concentration of a conservative ion e g cl of the two unmixed sites and of the mixed site using linear mixing or least square approaches however mixing modeling for calculating groundwater mixing ratio in three or more end members needs more data and modeling efforts for example δ18o and cl values can be used to identify mixing patterns gu et al 2017 douglas et al 2000 has used chemical characteristics and isotopic content of water i e relation between cl and δ 18 o to distinguish groundwater types and to compute mixing ratios despite the wide application of geochemical tracers in mixing modeling chemical reactions are usually the cause of changes in the geochemistry of groundwater that might induce uncertainty calculating mixing ratios in order to overcome this uncertainty source the conservative tracers which are not being affected by chemical reactions can be used to improve mixing models nakaya et al 2007 long and valder 2011 the rate of mixing which can be defined by how different end members contribute controls the amount of reactants resulting in products de simoni et al 2007 a mixing line drawn between two end members can be used to determine whether groundwater has been enriched or depleted with regard to a certain ion based on the situation of the sample related to the mixing line ravenscroft and mcarthur 2004 in addition the deviation from this line can be marked to identify geochemical processes tubau et al 2014 in this research mixing modeling is implemented in a unique case study where hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics of the aquifers have been changed due to effects of a new end member i e a dam reservoir named seymareh two hydrogeological conditions including pre reservoir i e before construction of the dam and post reservoir i e after construction of the dam conditions are considered recent studies including dye tracing tests at the seymareh dam site revealed leakage from the reservoir towards the downstream springs behrouj et al 2018 however the amount of leakage was unknown in the downstream springs this study attempts to 1 compare the hydrogeological and hydrochemical characteristics of a karst aquifer under pre reservoir and post reservoir conditions 2 estimate the mixing ratio under different hydrogeological conditions and 3 evaluate mixing modeling as a practical method to estimate leakage amount based on mixing ratio 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area including ravandi anticline is located in the southwestern part of the folded zagros mountains fig 1 geologically three formations exposed in the study area are in the order of age bakhtiari late pliocene gachsaran early miocene and asmari oligocene miocene bakhtiari formation bk which is mainly comprised of conglomerate is the youngest formation and covers some parts of the ravandi anticline gachsaran formation gs which mainly consists of gypsum and halite fills the syncline and lies on the top of asmari formation the main formation of the ravandi anticline is the asmari formation as which comprised of limestone behrouj et al 2018 the seymareh river at the elevation of 603 masl meters above sea level crosses the ravandi anticline and provides a tight gorge for construction of the seymareh dam the dam has been constructed on the northern flank of the ravandi anticline fig 1 the reservoir was impounded from 2009 to 2011 the reservoir water level has a measured elevation of 680 masl that has changed the hydrogeological conditions of the study area e g groundwater velocity hydraulic gradient and mixing processes two main aquifers including the ghachsaran formation gfa and the ravandi anticline were identified based on the characteristics of the water resources and outcrops of the gachsaran and asmari formations behrouj 2018 gfa is in the northeastern part of the study area two permanent springs namely gsp1 and gsp2 with a flow rate of less than 10 l s discharged gfa in pre reservoir condition fig 1b the direction of groundwater flow in this aquifer is towards the left ravandi aquifer lra based on water balance calculations bagheri et al 2006 no springs were observed from this aquifer after reservoir impoundment the ravandi anticline is divided in two sub aquifers namely right ravandi aquifer rra and left ravandi aquifer lra the general groundwater flow direction is from both flanks of the ravandi anticline toward the seymareh river under pre reservoir and post reservoir conditions behrouj et al 2018 the minimum and maximum groundwater levels in rra were about 593 up to 597 masl under pre reservoir condition and changed to be in the range of 605 658 masl under post reservoir condition as for the lra the minimum and maximum groundwater levels were 594 597 masl under pre reservoir condition but increased to 603 up to 634 masl under post reservoir condition the base of karstification which can be considered the bottom of the aquifer according to the drilling data is at about 470 masl there are more than 50 springs that discharge at the ravandi anticline from both aquifers situated on the banks of the seymareh river fig 1 lsp24 is the most important spring in terms of flow rate which averages about 432 l s the average hydraulic gradient in the ravandi anticline was computed to be about 0 0005 and 0 015 in before and after the reservoir impoundment respectively consequently the total discharge of the springs has increased from about 2000 l s to 5000 l s from pre reservoir to post reservoir conditions behrouj 2018 availability of hydrochemical isotopic and dye tracing data in 2006 bagheri et al 2006 before impoundment as the pre reservoir condition and in 2015 after impoundment as the post reservoir condition provide sufficient data for differentiating of two distinct hydrogeological conditions in order to compare the hydrogeology of the study area the measured data in july 2006 and july 2015 were selected as representative of the pre reservoir and post reservoir conditions respectively 2 2 sampling and analytical methods in order to compare the hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics of the aquifers gachsaran and ravandi aquifers and delineate the endmembers and mixing ratio two sampling sets before and after construction of the dam were selected sixty sampling points including 46 springs and 14 observation wells were sampled before construction of the dam under pre reservoir conditions in july 2006 supplementary table 1 however the sampling points were increased to 92 including 18 observation wells 9 drainage boreholes and 21 springs from lra and 14 observation wells 8 drainage boreholes and 19 springs from rra after construction of the dam under post reservoir condition in july 2015 supplementary table 2 the reservoir a few observation wells and drainage boreholes in grouting galleries of the dam were sampled in july 2015 only figs 1 and 2 low and lsp are abbreviations of the observation wells and springs related to lra respectively for rra aquifer row and rsp are used to show the observation wells and springs respectively the springs emerge close to the river elevation and their outlet elevation ranges from 595 to 603 masl four galleries numbered from top g1 with an elevation of about 730 masl to bottom g4 with an elevation of about 600 masl were accessible for sampling of groundwater at different depths fig 2 moreover a few boreholes in the foundation of the dam drilled to 470 masl are available for sampling of deep groundwater fig 2 since the bottom elevations of g1 and g2 are above the reservoir water level they are still dry the samples with abbreviations gr3b and gr4b on the right and gl3b and gl4b on the left belong to g3 and g4 respectively the samples taken from the right galleries are in rra and those samples taken from the left galleries are in lra the samples from the dam foundation i e deep groundwater are shown by f major ions c l s o 4 2 h c o 3 k n a c a 2 and m g 2 were analyzed at the hydrochemistry laboratory of shiraz university for all water samples 60 and 92 samples in pre reservoir and post reservoir conditions respectively electrical conductivity ec water acidity ph and temperature were measured simultaneously in situ environmental isotopes e g δ 2 h and δ18o were analyzed in 32 water samples under pre reservoir conditions and 20 water samples under post reservoir conditions at the environmental isotope laboratory university of waterloo canada more details of the analysis are presented in supplementary tables 1 and 2 2 3 mixing calculation the aquifers and the related water resources were studied from a hydrochemical point of view under both pre reservoir and post reservoir conditions in particular matrix and loading plots and piper diagram were constructed to delineate the relationship between the major ions and the most probable chemical reactions matrix plots highlight the most meaningful relationship between different species loading plots show the importance of ions on the first and second components axes first and second components are the linear transformation of a few measured variables into two components consequently it is possible to suggest some sources i e end members that are the reasons for the plausible chemical reactions the elementary number of end members was determined by pca however the number of end members was modified to consider the hydrogeological effect caused by the dam reservoir hydrochemical and isotopic composition of the water samples collected under both pre reservoir and post reservoir conditions were used to make final decisions regarding the end members and develop a reliable conceptual mixing model the mix code carrera et al 2004 is used to calculate the mixing ratio of end members the model attempts to adjust the measured and calculated concentration of conservative species with an acceptable tolerance value defined by user in addition a few studies have already discussed the chemical reactions for miscalculating the mixing ratios tubau et al 2014 jurado et al 2015 the effect of chemical reactions on the mixing model is eliminated by correcting the concentration of species at sampling sites based on the most probable occurring reactions an ion concentration x c which can be subtracted or added to the measured concentration depending on the reaction is defined as 7 x c c 1 q 1 q 2 where c 1 is the initial concentration of a sampling site and q 1 is the corresponding flow rate x c is the expected concentration to be added or subtracted from the same site with final corresponding flow rate q 2 the reliability of the end members can be crosschecked through the calibration process by defining a few reliable scenarios of the end members the mix code is handled for three scenarios including three four and five end members the mixing model is validated for two data sets aug 2014 and sep 2015 finally the validated mixing model is used to estimate the mixing ratio of the reservoir as a measure of leakage from the reservoir 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrochemical characteristics of the samples based on the measurements ca and so4 are the dominant ions in rra and gfa suggesting a calcium sulfate water type na and cl are the dominant ions in lra indicating sodium chloride water type under pre reservoir condition the so4 and ca average concentrations for samples collected under pre reservoir conditions from gfa were 1184 and 433 ppm respectively the average ec of gfa was about 2020 μs cm no sampling sites were accessible in gfa under post reservoir conditions the average ec increased in the lra aquifer from 1743 to 2784 μs cm and in the rra aquifer from 849 to 2049 μs cm under pre reservoir conditions to post reservoir conditions respectively the average ec of the reservoir is 841 μs cm and ca and so4 are the dominant ions the samples from the reservoir show a mean value of 305 and 137 ppm for so4 and ca respectively however the mean concentration of so4 and ca in the rra aquifer has increased from 244 and 117 ppm to 345 and 142 ppm from pre reservoir to post reservoir conditions respectively the average concentration of cl and na in the lra aquifer increased from 381 and 191 ppm to 564 and 314 ppm under pre reservoir to post reservoir conditions respectively the average concentration of hco3 in both the lra aquifer and the rra aquifer under pre reservoir condition is about 220 ppm while it is about 205 ppm in gfa under post reservoir condition the average concentration of hco3 is about 190 174 and 168 ppm in the reservoir lra aquifer and rra aquifer respectively samples from the dam foundation abbreviated as f in fig 2 which has a depth of about 470 masl are characterized with an ec of about 974 μs cm and is a na cl water type a unique aspect of the dam foundation samples is having k concentration of about 11 ppm which on average is three times higher than that of other samples which might be an indication of a reaction or even a different source of groundwater based on the matrix plots of the anions versus cations the most meaningful relationship is found between cl and na with pearson correlation coefficient of 0 985 and 0 986 indicating the solution of halite under both the pre reservoir and post reservoir conditions respectively fig 3 the relationship between ca variations with so4 is also noticeable with pearson correlation coefficient of 0 975 and 0 98 suggesting the solution of gypsum under both the pre reservoir and post reservoir conditions respectively however there is a meaningful match between mg and so4 with pearson correlation coefficient of 0 81 under post reservoir conditions that was not found under pre reservoir conditions with pearson correlation coefficient of 0 64 dissolution of halite and gypsum are highlighted in the loading plots fig 4 due to the high loading value of na and cl as the first component and ca mg and so4 as the first and second components respectively variations of the loading values of na and cl under pre reservoir and post reservoir conditions suggest increasing halite dissolution under post reservoir conditions 3 2 definition of end members in order to define end members the water samples from two sets of measurements july 2006 and july 2015 have initially been plotted on the piper diagram fig 5 the illustration of the samples on fig 5a from pre reservoir condition reveals that there should be three different groundwater resources including lra rra and gfa before impoundment the samples on fig 5b belong to the post reservoir conditions plus one sample from gfa under pre reservoir conditions for comparison the piper diagram suggests four end members based on the distribution of the sampling sites on the diagram representing post reservoir conditions fig 5b the end members are suggested based on the samples from the deep groundwater dg lra rra and gfa dg is based on the samples from the dam foundations abbreviated as f application of pca helps identify the samples that exhibit extreme concentrations which can be introduced as end members figs 6 and 7 application of pca for data of pre reservoir and post reservoir conditions show that the first two components have eigenvalue more than one but the value of the other components are insignificant for both conditions pca suggests at least three end members from three different aquifers namely lra rra and gfa in the pre reservoir conditions fig 6 for the post reservoir condition it was expected that the number of end members have been increased to four including the dam reservoir however pca shows three end members including lra gfa and dg under the post reservoir conditions and there is no evidence for the reservoir r as an end member fig 7 it seems that the application of the conventional procedure of emma method is unable to differentiate the reliable number of end members due to small differences between the concentration of the species james and roulet 2006 3 2 1 modification of the number of end members in order to improve the applicability of emma variation of the concentration of cl as a conservative ion and stable isotopes of δ 2 h and δ18o in response to variation of the reservoir water level are utilized the variations of the average cl concentration of lra and rra versus the reservoir water level rwl are presented in fig 8 in general the average cl concentration under the post reservoir conditions is greater than that of the pre reservoir conditions fig 8 moreover the average concentration of cl in lra and rra increases with increasing the reservoir water level however the concentration of cl in the reservoir water is less than that of the aquifers alternatively water level in the aquifers and discharge of the springs increased in response to increasing reservoir water level and possible leakage to the lra and rra fig 9 the pearson correlation coefficient between the reservoir water level and the four sampling sites in fig 9 including spr9 rra lsp24 lra row5 rra and low18 lra is 0 85 0 93 0 91 and 0 85 respectively it can be deduced that halite is probably dissolved by the leakage water from the reservoir before recharging to the aquifers figs 3 and 4 average δ 18 o and δ 2 h for the water samples from rra lra and gfa under pre reservoir condition were measured 4 70 and 22 6 5 25 and 26 and 4 29 and 24 respectively under post reservoir condition the average isotopic composition of rra and lra is 4 37 and 22 37 4 38 and 23 2 respectively meanwhile δ 18 o and δ 2 h of the samples from the reservoir measured to be 2 58 and 15 23 respectively the isotopic composition of the rra and lra reveal a degree of enrichment from pre reservoir to post reservoir conditions fig 10 average enrichment of δ 18 o and δ 2 h for the water samples from rra and lra aquifers is 0 33 and 0 23 0 87 and 2 80 respectively moreover the isotopic composition of the samples from rra and lra move closer to gfa under post reservoir conditions fig 10 because of the effect of the reservoir as a high hydraulic force it seems that the spring s water from the lra is partly fed by gfa which cause an enrichment of the isotopic content therefore the discharge of left springs may be a mixture of at least three end members which are lra r and gfa taking the regional groundwater flow direction into account it is likely that r and gfa at least to some extent firstly mixed and then flow toward the springs emerge from lra comparing of isotopic content and concentration of cl under two different hydraulic conditions reveal that the reservoir must be included in the list of end members under post reservoir condition when the differences between concentrations of the major ions are not considerable and a few numbers of the conservative species are available as in this study the reliable number of end members should be identified using simultaneous application of emma and additional using of isotopic hydrochemical and hydrogeological data together 3 3 mixing modeling 3 3 1 conceptual mixing model the mix code was utilized for calculating the mixing ratio of the end members emma was applied with eight measured species i e c l s o 4 2 h c o 3 k n a c a 2 m g 2 and ec the reliable conceptual mixing model is assessed by evolution of considering three four and five end members since the results of emma suggested at least three end members including rra lra and gf in the study area these aquifers were selected as the end members for the mixing modeling of the first scenario in the second scenario four end members including rra lra dg and gfa were selected to run the mixing model the third scenario consisted of five end members rra lra gfa r and dg as the end members the species composition of five possible end members has been shown in table 1 all of the models include 29 sampling sites with the 8 measured species since the eight species characterize the samples and the end members together all of them are used in the models however the effect of applying one fewer species by turn is discussed in section 3 3 4 in order to evaluate the reliability of the scenarios r2 is used as a measure of similarity between the measured and estimated concentration of the species moreover the akaike information criterion aic a rigorous approach for selecting a reliable model which basically prevents both underfitting and overfitting burnham and anderson 2002 was calculated for the mixing models the relationship between the estimated and measured concentrations is assessed initially for the conservative species i e cl then for the rest of the species fig 11 the standard deviation was assumed to be 0 10 for the conservative species i e cl na ec and 0 25 for the rest but when the standard deviation was presumed to be 0 25 for all the species r2 was better which is discussed in details in section 3 3 4 the conceptual mixing model of the five end members was selected as the most reliable model based on the higher value of r2 and lower value of aic discussed in details in section 3 3 2 therefore in the case of the five end members the mass balance equation for a conservative ion c e g cl with an inflow or outflow rate of q in the study site can be written as 8 crqr crraqrra clraqlra cdgqdg cgfaqgfa csqs where r rra lra dg gfa and s are abbreviations for the reservoir right ravandi aquifer left ravandi aquifer deep groundwater gachsaran formation and mixed samples respectively 3 3 2 calibration of the mixing model two mixing models of the five end member scenario were run with and without correction of the plausible chemical reactions based on eq 7 despite r2 was 0 62 0 90 0 95 0 97 0 98 0 99 0 99 and 0 99 for hco3 k ec ca so4 na cl and mg respectively the results of the mixing model without correction of the plausible chemical reactions manifest two issues first the estimated concentration of hco3 exhibited a low correlation with the measured concentrations r2 0 62 through the calibration process secondly in contrast to the results of the dye tracer tests behrouj et al 2018 the mixing model shows no contribution from the reservoir at the springs emerging from lra such as lsp24 moreover the discharge of these springs and concentration of na and cl increased in response to the increasing of the reservoir level fig 8 the mean concentration of cl was measured in the reservoir water 30 ppm to be less than that of the left springs emerging from lra aquifer 575 ppm it seems that halite dissolution is plausible as a result of movement of water from the reservoir to these springs in order to resolve these drawbacks caused by chemical reactions the mixing model has been run after correction of the species concentration by deduction of the effect of the plausible chemical reactions the results of such modified model reveal that the correlation between the measured and estimated concentration for almost all the species is improved specifically for hco3 which its r2 increased from 0 62 to 0 89 the natural logarithm of the residual sum of squares rss using regression model was 14 45 14 46 14 07 and 13 for the three end members four end members five end members mixing model without and with the correction of plausible chemical reactions respectively however aic was 478 493 494 and 457 for the three end members four end members five end members mixing model without and with the correction of plausible chemical reactions respectively since the smallest aic is an indication of the reliable model the mixing model with the correction of the plausible chemical reaction has been selected for calculation of the mixing ratios of the end members recalculations of the end members composition are shown in table 2 the mixing ratio of the end members in the sampling points is presented in fig 12 the ratio of gfa has almost the least ratio in all the sites except in low13 with a ratio of 0 394 since gf is mainly comprised of marl and gypsum it has no significant groundwater storage which contributes in the mixed sampling points the ratio of dg is also low except in a few deep boreholes such as gl3b17 0 953 foundation site 0 837 gr3b23 0 486 and low9 0 407 however rra aquifer extensively contributed in the right observation wells i e rows the mixing ratio of lra aquifer is estimated to be from 0 40 to 0 45 for all the left springs i e springs with abbreviation of lsp in fig 12 the mixing ratio of the reservoir which is in fact the value of leakage has been illustrated the maximum contribution of the reservoir is estimated in the drainage boreholes such as gr4b49 0 89 and gl4b33 0 80 which can be spotted as plausible weak zones in the dam grout curtain moreover the mixing ratio of the reservoir in the springs varies from minimum of 0 40 in rsp1 to maximum of 0 64 in rsp8 the estimated mixing ratio for lsp24 the spring with flow rate of 514 l s reveals about half of discharging water of this spring comes from the reservoir lack of the contribution of the reservoir in gl3b17 which is very close to the dam body shows there are no flow paths from the reservoir toward this sampling point fig 12 the results of the second mixing model i e considering chemical reactions are consistent with the geological setting e g low groundwater storage of gfa hydrogeological data e g different flow system through lra and rra aquifers and the previous dye tracer results e g low and high contribution of the reservoir in gl3b17 and lsp24 respectively behrouj et al 2018 accordingly the five end members mixing model with correction of the chemical reactions is reliable for applying in the different hydrogeological conditions in the study area 3 3 3 validation of the mixing model in order to validate the mixing model five end members with correction of the chemical reactions the measured data in august 2014 and september 2015 are used the effect of reactions is corrected based on eq 7 the results show an acceptable level of correlation between the measured and estimated concentration as r2 in august 2014 and september 2015 for cl and ec is 0 99 0 95 and 0 93 0 88 respectively moreover the mixing ratio of the reservoir in lsp24 is estimated to be 0 55 august 2014 and 0 46 september 2015 which are close to the ratio estimated by the calibrated mixing model for july 2015 0 50 the maximum difference between the calculated reservoir mixing ratios in the three set of modeling august 2014 july 2015 september 2015 for lsp24 is about 26 l s of 514 l s which is not much considering that the discharge of lsp24 can change due to the contribution of the other end members in time 3 3 4 uncertainty of the mixing model the known sources of uncertainty in the mixing model are the chemical reactions the assigned standard deviation sd to the concentration of species and the possibility of different combinations of species used in the mixing model tubau et al 2014 the final validated mixing model five end members with correction of the chemical reactions and lsp24 spring are selected as the reference model and a representative site for assessing the uncertainty of the results of the mixing model respectively the mixing ratios of the end members in lsp24 and r2 are used as the criteria of the models reliability the reference mixing model was run under assigning different values of sd to the species applied sds were the same for all the species except for one with an sd cl na ec 0 1 the rest of the species i e ca mg hco3 so4 k had an sd 0 25 the mixing ratio of the end members in lsp24 is shown in table 3 the r2 for all the models does not differ too much except for hco3 that had low values 0 54 and 0 73 when sd cl na ec 0 1 and sd 0 35 respectively the average flow rate of lsp24 is 432 l s and ranged from 100 to 537 l s when the reservoir water level was 633 and 680 masl respectively it is likely that about half of lsp24 flow rate is fed by the reservoir accordingly if a mixing model estimates the reservoir mixing ratio close to 0 50 at lsp24 spring that mixing model is reliable interestingly the results elucidated that the reservoir mixing ratio estimated close to 0 5 at lsp24 spring only assuming a range of 0 15 to 0 3 for sd hence the other alternatives whether sds more than 0 30 or less than 0 15 should not be used in the mixing model the final validated mixing model was run several times by removing one species in turn the r2 value for all estimated values versus the measured values for all the models was about 0 985 for the model with five end members with correction to the chemical reactions the mixing ratio of the end members in lsp24 has been changed in response to elimination of each species table 4 the results reveal that by removing of cl and mg from the set of species the mixing ratio of the end members in lsp24 is the same as the reference model however by removing the other species the mixing ratio of lsp24 was not consistent with the conceptual model because the mixing ratio of the reservoir in lsp24 was less than 0 10 4 conclusion the mixing process in a karst aquifer is modeled using the mix code under both pre reservoir and post reservoir conditions the hydrogeology and hydrochemistry of the study area were changed due to impoundment of the seymareh reservoir as a constant head boundary with an elevation of 680 masl the conventional statistical approaches i e matrix and loading plots are used to characterize the sampling points applying emma approach showed four end members including the gfa rra lra aquifers and a deep groundwater source having contribution in the discharge of the downstream springs however the comparison of chemical and isotopic content of water samples under pre reservoir and post reservoir conditions proves that the dam reservoir as the fifth end member has a considerable effect on chemical and isotopic contentment of the downstream springs moreover the conceptual model of mixing processes including five end members was selected due to the higher r2 between the measured and estimated concentration of the species and lower aic in comparison to three and four end members the conceptual mixing model is calibrated based on considering or neglecting a few known chemical reactions applying this model it was possible to quantify the leakage of the dam reservoir by calculation of its mixing ratio at different sampling sites and also to detect the weak zones of the grout curtain the reservoir mixing ratio ranged from zero at the sampling sites very close to the dam body to about 0 50 at most springs and 0 80 at some drainage boreholes away from the dam body the calculated ratio for the contribution of the reservoir was consistent with the results of the previous dye tracing tests and the correlation between the time variation of the reservoir water level and discharge of the springs the employed approach is recommended to be applied in sites with different hydrogeological conditions

8337,study region the karst system of the syemareh dam site with the reservoir capacity of 3 2 b m 3 located in the zagros fold belt southwestern of iran was studied under two conditions before and after the reservoir impoundment as pre reservoir and post reservoir conditions respectively study focus despite a mixing of several water resources including the dam reservoir contributed to the flow rate of the downstream springs the number of end members was still unknown and their mixing ratio was unquantified in this study firstly a statistical approach e g loading plot and matrix plot was utilized to identify possible chemical reactions then end member mixing analysis emma was used to determine the number of end members lastly the mix code was utilized to quantify the mixing ratios three scenarios i e assuming three four and five end members were compared to find a reliable mixing model based on the best match between the observed and estimated values of species concentration in order to improve the calibration of the reliable mixing model the species concentrations were corrected by deduction of the effect of plausible chemical reactions new hydrological insights for the region the five end members mixing model consisted of three aquifers deep groundwater and the reservoir was suggested as the dominant mixing process leakage from the reservoir as an end member was

12 of the earth s continental area hartmann et al 2014 in particular 11 of iran s land surface covered by karst limestone raeisi and kowsar 1997 large fractures and conduits are the main pathways of groundwater flow in karst aquifers which cause rapid response to hydrological stresses such as heavy rainfall events and impoundment of dam reservoirs in addition man made stresses such as elevated water pressure by a dam reservoir provides favorable conditions for leakage through karst features which potentially change the hydrogeological setting of the downstream aquifers mohammadi et al 2007a b battaglia et al 2016 behrouj et al 2018 milanovic 2018 increasing discharge at downstream springs and groundwater level as well as variations of hydrochemical composition contreras and hernandez 2013 are indications of leakage and probably mixing of dam reservoir water with surrounding aquifers leakage from dam sites has been reported in numerous dams in karst areas over the world see for example milanovic 2018 a few conventional methods such as geophysical and tracer tests boleve et al 2011 a combination of geological and hydrogeological techniques kamble et al 2014 and numerical modeling cheshomi et al 2014 were utilized to evaluate the leakage amount through dam sites however no studies have applied mixing modeling to calculate the reservoir leakage in order to quantify the contribution i e mixing ratio of a dam reservoir in the surrounding aquifers mixing modeling is a potential approach although mixing models have not been particularly used to assess the leakage from a dam site they have been implemented to determine the age distribution of groundwater jurgens et al 2014 to assess the mechanisms that control stream water chemistry katsuyama et al 2001 to quantify the chemical processes that affect the organic pollutants in an urban aquifer jurado et al 2015 to locate the water inrush in mining industry gu et al 2017 and to quantify the proportion of different water sources in mining scheiber et al 2018 amongst others mixing process defines interaction between two or more sources of water as end members calculation of mixing ratio usually consists of several steps which mainly start by distinguishing end members followed by mixing modeling end member mixing analysis emma has been widely used to identify the number of end members hooper et al 1990 christophersen et al 1990 hooper 2003 vázquez suñé et al 2010 tubau et al 2014 pelizardi et al 2017 emma utilizes principle component analysis pca as a multivariate statistical method to find the minimum number of end members christophersen and hooper 1992 mohammadi 2009 valder et al 2012 chen et al 2014 sun and gui 2015 following the delineation of end members a mixing model implemented to quantify the mixing ratios conventional mixing models are handled based on some common approaches such as linear mixing and least square the linear mixing model of n end members considering continuity and solute and water mass balance assumes linear contribution of the end members to the mixed samples based on the following equations carrera et al 2004 1 x 1 q 1 x 2 q 2 x n q n y o q o 2 q 1 q 2 q n q o where x 1 to x n are the concentrations of inflow waters i e end members q 1 to q n are the corresponding rates y o is the concentration of outflow water i e mixed water and q o is its rate by dividing 1 and 2 by q o and defining δ as the mixing ratio 3 x 1 δ 1 x 2 δ 2 x n δ n y o 4 i 1 i n δ i 1 on the other hand the following equation was introduced for computation of mixing ratio based on least squares and is a general form of eq 1 carrera et al 2004 5 y p s e 1 n e δ p s x e s ε p s where y p s and x e s are the concentrations of species s in sample p and end member e respectively δ p s is the mixing ratio of end member e in mixture p and ε p s is an error which might arise from measurements the aforementioned methods assume that the composition of end members despite reality is well known joerin et al 2002 applied monte carlo analysis to specify the uncertainty of a three end member mixing model rueedi et al 2005 has presented a statistical multi parameter procedure to calculate mixing ratios and their uncertainties using a set of chemical and isotopic parameters carrera et al 2004 has presented an algorithm to quantify the mixing ratios using a maximum likelihood method considering this fact that the composition of end members is not well known the following likelihood equation has to be maximized 6 l p e x p 1 2 y p f δ p t a p 1 y p f δ p subject to δ p t l n e 1 where δ p is the vector of mixing ratios l n e is a one dimensional vector of l s y p is the vector of all species measured in the pth sample a p is covariance matrix of them and f x e s is a matrix of all chemical analyses of end members the algorithm has been named the mix code and applied in several studies vázquez suñé et al 2010 tubau et al 2014 jurado et al 2015 scheiber et al 2018 to run mixing models geochemical tracers can be used to quantify mixing ratios crandall et al 1999 in a two end members mixing model the proportion of the two unmixed sites in the mixed site is easy to be calculated by measuring the concentration of a conservative ion e g cl of the two unmixed sites and of the mixed site using linear mixing or least square approaches however mixing modeling for calculating groundwater mixing ratio in three or more end members needs more data and modeling efforts for example δ18o and cl values can be used to identify mixing patterns gu et al 2017 douglas et al 2000 has used chemical characteristics and isotopic content of water i e relation between cl and δ 18 o to distinguish groundwater types and to compute mixing ratios despite the wide application of geochemical tracers in mixing modeling chemical reactions are usually the cause of changes in the geochemistry of groundwater that might induce uncertainty calculating mixing ratios in order to overcome this uncertainty source the conservative tracers which are not being affected by chemical reactions can be used to improve mixing models nakaya et al 2007 long and valder 2011 the rate of mixing which can be defined by how different end members contribute controls the amount of reactants resulting in products de simoni et al 2007 a mixing line drawn between two end members can be used to determine whether groundwater has been enriched or depleted with regard to a certain ion based on the situation of the sample related to the mixing line ravenscroft and mcarthur 2004 in addition the deviation from this line can be marked to identify geochemical processes tubau et al 2014 in this research mixing modeling is implemented in a unique case study where hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics of the aquifers have been changed due to effects of a new end member i e a dam reservoir named seymareh two hydrogeological conditions including pre reservoir i e before construction of the dam and post reservoir i e after construction of the dam conditions are considered recent studies including dye tracing tests at the seymareh dam site revealed leakage from the reservoir towards the downstream springs behrouj et al 2018 however the amount of leakage was unknown in the downstream springs this study attempts to 1 compare the hydrogeological and hydrochemical characteristics of a karst aquifer under pre reservoir and post reservoir conditions 2 estimate the mixing ratio under different hydrogeological conditions and 3 evaluate mixing modeling as a practical method to estimate leakage amount based on mixing ratio 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area including ravandi anticline is located in the southwestern part of the folded zagros mountains fig 1 geologically three formations exposed in the study area are in the order of age bakhtiari late pliocene gachsaran early miocene and asmari oligocene miocene bakhtiari formation bk which is mainly comprised of conglomerate is the youngest formation and covers some parts of the ravandi anticline gachsaran formation gs which mainly consists of gypsum and halite fills the syncline and lies on the top of asmari formation the main formation of the ravandi anticline is the asmari formation as which comprised of limestone behrouj et al 2018 the seymareh river at the elevation of 603 masl meters above sea level crosses the ravandi anticline and provides a tight gorge for construction of the seymareh dam the dam has been constructed on the northern flank of the ravandi anticline fig 1 the reservoir was impounded from 2009 to 2011 the reservoir water level has a measured elevation of 680 masl that has changed the hydrogeological conditions of the study area e g groundwater velocity hydraulic gradient and mixing processes two main aquifers including the ghachsaran formation gfa and the ravandi anticline were identified based on the characteristics of the water resources and outcrops of the gachsaran and asmari formations behrouj 2018 gfa is in the northeastern part of the study area two permanent springs namely gsp1 and gsp2 with a flow rate of less than 10 l s discharged gfa in pre reservoir condition fig 1b the direction of groundwater flow in this aquifer is towards the left ravandi aquifer lra based on water balance calculations bagheri et al 2006 no springs were observed from this aquifer after reservoir impoundment the ravandi anticline is divided in two sub aquifers namely right ravandi aquifer rra and left ravandi aquifer lra the general groundwater flow direction is from both flanks of the ravandi anticline toward the seymareh river under pre reservoir and post reservoir conditions behrouj et al 2018 the minimum and maximum groundwater levels in rra were about 593 up to 597 masl under pre reservoir condition and changed to be in the range of 605 658 masl under post reservoir condition as for the lra the minimum and maximum groundwater levels were 594 597 masl under pre reservoir condition but increased to 603 up to 634 masl under post reservoir condition the base of karstification which can be considered the bottom of the aquifer according to the drilling data is at about 470 masl there are more than 50 springs that discharge at the ravandi anticline from both aquifers situated on the banks of the seymareh river fig 1 lsp24 is the most important spring in terms of flow rate which averages about 432 l s the average hydraulic gradient in the ravandi anticline was computed to be about 0 0005 and 0 015 in before and after the reservoir impoundment respectively consequently the total discharge of the springs has increased from about 2000 l s to 5000 l s from pre reservoir to post reservoir conditions behrouj 2018 availability of hydrochemical isotopic and dye tracing data in 2006 bagheri et al 2006 before impoundment as the pre reservoir condition and in 2015 after impoundment as the post reservoir condition provide sufficient data for differentiating of two distinct hydrogeological conditions in order to compare the hydrogeology of the study area the measured data in july 2006 and july 2015 were selected as representative of the pre reservoir and post reservoir conditions respectively 2 2 sampling and analytical methods in order to compare the hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics of the aquifers gachsaran and ravandi aquifers and delineate the endmembers and mixing ratio two sampling sets before and after construction of the dam were selected sixty sampling points including 46 springs and 14 observation wells were sampled before construction of the dam under pre reservoir conditions in july 2006 supplementary table 1 however the sampling points were increased to 92 including 18 observation wells 9 drainage boreholes and 21 springs from lra and 14 observation wells 8 drainage boreholes and 19 springs from rra after construction of the dam under post reservoir condition in july 2015 supplementary table 2 the reservoir a few observation wells and drainage boreholes in grouting galleries of the dam were sampled in july 2015 only figs 1 and 2 low and lsp are abbreviations of the observation wells and springs related to lra respectively for rra aquifer row and rsp are used to show the observation wells and springs respectively the springs emerge close to the river elevation and their outlet elevation ranges from 595 to 603 masl four galleries numbered from top g1 with an elevation of about 730 masl to bottom g4 with an elevation of about 600 masl were accessible for sampling of groundwater at different depths fig 2 moreover a few boreholes in the foundation of the dam drilled to 470 masl are available for sampling of deep groundwater fig 2 since the bottom elevations of g1 and g2 are above the reservoir water level they are still dry the samples with abbreviations gr3b and gr4b on the right and gl3b and gl4b on the left belong to g3 and g4 respectively the samples taken from the right galleries are in rra and those samples taken from the left galleries are in lra the samples from the dam foundation i e deep groundwater are shown by f major ions c l s o 4 2 h c o 3 k n a c a 2 and m g 2 were analyzed at the hydrochemistry laboratory of shiraz university for all water samples 60 and 92 samples in pre reservoir and post reservoir conditions respectively electrical conductivity ec water acidity ph and temperature were measured simultaneously in situ environmental isotopes e g δ 2 h and δ18o were analyzed in 32 water samples under pre reservoir conditions and 20 water samples under post reservoir conditions at the environmental isotope laboratory university of waterloo canada more details of the analysis are presented in supplementary tables 1 and 2 2 3 mixing calculation the aquifers and the related water resources were studied from a hydrochemical point of view under both pre reservoir and post reservoir conditions in particular matrix and loading plots and piper diagram were constructed to delineate the relationship between the major ions and the most probable chemical reactions matrix plots highlight the most meaningful relationship between different species loading plots show the importance of ions on the first and second components axes first and second components are the linear transformation of a few measured variables into two components consequently it is possible to suggest some sources i e end members that are the reasons for the plausible chemical reactions the elementary number of end members was determined by pca however the number of end members was modified to consider the hydrogeological effect caused by the dam reservoir hydrochemical and isotopic composition of the water samples collected under both pre reservoir and post reservoir conditions were used to make final decisions regarding the end members and develop a reliable conceptual mixing model the mix code carrera et al 2004 is used to calculate the mixing ratio of end members the model attempts to adjust the measured and calculated concentration of conservative species with an acceptable tolerance value defined by user in addition a few studies have already discussed the chemical reactions for miscalculating the mixing ratios tubau et al 2014 jurado et al 2015 the effect of chemical reactions on the mixing model is eliminated by correcting the concentration of species at sampling sites based on the most probable occurring reactions an ion concentration x c which can be subtracted or added to the measured concentration depending on the reaction is defined as 7 x c c 1 q 1 q 2 where c 1 is the initial concentration of a sampling site and q 1 is the corresponding flow rate x c is the expected concentration to be added or subtracted from the same site with final corresponding flow rate q 2 the reliability of the end members can be crosschecked through the calibration process by defining a few reliable scenarios of the end members the mix code is handled for three scenarios including three four and five end members the mixing model is validated for two data sets aug 2014 and sep 2015 finally the validated mixing model is used to estimate the mixing ratio of the reservoir as a measure of leakage from the reservoir 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrochemical characteristics of the samples based on the measurements ca and so4 are the dominant ions in rra and gfa suggesting a calcium sulfate water type na and cl are the dominant ions in lra indicating sodium chloride water type under pre reservoir condition the so4 and ca average concentrations for samples collected under pre reservoir conditions from gfa were 1184 and 433 ppm respectively the average ec of gfa was about 2020 μs cm no sampling sites were accessible in gfa under post reservoir conditions the average ec increased in the lra aquifer from 1743 to 2784 μs cm and in the rra aquifer from 849 to 2049 μs cm under pre reservoir conditions to post reservoir conditions respectively the average ec of the reservoir is 841 μs cm and ca and so4 are the dominant ions the samples from the reservoir show a mean value of 305 and 137 ppm for so4 and ca respectively however the mean concentration of so4 and ca in the rra aquifer has increased from 244 and 117 ppm to 345 and 142 ppm from pre reservoir to post reservoir conditions respectively the average concentration of cl and na in the lra aquifer increased from 381 and 191 ppm to 564 and 314 ppm under pre reservoir to post reservoir conditions respectively the average concentration of hco3 in both the lra aquifer and the rra aquifer under pre reservoir condition is about 220 ppm while it is about 205 ppm in gfa under post reservoir condition the average concentration of hco3 is about 190 174 and 168 ppm in the reservoir lra aquifer and rra aquifer respectively samples from the dam foundation abbreviated as f in fig 2 which has a depth of about 470 masl are characterized with an ec of about 974 μs cm and is a na cl water type a unique aspect of the dam foundation samples is having k concentration of about 11 ppm which on average is three times higher than that of other samples which might be an indication of a reaction or even a different source of groundwater based on the matrix plots of the anions versus cations the most meaningful relationship is found between cl and na with pearson correlation coefficient of 0 985 and 0 986 indicating the solution of halite under both the pre reservoir and post reservoir conditions respectively fig 3 the relationship between ca variations with so4 is also noticeable with pearson correlation coefficient of 0 975 and 0 98 suggesting the solution of gypsum under both the pre reservoir and post reservoir conditions respectively however there is a meaningful match between mg and so4 with pearson correlation coefficient of 0 81 under post reservoir conditions that was not found under pre reservoir conditions with pearson correlation coefficient of 0 64 dissolution of halite and gypsum are highlighted in the loading plots fig 4 due to the high loading value of na and cl as the first component and ca mg and so4 as the first and second components respectively variations of the loading values of na and cl under pre reservoir and post reservoir conditions suggest increasing halite dissolution under post reservoir conditions 3 2 definition of end members in order to define end members the water samples from two sets of measurements july 2006 and july 2015 have initially been plotted on the piper diagram fig 5 the illustration of the samples on fig 5a from pre reservoir condition reveals that there should be three different groundwater resources including lra rra and gfa before impoundment the samples on fig 5b belong to the post reservoir conditions plus one sample from gfa under pre reservoir conditions for comparison the piper diagram suggests four end members based on the distribution of the sampling sites on the diagram representing post reservoir conditions fig 5b the end members are suggested based on the samples from the deep groundwater dg lra rra and gfa dg is based on the samples from the dam foundations abbreviated as f application of pca helps identify the samples that exhibit extreme concentrations which can be introduced as end members figs 6 and 7 application of pca for data of pre reservoir and post reservoir conditions show that the first two components have eigenvalue more than one but the value of the other components are insignificant for both conditions pca suggests at least three end members from three different aquifers namely lra rra and gfa in the pre reservoir conditions fig 6 for the post reservoir condition it was expected that the number of end members have been increased to four including the dam reservoir however pca shows three end members including lra gfa and dg under the post reservoir conditions and there is no evidence for the reservoir r as an end member fig 7 it seems that the application of the conventional procedure of emma method is unable to differentiate the reliable number of end members due to small differences between the concentration of the species james and roulet 2006 3 2 1 modification of the number of end members in order to improve the applicability of emma variation of the concentration of cl as a conservative ion and stable isotopes of δ 2 h and δ18o in response to variation of the reservoir water level are utilized the variations of the average cl concentration of lra and rra versus the reservoir water level rwl are presented in fig 8 in general the average cl concentration under the post reservoir conditions is greater than that of the pre reservoir conditions fig 8 moreover the average concentration of cl in lra and rra increases with increasing the reservoir water level however the concentration of cl in the reservoir water is less than that of the aquifers alternatively water level in the aquifers and discharge of the springs increased in response to increasing reservoir water level and possible leakage to the lra and rra fig 9 the pearson correlation coefficient between the reservoir water level and the four sampling sites in fig 9 including spr9 rra lsp24 lra row5 rra and low18 lra is 0 85 0 93 0 91 and 0 85 respectively it can be deduced that halite is probably dissolved by the leakage water from the reservoir before recharging to the aquifers figs 3 and 4 average δ 18 o and δ 2 h for the water samples from rra lra and gfa under pre reservoir condition were measured 4 70 and 22 6 5 25 and 26 and 4 29 and 24 respectively under post reservoir condition the average isotopic composition of rra and lra is 4 37 and 22 37 4 38 and 23 2 respectively meanwhile δ 18 o and δ 2 h of the samples from the reservoir measured to be 2 58 and 15 23 respectively the isotopic composition of the rra and lra reveal a degree of enrichment from pre reservoir to post reservoir conditions fig 10 average enrichment of δ 18 o and δ 2 h for the water samples from rra and lra aquifers is 0 33 and 0 23 0 87 and 2 80 respectively moreover the isotopic composition of the samples from rra and lra move closer to gfa under post reservoir conditions fig 10 because of the effect of the reservoir as a high hydraulic force it seems that the spring s water from the lra is partly fed by gfa which cause an enrichment of the isotopic content therefore the discharge of left springs may be a mixture of at least three end members which are lra r and gfa taking the regional groundwater flow direction into account it is likely that r and gfa at least to some extent firstly mixed and then flow toward the springs emerge from lra comparing of isotopic content and concentration of cl under two different hydraulic conditions reveal that the reservoir must be included in the list of end members under post reservoir condition when the differences between concentrations of the major ions are not considerable and a few numbers of the conservative species are available as in this study the reliable number of end members should be identified using simultaneous application of emma and additional using of isotopic hydrochemical and hydrogeological data together 3 3 mixing modeling 3 3 1 conceptual mixing model the mix code was utilized for calculating the mixing ratio of the end members emma was applied with eight measured species i e c l s o 4 2 h c o 3 k n a c a 2 m g 2 and ec the reliable conceptual mixing model is assessed by evolution of considering three four and five end members since the results of emma suggested at least three end members including rra lra and gf in the study area these aquifers were selected as the end members for the mixing modeling of the first scenario in the second scenario four end members including rra lra dg and gfa were selected to run the mixing model the third scenario consisted of five end members rra lra gfa r and dg as the end members the species composition of five possible end members has been shown in table 1 all of the models include 29 sampling sites with the 8 measured species since the eight species characterize the samples and the end members together all of them are used in the models however the effect of applying one fewer species by turn is discussed in section 3 3 4 in order to evaluate the reliability of the scenarios r2 is used as a measure of similarity between the measured and estimated concentration of the species moreover the akaike information criterion aic a rigorous approach for selecting a reliable model which basically prevents both underfitting and overfitting burnham and anderson 2002 was calculated for the mixing models the relationship between the estimated and measured concentrations is assessed initially for the conservative species i e cl then for the rest of the species fig 11 the standard deviation was assumed to be 0 10 for the conservative species i e cl na ec and 0 25 for the rest but when the standard deviation was presumed to be 0 25 for all the species r2 was better which is discussed in details in section 3 3 4 the conceptual mixing model of the five end members was selected as the most reliable model based on the higher value of r2 and lower value of aic discussed in details in section 3 3 2 therefore in the case of the five end members the mass balance equation for a conservative ion c e g cl with an inflow or outflow rate of q in the study site can be written as 8 crqr crraqrra clraqlra cdgqdg cgfaqgfa csqs where r rra lra dg gfa and s are abbreviations for the reservoir right ravandi aquifer left ravandi aquifer deep groundwater gachsaran formation and mixed samples respectively 3 3 2 calibration of the mixing model two mixing models of the five end member scenario were run with and without correction of the plausible chemical reactions based on eq 7 despite r2 was 0 62 0 90 0 95 0 97 0 98 0 99 0 99 and 0 99 for hco3 k ec ca so4 na cl and mg respectively the results of the mixing model without correction of the plausible chemical reactions manifest two issues first the estimated concentration of hco3 exhibited a low correlation with the measured concentrations r2 0 62 through the calibration process secondly in contrast to the results of the dye tracer tests behrouj et al 2018 the mixing model shows no contribution from the reservoir at the springs emerging from lra such as lsp24 moreover the discharge of these springs and concentration of na and cl increased in response to the increasing of the reservoir level fig 8 the mean concentration of cl was measured in the reservoir water 30 ppm to be less than that of the left springs emerging from lra aquifer 575 ppm it seems that halite dissolution is plausible as a result of movement of water from the reservoir to these springs in order to resolve these drawbacks caused by chemical reactions the mixing model has been run after correction of the species concentration by deduction of the effect of the plausible chemical reactions the results of such modified model reveal that the correlation between the measured and estimated concentration for almost all the species is improved specifically for hco3 which its r2 increased from 0 62 to 0 89 the natural logarithm of the residual sum of squares rss using regression model was 14 45 14 46 14 07 and 13 for the three end members four end members five end members mixing model without and with the correction of plausible chemical reactions respectively however aic was 478 493 494 and 457 for the three end members four end members five end members mixing model without and with the correction of plausible chemical reactions respectively since the smallest aic is an indication of the reliable model the mixing model with the correction of the plausible chemical reaction has been selected for calculation of the mixing ratios of the end members recalculations of the end members composition are shown in table 2 the mixing ratio of the end members in the sampling points is presented in fig 12 the ratio of gfa has almost the least ratio in all the sites except in low13 with a ratio of 0 394 since gf is mainly comprised of marl and gypsum it has no significant groundwater storage which contributes in the mixed sampling points the ratio of dg is also low except in a few deep boreholes such as gl3b17 0 953 foundation site 0 837 gr3b23 0 486 and low9 0 407 however rra aquifer extensively contributed in the right observation wells i e rows the mixing ratio of lra aquifer is estimated to be from 0 40 to 0 45 for all the left springs i e springs with abbreviation of lsp in fig 12 the mixing ratio of the reservoir which is in fact the value of leakage has been illustrated the maximum contribution of the reservoir is estimated in the drainage boreholes such as gr4b49 0 89 and gl4b33 0 80 which can be spotted as plausible weak zones in the dam grout curtain moreover the mixing ratio of the reservoir in the springs varies from minimum of 0 40 in rsp1 to maximum of 0 64 in rsp8 the estimated mixing ratio for lsp24 the spring with flow rate of 514 l s reveals about half of discharging water of this spring comes from the reservoir lack of the contribution of the reservoir in gl3b17 which is very close to the dam body shows there are no flow paths from the reservoir toward this sampling point fig 12 the results of the second mixing model i e considering chemical reactions are consistent with the geological setting e g low groundwater storage of gfa hydrogeological data e g different flow system through lra and rra aquifers and the previous dye tracer results e g low and high contribution of the reservoir in gl3b17 and lsp24 respectively behrouj et al 2018 accordingly the five end members mixing model with correction of the chemical reactions is reliable for applying in the different hydrogeological conditions in the study area 3 3 3 validation of the mixing model in order to validate the mixing model five end members with correction of the chemical reactions the measured data in august 2014 and september 2015 are used the effect of reactions is corrected based on eq 7 the results show an acceptable level of correlation between the measured and estimated concentration as r2 in august 2014 and september 2015 for cl and ec is 0 99 0 95 and 0 93 0 88 respectively moreover the mixing ratio of the reservoir in lsp24 is estimated to be 0 55 august 2014 and 0 46 september 2015 which are close to the ratio estimated by the calibrated mixing model for july 2015 0 50 the maximum difference between the calculated reservoir mixing ratios in the three set of modeling august 2014 july 2015 september 2015 for lsp24 is about 26 l s of 514 l s which is not much considering that the discharge of lsp24 can change due to the contribution of the other end members in time 3 3 4 uncertainty of the mixing model the known sources of uncertainty in the mixing model are the chemical reactions the assigned standard deviation sd to the concentration of species and the possibility of different combinations of species used in the mixing model tubau et al 2014 the final validated mixing model five end members with correction of the chemical reactions and lsp24 spring are selected as the reference model and a representative site for assessing the uncertainty of the results of the mixing model respectively the mixing ratios of the end members in lsp24 and r2 are used as the criteria of the models reliability the reference mixing model was run under assigning different values of sd to the species applied sds were the same for all the species except for one with an sd cl na ec 0 1 the rest of the species i e ca mg hco3 so4 k had an sd 0 25 the mixing ratio of the end members in lsp24 is shown in table 3 the r2 for all the models does not differ too much except for hco3 that had low values 0 54 and 0 73 when sd cl na ec 0 1 and sd 0 35 respectively the average flow rate of lsp24 is 432 l s and ranged from 100 to 537 l s when the reservoir water level was 633 and 680 masl respectively it is likely that about half of lsp24 flow rate is fed by the reservoir accordingly if a mixing model estimates the reservoir mixing ratio close to 0 50 at lsp24 spring that mixing model is reliable interestingly the results elucidated that the reservoir mixing ratio estimated close to 0 5 at lsp24 spring only assuming a range of 0 15 to 0 3 for sd hence the other alternatives whether sds more than 0 30 or less than 0 15 should not be used in the mixing model the final validated mixing model was run several times by removing one species in turn the r2 value for all estimated values versus the measured values for all the models was about 0 985 for the model with five end members with correction to the chemical reactions the mixing ratio of the end members in lsp24 has been changed in response to elimination of each species table 4 the results reveal that by removing of cl and mg from the set of species the mixing ratio of the end members in lsp24 is the same as the reference model however by removing the other species the mixing ratio of lsp24 was not consistent with the conceptual model because the mixing ratio of the reservoir in lsp24 was less than 0 10 4 conclusion the mixing process in a karst aquifer is modeled using the mix code under both pre reservoir and post reservoir conditions the hydrogeology and hydrochemistry of the study area were changed due to impoundment of the seymareh reservoir as a constant head boundary with an elevation of 680 masl the conventional statistical approaches i e matrix and loading plots are used to characterize the sampling points applying emma approach showed four end members including the gfa rra lra aquifers and a deep groundwater source having contribution in the discharge of the downstream springs however the comparison of chemical and isotopic content of water samples under pre reservoir and post reservoir conditions proves that the dam reservoir as the fifth end member has a considerable effect on chemical and isotopic contentment of the downstream springs moreover the conceptual model of mixing processes including five end members was selected due to the higher r2 between the measured and estimated concentration of the species and lower aic in comparison to three and four end members the conceptual mixing model is calibrated based on considering or neglecting a few known chemical reactions applying this model it was possible to quantify the leakage of the dam reservoir by calculation of its mixing ratio at different sampling sites and also to detect the weak zones of the grout curtain the reservoir mixing ratio ranged from zero at the sampling sites very close to the dam body to about 0 50 at most springs and 0 80 at some drainage boreholes away from the dam body the calculated ratio for the contribution of the reservoir was consistent with the results of the previous dye tracing tests and the correlation between the time variation of the reservoir water level and discharge of the springs the employed approach is recommended to be applied in sites with different hydrogeological conditions

8338,study region lake basaka is a volcanically dammed closed basin type lake located within matahara plain area northern part of the main ethiopian rift valley merv region the merv is situated within the great east african rift valley gearv region which is hydrgeologically unstable and complex study focus in the current study a conceptual lake gw flux model was systematically formulated solved calibrated and validated then the surface water groundwater interaction was quantified and a mathematical relationship developed new hydrological insights for the region the predictive performance of the developed gw flux model was very good both during the calibration and validation periods which confirms the validity and acceptability of the developed gw flux model and the simulated time series lake level the net gw fluxes to the lake were variable during the different hydrologic periods considered the gw flux to the total inflow increased from 15 1960s to about 54 2000s overall gw flux plays a leading role in the hydrodynamics existence and expansion of lake basaka keywords basaka lake calibration conceptual model fluxes simulation validation water balance 1 introduction lake basaka is an endorheic closed basin type terminal lake located in the central rift valley of ethiopia such type of lakes are very sensitive to a small change of the water balance components the lake is showing fluctuations in lake level and quality depending upon the hydro chemical inputs and outputs the lake level increased by about 9 2 m and the surface area increased by about 47 3 km2 over the period of about five decades 1957 to 2015 dinka 2017a the dynamics in water level and quality of the lake are well documented by different researchers tessema 1998 abebe 2000 ayenew 2004 2007 alemayehu et al 2006 klemperer and cash 2007 belay 2009 georner et al 2009 dinka et al 2009 2014 2015 dinka 2010 2012 dinka 2017b dinka 2012a 2017a summarised the potential causes sources of the lake expansion as establishment of irrigation schemes leakage from the awash river increased recharge from hot spring and groundwater flux lake neotectonisim increased surface runoff climate change etc the expansion of the lake with its poor water quality is negatively impacting the socio economics and environment of the region dinka et al 2014 and challenging irrigation development in matahara region in particular and awash river basin in general dinka 2012 2017 the lake level fluctuation of lake basaka can be indicator of the influence of natural factors e g climatic variation and human activities e g land use land cover lulc change on the hydro chemical processes within its catchment area lakes usually respond to the hydro chemical changes through their water and chemical balances between the inputs and outputs legesse et al 2004 shanahan et al 2007 dinka et al 2014 as a permanent lake interaction of lake basaka with the surrounding environment such as atmosphere subsurface and other surface water features are expected especially there is a good exchange between the lake and groundwater system of the area the study made by dinka 2010 indicates that lake basaka interacts with the surrounding gw system in three main ways i receive considerable amount of gw inflows ii minor seepage leakage losses to the groundwater aquifer and iii lose water to the gw system as subsurface outflow thus understanding the hydrological processes involved in lake basaka requires to take in to account the level of phereatic gw table in relation to the surface of the lake in many lakes gw flux is the large component of lake s water balance wentz and rose 1991 winter 1981 hood et al 2006 winter and likens 2009 dinka 2010 dinka et al 2014 and hence a very important parameter for understanding the lake system the case is also true for lake basaka all the previous studies and current lake condition are indicators of the potential for significant gw contribution to lake basaka according to the various study reports alemayehu et al 2006 ayenew 2007b belay 2009 dinka 2010 dinka et al 2014 the groundwater contribution to the lake is more than 50 of the total inflow and is responsible for the changes in the water balance of the lake the water balance analysis made by dinka et al 2014 revealed that the groundwater contribution in recent time post 2000 is about 60 of the total inflow and is playing a leading role in the hydrodynamics and existence of the lake this makes lake basaka more interesting for quantifying its groundwater contribution understanding and quantifying the interaction of lake basaka with the surrounding gw system is very crucial in order to explain the water balance and hydrochemical sources for the lake as gw flux is the major component of the lake s water input approrpriate quantification measurement of the net gw fluxes to the lake plays a great role for understanding the regimes of lake water balance and explain the possible cause for rise of lake level thus contribute for the sustainable lake water management strategy although some researchers tried to discuss the water balance of the lake recently e g alemayehu 2006 ayenew 2007a belay 2009 georner et al 2009 none of them modeled it by considering the decadal lulc change except dinka 2010 and dinka et al 2014 the long term seasonal and annual gw fluxes to the lake were not estimated by any of the previous studies gw flux to the lake is most likely to vary both seasonally and annually depending upon the changes in natural processes and anthropogenic activities within the lake catchment groundwater flux can be directly measured using seepage meters automated or collection bags fellows and brezonik 1980 belanger et al 1985 kalbus et al 2006 rosenberry et al 2008

krabbenhoft 1998 kluge et al 2007 stets et al 2010 all of the gw flux estimation methods are extensively reviewed by kalbus et al 2006 and rosenberry and labaugh 2008 the choice of the method largely depends on data availability the estimation method of gw component affects the lakes water balance significantly this is due to the fact that there are uncertainties associated with any estimation method of gw flux accurate measurement or quantification of gw flux is very difficult and data intensive hence it is often calculated as the residual of the water balance or sometimes ignored winter 1981 abd ellah 2009 ito et al 2009 stets et al 2010 dinka et al 2014 the most difficult and challenging part of lake s water balance analysis for a closed basin type lakes like basaka is the measurement or quantification of gw flux component furthermore quantitative understanding of the hydrologic systems and hence the data intensive modeling is difficult in developing countries like ethiopia due to the limitation of sufficient recorded data awulachew 2006 dinka et al 2014 in such situation the usual approach is to develop a conceptual water balance model by assuming the gw flux as a residual error abd ellah 2009 ito et al 2009 dinka et al 2014 in the current study therefore an attempt has been made to quantify the net gw flux to lake basaka using a conceptual water balance model the gw flux model was systematically formulated through a quantitative assessment of all the inflows outflows and storages then a relationship between gw and the surface water components of lake water balance rainfall surface runoff evaporation and lake storage was established that means the hydrologic interaction between gw and lake was quantified the results of this study contribute to a better understanding of dynamics of lake water balance especially gw flux and plays a significant role for the sustainable lake management 2 methodology 2 1 brief description of study area lake basaka is a volcanically dammed closed basin type lake located within matahara plain in the northern part of the main ethiopian rift valley merv region the merv region is situated within the great east african rift valley gearv which is geologically unstable the gearv region is hydrogeology classified as the most complex and least understood kebede et al 2008 dinka 2017c the total surface water catchment of the lake is about 500 km2 and it has variable elevation in the ranges of 950 1700 m dinka 2010 dinka et al 2014 the area is characterized by bimodal and erratic rainfall distribution pattern the potential evaporation e is always exceeding the rainfall amount throughout the year the long term 1966 2015 mean annual rainfall temperature and annual pan evaporation of the area are 544 mm 26 5 c and 2070 mm respectively mean monthly temperature ranges from 21 7 c in december to 28 7 c in june there are different soil types such as lepthosols cambisols podzoluvisols luvisols etc land use cover units forestland woodlands bushes grassland farmland wetland etc and irrigation schemes abadir nura era and fantalle within the lake catchment lake basaka catchment is well documented in different literatures e g georner et al 2009 dinka 2010 2012 dinka et al 2014 dinka 2015 dinka 2016 dinka 2017aa b c 2 2 conceptual model development in the current study conceptual net gw flux model was developed for the estimation of gw contribution to lake basaka the developed conceptual gw flux model was through a systematic procedure following various modeling processes formulation calibration verification and simulation application as described in the subsequent sub sections 2 2 1 2 2 5 the water balance model was formulated through a quantitative assessment of all the inflows outflows and storages moreover different representative hydrologic years 1973 1986 2000 and 2007 were selected based on the fact that gw flux varies in different time periods following the changes natural and human induced occurred in the hydrologic regimes runoff erosion sedimentation of the lake catchment 2 2 1 conceptual model formulation the general water balance equation for lake basaka can be written in the form of continuity equation equ 1 the average integral form equ 1b dinka et al 2014 simplifies the complexity of the integral equation 1a d s d t i t o t 1b s t i t o t where i t and o t are the inflows i and outflows o to from the lake over a period of time t ds dt and δs δt are the change in storage as function of time the water balance calculation for a lake usually involves simulating the lake level on monthly annual or longer time step vallet coulomb et al 2001 kebede et al 2008 dinka et al 2014 as schematically presented in fig 1 dinka et al 2014 lake basaka is a closed basin with no surface outflow oo 0 the inputs to the lake are precipitation pl directly falling on the lake surface surface runoff q from the catchments to the lake gw inflow gin and sediment deposited y in the lake from the catchments sedimentation scenario the outputs from the lake includes evaporation el from the lake surface and gw outflow gout note that y is the reduction of storage volume due to sedimentation dinka et al 2014 by considering the effect of sedimentation scenario after inserting all the components of inflows and outflows into equ 1 the general water balance for the lake basaka over certain period δt can be written as shown in equ 2 2 s v v t v t 1 p l g i n q y e i n g i n where δv is the lake volume v change and the other parameters are the same meaning as defined earlier under equ 1 with the units of m3 over a period of month year or longer time periods in the current study a period of one month is considered and hence δt 1 month further simplification of equ 2 can be made by substituting the gw inflow gin minus gw outflow gout components by the net gw flux gnet and the change in volume δv can be expressed in terms of lake surface area a as function of lake level h a h and change in lake level δh after re arranging equ 2 the monthly water balance equation for the lake is written in the form of equ 3 3 a h δ h p e a q g n e t y where δh is the change in lake stage ht ht 1 ht and ht 1 are lake stages at time t current period month in this case and t 1 previous period months in this case ε is the random error term which will be determined by the model calibration note that the units of h p e and ε are in units of m a in m2 and others q g and y in m3 2 2 2 model solution the water balance model shown in the above form equ 2 3 can be used to compute and simulate lake water volume area and depth or to estimate unknown components of the lake s water balance simulation of the water balance equations requires estimation of all the lake s water inputs and outputs and the corresponding change in lake level or volume over the considered time period however there is no direct solution to the water balance equation since there are two unknown parameters ht and gnet in addition to that a and v are the function of h at different time in this study the purpose of the water balance is to estimate the gw flux by developing a relation between surface and ground water components of the lake water balance and then simulate the lake level and compute a water volume area and temporal variability of these variables on monthly and annual time intervals usually the storage capacity either area based or volume based curves are used to estimate the area and volume of the lake awulachew 2006 dinka et al 2014 in this particular study the lake level was simulated using volume based simulation procedure using the capacity curve equation equ 4 h is in m and v in mm3 developed for lake basaka by dinka 2010 and dinka et al 2014 the computation steps described by awulachew 2006 and modified by dinka et al 2014 has been employed 4 v t 0 0468 h t 4 0 6557 h t 3 1 4548 h t 2 4 2759 h t 0 2539 2 2 3 estimation of surface components of water balance all the surface components of the lake s water balance are known for the periods of interest 1973 1986 2000 and 2007 and are already estimated by dinka 2010 and dinka et al 2014 surface runoff was estimated using usda cn united stated department of agriculture curve number method lake evaporation was estimated using the modified penman method sediment yield was estimated using rusle revised universal soil loss equation by accounting site specific sdr sediment delivery ratio the lake area and volume were obtained from the lake capacity curve equation developed by dinka et al 2014 therefore the previous estimations were used and detail estimation procedures are presented by dinka et al 2014 2 2 4 net groundwater flux in this study an indirect approach is used to estimate the net gw flux gnet to the lake first an attempt was made to estimate the initial gnet to the lake from known values of h a p e q and y for the different hydrologic years of interest 1973 1986 2000 and 2007 on monthly basis using the volume based equation equ 5 awulachew 2006 which is the modified form of equ 3 the selected hydrologic years are representative for the variability of gw flux depending upon the changes in natural and anthropogenic factors in the lake catchment furthermore the lulc condition of the lake catchment is also available for the selected hydrologic years from the works of dinka 2012b 5 g n e t t h t h t 1 a m t p t e t a m t q t y t ε t from equ 5 am is the average surface area of the lake km2 and others are as defined earlier the average surface area km2 of the lake for the considered time periods months determined as follows 6 a m t a 1 t a 2 t 2 where a1 t and a2 t are the surface area of the lake at the beginning and end of the month and estimated using the modified form of polynomial equation developed by dinka et al 2014 from lake capacity curve as 7a a 1 t 0 0629 h t 1 4 0 86 h t 1 3 3 8353 h t 1 2 14 033 h t 1 0 8939 7b a 2 t 0 0629 h t 4 0 86 h t 3 3 8353 h t 2 14 033 h t 0 8939 where h m and a km2 are the average monthly lake stage and surface area respectively here it should be noted that the lake level at the beginning of the current month is equal to the lake level at the end of the previous month 2 2 5 model calibration validation and simulation there are no measured values of gw flux and hence the model was calibrated and validated by comparison of the observed and simulated lake levels using the modified form of equ 5 presented in equ 8 calibration validation of the net gw flux model is directly the calibration validation of the developed conceptual water balance model since the two models are not independent and could not be calibrated independently dinka et al 2014 in the model calibration the general trends of lake levels and the temporal seasonal and annual dynamics of gw were considered 8 h t h t 1 p t e t g n e t t q t y t a m t ε t equ 7 was calibrated and validated manually on excel spreadsheet in such a way that the difference between the simulated and measured lake level is within the target 0 15 m note that calibration and validation targets of 0 15 was considered based on the obtained value of root mean square error 0 1249 for the lake stage first the net gw inflow was optimized until the simulated and recorded lake level is within the calibration target 0 15 m for the period of dec 1991 dec 1995 then the lake stage was validated for two years dec 1996 dec 1999 the final selection of the best fit between the measured and simulated lake levels was based on the performance evaluation criteria such as coefficient of determination r2 mean average error mae root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and bias given in equs

respectively the performance of the model simulated a and v of the lake were also evalueated using equa 9 12 by replacing h by a and v respectively once the calibration validation quality is within the predefined performance limit the initial gnet model was developed from the monthly estimated values of gnet in different years of interest 1973 1986 and 1999 a relation was developed between gnet and the other surface water components rainfall surface runoff and evaporation of the lake s water balance as the initial estimate that means the hydraulic interaction between gw flux and lake level was quantified this provides the value of the net exchange between the lake and groundwater then using the optimized monthly gnet for the different calibration and validated periods a mathematical equation that relates the gnet with the other surface components of the lake s water balance was developed a net gw flux model was developed based on the fact that the surface and ground water in the area are interacting very well dinka 2010 the performance of the developed gnet model was again evaluated using the above performance parameters equ 9 12 the optimized equation for the gnet as function of the other surface components of the lake water balance was then used for the simulation of time series gnet and lake level an excel spreadsheet was used for the optimization of the net gw fluxes and estimation of the water balance components 3 results and discussion 3 1 estimated initial groundwater flux 1973 1986 and 2000 the surface components of the lake water balance were already presented in detail by dinka et al 2014 thus in this study only the estimated subsurface components i e net groundwater fluxes are presented the net gw flux gnet values were simulated for the different years of interest 1973 1986 and 2000 using water balance equation eq 4 following the volume based procedure all of the simulated model outputs during the calibration period satisfied the calibration target set 0 15 m and even 90 of the samples were calibrated successfully within the calibration target of 0 1 m the optimised gnet values seasonal and annual for the different hydrologic years of interest are presented in fig 2 two important features can be observed from fig 2 i the gnet values are positive inflow outflow for most of the months in all the years considered and ii the gnet values are showing variability both seasonally and annually the annual variability is significant compared to the seasonal variability negative gnet outflow inflow occurs usually in the months of july and august fig 2 where there are heavy rainfalls and consequently immense runoff and erosion responses in the area it is also observed occassionally in the months of march and june it is possible to see that the gnet value is almost constant during non rainy periods this condition confirms the significant gw outflow from the lake into the surrounding gw aquifer system of the area the gw inflow is from the south western shore of the lake where there are a number of hot springs which are currently submerged the direction of gw inflow is also reported by others e g ayenew 2007b belay 2009 georner et al 2009 dinka 2010 dinka et al 2014 dinka 2017c the groundwater outflow from the lake during heavy rainy period is towards north east east and south east directions but mostly towards north east direction the gw inflow and outflow to from the lake generally follows the direction of gw flow pattern in the awash basin suggested by ayenew 2007 and dinka 2017c for the groundwater flow pattern in the region please refer fig 9 of dinka 2017c 3 2 developed net groundwater flux model as an initial setup a regression model fig 3 between the net gw flux with the surface water systems was developed from the monthly estimated values during the hydrologic years of interest 1973 1986 2000 2007 it is evident from fig 3b that the relationship between gnet and p e am q y is not linear when the x axis is positive equ 13 fails to capture the trend of gnet value during the periods of very high evaporation and very low rainfall in such condition a 2nd degree polynomial and exponential functions fig 3b gives better estimate for gnet in this study a mathematical linear equation equ 13 was fitted to estimate the net gw flux based on the linear relationship shown in fig 3a 13 g n e t t 0 906 e t p t 1 a m t q t y t 0 1071 r 2 0 9217 where g m m3 p m q e and y in m m3 am t in km2 and t and t 1 are the current and previous time period months respectively the surface area of the lake was determined from lake capacity curve equ 7 developed by dinka et al 2014 here it is important to note that rainfall of the previous month is used for the estimation of gnet for the current month which was confirmed during the calibration period that means the gw recharge from rainfall within the lake catchment will reach the lake as gw inflow approximately after a month 1 month lag time the lag time of 1 month in the area is already confirmed by the works of dinka et al 2014 moreover a well recharge study made by belay 2009 in the area indicated that the recharge from rainfall will reach the deep wells approximately in five weeks which supports the results obtained in this study the developed gw flux model was calibrated and validated based on the measured and simulated lake stages the optimised and simulated lake stage compared with the measured lake stage for the calibration and validation periods are shown in fig 4 the model performance result table 1 revealed that there is a good agreement between the measured and simulated lake stages for lake basaka which is verified by higher r2 and ef and lower mae and rmse the highest model effciciency obtained during calibration nse 0 861 and validation nse 0 914 periods reveals that the developed water balance model estimates the lake level very well almost similar to that of the measured one in general the predictive performance of the developed model is very good both during the calibration and validation periods and hence can be used for the simulation of time series gw flux and lake level therefore the simulation of the gw flux and lake level for long period can be done within the required level of accuracy in order to estimate the net gw flux for the other years 1976 1999 a relation between the gnet and the other surface water balance components of the lake hydrologic cycle has been developed as shown in fig 5 the underlying assumption is that the gw flux potential in each succeeding year is directly related to the antecedent lake level and hydrometeorological processes this approach is logical due to the fact that surface and ground water are linked components of the hydrologic system that interacts in a variety of physiographic and climatic landscapes sophocleous 2002 dinka et al 2014 the movement of water between surface and ground water is mostly controlled by the position of the surface water lake in this case within the gw flow systems geologic characteristics of surface water lake beds and climate winter et al 1998 the final net gw flux model equ 14 was developed in relation to the surface components of the water balance fig 5 and used for the simulation of time series of net gw flux and lake level for the other periods post 1999 14 g n e t t 1 041 e t p t 1 a m

in fig 6 the important feature observed from fig 7 is that gw flux is the major inflow component of the lake water balance and is showing a proportional increment to compensate the continuously increasing e flux as function of lake incremental area a though the exact time of the change in gw flux to the lake is not known it is believed that it was started in the 1960s probably following the introduction of large scale irrigation schemes abadir and nura era at the end of 1960s the net gw flux is changing annually generally showing an increasing trend the trend of net gw flux is alson variable from period to period the net gw flux showed a gradual increasing trend slope 2 85 upto 1995 and sharply increased slope 9 7 thereafter until 2002 after 2002 the gw flux showed a slow increasing trend slope 0 65 the simulated decadal gnet m3 s after calibration and validation are plotted in fig 7 it is easy to see that the gw fluxes are increasing periodically except 2007 2008 the simulated decadal net gw fluxes increased from 0 05 m3 s 1 in the 1960s to about 1 52 m3 s 1 in the 2000s the obtained gw inflow for the period between 1960 and 1972 in this study is 0 05 m3 s which is in agreement with that of halcrow 1978 and others dinka 2010 dinka et al 2014 the net gw flux obtained from the developed gw flux model 0 48 m3s 1 in this study for the 1970s is 10 fold compared to the 1960s moreover the net gw flux doubled in the 1990s compared to the 1980s in recent period post 2000 the base flow coefficient ratio of gw flux to the total inflow is about 0 54 georner et al 2009 indicated from water balance calculation that at least 1 59 m3s 1 of water 1989 average must flow into the lake to compensate for e and allow for water level rise 8 of the 1 59 m3s 1 the estimated gw flux for the same period 2000s in this study 1 6 m3 s is in a good agreement with that of georner et al 2009 the agreement of the result with the previous results indicates the acceptability of the developed gw flux model and the simulated decedal gw flux values in general this study result reveals that the expansion of the lake is mainly due to the increase in the net gw flux into the lake which is also suggested by others alemayehu et al 2006 belay 2009 georner 2009 dinka 2010 dinka et al 2014 the cause for the increment of the gw flux into the lake especially after 1995 is not yet identified some study reports are indicating that the change in net gw flux is due to the favorable geologic factors combined with the availability of water which enhanced the modern recharge or due to the increment of recharge from the irrigated agriculture and the rise of the awash river level after the construction of the koka dam located some 152 km upstream alemayehu et al 2006 others relate it to the lake neotectonisim ayenew 1998 tessema 1998 ayenew and becht 2008 ayenew et al 2008 georner et al 2009 there are strong signs of changes in the hydrological settings of the rift system by neotectonism earthquakes and volcanic eruption ayenew and becht 2008 ayenew and becht 2008 concluded from water balance study that the gw flow in the rift are controlled by geologic structures either via flows in the tensional faults or through fluvial and lacustrine deposits whose occurrence is influenced by tectonism 3 4 model simulated lake level after substituting equ 14 into equ 4 8 and then rearranging simplification the final h and v equations will be written as follows 15 h t h t 1 p t 1 041 p t 1 0 041 e t 0 041 q t y t a m t 0 2358 16 v t h t a m t h t 1 p t 1 041 p t 1 0 041 e t a m t 0 041 q t y t 0 2358 the monthly lake a and v were simulated using the lake capacity curve equation presented earlier under equ 7 and equ 4 respectively the performance of the model simulated lake level surface area and volume were evaluated using equa 7 10 the model simulated lake levels were evaluated by comparing it with the recorded ones note that the a and v obtained from the rating curve equ 17 18 dinka 2010 dinka et al 2014 are considered as the observed a and v in the this study table 2 illustrates the summary of the performances of the model simulated lake stage area and volume compared to the recorded value for the recorded period 1976 1998 the predictive performance of the model over the period of 1976 1998 is very good and satisfactory therefore the developed model simulates the lake level almost similar to the measured values the model simulated transient monthly lake levels compared to the measured ones are presented in fig 8 the hydrometeorological data was used in conjunction with the lake stage area volume relationship to calculate the monthly water balances for the lake basaka over the period of 1976 2008 as can be seen from fig 8 the divergence between the model simulated and recorded lake level is very small in all the recorded periods except some minor discrepancy in the periods of extreme climatic conditions 1982 1983 and 1985 1987 this reveals that the uncertainties associated with the component estimation were minimized more or less for all or at least most of the components relatively significant divergences were observed during the extremely wet periods 1982 1983 and dry periods 1985 1987 the year 1983 was historically the wettest year next to 2008 since the establishment of meteorological station 1966 in the area the year 1985 was historically the driest period in ethiopian history followed by the devastating famine in the country thus the developed model overestimates the lake stage during the relatively wettest period and underestimates during the relatively driest periods other studies conducted in the area belay 2009 dinka 2010 dinka et al 2014 also stated that conceptual models overestimate the lake stage during the wet period and underestimate during dry period model simulated results for the inflow and outflow components are summarized in table 3 in recent years 2000 2008 a total of 93 mm3 of water is entered into lake basaka annually as p q gin and y during the same period about 75 8 mm3 of water leaving the lake as e and gout that means about 18 5 of the inflows are stored within the lakle in recent time post 2000s and about 14 8 stored in the lake from 1972 2008 in recent time post 2000 gw flux accounts about 56 of the total inflow and is responsible for the existence and expansion of the lake lake e accounts about 93 of the total outflow from the lake 4 conclusion and or recommendation the seasonal and annual dynamics of gw flux and lake level of lake basaka has been evaluated by considering the historical hydro metorological parameters the study demonstrates the estimation of lake s gw flux under limited or no recorded data the sw gw interaction was quantified and a relationship was developed using conceptual gw flux model which was calibrated and verified successfully the final developed conceptual net gw flux model was used to simulate the time series gw flux and lake level there was a good agreement between the observed and simulated lake stage nse 0 98 at monthly time step which confirms the validity and acceptability of the developed conceptual net gw flux model for lake basaka and hence the validity of the time series simulation lake level furthermore the very good predictive performance of the developed gw flux model could be indicator of the good quantification of the hydroclimatic characteristics of the study area this is due to the fact that the lake level is sensitive to the changes in the catchment hydrologic characteristics and rainfall variations natural which were quantiufied systematically in this study the error is more or less minimised moreover findings of this study have a good agreement with the results of previous studies the decadal net gw fluxes increased from 0 05 m3 s 1 in the 1960s to about 1 52 m3 s 1 in the 2000s lake e is the major water loss accounting more than 93 of the total outflow in general the study result revealed that hydrological water balance of the lake is dominated by the gw flux which accounts about 56 of the total water inflow in recent time post 2000s in the period of 45 years 1973 2010 the gw contribution was about 53 5 of the total inflow the gw flux continously showed an increasing trend to compensate for the losses mostly due to e and keep the lake level to rise at a rate of about 14 the trend of gw flux is not with the same mangitude in all the periods considered gradual increasing trend 1976 1995 sharp increasing trend 1996 2002 and a slow increasing trend 2003 2010 thus it is logical to conclude that gw plays a leading role in the hydrodynamics existence and expansion of lake basaka the cause for the increment of the gw flux into the lake is not fully explained so far some study reports suggested the cause generally as i increased modern recharges from irrigated agriculture and awash river and ii effects of lake neotectonism earthquakes and volcanic eruption due to the location of the study area in the active part of merv region there was no detailed investigation that can explain the possible source for gw flux this condition is challenging the measures to be taken to minimize if not prevented the expansion of the lake and its possible threats to the downstream irrigation development in matahara area in particular and awash basin in general thus a detailed and comprehensive investigation regarding the potential sources of gw flux is highly recommended by the author of this paper author statement this is the second revision of the manuscript

plays a leading role in the hydrodynamics existence and expansion of lake basaka keywords basaka lake calibration conceptual model fluxes simulation validation water balance 1 introduction lake basaka is an endorheic closed basin type terminal lake located in the central rift valley of ethiopia such type of lakes are very sensitive to a small change of the water balance components the lake is showing fluctuations in lake level and quality depending upon the hydro chemical inputs and outputs the lake level increased by about 9 2 m and the surface area increased by about 47 3 km2 over the period of about five decades 1957 to 2015 dinka 2017a the dynamics in water level and quality of the lake are well documented by different researchers tessema 1998 abebe 2000 ayenew 2004 2007 alemayehu et al 2006 klemperer and cash 2007 belay 2009 georner et al 2009 dinka et al 2009 2014 2015 dinka 2010 2012 dinka 2017b dinka 2012a 2017a summarised the potential causes sources of the lake expansion as establishment of irrigation schemes leakage from the awash river increased recharge from hot spring and groundwater flux lake neotectonisim increased surface runoff climate change etc the expansion of the lake with its poor water quality is negatively impacting the socio economics and environment of the region dinka et al 2014 and challenging irrigation development in matahara region in particular and awash river basin in general dinka 2012 2017 the lake level fluctuation of lake basaka can be indicator of the influence of natural factors e g climatic variation and human activities e g land use land cover lulc change on the hydro chemical processes within its catchment area lakes usually respond to the hydro chemical changes through their water and chemical balances between the inputs and outputs legesse et al 2004 shanahan et al 2007 dinka et al 2014 as a permanent lake interaction of lake basaka with the surrounding environment such as atmosphere subsurface and other surface water features are expected especially there is a good exchange between the lake and groundwater system of the area the study made by dinka 2010 indicates that lake basaka interacts with the surrounding gw system in three main ways i receive considerable amount of gw inflows ii minor seepage leakage losses to the groundwater aquifer and iii lose water to the gw system as subsurface outflow thus understanding the hydrological processes involved in lake basaka requires to take in to account the level of phereatic gw table in relation to the surface of the lake in many lakes gw flux is the large component of lake s water balance wentz and rose 1991 winter 1981 hood et al 2006 winter and likens 2009 dinka 2010 dinka et al 2014 and hence a very important parameter for understanding the lake system the case is also true for lake basaka all the previous studies and current lake condition are indicators of the potential for significant gw contribution to lake basaka according to the various study reports alemayehu et al 2006 ayenew 2007b belay 2009 dinka 2010 dinka et al 2014 the groundwater contribution to the lake is more than 50 of the total inflow and is responsible for the changes in the water balance of the lake the water balance analysis made by dinka et al 2014 revealed that the groundwater contribution in recent time post 2000 is about 60 of the total inflow and is playing a leading role in the hydrodynamics and existence of the lake this makes lake basaka more interesting for quantifying its groundwater contribution understanding and quantifying the interaction of lake basaka with the surrounding gw system is very crucial in order to explain the water balance and hydrochemical sources for the lake as gw flux is the major component of the lake s water input approrpriate quantification measurement of the net gw fluxes to the lake plays a great role for understanding the regimes of lake water balance and explain the possible cause for rise of lake level thus contribute for the sustainable lake water management strategy although some researchers tried to discuss the water balance of the lake recently e g alemayehu 2006 ayenew 2007a belay 2009 georner et al 2009 none of them modeled it by considering the decadal lulc change except dinka 2010 and dinka et al 2014 the long term seasonal and annual gw fluxes to the lake were not estimated by any of the previous studies gw flux to the lake is most likely to vary both seasonally and annually depending upon the changes in natural processes and anthropogenic activities within the lake catchment groundwater flux can be directly measured using seepage meters automated or collection bags fellows and brezonik 1980 belanger et al 1985 kalbus et al 2006 rosenberry et al 2008

krabbenhoft 1998 kluge et al 2007 stets et al 2010 all of the gw flux estimation methods are extensively reviewed by kalbus et al 2006 and rosenberry and labaugh 2008 the choice of the method largely depends on data availability the estimation method of gw component affects the lakes water balance significantly this is due to the fact that there are uncertainties associated with any estimation method of gw flux accurate measurement or quantification of gw flux is very difficult and data intensive hence it is often calculated as the residual of the water balance or sometimes ignored winter 1981 abd ellah 2009 ito et al 2009 stets et al 2010 dinka et al 2014 the most difficult and challenging part of lake s water balance analysis for a closed basin type lakes like basaka is the measurement or quantification of gw flux component furthermore quantitative understanding of the hydrologic systems and hence the data intensive modeling is difficult in developing countries like ethiopia due to the limitation of sufficient recorded data awulachew 2006 dinka et al 2014 in such situation the usual approach is to develop a conceptual water balance model by assuming the gw flux as a residual error abd ellah 2009 ito et al 2009 dinka et al 2014 in the current study therefore an attempt has been made to quantify the net gw flux to lake basaka using a conceptual water balance model the gw flux model was systematically formulated through a quantitative assessment of all the inflows outflows and storages then a relationship between gw and the surface water components of lake water balance rainfall surface runoff evaporation and lake storage was established that means the hydrologic interaction between gw and lake was quantified the results of this study contribute to a better understanding of dynamics of lake water balance especially gw flux and plays a significant role for the sustainable lake management 2 methodology 2 1 brief description of study area lake basaka is a volcanically dammed closed basin type lake located within matahara plain in the northern part of the main ethiopian rift valley merv region the merv region is situated within the great east african rift valley gearv which is geologically unstable the gearv region is hydrogeology classified as the most complex and least understood kebede et al 2008 dinka 2017c the total surface water catchment of the lake is about 500 km2 and it has variable elevation in the ranges of 950 1700 m dinka 2010 dinka et al 2014 the area is characterized by bimodal and erratic rainfall distribution pattern the potential evaporation e is always exceeding the rainfall amount throughout the year the long term 1966 2015 mean annual rainfall temperature and annual pan evaporation of the area are 544 mm 26 5 c and 2070 mm respectively mean monthly temperature ranges from 21 7 c in december to 28 7 c in june there are different soil types such as lepthosols cambisols podzoluvisols luvisols etc land use cover units forestland woodlands bushes grassland farmland wetland etc and irrigation schemes abadir nura era and fantalle within the lake catchment lake basaka catchment is well documented in different literatures e g georner et al 2009 dinka 2010 2012 dinka et al 2014 dinka 2015 dinka 2016 dinka 2017aa b c 2 2 conceptual model development in the current study conceptual net gw flux model was developed for the estimation of gw contribution to lake basaka the developed conceptual gw flux model was through a systematic procedure following various modeling processes formulation calibration verification and simulation application as described in the subsequent sub sections 2 2 1 2 2 5 the water balance model was formulated through a quantitative assessment of all the inflows outflows and storages moreover different representative hydrologic years 1973 1986 2000 and 2007 were selected based on the fact that gw flux varies in different time periods following the changes natural and human induced occurred in the hydrologic regimes runoff erosion sedimentation of the lake catchment 2 2 1 conceptual model formulation the general water balance equation for lake basaka can be written in the form of continuity equation equ 1 the average integral form equ 1b dinka et al 2014 simplifies the complexity of the integral equation 1a d s d t i t o t 1b s t i t o t where i t and o t are the inflows i and outflows o to from the lake over a period of time t ds dt and δs δt are the change in storage as function of time the water balance calculation for a lake usually involves simulating the lake level on monthly annual or longer time step vallet coulomb et al 2001 kebede et al 2008 dinka et al 2014 as schematically presented in fig 1 dinka et al 2014 lake basaka is a closed basin with no surface outflow oo 0 the inputs to the lake are precipitation pl directly falling on the lake surface surface runoff q from the catchments to the lake gw inflow gin and sediment deposited y in the lake from the catchments sedimentation scenario the outputs from the lake includes evaporation el from the lake surface and gw outflow gout note that y is the reduction of storage volume due to sedimentation dinka et al 2014 by considering the effect of sedimentation scenario after inserting all the components of inflows and outflows into equ 1 the general water balance for the lake basaka over certain period δt can be written as shown in equ 2 2 s v v t v t 1 p l g i n q y e i n g i n where δv is the lake volume v change and the other parameters are the same meaning as defined earlier under equ 1 with the units of m3 over a period of month year or longer time periods in the current study a period of one month is considered and hence δt 1 month further simplification of equ 2 can be made by substituting the gw inflow gin minus gw outflow gout components by the net gw flux gnet and the change in volume δv can be expressed in terms of lake surface area a as function of lake level h a h and change in lake level δh after re arranging equ 2 the monthly water balance equation for the lake is written in the form of equ 3 3 a h δ h p e a q g n e t y where δh is the change in lake stage ht ht 1 ht and ht 1 are lake stages at time t current period month in this case and t 1 previous period months in this case ε is the random error term which will be determined by the model calibration note that the units of h p e and ε are in units of m a in m2 and others q g and y in m3 2 2 2 model solution the water balance model shown in the above form equ 2 3 can be used to compute and simulate lake water volume area and depth or to estimate unknown components of the lake s water balance simulation of the water balance equations requires estimation of all the lake s water inputs and outputs and the corresponding change in lake level or volume over the considered time period however there is no direct solution to the water balance equation since there are two unknown parameters ht and gnet in addition to that a and v are the function of h at different time in this study the purpose of the water balance is to estimate the gw flux by developing a relation between surface and ground water components of the lake water balance and then simulate the lake level and compute a water volume area and temporal variability of these variables on monthly and annual time intervals usually the storage capacity either area based or volume based curves are used to estimate the area and volume of the lake awulachew 2006 dinka et al 2014 in this particular study the lake level was simulated using volume based simulation procedure using the capacity curve equation equ 4 h is in m and v in mm3 developed for lake basaka by dinka 2010 and dinka et al 2014 the computation steps described by awulachew 2006 and modified by dinka et al 2014 has been employed 4 v t 0 0468 h t 4 0 6557 h t 3 1 4548 h t 2 4 2759 h t 0 2539 2 2 3 estimation of surface components of water balance all the surface components of the lake s water balance are known for the periods of interest 1973 1986 2000 and 2007 and are already estimated by dinka 2010 and dinka et al 2014 surface runoff was estimated using usda cn united stated department of agriculture curve number method lake evaporation was estimated using the modified penman method sediment yield was estimated using rusle revised universal soil loss equation by accounting site specific sdr sediment delivery ratio the lake area and volume were obtained from the lake capacity curve equation developed by dinka et al 2014 therefore the previous estimations were used and detail estimation procedures are presented by dinka et al 2014 2 2 4 net groundwater flux in this study an indirect approach is used to estimate the net gw flux gnet to the lake first an attempt was made to estimate the initial gnet to the lake from known values of h a p e q and y for the different hydrologic years of interest 1973 1986 2000 and 2007 on monthly basis using the volume based equation equ 5 awulachew 2006 which is the modified form of equ 3 the selected hydrologic years are representative for the variability of gw flux depending upon the changes in natural and anthropogenic factors in the lake catchment furthermore the lulc condition of the lake catchment is also available for the selected hydrologic years from the works of dinka 2012b 5 g n e t t h t h t 1 a m t p t e t a m t q t y t ε t from equ 5 am is the average surface area of the lake km2 and others are as defined earlier the average surface area km2 of the lake for the considered time periods months determined as follows 6 a m t a 1 t a 2 t 2 where a1 t and a2 t are the surface area of the lake at the beginning and end of the month and estimated using the modified form of polynomial equation developed by dinka et al 2014 from lake capacity curve as 7a a 1 t 0 0629 h t 1 4 0 86 h t 1 3 3 8353 h t 1 2 14 033 h t 1 0 8939 7b a 2 t 0 0629 h t 4 0 86 h t 3 3 8353 h t 2 14 033 h t 0 8939 where h m and a km2 are the average monthly lake stage and surface area respectively here it should be noted that the lake level at the beginning of the current month is equal to the lake level at the end of the previous month 2 2 5 model calibration validation and simulation there are no measured values of gw flux and hence the model was calibrated and validated by comparison of the observed and simulated lake levels using the modified form of equ 5 presented in equ 8 calibration validation of the net gw flux model is directly the calibration validation of the developed conceptual water balance model since the two models are not independent and could not be calibrated independently dinka et al 2014 in the model calibration the general trends of lake levels and the temporal seasonal and annual dynamics of gw were considered 8 h t h t 1 p t e t g n e t t q t y t a m t ε t equ 7 was calibrated and validated manually on excel spreadsheet in such a way that the difference between the simulated and measured lake level is within the target 0 15 m note that calibration and validation targets of 0 15 was considered based on the obtained value of root mean square error 0 1249 for the lake stage first the net gw inflow was optimized until the simulated and recorded lake level is within the calibration target 0 15 m for the period of dec 1991 dec 1995 then the lake stage was validated for two years dec 1996 dec 1999 the final selection of the best fit between the measured and simulated lake levels was based on the performance evaluation criteria such as coefficient of determination r2 mean average error mae root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and bias given in equs 9 12 respectively 9 r 2 h i o b s h o b s h i s i m h s i m 2 h i o b s h o b s 2 h i s i m h s i m 2 10 m a e 1 n i 1 n h i o b s h i s i m 11 r m s e 1 n h i o b s h i s i m 2 0 5 12 n s e 1 h i o b s h i s i m 2 h i o b s h o b s 2 where hobs and hsim are observed and model simulated lake levels respectively and h o b s and h s i m are mean of the observed and model simulated lake levels respectively the performance of the model simulated a and v of the lake were also evalueated using equa 9 12 by replacing h by a and v respectively once the calibration validation quality is within the predefined performance limit the initial gnet model was developed from the monthly estimated values of gnet in different years of interest 1973 1986 and 1999 a relation was developed between gnet and the other surface water components rainfall surface runoff and evaporation of the lake s water balance as the initial estimate that means the hydraulic interaction between gw flux and lake level was quantified this provides the value of the net exchange between the lake and groundwater then using the optimized monthly gnet for the different calibration and validated periods a mathematical equation that relates the gnet with the other surface components of the lake s water balance was developed a net gw flux model was developed based on the fact that the surface and ground water in the area are interacting very well dinka 2010 the performance of the developed gnet model was again evaluated using the above performance parameters equ 9 12 the optimized equation for the gnet as function of the other surface components of the lake water balance was then used for the simulation of time series gnet and lake level an excel spreadsheet was used for the optimization of the net gw fluxes and estimation of the water balance components 3 results and discussion 3 1 estimated initial groundwater flux 1973 1986 and 2000 the surface components of the lake water balance were already presented in detail by dinka et al 2014 thus in this study only the estimated subsurface components i e net groundwater fluxes are presented the net gw flux gnet values were simulated for the different years of interest 1973 1986 and 2000 using water balance equation eq 4 following the volume based procedure all of the simulated model outputs during the calibration period satisfied the calibration target set 0 15 m and even 90 of the samples were calibrated successfully within the calibration target of 0 1 m the optimised gnet values seasonal and annual for the different hydrologic years of interest are presented in fig 2 two important features can be observed from fig 2 i the gnet values are positive inflow outflow for most of the months in all the years considered and ii the gnet values are showing variability both seasonally and annually the annual variability is significant compared to the seasonal variability negative gnet outflow inflow occurs usually in the months of july and august fig 2 where there are heavy rainfalls and consequently immense runoff and erosion responses in the area it is also observed occassionally in the months of march and june it is possible to see that the gnet value is almost constant during non rainy periods this condition confirms the significant gw outflow from the lake into the surrounding gw aquifer system of the area the gw inflow is from the south western shore of the lake where there are a number of hot springs which are currently submerged the direction of gw inflow is also reported by others e g ayenew 2007b belay 2009 georner et al 2009 dinka 2010 dinka et al 2014 dinka 2017c the groundwater outflow from the lake during heavy rainy period is towards north east east and south east directions but mostly towards north east direction the gw inflow and outflow to from the lake generally follows the direction of gw flow pattern in the awash basin suggested by ayenew 2007 and dinka 2017c for the groundwater flow pattern in the region please refer fig 9 of dinka 2017c 3 2 developed net groundwater flux model as an initial setup a regression model fig 3 between the net gw flux with the surface water systems was developed from the monthly estimated values during the hydrologic years of interest 1973 1986 2000 2007 it is evident from fig 3b that the relationship between gnet and p e am q y is not linear when the x axis is positive equ 13 fails to capture the trend of gnet value during the periods of very high evaporation and very low rainfall in such condition a 2nd degree polynomial and exponential functions fig 3b gives better estimate for gnet in this study a mathematical linear equation equ 13 was fitted to estimate the net gw flux based on the linear relationship shown in fig 3a 13 g n e t t 0 906 e t p t 1 a m t q t y t 0 1071 r 2 0 9217 where g m m3 p m q e and y in m m3 am t in km2 and t and t 1 are the current and previous time period months respectively the surface area of the lake was determined from lake capacity curve equ 7 developed by dinka et al 2014 here it is important to note that rainfall of the previous month is used for the estimation of gnet for the current month which was confirmed during the calibration period that means the gw recharge from rainfall within the lake catchment will reach the lake as gw inflow approximately after a month 1 month lag time the lag time of 1 month in the area is already confirmed by the works of dinka et al 2014 moreover a well recharge study made by belay 2009 in the area indicated that the recharge from rainfall will reach the deep wells approximately in five weeks which supports the results obtained in this study the developed gw flux model was calibrated and validated based on the measured and simulated lake stages the optimised and simulated lake stage compared with the measured lake stage for the calibration and validation periods are shown in fig 4 the model performance result table 1 revealed that there is a good agreement between the measured and simulated lake stages for lake basaka which is verified by higher r2 and ef and lower mae and rmse the highest model effciciency obtained during calibration nse 0 861 and validation nse 0 914 periods reveals that the developed water balance model estimates the lake level very well almost similar to that of the measured one in general the predictive performance of the developed model is very good both during the calibration and validation periods and hence can be used for the simulation of time series gw flux and lake level therefore the simulation of the gw flux and lake level for long period can be done within the required level of accuracy in order to estimate the net gw flux for the other years 1976 1999 a relation between the gnet and the other surface water balance components of the lake hydrologic cycle has been developed as shown in fig 5 the underlying assumption is that the gw flux potential in each succeeding year is directly related to the antecedent lake level and hydrometeorological processes this approach is logical due to the fact that surface and ground water are linked components of the hydrologic system that interacts in a variety of physiographic and climatic landscapes sophocleous 2002 dinka et al 2014 the movement of water between surface and ground water is mostly controlled by the position of the surface water lake in this case within the gw flow systems geologic characteristics of surface water lake beds and climate winter et al 1998 the final net gw flux model equ 14 was developed in relation to the surface components of the water balance fig 5 and used for the simulation of time series of net gw flux and lake level for the other periods post 1999 14 g n e t t 1 041 e t p t 1 a m t q y t 0 1242 r 2 0 9661 3 3 model simulated net gw flux a time series simulation for gnet values are executed using the developed net gw flux model equ 14 and the annual values are plotted as shown in fig 6 the important feature observed from fig 7 is that gw flux is the major inflow component of the lake water balance and is showing a proportional increment to compensate the continuously increasing e flux as function of lake incremental area a though the exact time of the change in gw flux to the lake is not known it is believed that it was started in the 1960s probably following the introduction of large scale irrigation schemes abadir and nura era at the end of 1960s the net gw flux is changing annually generally showing an increasing trend the trend of net gw flux is alson variable from period to period the net gw flux showed a gradual increasing trend slope 2 85 upto 1995 and sharply increased slope 9 7 thereafter until 2002 after 2002 the gw flux showed a slow increasing trend slope 0 65 the simulated decadal gnet m3 s after calibration and validation are plotted in fig 7 it is easy to see that the gw fluxes are increasing periodically except 2007 2008 the simulated decadal net gw fluxes increased from 0 05 m3 s 1 in the 1960s to about 1 52 m3 s 1 in the 2000s the obtained gw inflow for the period between 1960 and 1972 in this study is 0 05 m3 s which is in agreement with that of halcrow 1978 and others dinka 2010 dinka et al 2014 the net gw flux obtained from the developed gw flux model 0 48 m3s 1 in this study for the 1970s is 10 fold compared to the 1960s moreover the net gw flux doubled in the 1990s compared to the 1980s in recent period post 2000 the base flow coefficient ratio of gw flux to the total inflow is about 0 54 georner et al 2009 indicated from water balance calculation that at least 1 59 m3s 1 of water 1989 average must flow into the lake to compensate for e and allow for water level rise 8 of the 1 59 m3s 1 the estimated gw flux for the same period 2000s in this study 1 6 m3 s is in a good agreement with that of georner et al 2009 the agreement of the result with the previous results indicates the acceptability of the developed gw flux model and the simulated decedal gw flux values in general this study result reveals that the expansion of the lake is mainly due to the increase in the net gw flux into the lake which is also suggested by others alemayehu et al 2006 belay 2009 georner 2009 dinka 2010 dinka et al 2014 the cause for the increment of the gw flux into the lake especially after 1995 is not yet identified some study reports are indicating that the change in net gw flux is due to the favorable geologic factors combined with the availability of water which enhanced the modern recharge or due to the increment of recharge from the irrigated agriculture and the rise of the awash river level after the construction of the koka dam located some 152 km upstream alemayehu et al 2006 others relate it to the lake neotectonisim ayenew 1998 tessema 1998 ayenew and becht 2008 ayenew et al 2008 georner et al 2009 there are strong signs of changes in the hydrological settings of the rift system by neotectonism earthquakes and volcanic eruption ayenew and becht 2008 ayenew and becht 2008 concluded from water balance study that the gw flow in the rift are controlled by geologic structures either via flows in the tensional faults or through fluvial and lacustrine deposits whose occurrence is influenced by tectonism 3 4 model simulated lake level after substituting equ 14 into equ 4 8 and then rearranging simplification the final h and v equations will be written as follows 15 h t h t 1 p t 1 041 p t 1 0 041 e t 0 041 q t y t a m t 0 2358 16 v t h t a m t h t 1 p t 1 041 p t 1 0 041 e t a m t 0 041 q t y t 0 2358 the monthly lake a and v were simulated using the lake capacity curve equation presented earlier under equ 7 and equ 4 respectively the performance of the model simulated lake level surface area and volume were evaluated using equa 7 10 the model simulated lake levels were evaluated by comparing it with the recorded ones note that the a and v obtained from the rating curve equ 17 18 dinka 2010 dinka et al 2014 are considered as the observed a and v in the this study table 2 illustrates the summary of the performances of the model simulated lake stage area and volume compared to the recorded value for the recorded period 1976 1998 the predictive performance of the model over the period of 1976 1998 is very good and satisfactory therefore the developed model simulates the lake level almost similar to the measured values the model simulated transient monthly lake levels compared to the measured ones are presented in fig 8 the hydrometeorological data was used in conjunction with the lake stage area volume relationship to calculate the monthly water balances for the lake basaka over the period of 1976 2008 as can be seen from fig 8 the divergence between the model simulated and recorded lake level is very small in all the recorded periods except some minor discrepancy in the periods of extreme climatic conditions 1982 1983 and 1985 1987 this reveals that the uncertainties associated with the component estimation were minimized more or less for all or at least most of the components relatively significant divergences were observed during the extremely wet periods 1982 1983 and dry periods 1985 1987 the year 1983 was historically the wettest year next to 2008 since the establishment of meteorological station 1966 in the area the year 1985 was historically the driest period in ethiopian history followed by the devastating famine in the country thus the developed model overestimates the lake stage during the relatively wettest period and underestimates during the relatively driest periods other studies conducted in the area belay 2009 dinka 2010 dinka et al 2014 also stated that conceptual models overestimate the lake stage during the wet period and underestimate during dry period model simulated results for the inflow and outflow components are summarized in table 3 in recent years 2000 2008 a total of 93 mm3 of water is entered into lake basaka annually as p q gin and y during the same period about 75 8 mm3 of water leaving the lake as e and gout that means about 18 5 of the inflows are stored within the lakle in recent time post 2000s and about 14 8 stored in the lake from 1972 2008 in recent time post 2000 gw flux accounts about 56 of the total inflow and is responsible for the existence and expansion of the lake lake e accounts about 93 of the total outflow from the lake 4 conclusion and or recommendation the seasonal and annual dynamics of gw flux and lake level of lake basaka has been evaluated by considering the historical hydro metorological parameters the study demonstrates the estimation of lake s gw flux under limited or no recorded data the sw gw interaction was quantified and a relationship was developed using conceptual gw flux model which was calibrated and verified successfully the final developed conceptual net gw flux model was used to simulate the time series gw flux and lake level there was a good agreement between the observed and simulated lake stage nse 0 98 at monthly time step which confirms the validity and acceptability of the developed conceptual net gw flux model for lake basaka and hence the validity of the time series simulation lake level furthermore the very good predictive performance of the developed gw flux model could be indicator of the good quantification of the hydroclimatic characteristics of the study area this is due to the fact that the lake level is sensitive to the changes in the catchment hydrologic characteristics and rainfall variations natural which were quantiufied systematically in this study the error is more or less minimised moreover findings of this study have a good agreement with the results of previous studies the decadal net gw fluxes increased from 0 05 m3 s 1 in the 1960s to about 1 52 m3 s 1 in the 2000s lake e is the major water loss accounting more than 93 of the total outflow in general the study result revealed that hydrological water balance of the lake is dominated by the gw flux which accounts about 56 of the total water inflow in recent time post 2000s in the period of 45 years 1973 2010 the gw contribution was about 53 5 of the total inflow the gw flux continously showed an increasing trend to compensate for the losses mostly due to e and keep the lake level to rise at a rate of about 14 the trend of gw flux is not with the same mangitude in all the periods considered gradual increasing trend 1976 1995 sharp increasing trend 1996 2002 and a slow increasing trend 2003 2010 thus it is logical to conclude that gw plays a leading role in the hydrodynamics existence and expansion of lake basaka the cause for the increment of the gw flux into the lake is not fully explained so far some study reports suggested the cause generally as i increased modern recharges from irrigated agriculture and awash river and ii effects of lake neotectonism earthquakes and volcanic eruption due to the location of the study area in the active part of merv region there was no detailed investigation that can explain the possible source for gw flux this condition is challenging the measures to be taken to minimize if not prevented the expansion of the lake and its possible threats to the downstream irrigation development in matahara area in particular and awash basin in general thus a detailed and comprehensive investigation regarding the potential sources of gw flux is highly recommended by the author of this paper author statement this is the second revision of the manuscript

8339,study region tarago reservoir victoria australia study focus this study investigates the influence of rainfall river inflow and wind on the temperature stratification of the tarago reservoir by incorporating atmospheric and bathymetric conditions using a three dimensional hydrodynamic model new hydrological insights for this region in this study a three dimensional 3d hydrodynamic model was developed and applied to the tarago reservoir the model allowed 3d visualization of the thermal structure and the seasonal and longitudinal differences in stratification could be quantified using the schmidt stability index the simulation results revealed longitudinal differences in thermal structure among the riverine transition and lacustrine zones the bathymetry affects the lake stratification and stability furthermore the strong vertical current caused by the sharp bathymetry gradient significantly weakens the stability in deep zones in addition this study assessed the impacts of rainfall and wind on lake stability using sensitivity analysis the results indicated that rainfall decreases the water temperature of the lake but hardly affects the summer stratification moreover the wind not only influences the intensity and duration of stratification but also contributes to the heat storage of waterbodies the patterns of water current velocities and temperature also showed that the circulation generated by overflow and underflow plumes have a crucial effect on the thermal structure of the transition and lacustrine zones keywords hydrodynamic modelling stratification schmidt stability tarago reservoir 1 introduction the reservoirs in australia have a combined water capacity of more than 91 000 g l and are collection and storage systems for domestic irrigation and industrial use as well as for flood control more than 20 temperate reservoirs store approximately 2000 g l of water in victoria and south australia these reservoirs develop a cycle of thermal stratification and mixing every year in addition to external factors such as heat exchange and wind force the changes in the thermal structure of these reservoirs are directly subject to internal influences such as lake morphometry han et al 2000 helfer et al 2009 numerous researchers have investigated the thermal structure of lakes and reservoirs and suggested that physical chemical and biological processes in aquatic environments affect the stratification and mixing process helfer et al 2011 kirillin and shatwell 2016 lawson and anderson 2007 yu et al 2014a when stratification develops in a temperate monomictic reservoir i e reservoirs that mix once a year the vertical thermal dynamics of the reservoir present remarkable changes noori et al 2019 boehrer and schultze 2008 and imboden and wüest 1995 revealed that the processes affecting heat transfer through the surface layer of reservoirs include short wave radiation from the sun longwave radiation of the atmosphere and surface waters sensible heat exchange and heat flux caused by evaporation and precipitation these processes exert a rather limited influence upon the deep layers especially in hypereutrophic lakes where algae grow abundantly furthermore heat transport from the surface to deeper layers relies mainly on turbulence and wind induced currents sundaram and rehm 1971 the different thermal dynamics between the surface layer and deep layers cause a considerable change in water temperature and the differences in water density caused by these temperature differences produce positive buoyancy gradients the stability of such gradients is affected by the combined action of wind induced stirring and convection from surface cooling when turnover occurs kirillin 2010 as engineered structures reservoirs possess morphological features that differ from those of natural lakes in general reservoirs are long and narrow have a main inflow with many tributaries and an outflow at or near the dam wall and can be divided into three distinct zones riverine transition and lacustrine reflecting the obvious longitudinal differences in morphological hydrodynamic and water quality properties ji 2017 water temperature differences between the inflow and reservoir water cause opposite movements of the inflow current referred to as thermocline erosion this condition significantly influences the temperature distribution of the transition and lacustrine zones hebbert et al 1979 therefore a comprehensive analysis of thermal structure requires a three dimensional 3d water temperature distribution in reservoirs field measurements of water temperature can usually only be acquired at several observation points however these measurements are not sufficient to visualise and understand spatial and temporal variations in the thermal structure of entire reservoirs because of the frequent changes in the heat exchange and flow regime as well as the longitudinal difference in reservoirs morphological features over the past two decades the application of numerical modelling in the study of lakes and reservoirs has experienced remarkable progress and played an extensive and unique role in revealing the inherent movements within waterbodies chao et al 2010 yu et al 2014b zhang and chan 2003 numerical modelling has widely been considered an appropriate tool for simulating the hydrodynamic characteristics of various waterbodies antonopoulos and gianniou 2003 hostetler and bartlein 1990 patterson and imberger 1989 previous studies have adopted vertical one dimensional 1d hydrodynamic models to simulate the cycle of thermal stratification and mixing in lakes and have highlighted that atmospheric heat exchange incoming solar radiation and wind forcing play vital roles in the thermal structure of waterbodies bertone et al 2015 mackay et al 2009 tuan et al 2009 given the limitations of 1d models most of these studies have focused on vertical temporal variations of the thermal structure at one specific location of a reservoir research focusing on the relationship between thermal behaviours and spatial variations is rare for nearly 20 years 3d numerical modelling has exhibited great potential as a method for investigating the spatial variation of the thermal structure in reservoirs lessin et al 2014 torriano et al 2012 león et al 2007 simulated surface fluxes thermal structure and hydrodynamic components in great slave lake canada and conducted a series of sensitivity analyses based on meteorological inputs through a 3d hydrodynamic model li et al 2018 successfully simulated the hydrodynamics and thermal dynamics of poyang lake china through 3d numerical models and revealed significant spatial variability of the thermal stability a combined 3d hydrodynamic model and watershed model was published by dargahi and setegn 2011 the model presented the characteristics of the summer stratification profile and dominant factors affecting thermal structures the aforementioned research studies have provided strong evidence that 3d numerical models are effective and reliable tools for analysing the thermal structure of natural waters however to the authors knowledge research focusing specifically on the influence of morphological differences on the thermal structure and hydrodynamic characteristics caused by the significant differences among riverine transition and lacustrine zones is limited the tarago reservoir in victoria australia presents significant longitudinal differences in morphology and experiences a distinct seasonal variation in water temperature as the main water supply for westernport and the mornington peninsula in victoria australia the water quality of the tarago reservoir is critical to the health of local residents however the reservoir has experienced some water quality issues since its establishment in 1969 and tarago water treatment plant twtp was constructed to deal with the deteriorating water quality of the reservoir in 2009 young 2009 without a comprehensive understanding of the variation in the reservoir s thermal structure it is difficult to predict the pollutant transport in it consequently high efficiency and low cost water treatment cannot be guaranteed at all times the challenges associated with treating seasonally deteriorated raw water may lead to complaints from consumers therefore investigating the temporal and spatial variation in the thermal structure is vital for water resources management the goals of this study were to investigate the thermal structure of the tarago reservoir the influence of rainfall and wind on the thermal structures in the riverine transition and lacustrine zones and the role of overflow and underflow during stratification the present study developed and validated a 3d numerical model for the reservoir the simulation results provided visualised hydrodynamic and thermodynamic processes of the reservoir based on the spatial pattern of the schmidt stability index ssi the temporal and spatial differentiation of the thermal structure variation were revealed furthermore the roles of rainfall and wind were examined through comparisons of simulated results from the model with different scenarios the pattern of water temperature and current velocities revealed the roles of overflow and underflow during stratification 2 study site and materials 2 1 research domain the tarago reservoir 38 1 s 145 56 e fig 1 a is approximately 85 km east of melbourne in victoria australia and has a maximum capacity of 37 580 ml of freshwater it was built in 1969 to supply drinking water to the mornington peninsula and westernport fig 1 a which in 2016 had a population of 165 000 australian bureau of statistics 2016 the surface area of the reservoir is approximately 360 ha and its catchment area is 11 400 ha the maximum depth of the reservoir is approximately 23 m near the dam wall upstream of the reservoir is the tarago river and on average 60 ml of water is transported into the tarago reservoir per day the average annual evaporation and precipitation from 2012 and 2017 were 1751 mm and 857 mm respectively the average air temperature for the reservoir is 13 73 c and the lowest daily air temperature from 2012 to 2017 is 2 75 c with a mean volume of 22 548 ml and a mean annual inflow of 0 36 m3 s the hydraulic retention time of the reservoir is 1 97 years the morphological features of the tarago reservoir are in line with the three abovementioned zones namely the riverine transition and lacustrine zones the shape of the reservoir is narrow and long and its water depth gradually increases from the main inflow to outflow reaching its maximum near the dam the tarago reservoir experienced significant algal blooms in the early 1990s and its outflows were removed from the urban water supply system because of poor water quality the melbourne area suffered persistent low rainfall famously referred to as the millennium drought where the water storage in the area dropped to 38 9 of the total capacity in december 2006 and 25 5 in june 2009 in 2009 the twtp was built to purify the outflows from the reservoir which allowed it to be reconnected to the water supply system however seasonal factors have led to some periods with high manganese which has created challenges for plant operations 2 2 monitoring data melbourne water provided the bathymetry of the tarago reservoir the discharge of the inflow and outflow and the meteorological conditions of the reservoir such as air temperature wind speed wind direction relative humidity clearness and precipitation table 1 were observed at neerim south station and tarago reservoir station fig 1 b which are managed by the australian bureau of meteorology bom in addition melbourne water provided rough records about the temperature of the water samples that were collected in the tarago river the inflow of the reservoir in 2017 the vertical profiling system vps structure was installed by melbourne water in the region near the dam wall fig 1 b and since then it has been collecting a series of parameters including water temperature and water level at a three hour frequency and a one meter vertical the high frequency vertical water temperature records were of crucial significance for the calibration and validation of the hydrodynamic model all data collected in this study are available for the period from june 2017 to june 2018 3 methodology 3 1 3d hydrodynamic model this study adopted the dhi mike 3 flow model to simulate the temporal and spatial behaviours of thermal structure through the simulation of flow dynamics and heat exchange in the tarago reservoir dhi 2017 the mike 3 flow model a non hydrostatic numerical modelling system has been successfully employed in various hydrodynamic studies in oceans coasts estuaries and lakes kheirabadi et al 2018 ma et al 2009 sokolova et al 2013 vo and gourbesville 2016 the fundamental component of this flow model is its hydrodynamic module which simulates unsteady 3d flows based on density variations bathymetry and external forces such as meteorology currents and other hydrographic conditions the mathematical foundations of the model are as follows the mass conservation equation 3d reynolds averaged navier stokes equations including the effect of turbulence and variable density and a conservation equation for temperature and salinity for the purposes of the modelling study an accurate description of heat exchange was required heat exchange is calculated based on the sensible heat flux latent heat flux evaporative heat loss net shortwave radiation and net longwave radiation the four physical processes were calculated using an embedded heat exchange module and most parameters have been specified in mike3 dhi 2017 the intensity of solar radiation was described as a function that depends on the distance to the sun declination angle and latitude extraterrestrial radiation and the cloudiness and amount of water vapour in the atmosphere henderson sellers 1986 imberger and hamblin 1982 tucker 1982 weisman and brutsaert 1973 the evaporative heat loss determined by dalton s law is given by eq 1 as the equation shows the constants a 1 and b 1 called constant and wind coefficient in dalton s law respectively must be specified the evaporation rate can be calculated from the latent heat flux using eq 2 1 q v l c e a 1 b 1 w 2 m q w a t e r q a i r 2 δ η e q v l ρ w a t e r where l is the latent heat of vaporisation 2 5 106 j kg c e is the moisture

the evaporation rate 3 1 1 bathymetry and grid melbourne water provided details of the bathymetry of the study site see fig 2 this domain of the tarago reservoir was converted to a grid map with parameters see table 2 the relative altitude of the surrounding land in the grid map was defined as 10 m the depth given by a grid point represents both the grid and the surrounding area which weakens the topographical change of the bottom of the reservoir spacing of 0 5 m was adopted in the vertical direction to ensure a high resolution of simulated vertical temperature profiles fig 2 also shows the two open boundaries of the reservoir inflow in the north and the outflow in the south 3 1 2 boundary conditions the boundary conditions included the water discharge and water temperature at the neerim south station and the tarago reservoir station the shoreline of tarago reservoir was defined as an impermeable and zero normal velocity boundary furthermore the inflow water temperature was assumed to be constant in the vertical direction however as table 1 demonstrates the frequency monthly of the inflow water temperature is insufficient to represent the temperature variation thus this study used the correlation between air temperature and water temperature from august 2005 to september 2009 fig 3 to estimate the daily inflow water temperature moreover this study adopted the linear regression model for one dependent variable air temperature to estimate the water temperature webb and nobilis 1997 the simple model is given by eq 3 3 t w t a b t a t ε t where t w t is the water temperature for a given day t a t is the air temperature for the same day as water temperature a and b are regression parameters and ε t is an error term the parameters a and b were determined through the curve fitting between local air temperature ta and inflow water temperature tw the r squared of 0 8163 indicated that the estimation of the inflow water temperature on air temperature is feasible and parameters a and b were 0 77 and 4 26 respectively fig 5 presents the discharge and water temperature of the inflow and outflow of the tarago reservoir during the study period the historical discharge records indicated that neither inflow nor outflow discharges exhibited a seasonal change 3 1 3 model setup the model defined the density variation as the function of salinity and water temperature variation and considered detailed meteorological conditions local air temperature wind speed and direction and precipitation were collected hourly at the tarago reservoir station the clearness coefficient is bright sunshine hours divided by the length of the day where 100 specifies a clear sky and 0 specifies cloudy weather relative humidity is the amount of moisture in the air as a percentage of the amount of moisture the air can actually contain average monthly clearness was 66 from december 2016 to may 2017 and 45 for the rest of the research period the average monthly relative humidity was 75 for the entire research period the initial water temperature was set at 10 75 c at the starting time of 00 00 31 august 2017 when the reservoir was in a well mixed condition which was effective for minimizing the vertical error in water temperature the simulation period of this model was from 31 august 2017 to 1 june 2018 to ensure that the simulation would experience entire stratification and mixing processes given the numerical stability restriction of this model the simulated interval was specified as 20 s notably the model required four weeks to finish the modelling warm up because a cold start was adopted which initialised the velocity field to zero at the beginning of the simulated period the heat exchange coefficients see table 3 were calibrated using the measured water temperature the turbulence module is a mixed k ԑ smagorinsky model that includes various empirical constants and diffusion parameters which were obtained from prior reported experimental results horiuti 1987 the smagorinsky coefficient and eddy viscosity limits were specified in the turbulence model table 3 in addition a linear relationship was assumed between the dispersion of temperature and the eddy viscosity which was defined by the dispersion factor and dispersion limits table 3 in addition the wind friction factor is calculated in accordance with smith and banke 1975 the data collected by the vps provide three hourly measurements for water temperatures from the surface depth 1 m to a depth of 14 m with 1 m vertical spacing the validation of the model was undertaken through a comparison between the measured and simulated water temperatures using the time series and vertical profiles the mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse were used to detect the performance of the model in addition pearson s product moment correlation coefficient r or r2 the coefficient of determination is usually used to describe the correlation between simulated and observed data legates and mccabe 1999 the square of r ranges from 0 to 1 with values close to 1 indicating a better correlation in addition this study introduced the index of agreement developed by willmott willmott 1981 to provide comparisons of the simulated data p with the observed data o the advantage of the index of agreement is its ability to give the proper weight to the error and difference however the distinct disadvantage of this index is that it exaggerates the influence of the extreme values legates and mccabe 1999 given that there were hardly any extreme values in the simulated results the index of agreement was more valuable than the square of r the index of agreement is given by 4 d 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n p i o o i o 2 where p is the simulated data o is the observed data o is the weighted mean direction or vector of the elements contained in the observed data n is the sum of elements contained in the observed data and i is the number of the element 3 2 stratification stability analysis this research adopted the ssi to quantify the degree of mixing and stratification to enable a more detailed understanding of spatial and temporal variations in thermal structure read et al 2011 schmidt stability was defined by schmidt 1928 to reflect the resistance to mechanical mixing caused by the potential energy of the water column during stratification the ssi has been widely used to indicate the stability of the water column and describe the intensity of thermal stratification in waterbodies bertone et al 2015 kirillin and shatwell 2016 lawson and anderson 2007 li et al 2018 the ssi was given by 5 s t x y g 0 z d z z d 2 ρ z x y z ρ x y z where g is the gravity acceleration m s2 ρ z is the density at depth z and ρ is the mean density of the water column z d is the maximum depth of the lake m and z v is the depth to the centre of the water column m 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of simulated water level and temperature the outputs of the mike 3 flow model provided simulated water temperatures at a 0 5 m vertical interval every hour the measured water level and water temperature from the vps see fig 1 were used to validate the model two time series of simulated and observed water levels at the sample station indicated that the simulated results agreed with the variation and trend of the observed data fig 6 fig 7 presents the time series of the observed and simulated water temperatures at the surface and middle layers table 4 presents the mae rmse coefficient of determination r2 and the index of agreement in the comparisons between the observed and simulated water temperatures at the surface depth 1 m and middle depth 8 m layers the mean absolute errors and rmse for all layers were low and less than 1 0 c the high coefficient of determination r2 and index of agreement indicated the simulated temperatures agreed well with observations to validate the model s capability to simulate the vertical distribution of water temperature the vertical profiles of the simulated and measured water temperatures were compared at 12 moments which included the diurnal and seasonal changes in water temperature fig 8 demonstrates that the simulated results closely matched the measured results representing a high level of consistency between the simulated and measured data the simulated results accurately reproduced not only the vertical distribution of water temperature but also the daily and seasonal variation of temperature gradients from strong stratification to the mixing condition the simulated water temperature after mid march was slightly lower than the observed value similarly the model underestimated the water level when the reservoir was in a mixing condition in table 4 the rmse r2 and index of agreement indicates that the model reproduced the overall trend of the surface water temperature well but fig 7 shows deficiencies in simulating the surface water temperature on short time scales the constant coefficients used in the heat exchange module such as the constant and wind coefficients in dalton s law beta in beer s law and the light extinction coefficient guaranteed efficient and reliable operation but reduced the accuracy of numerical simulations at short time scales in addition the monthly records of clearness and humidity were not sufficient these drawbacks affected the performance of the model however in general the validation results indicated high model accuracy 4 2 simulated thermal structure although the water temperature measured by the vps could not provide an overall understanding of the thermal structure of the tarago reservoir it contributed to the calibration and validation of the 3d model this study investigated the thermal structure of the reservoir through the simulation results of the water temperature of the entire reservoir to reveal the spatial difference of thermal structure during the simulated period three locations in the reservoir were chosen to represent the riverine transition and lacustrine zones see fig 9 the maximum depths of the three locations were 8 12 and 22 m respectively the simulated vertical temperature distributions of these locations from september 2017 to june 2018 are displayed in fig 9 which shows a complete cycle of stratification and turnover occurring in the reservoir furthermore the figure demonstrates that depth is a crucial factor causing the difference in the thermal structure the boundary between the stratification and mixing condition in the riverine zone is blurry because the water temperatures on the bottom increased rapidly the stratification lasted a relatively short time and was broken in early january 2018 in fig 9 b it is obvious that the deep layers of the transition zone continued warming from december 2017 to early february 2018 and the period when water temperatures were in a continuously increasing trend was longer and extended to early march 2018 in the lacustrine zone consequently the duration of stratification increased with rising depth in addition the date of turnover caused by the drop in air temperature was identified in early april 2018 however the water temperature of the entire water column became almost uniform between march and april which suggested a significant reduction in the gradient of water density hence the deterioration of water quality caused by the mixing process might have occurred before turnover the time series of vertical water temperature distribution clearly reflected the temporal variation of the thermal structure in several locations in the reservoir but it was impractical to analyse the spatial difference of thermal structure through the time series therefore the ssi was introduced for this purpose 4 3 stratification stability based on the calculation of the ssi in eq 5 exploration of the seasonal differences in thermal structure in the riverine transition and lacustrine zones became feasible the spatial pattern of the monthly ssi in the tarago reservoir was calculated from the density in turn computed from the validated mike 3 flow model the ssi pattern of the different seasons september 2017 for spring december 2017 for summer march 2018 for autumn and june 2018 for winter are presented in fig 10 several previous studies undertaken on reservoirs and lakes of substantially different sizes have indicated that an ssi value of 200 j m2 is a sensible threshold for ensuring thermal stratification li et al 2018 magee and wu 2017 read et al 2011 in fig 10 b which presents the summer of 2018 the schmidt stability in most regions with a depth more than 12 m exceeded 200 j m2 and the index of the shallow area near shore and inlet varied from only 50 j m2 to 150 j m2 the ssi of regions a and c exceeded 350 j m2 which represented the regions with the strongest stratification during summer as fig 10 a and d demonstrate the ssi of the entire reservoir hardly exceeded 100 j m2 and the index of any area other than region c fig 10 b was rarely more than 50 j m2 the ssi became very low during spring and winter even in the lacustrine zones which indicated that the thermal structure of the tarago reservoir in spring and winter tends to be weak and susceptible to mixing comparing fig 10 and the bathymetry fig 2 the ssi gradually increased with the increasing water depth from the inlet to the outlet reaching its peak at the deepest area near the dam region c therefore it is obvious that a gradually increasing depth along the flow direction is correlated to an increase in schmidt stability however the ssi in region b fig 10 b where an abrupt and narrow curve between region a and c is present remained at a relatively low level compared with nearby values a significant decrease in schmidt stability indicated that the sharp turn influenced the thermal structure of zone b here the current dynamic is a key to interpreting the mechanism of the sharp turn for the stratification four spots with similar depths fig 11 a were chosen as targets to examine the change in current velocity and the vertical velocity component from spot a to d the simulated results from the validated model provided the current velocities and velocity components in the vertical direction this study calculated the mean of the absolute value of current velocity and the vertical velocity w velocity component in december 2017 fig 11 b and c display the vertical profiles of these mean absolute velocities the magnitude of current velocities of the four spots was similar but the magnitude of the vertical velocity component in spot a was significantly greater than those in the other three especially in the layers below a depth of 5 m this difference demonstrates that the vertical movement of current is much more significant at the sharp turn than it is in spots b c and d and led to the reduction of the stability of thermal stratification during december 2017 to summarise the stratification stability of the entire reservoir presents a significant seasonal change and the depth of water mainly affects stratification stability during the same season the longitudinal difference in stratification stability is particularly apparent during summer in addition the stratification stability in some deep zones can be significantly weakened by the sharp turn because an active vertical current movement occurs there 4 4 effects of rainfall and wind the total rainfall for the tarago reservoir was approximately 780 mm in 2018 fig 4 presents the daily precipitation in the tarago reservoir from september 2017 to june 2018 which indicated that heavy precipitation occurred at different times seasons during the study period to generate a simulation without the influence of rainfall the rainfall condition was removed from the original 3d hydrodynamic model through comparing the new simulated results with the original ones the role of rainfall on the thermal structure was revealed fig 12 shows the vertical profiles of water temperature from two simulations in the three locations representing riverine transition and lacustrine zones see fig 9 during heavy rainfall at 3 00 pm on 3rd 4th and 5th december the simulated water temperatures from the surface to 5 m in depth simulated by the model eliminating rainfall no rainfall model were noticeably higher than those simulated by the original model the gaps between two vertical profiles were greater in the epilimnion than in the hypolimnion and approached zero at the bottom of the reservoir therefore the role of rainfall is more significant in the riverine zone than in the transition and lacustrine zones mainly due to a lower depth leading to a thermal change throughout the profile unlike in the deeper lacustrine zone the input of heavy rainfall reduced the water temperature especially in the epilimnion and in view of the comparisons shown in fig 12 the rainfall had minimal impact on the stratification during days with the heaviest rainfall to check the difference in stratification for the two models during the entire research period the ssi was used to quantify the structure of stratification the relative difference in ssi dssi which is used to illustrate the proportion of the influence of rainfall on the stratification was described as follows 6 d s s i s s i o s s i n r s s i o where s s i o is the ssi from original model results s s i n r is the ssi from no rainfall model results three time series of the dssi are presented in fig 13 while the ssi from the original model was used to show the phase of stratification the figure shows that the proportions of varying ssi due to rainfall were never more than 5 during summer stratification even in the riverine zone when ssi dropped to a very low level in the mixing process a slight change of ssi caused a significant dssi and the relative difference became meaningless xuan et al 2015 observed that heavy rainfall with more than 160 mm day caused the bottom water temperature to increase by approximately 4 0 c and accelerated the mixing process however with the heaviest rainfall being less than 50 mm day in the tarago reservoir rainfall exhibited a minimal influence on the bottom water temperature in view of the fact that the rainfall has never exceeded 50 mm day in the tarago reservoir over the past decade it can be concluded that the rainfall occurring there caused the water temperature to drop in the epilimnion but hardly influenced the thermal stratification future work is required to develop a rainfall runoff model to ensure the inflow can also be adjusted according to the change in rainfall for different scenarios thereby enabling the current results to be confirmed the wind force is a vital factor determining circulation and vertical mixing of the reservoir a no wind model provides a way to examine the thermal structure of the reservoir without wind and thus assess how sensitive the model is and the reservoir to wind fig 14 displays comparisons between the vertical profiles of water temperature simulated by original and no wind models without the influence of wind the water temperature of deep layers did not change instead sharper temperature gradients occurred in the epilimnion the simulated results indicated that the heat flux could not reach the deep layers without wind forcing and furthermore the vertical mixing produced by wind is the principal driving force contributing to the downward transport of heat to further study the role of wind two further hypothetical scenarios were analysed based on the field wind conditions a strong wind scenario which used 1 5 times the field wind speed and a weak wind scenario which used 0 5 times the field wind speed original wind directions were not altered fig 15 displays the vertical profiles of water temperature simulated for the three scenarios in the original event the main phase of the formation and reinforcement of summer stratification was from 3 11 2017 to 3 01 2018 and the stratification was broken after 3 03 2018 sharper temperature gradients occurring during the weak wind event indicated a more stable summer stratification and delayed destratification by contrast strong wind of 1 5 times the field wind speed caused stronger vertical mixing which prevented the formation of a considerable stratification the wind conditions determined the rate of the downward transport of heat and the rate was the key factor in the formation and destruction of the stratification the difference in vertical temperature profiles among the riverine transition and lacustrine zones revealed that the thermal structure of the reservoir depends on both the maximum depth of the water column and wind conditions the strong wind scenario suggested a very high rate of heat transport into deep layers the shallow zones remained in mixing conditions during the mid seasons and only lacustrine zones a depth of approximately 20 m presented a mild stratification the differences in thermal structure among the three zones were more distinct in the weak wind scenario which also resulted in stronger stratification for instance the riverine zone with a depth of 7 m was in a mixing condition after 3 03 2018 but the transition and lacustrine zones were still in a steady stratification for these three scenarios the waterbody eventually reached full mixing conditions and presented similar vertical profiles of water temperature compared with the vital role of wind conditions during stratification the influence of wind after turnover can be neglected in addition the differences in temperature vertical profile indicated that wind conditions determine the capacity of the reservoir to store heat although strong wind causes evaporation resulting in heat loss a very large amount of heat is transported and stored in the deep layers of the reservoir with the help of strong wind in conclusion wind condition plays a fundamental role in changing the thermal structure of the tarago reservoir furthermore the degree and duration of stratification are related to the intensity of the wind conditions the capacity of the reservoir to store heat also depends on the wind conditions in view of the dominant role of wind in disturbing the summer stratification strong wind conditions restrain the deterioration of hypolimnion water quality introduced by stable stratification but advance and strengthen the turnover in addition the annual total evaporation from the reservoir is strongly affected by the wind speed 1494 mm with 0 5 times field wind speed 2082 mm with field wind speed and 2670 mm with 1 5 times field wind speed increased evaporation causes the reservoir volume to decrease more rapidly which in turn affects the thermal stability of the water column therefore the effect of wind on the thermal structure of the reservoir is vital for water management 4 5 roles of cold and warm inflow plumes in stratification inflow plumes play a vital role in the heat input of reservoirs and the temperature of inflow plumes determines their movement to a great extent when inserted into reservoirs given the different densities caused by temperature variation the dynamic of an inflow plume presents a significant differentiation when a heat or cold inflow plume enters the reservoir theoretically warm currents with lower density affect the surface flow dynamics but cold currents tend to move downwards because of their higher densities han et al 2000 in the tarago reservoir the hydraulic retention time is 1 97 years with a mean annual inflow of 0 36 m3 s and a flood event did not occur during the study period the influences of the inflow boundary condition on the current dynamic and temperature of riverine zones were checked fig 16 compares water temperatures between inflow boundary conditions and the three locations in the riverine zone r1 r2 and r3 in fig 11 the water temperature at the three locations did not exhibit a similar trend or magnitude to that of the inflow water temperature which revealed that the inflow conditions had a negligible effect on the riverine zone therefore subsequent analyses should not concentrate on the inflow boundary condition itself to further discuss the role of inflow on the thermal structure of the lacustrine zone the 3d hydrodynamic model with a constant inflow water temperature 11 69 c the average value during the research period was deployed fig 17 presents a comparison of the original and new time series of water temperature at the point representing the lacustrine zone see fig 9 the differences between the two simulated results were never more than 0 8 c which proved that the variation of inflow water temperature has a minimal effect on the thermal structure of the lacustrine zone in view of the fact that the riverine zone occupies a quarter of the longitudinal length of the reservoir the thermodynamic activities in the riverine zone are crucial to the thermal structure of the entire reservoir therefore the definition of inflow in the analysis of intrusion flows was not limited to the boundary conditions but extended to the shallow area located in the riverine zones the type of inflow depends on the water temperature pattern of the riverine zones rather than on the inflow water temperature thus the intrusion flows were divided into overflow and underflow according to the comparison of water temperatures between the riverine zones and transition zone acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the roles of overflow and underflow plumes in the thermal structure in the tarago reservoir required a 3d simulation of the flow dynamics to represent the aforementioned roles the simulated flow conditions were represented using velocity vectors the contour of the horizontal water temperature distribution and velocity vector at various depths are presented in figs 18 and 19 to minimise the wind effect the selected dates were 18th december 2017 and 7thjanuary 2018 which were both during the stratification period and had daily average wind speeds of 0 644 m s and 0 723 m s respectively in nonuniform directions fig 18 a presents a typical overflow plume in which a high water temperature inflow dominates the direction of surface currents and drives the upper currents uniformly to flow downstream moreover the deeper layer currents at depths of 4 m b and 8 m c presented an opposite flow directions to the surface currents the current at 4 m was chaotic but that at 8 m was highly consistent in summary a warm overflow plume generally replaced the water in the shallow layer and drove the original epilimnion water into the deeper layer during the stratification period in the tarago reservoir moreover a circulation formed under the influence of the warm overflow plume and a noticeable eddy occurred in the interlayer of the circulation by contrast as seen in fig 19 the cold underflow plume inserted into the deep layer and created a reverse circulation promoting warm water to float to the epilimnion and leading the high temperature surface water in the downstream to backflow into the upstream to demonstrate the entire structure of the circulation fig 20 displays the simulated current and temperature distributions at cross sections x1 x2 the broader definition of inflow suggests that the differences in heat exchange between riverine zones and the deeper zone play a considerable role in the flow dynamics the response of water temperature in the riverine zone is faster than that in the deeper zones when reservoirs gain or lose the same amount of heat the higher water temperature in the riverine regions fig 18 a presented a heat input to the waterbody and that in the lacustrine zone fig 19 a indicated a heat loss to the waterbody fig 21 displays the variations in local air temperature during the study period the overflow occurred when the daily air temperature maintained steady growth and the underflow occurred when air temperatures took a significant and sudden drop in conclusion the different reactions to the heat input or output among riverine transition and lacustrine zones created the overflow or underflow without wind and either the overflow or underflow created vertical circulations in the reservoir the overflow enhanced the stability of stratification because the warmer water floated and relatively cold water moved to a deeper layer however the circulations created by underflow provided much heat to the middle and deep layers through the underflow and created partial mixing in the transition and lacustrine zones of the reservoir although previous studies have proven that wind is the main force driving circulations falconer et al 1991 gibbs et al 2016 he et al 2011 our findings indicated that overflow or underflow caused by the different responses between riverine and lacustrine zones to heat exchange also contributed to the circulation and had opposite effects on the thermal structure of the reservoir however wind maintained a dominant role with regards to circulation potential 5 conclusions a 3d hydrodynamic model of the tarago reservoir was developed using the mike 3 flow model water level and temperature measured by the vps were used to calibrate and validate the model and the model achieved good accuracy with the simulations of the 3d numerical model the analysis of the thermal structure of the reservoir extended from a single observation point to the entire reservoir the vertical water temperature patterns of riverine transition and lacustrine zones showed the longitudinal difference in thermal structure the introduction of the ssi helped to quantify the thermal structure of the entire research domain revealing the effects of water depth seasonal change and special morphometric changes on stratification stability the contribution of rainfall to the lake stratification was minimal instead the vital roles of wind condition in the formation and destruction of thermal stratification and also heat storage were revealed through adjusting wind conditions the overflow and underflow related to the air temperature created inverse circulations that significantly influenced the stratification the development and application of our 3d hydrodynamic model not only enhanced the understanding of the thermal structure of the tarago reservoir but also provides a feasible method for discovering the role of external factors in the thermal structure of waterbodies future work will focus on using the developed model to assess manganese transport in the tarago reservoir because manganese spikes are regularly recorded in the raw water of the twtp during turnover events funding this research was partially funded by the australian government through the australian research council arc lp160100217 credit authorship contribution

8339,study region tarago reservoir victoria australia study focus this study investigates the influence of rainfall river inflow and wind on the temperature stratification of the tarago reservoir by incorporating atmospheric and bathymetric conditions using a three dimensional hydrodynamic model new hydrological insights for this region in this study a three dimensional 3d hydrodynamic model was developed and applied to the tarago reservoir the model allowed 3d visualization of the thermal structure and the seasonal and longitudinal differences in stratification could be quantified using the schmidt stability index the simulation results revealed longitudinal differences in thermal structure among the riverine transition and lacustrine zones the bathymetry affects the lake stratification and stability furthermore the strong vertical current caused by the sharp bathymetry gradient significantly weakens the stability in deep zones in addition this study assessed the impacts of rainfall and wind on lake stability using sensitivity analysis the results indicated that rainfall decreases the water temperature of the lake but hardly affects the summer stratification moreover the wind not only influences the intensity and duration of stratification but also contributes to the heat storage of waterbodies the patterns of water current velocities and temperature also showed that the circulation generated by overflow and underflow plumes have a crucial effect on the thermal structure of the transition and lacustrine zones keywords hydrodynamic modelling stratification schmidt stability tarago reservoir 1 introduction the reservoirs in australia have a combined water capacity of more than 91 000 g l and are collection and storage systems for domestic irrigation and industrial use as well as for flood control more than 20 temperate reservoirs store approximately 2000 g l of water in victoria and south australia these reservoirs develop a cycle of thermal stratification and mixing every year in addition to external factors such as heat exchange and wind force the changes in the thermal structure of these reservoirs are directly subject to internal influences such as lake morphometry han et al 2000 helfer et al 2009 numerous researchers have investigated the thermal structure of lakes and reservoirs and suggested that physical chemical and biological processes in aquatic environments affect the stratification and mixing process helfer et al 2011 kirillin and shatwell 2016 lawson and anderson 2007 yu et al 2014a when stratification develops in a temperate monomictic reservoir i e reservoirs that mix once a year the vertical thermal dynamics of the reservoir present remarkable changes noori et al 2019 boehrer and schultze 2008 and imboden and wüest 1995 revealed that the processes affecting heat transfer through the surface layer of reservoirs include short wave radiation from the sun longwave radiation of the atmosphere and surface waters sensible heat exchange and heat flux caused by evaporation and precipitation these processes exert a rather limited influence upon the deep layers especially in hypereutrophic lakes where algae grow abundantly furthermore heat transport from the surface to deeper layers relies mainly on turbulence and wind induced currents sundaram and rehm 1971 the different thermal dynamics between the surface layer and deep layers cause a considerable change in water temperature and the differences in water density caused by these temperature differences produce positive buoyancy gradients the stability of such gradients is affected by the combined action of wind induced stirring and convection from surface cooling when turnover occurs kirillin 2010 as engineered structures reservoirs possess morphological features that differ from those of natural lakes in general reservoirs are long and narrow have a main inflow with many tributaries and an outflow at or near the dam wall and can be divided into three distinct zones riverine transition and lacustrine reflecting the obvious longitudinal differences in morphological hydrodynamic and water quality properties ji 2017 water temperature differences between the inflow and reservoir water cause opposite movements of the inflow current referred to as thermocline erosion this condition significantly influences the temperature distribution of the transition and lacustrine zones hebbert et al 1979 therefore a comprehensive analysis of thermal structure requires a three dimensional 3d water temperature distribution in reservoirs field measurements of water temperature can usually only be acquired at several observation points however these measurements are not sufficient to visualise and understand spatial and temporal variations in the thermal structure of entire reservoirs because of the frequent changes in the heat exchange and flow regime as well as the longitudinal difference in reservoirs morphological features over the past two decades the application of numerical modelling in the study of lakes and reservoirs has experienced remarkable progress and played an extensive and unique role in revealing the inherent movements within waterbodies chao et al 2010 yu et al 2014b zhang and chan 2003 numerical modelling has widely been considered an appropriate tool for simulating the hydrodynamic characteristics of various waterbodies antonopoulos and gianniou 2003 hostetler and bartlein 1990 patterson and imberger 1989 previous studies have adopted vertical one dimensional 1d hydrodynamic models to simulate the cycle of thermal stratification and mixing in lakes and have highlighted that atmospheric heat exchange incoming solar radiation and wind forcing play vital roles in the thermal structure of waterbodies bertone et al 2015 mackay et al 2009 tuan et al 2009 given the limitations of 1d models most of these studies have focused on vertical temporal variations of the thermal structure at one specific location of a reservoir research focusing on the relationship between thermal behaviours and spatial variations is rare for nearly 20 years 3d numerical modelling has exhibited great potential as a method for investigating the spatial variation of the thermal structure in reservoirs lessin et al 2014 torriano et al 2012 león et al 2007 simulated surface fluxes thermal structure and hydrodynamic components in great slave lake canada and conducted a series of sensitivity analyses based on meteorological inputs through a 3d hydrodynamic model li et al 2018 successfully simulated the hydrodynamics and thermal dynamics of poyang lake china through 3d numerical models and revealed significant spatial variability of the thermal stability a combined 3d hydrodynamic model and watershed model was published by dargahi and setegn 2011 the model presented the characteristics of the summer stratification profile and dominant factors affecting thermal structures the aforementioned research studies have provided strong evidence that 3d numerical models are effective and reliable tools for analysing the thermal structure of natural waters however to the authors knowledge research focusing specifically on the influence of morphological differences on the thermal structure and hydrodynamic characteristics caused by the significant differences among riverine transition and lacustrine zones is limited the tarago reservoir in victoria australia presents significant longitudinal differences in morphology and experiences a distinct seasonal variation in water temperature as the main water supply for westernport and the mornington peninsula in victoria australia the water quality of the tarago reservoir is critical to the health of local residents however the reservoir has experienced some water quality issues since its establishment in 1969 and tarago water treatment plant twtp was constructed to deal with the deteriorating water quality of the reservoir in 2009 young 2009 without a comprehensive understanding of the variation in the reservoir s thermal structure it is difficult to predict the pollutant transport in it consequently high efficiency and low cost water treatment cannot be guaranteed at all times the challenges associated with treating seasonally deteriorated raw water may lead to complaints from consumers therefore investigating the temporal and spatial variation in the thermal structure is vital for water resources management the goals of this study were to investigate the thermal structure of the tarago reservoir the influence of rainfall and wind on the thermal structures in the riverine transition and lacustrine zones and the role of overflow and underflow during stratification the present study developed and validated a 3d numerical model for the reservoir the simulation results provided visualised hydrodynamic and thermodynamic processes of the reservoir based on the spatial pattern of the schmidt stability index ssi the temporal and spatial differentiation of the thermal structure variation were revealed furthermore the roles of rainfall and wind were examined through comparisons of simulated results from the model with different scenarios the pattern of water temperature and current velocities revealed the roles of overflow and underflow during stratification 2 study site and materials 2 1 research domain the tarago reservoir 38 1 s 145 56 e fig 1 a is approximately 85 km east of melbourne in victoria australia and has a maximum capacity of 37 580 ml of freshwater it was built in 1969 to supply drinking water to the mornington peninsula and westernport fig 1 a which in 2016 had a population of 165 000 australian bureau of statistics 2016 the surface area of the reservoir is approximately 360 ha and its catchment area is 11 400 ha the maximum depth of the reservoir is approximately 23 m near the dam wall upstream of the reservoir is the tarago river and on average 60 ml of water is transported into the tarago reservoir per day the average annual evaporation and precipitation from 2012 and 2017 were 1751 mm and 857 mm respectively the average air temperature for the reservoir is 13 73 c and the lowest daily air temperature from 2012 to 2017 is 2 75 c with a mean volume of 22 548 ml and a mean annual inflow of 0 36 m3 s the hydraulic retention time of the reservoir is 1 97 years the morphological features of the tarago reservoir are in line with the three abovementioned zones namely the riverine transition and lacustrine zones the shape of the reservoir is narrow and long and its water depth gradually increases from the main inflow to outflow reaching its maximum near the dam the tarago reservoir experienced significant algal blooms in the early 1990s and its outflows were removed from the urban water supply system because of poor water quality the melbourne area suffered persistent low rainfall famously referred to as the millennium drought where the water storage in the area dropped to 38 9 of the total capacity in december 2006 and 25 5 in june 2009 in 2009 the twtp was built to purify the outflows from the reservoir which allowed it to be reconnected to the water supply system however seasonal factors have led to some periods with high manganese which has created challenges for plant operations 2 2 monitoring data melbourne water provided the bathymetry of the tarago reservoir the discharge of the inflow and outflow and the meteorological conditions of the reservoir such as air temperature wind speed wind direction relative humidity clearness and precipitation table 1 were observed at neerim south station and tarago reservoir station fig 1 b which are managed by the australian bureau of meteorology bom in addition melbourne water provided rough records about the temperature of the water samples that were collected in the tarago river the inflow of the reservoir in 2017 the vertical profiling system vps structure was installed by melbourne water in the region near the dam wall fig 1 b and since then it has been collecting a series of parameters including water temperature and water level at a three hour frequency and a one meter vertical the high frequency vertical water temperature records were of crucial significance for the calibration and validation of the hydrodynamic model all data collected in this study are available for the period from june 2017 to june 2018 3 methodology 3 1 3d hydrodynamic model this study adopted the dhi mike 3 flow model to simulate the temporal and spatial behaviours of thermal structure through the simulation of flow dynamics and heat exchange in the tarago reservoir dhi 2017 the mike 3 flow model a non hydrostatic numerical modelling system has been successfully employed in various hydrodynamic studies in oceans coasts estuaries and lakes kheirabadi et al 2018 ma et al 2009 sokolova et al 2013 vo and gourbesville 2016 the fundamental component of this flow model is its hydrodynamic module which simulates unsteady 3d flows based on density variations bathymetry and external forces such as meteorology currents and other hydrographic conditions the mathematical foundations of the model are as follows the mass conservation equation 3d reynolds averaged navier stokes equations including the effect of turbulence and variable density and a conservation equation for temperature and salinity for the purposes of the modelling study an accurate description of heat exchange was required heat exchange is calculated based on the sensible heat flux latent heat flux evaporative heat loss net shortwave radiation and net longwave radiation the four physical processes were calculated using an embedded heat exchange module and most parameters have been specified in mike3 dhi 2017 the intensity of solar radiation was described as a function that depends on the distance to the sun declination angle and latitude extraterrestrial radiation and the cloudiness and amount of water vapour in the atmosphere henderson sellers 1986 imberger and hamblin 1982 tucker 1982 weisman and brutsaert 1973 the evaporative heat loss determined by dalton s law is given by eq 1 as the equation shows the constants a 1 and b 1 called constant and wind coefficient in dalton s law respectively must be specified the evaporation rate can be calculated from the latent heat flux using eq 2 1 q v l c e a 1 b 1 w 2 m q w a t e r q a i r 2 δ η e q v l ρ w a t e r where l is the latent heat of vaporisation 2 5 106 j kg c e is the moisture coefficient 1 32 10 3 w 2 m is the wind speed 2 m above the sea surface q w a t e r is the water vapour density close to the surface q a i r is the water vapour density in the atmosphere and δ η e is the evaporation rate 3 1 1 bathymetry and grid melbourne water provided details of the bathymetry of the study site see fig 2 this domain of the tarago reservoir was converted to a grid map with parameters see table 2 the relative altitude of the surrounding land in the grid map was defined as 10 m the depth given by a grid point represents both the grid and the surrounding area which weakens the topographical change of the bottom of the reservoir spacing of 0 5 m was adopted in the vertical direction to ensure a high resolution of simulated vertical temperature profiles fig 2 also shows the two open boundaries of the reservoir inflow in the north and the outflow in the south 3 1 2 boundary conditions the boundary conditions included the water discharge and water temperature at the neerim south station and the tarago reservoir station the shoreline of tarago reservoir was defined as an impermeable and zero normal velocity boundary furthermore the inflow water temperature was assumed to be constant in the vertical direction however as table 1 demonstrates the frequency monthly of the inflow water temperature is insufficient to represent the temperature variation thus this study used the correlation between air temperature and water temperature from august 2005 to september 2009 fig 3 to estimate the daily inflow water temperature moreover this study adopted the linear regression model for one dependent variable air temperature to estimate the water temperature webb and nobilis 1997 the simple model is given by eq 3 3 t w t a b t a t ε t where t w t is the water temperature for a given day t a t is the air temperature for the same day as water temperature a and b are regression parameters and ε t is an error term the parameters a and b were determined through the curve fitting between local air temperature ta and inflow water temperature tw the r squared of 0 8163 indicated that the estimation of the inflow water temperature on air temperature is feasible and parameters a and b were 0 77 and 4 26 respectively fig 5 presents the discharge and water temperature of the inflow and outflow of the tarago reservoir during the study period the historical discharge records indicated that neither inflow nor outflow discharges exhibited a seasonal change 3 1 3 model setup the model defined the density variation as the function of salinity and water temperature variation and considered detailed meteorological conditions local air temperature wind speed and direction and precipitation were collected hourly at the tarago reservoir station the clearness coefficient is bright sunshine hours divided by the length of the day where 100 specifies a clear sky and 0 specifies cloudy weather relative humidity is the amount of moisture in the air as a percentage of the amount of moisture the air can actually contain average monthly clearness was 66 from december 2016 to may 2017 and 45 for the rest of the research period the average monthly relative humidity was 75 for the entire research period the initial water temperature was set at 10 75 c at the starting time of 00 00 31 august 2017 when the reservoir was in a well mixed condition which was effective for minimizing the vertical error in water temperature the simulation period of this model was from 31 august 2017 to 1 june 2018 to ensure that the simulation would experience entire stratification and mixing processes given the numerical stability restriction of this model the simulated interval was specified as 20 s notably the model required four weeks to finish the modelling warm up because a cold start was adopted which initialised the velocity field to zero at the beginning of the simulated period the heat exchange coefficients see table 3 were calibrated using the measured water temperature the turbulence module is a mixed k ԑ smagorinsky model that includes various empirical constants and diffusion parameters which were obtained from prior reported experimental results horiuti 1987 the smagorinsky coefficient and eddy viscosity limits were specified in the turbulence model table 3 in addition a linear relationship was assumed between the dispersion of temperature and the eddy viscosity which was defined by the dispersion factor and dispersion limits table 3 in addition the wind friction factor is calculated in accordance with smith and banke 1975 the data collected by the vps provide three hourly measurements for water temperatures from the surface depth 1 m to a depth of 14 m with 1 m vertical spacing the validation of the model was undertaken through a comparison between the measured and simulated water temperatures using the time series and vertical profiles the mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse were used to detect the performance of the model in addition pearson s product moment correlation coefficient r or r2 the coefficient of determination is usually used to describe the correlation between simulated and observed data legates and mccabe 1999 the square of r ranges from 0 to 1 with values close to 1 indicating a better correlation in addition this study introduced the index of agreement developed by willmott willmott 1981 to provide comparisons of the simulated data p with the observed data o the advantage of the index of agreement is its ability to give the proper weight to the error and difference however the distinct disadvantage of this index is that it exaggerates the influence of the extreme values legates and mccabe 1999 given that there were hardly any extreme values in the simulated results the index of agreement was more valuable than the square of r the index of agreement is given by 4 d 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n p i o o i o 2 where p is the simulated data o is the observed data o is the weighted mean direction or vector of the elements contained in the observed data n is the sum of elements contained in the observed data and i is the number of the element 3 2 stratification stability analysis this research adopted the ssi to quantify the degree of mixing and stratification to enable a more detailed understanding of spatial and temporal variations in thermal structure read et al 2011 schmidt stability was defined by schmidt 1928 to reflect the resistance to mechanical mixing caused by the potential energy of the water column during stratification the ssi has been widely used to indicate the stability of the water column and describe the intensity of thermal stratification in waterbodies bertone et al 2015 kirillin and shatwell 2016 lawson and anderson 2007 li et al 2018 the ssi was given by 5 s t x y g 0 z d z z d 2 ρ z x y z ρ x y z where g is the gravity acceleration m s2 ρ z is the density at depth z and ρ is the mean density of the water column z d is the maximum depth of the lake m and z v is the depth to the centre of the water column m 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of simulated water level and temperature the outputs of the mike 3 flow model provided simulated water temperatures at a 0 5 m vertical interval every hour the measured water level and water temperature from the vps see fig 1 were used to validate the model two time series of simulated and observed water levels at the sample station indicated that the simulated results agreed with the variation and trend of the observed data fig 6 fig 7 presents the time series of the observed and simulated water temperatures at the surface and middle layers table 4 presents the mae rmse coefficient of determination r2 and the index of agreement in the comparisons between the observed and simulated water temperatures at the surface depth 1 m and middle depth 8 m layers the mean absolute errors and rmse for all layers were low and less than 1 0 c the high coefficient of determination r2 and index of agreement indicated the simulated temperatures agreed well with observations to validate the model s capability to simulate the vertical distribution of water temperature the vertical profiles of the simulated and measured water temperatures were compared at 12 moments which included the diurnal and seasonal changes in water temperature fig 8 demonstrates that the simulated results closely matched the measured results representing a high level of consistency between the simulated and measured data the simulated results accurately reproduced not only the vertical distribution of water temperature but also the daily and seasonal variation of temperature gradients from strong stratification to the mixing condition the simulated water temperature after mid march was slightly lower than the observed value similarly the model underestimated the water level when the reservoir was in a mixing condition in table 4 the rmse r2 and index of agreement indicates that the model reproduced the overall trend of the surface water temperature well but fig 7 shows deficiencies in simulating the surface water temperature on short time scales the constant coefficients used in the heat exchange module such as the constant and wind coefficients in dalton s law beta in beer s law and the light extinction coefficient guaranteed efficient and reliable operation but reduced the accuracy of numerical simulations at short time scales in addition the monthly records of clearness and humidity were not sufficient these drawbacks affected the performance of the model however in general the validation results indicated high model accuracy 4 2 simulated thermal structure although the water temperature measured by the vps could not provide an overall understanding of the thermal structure of the tarago reservoir it contributed to the calibration and validation of the 3d model this study investigated the thermal structure of the reservoir through the simulation results of the water temperature of the entire reservoir to reveal the spatial difference of thermal structure during the simulated period three locations in the reservoir were chosen to represent the riverine transition and lacustrine zones see fig 9 the maximum depths of the three locations were 8 12 and 22 m respectively the simulated vertical temperature distributions of these locations from september 2017 to june 2018 are displayed in fig 9 which shows a complete cycle of stratification and turnover occurring in the reservoir furthermore the figure demonstrates that depth is a crucial factor causing the difference in the thermal structure the boundary between the stratification and mixing condition in the riverine zone is blurry because the water temperatures on the bottom increased rapidly the stratification lasted a relatively short time and was broken in early january 2018 in fig 9 b it is obvious that the deep layers of the transition zone continued warming from december 2017 to early february 2018 and the period when water temperatures were in a continuously increasing trend was longer and extended to early march 2018 in the lacustrine zone consequently the duration of stratification increased with rising depth in addition the date of turnover caused by the drop in air temperature was identified in early april 2018 however the water temperature of the entire water column became almost uniform between march and april which suggested a significant reduction in the gradient of water density hence the deterioration of water quality caused by the mixing process might have occurred before turnover the time series of vertical water temperature distribution clearly reflected the temporal variation of the thermal structure in several locations in the reservoir but it was impractical to analyse the spatial difference of thermal structure through the time series therefore the ssi was introduced for this purpose 4 3 stratification stability based on the calculation of the ssi in eq 5 exploration of the seasonal differences in thermal structure in the riverine transition and lacustrine zones became feasible the spatial pattern of the monthly ssi in the tarago reservoir was calculated from the density in turn computed from the validated mike 3 flow model the ssi pattern of the different seasons september 2017 for spring december 2017 for summer march 2018 for autumn and june 2018 for winter are presented in fig 10 several previous studies undertaken on reservoirs and lakes of substantially different sizes have indicated that an ssi value of 200 j m2 is a sensible threshold for ensuring thermal stratification li et al 2018 magee and wu 2017 read et al 2011 in fig 10 b which presents the summer of 2018 the schmidt stability in most regions with a depth more than 12 m exceeded 200 j m2 and the index of the shallow area near shore and inlet varied from only 50 j m2 to 150 j m2 the ssi of regions a and c exceeded 350 j m2 which represented the regions with the strongest stratification during summer as fig 10 a and d demonstrate the ssi of the entire reservoir hardly exceeded 100 j m2 and the index of any area other than region c fig 10 b was rarely more than 50 j m2 the ssi became very low during spring and winter even in the lacustrine zones which indicated that the thermal structure of the tarago reservoir in spring and winter tends to be weak and susceptible to mixing comparing fig 10 and the bathymetry fig 2 the ssi gradually increased with the increasing water depth from the inlet to the outlet reaching its peak at the deepest area near the dam region c therefore it is obvious that a gradually increasing depth along the flow direction is correlated to an increase in schmidt stability however the ssi in region b fig 10 b where an abrupt and narrow curve between region a and c is present remained at a relatively low level compared with nearby values a significant decrease in schmidt stability indicated that the sharp turn influenced the thermal structure of zone b here the current dynamic is a key to interpreting the mechanism of the sharp turn for the stratification four spots with similar depths fig 11 a were chosen as targets to examine the change in current velocity and the vertical velocity component from spot a to d the simulated results from the validated model provided the current velocities and velocity components in the vertical direction this study calculated the mean of the absolute value of current velocity and the vertical velocity w velocity component in december 2017 fig 11 b and c display the vertical profiles of these mean absolute velocities the magnitude of current velocities of the four spots was similar but the magnitude of the vertical velocity component in spot a was significantly greater than those in the other three especially in the layers below a depth of 5 m this difference demonstrates that the vertical movement of current is much more significant at the sharp turn than it is in spots b c and d and led to the reduction of the stability of thermal stratification during december 2017 to summarise the stratification stability of the entire reservoir presents a significant seasonal change and the depth of water mainly affects stratification stability during the same season the longitudinal difference in stratification stability is particularly apparent during summer in addition the stratification stability in some deep zones can be significantly weakened by the sharp turn because an active vertical current movement occurs there 4 4 effects of rainfall and wind the total rainfall for the tarago reservoir was approximately 780 mm in 2018 fig 4 presents the daily precipitation in the tarago reservoir from september 2017 to june 2018 which indicated that heavy precipitation occurred at different times seasons during the study period to generate a simulation without the influence of rainfall the rainfall condition was removed from the original 3d hydrodynamic model through comparing the new simulated results with the original ones the role of rainfall on the thermal structure was revealed fig 12 shows the vertical profiles of water temperature from two simulations in the three locations representing riverine transition and lacustrine zones see fig 9 during heavy rainfall at 3 00 pm on 3rd 4th and 5th december the simulated water temperatures from the surface to 5 m in depth simulated by the model eliminating rainfall no rainfall model were noticeably higher than those simulated by the original model the gaps between two vertical profiles were greater in the epilimnion than in the hypolimnion and approached zero at the bottom of the reservoir therefore the role of rainfall is more significant in the riverine zone than in the transition and lacustrine zones mainly due to a lower depth leading to a thermal change throughout the profile unlike in the deeper lacustrine zone the input of heavy rainfall reduced the water temperature especially in the epilimnion and in view of the comparisons shown in fig 12 the rainfall had minimal impact on the stratification during days with the heaviest rainfall to check the difference in stratification for the two models during the entire research period the ssi was used to quantify the structure of stratification the relative difference in ssi dssi which is used to illustrate the proportion of the influence of rainfall on the stratification was described as follows 6 d s s i s s i o s s i n r s s i o where s s i o is the ssi from original model results s s i n r is the ssi from no rainfall model results three time series of the dssi are presented in fig 13 while the ssi from the original model was used to show the phase of stratification the figure shows that the proportions of varying ssi due to rainfall were never more than 5 during summer stratification even in the riverine zone when ssi dropped to a very low level in the mixing process a slight change of ssi caused a significant dssi and the relative difference became meaningless xuan et al 2015 observed that heavy rainfall with more than 160 mm day caused the bottom water temperature to increase by approximately 4 0 c and accelerated the mixing process however with the heaviest rainfall being less than 50 mm day in the tarago reservoir rainfall exhibited a minimal influence on the bottom water temperature in view of the fact that the rainfall has never exceeded 50 mm day in the tarago reservoir over the past decade it can be concluded that the rainfall occurring there caused the water temperature to drop in the epilimnion but hardly influenced the thermal stratification future work is required to develop a rainfall runoff model to ensure the inflow can also be adjusted according to the change in rainfall for different scenarios thereby enabling the current results to be confirmed the wind force is a vital factor determining circulation and vertical mixing of the reservoir a no wind model provides a way to examine the thermal structure of the reservoir without wind and thus assess how sensitive the model is and the reservoir to wind fig 14 displays comparisons between the vertical profiles of water temperature simulated by original and no wind models without the influence of wind the water temperature of deep layers did not change instead sharper temperature gradients occurred in the epilimnion the simulated results indicated that the heat flux could not reach the deep layers without wind forcing and furthermore the vertical mixing produced by wind is the principal driving force contributing to the downward transport of heat to further study the role of wind two further hypothetical scenarios were analysed based on the field wind conditions a strong wind scenario which used 1 5 times the field wind speed and a weak wind scenario which used 0 5 times the field wind speed original wind directions were not altered fig 15 displays the vertical profiles of water temperature simulated for the three scenarios in the original event the main phase of the formation and reinforcement of summer stratification was from 3 11 2017 to 3 01 2018 and the stratification was broken after 3 03 2018 sharper temperature gradients occurring during the weak wind event indicated a more stable summer stratification and delayed destratification by contrast strong wind of 1 5 times the field wind speed caused stronger vertical mixing which prevented the formation of a considerable stratification the wind conditions determined the rate of the downward transport of heat and the rate was the key factor in the formation and destruction of the stratification the difference in vertical temperature profiles among the riverine transition and lacustrine zones revealed that the thermal structure of the reservoir depends on both the maximum depth of the water column and wind conditions the strong wind scenario suggested a very high rate of heat transport into deep layers the shallow zones remained in mixing conditions during the mid seasons and only lacustrine zones a depth of approximately 20 m presented a mild stratification the differences in thermal structure among the three zones were more distinct in the weak wind scenario which also resulted in stronger stratification for instance the riverine zone with a depth of 7 m was in a mixing condition after 3 03 2018 but the transition and lacustrine zones were still in a steady stratification for these three scenarios the waterbody eventually reached full mixing conditions and presented similar vertical profiles of water temperature compared with the vital role of wind conditions during stratification the influence of wind after turnover can be neglected in addition the differences in temperature vertical profile indicated that wind conditions determine the capacity of the reservoir to store heat although strong wind causes evaporation resulting in heat loss a very large amount of heat is transported and stored in the deep layers of the reservoir with the help of strong wind in conclusion wind condition plays a fundamental role in changing the thermal structure of the tarago reservoir furthermore the degree and duration of stratification are related to the intensity of the wind conditions the capacity of the reservoir to store heat also depends on the wind conditions in view of the dominant role of wind in disturbing the summer stratification strong wind conditions restrain the deterioration of hypolimnion water quality introduced by stable stratification but advance and strengthen the turnover in addition the annual total evaporation from the reservoir is strongly affected by the wind speed 1494 mm with 0 5 times field wind speed 2082 mm with field wind speed and 2670 mm with 1 5 times field wind speed increased evaporation causes the reservoir volume to decrease more rapidly which in turn affects the thermal stability of the water column therefore the effect of wind on the thermal structure of the reservoir is vital for water management 4 5 roles of cold and warm inflow plumes in stratification inflow plumes play a vital role in the heat input of reservoirs and the temperature of inflow plumes determines their movement to a great extent when inserted into reservoirs given the different densities caused by temperature variation the dynamic of an inflow plume presents a significant differentiation when a heat or cold inflow plume enters the reservoir theoretically warm currents with lower density affect the surface flow dynamics but cold currents tend to move downwards because of their higher densities han et al 2000 in the tarago reservoir the hydraulic retention time is 1 97 years with a mean annual inflow of 0 36 m3 s and a flood event did not occur during the study period the influences of the inflow boundary condition on the current dynamic and temperature of riverine zones were checked fig 16 compares water temperatures between inflow boundary conditions and the three locations in the riverine zone r1 r2 and r3 in fig 11 the water temperature at the three locations did not exhibit a similar trend or magnitude to that of the inflow water temperature which revealed that the inflow conditions had a negligible effect on the riverine zone therefore subsequent analyses should not concentrate on the inflow boundary condition itself to further discuss the role of inflow on the thermal structure of the lacustrine zone the 3d hydrodynamic model with a constant inflow water temperature 11 69 c the average value during the research period was deployed fig 17 presents a comparison of the original and new time series of water temperature at the point representing the lacustrine zone see fig 9 the differences between the two simulated results were never more than 0 8 c which proved that the variation of inflow water temperature has a minimal effect on the thermal structure of the lacustrine zone in view of the fact that the riverine zone occupies a quarter of the longitudinal length of the reservoir the thermodynamic activities in the riverine zone are crucial to the thermal structure of the entire reservoir therefore the definition of inflow in the analysis of intrusion flows was not limited to the boundary conditions but extended to the shallow area located in the riverine zones the type of inflow depends on the water temperature pattern of the riverine zones rather than on the inflow water temperature thus the intrusion flows were divided into overflow and underflow according to the comparison of water temperatures between the riverine zones and transition zone acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the roles of overflow and underflow plumes in the thermal structure in the tarago reservoir required a 3d simulation of the flow dynamics to represent the aforementioned roles the simulated flow conditions were represented using velocity vectors the contour of the horizontal water temperature distribution and velocity vector at various depths are presented in figs 18 and 19 to minimise the wind effect the selected dates were 18th december 2017 and 7thjanuary 2018 which were both during the stratification period and had daily average wind speeds of 0 644 m s and 0 723 m s respectively in nonuniform directions fig 18 a presents a typical overflow plume in which a high water temperature inflow dominates the direction of surface currents and drives the upper currents uniformly to flow downstream moreover the deeper layer currents at depths of 4 m b and 8 m c presented an opposite flow directions to the surface currents the current at 4 m was chaotic but that at 8 m was highly consistent in summary a warm overflow plume generally replaced the water in the shallow layer and drove the original epilimnion water into the deeper layer during the stratification period in the tarago reservoir moreover a circulation formed under the influence of the warm overflow plume and a noticeable eddy occurred in the interlayer of the circulation by contrast as seen in fig 19 the cold underflow plume inserted into the deep layer and created a reverse circulation promoting warm water to float to the epilimnion and leading the high temperature surface water in the downstream to backflow into the upstream to demonstrate the entire structure of the circulation fig 20 displays the simulated current and temperature distributions at cross sections x1 x2 the broader definition of inflow suggests that the differences in heat exchange between riverine zones and the deeper zone play a considerable role in the flow dynamics the response of water temperature in the riverine zone is faster than that in the deeper zones when reservoirs gain or lose the same amount of heat the higher water temperature in the riverine regions fig 18 a presented a heat input to the waterbody and that in the lacustrine zone fig 19 a indicated a heat loss to the waterbody fig 21 displays the variations in local air temperature during the study period the overflow occurred when the daily air temperature maintained steady growth and the underflow occurred when air temperatures took a significant and sudden drop in conclusion the different reactions to the heat input or output among riverine transition and lacustrine zones created the overflow or underflow without wind and either the overflow or underflow created vertical circulations in the reservoir the overflow enhanced the stability of stratification because the warmer water floated and relatively cold water moved to a deeper layer however the circulations created by underflow provided much heat to the middle and deep layers through the underflow and created partial mixing in the transition and lacustrine zones of the reservoir although previous studies have proven that wind is the main force driving circulations falconer et al 1991 gibbs et al 2016 he et al 2011 our findings indicated that overflow or underflow caused by the different responses between riverine and lacustrine zones to heat exchange also contributed to the circulation and had opposite effects on the thermal structure of the reservoir however wind maintained a dominant role with regards to circulation potential 5 conclusions a 3d hydrodynamic model of the tarago reservoir was developed using the mike 3 flow model water level and temperature measured by the vps were used to calibrate and validate the model and the model achieved good accuracy with the simulations of the 3d numerical model the analysis of the thermal structure of the reservoir extended from a single observation point to the entire reservoir the vertical water temperature patterns of riverine transition and lacustrine zones showed the longitudinal difference in thermal structure the introduction of the ssi helped to quantify the thermal structure of the entire research domain revealing the effects of water depth seasonal change and special morphometric changes on stratification stability the contribution of rainfall to the lake stratification was minimal instead the vital roles of wind condition in the formation and destruction of thermal stratification and also heat storage were revealed through adjusting wind conditions the overflow and underflow related to the air temperature created inverse circulations that significantly influenced the stratification the development and application of our 3d hydrodynamic model not only enhanced the understanding of the thermal structure of the tarago reservoir but also provides a feasible method for discovering the role of external factors in the thermal structure of waterbodies future work will focus on using the developed model to assess manganese transport in the tarago reservoir because manganese spikes are regularly recorded in the raw water of the twtp during turnover events funding this research was partially funded by the australian government through the australian research council arc lp160100217 credit authorship contribution
