2760,ongoing climate change considerably affects terrestrial aridity from multiple perspectives as a typical sharp zonal aridity gradient china s hu line effectively divides the country into the arid northwest and the humid southeast and has exerted profound impacts on human settlement agricultural and socio economic development previous studies of regions experiencing sharp zonal aridity gradients e g the 100th meridian in the usa and the sahel belt in northern africa reported significant and widespread aridity changes in the context of anthropogenic climate change yet how changes in aridity may geographically shift the hu line remains unknown here we assess the historical and future shifts of the hu line from agroecological atmospheric and hydrologic perspectives our results show that the effective arid humid divide from the agroecological perspective has moved northwest with a mean shift of 0 48 over 1982 2016 whereas from the atmospheric and hydrologic perspectives its position remains effectively unchanged very small northwest movements over the past 35 years for future periods under a high emission scenario ssp585 the effective arid humid divides from all three perspectives move northwest towards the end of the 21st century suggesting an overall decrease of agroecological atmospheric and hydrologic aridity in the region in addition we find that vegetation response to elevated atmospheric co2 concentration plays a key role in determining the predicted shifts of the hu line which alleviates aridity increases under warming and effectively drives the arid humid divides toward more arid northwest our finding of the northwest movement of the hu line under future climate change in particular due to rising co2 suggests a future potential for expansion of china s agricultural and socioeconomy northwest and also sheds light on studying other regions experiencing sharp zonal aridity gradients keywords the hu line aridity change agroecological aridity hydrologic aridity atmospheric aridity vegetation co2 fertilization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction there are several regions experiencing sharp zonal aridity gradients in the world and studying their dynamics under past and future climate change provided enhanced process understanding of these climate change hotspots two prominent examples are the 100th meridian in the usa powell 1879 seager et al 2018 and the sahel belt in northern africa br√∂nnimann et al 2015 thomas and nigam 2018 a third region exhibiting a sharp zonal aridity gradient named after a famous chinese geographer is the hu line hu 1935 which is an important internal division in china chen et al 2016 the hu line roughly corresponds to the frontier of the east asian monsoon and is a precipitation isopleth of 400 mm yr 1 which forms a sharp zonal aridity gradient from southeast to northwest in the surrounding region that effectively divides mainland china into the arid west and humid east liu 2019 zhang et al 2021b the hu line travels diagonally across china from the city of heihe in the northeast to tengchong in the southwest fig 1 a and divides china into the well populated east and sparsely populated west hu 1990 according to china s 2010 census 94 of the population lives on 43 of the country s area southeast of the hu line with the population density 22 times higher than that on the northwest side of the hu line 325 84 versus 14 68 people per km2 wu and zhu 2016 recent national economic statistics show that the per capita gdp in provinces east of the hu line is about 15 higher than those to the west yin et al 2016 this striking demographic and socioeconomic contrast is largely driven by the contrast of natural environmental conditions on the two sides of the hu line as a result the land to the east of the hu line is generally covered by forests and croplands with abundant water resources hu 1990 wang et al 1995 in direct contrast to the west the vegetation cover is low grassland and desert are the main land use types and water resources are often extremely limited hu 1990 wang et al 1995 anthropogenic climate change has exerted a profound impact on earth s climate system with changes in aridity widely documented in different parts of the world cook et al 2004 gao et al 2015 ramarao et al 2019 for the regions surrounding the hu line changes in aridity may geographically shift the hu line for example increased aridity in the region effectively indicates a movement of the hu line towards the more humid southeast which may substantially impact human settlement and agriculture development and consequently alter the socioeconomic structures zhang et al 2021a therefore this study aims to assess changes in aridity in the hu line region and to quantify the shift of the hu line for the historical period and under future climate change scenarios traditionally aridity is assessed using the aridity index ai which is defined as the ratio of mean annual precipitation p over mean annual potential evapotranspiration e p that quantifies the relative magnitudes of atmospheric water supply and demand feng and fu 2013 sherwood et al 2014 greve et al 2019 however aridity is a multifaced phenomenon lian et al 2021 whereas ai only measures aridity from an atmospheric perspective previous studies have demonstrated that changes in atmospheric aridity may be largely decoupled from changes in aridity over land yang et al 2018 indicating that using ai only is not an adequate single measure of the overall wetting drying trend over land roderick et al 2015 greve and seneviratne 2015 he et al 2019 here we follow a more comprehensive framework for assessing aridity change that considers aridity from atmospheric hydrologic and agroecological perspectives lian et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 in addition to ai to indicate atmospheric aridity surface runoff q and vegetation productivity are respectively used to assess aridity from hydrologic and agroecological perspectives lian et al 2021 dai 2016 roderick et al 2015 he et al 2019 compared with ai q and vegetation productivity are of more direct relevance to human needs as the changes may impose a larger impact on modifying the human settlement and agriculture development in section 2 the method for identifying the line of effective arid humid division and the data used in this study are described in section 3 we present results on aridity changes and the shifts of the effective arid humid divide lines from the three perspectives for the historical period 1982 2016 and future climate change towards to end of the 21st century under a high emission scenario ssp585 additionally the effects of vegetation responses to elevated atmospheric co2 concentration co2 on aridity changes and the associated shifts of the hu line are investigated discussions on key findings are made in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 data 2 1 1 historical observation data to assess agroecological aridity for the historical period we collected half monthly leaf area index lai data estimated based on the global inventory modeling and mapping studies 3 g gimms 3 g normalized difference vegetation index ndvi from 1982 to 2016 with a spatial resolution of 1 12 zhu et al 2013 for historical atmospheric aridity monthly gridded p and e p were taken from the climate research unit cru version 4 global terrestrial surface climate dataset at a spatial resolution of 0 5 for 1982 2016 harris et al 2020 for hydrologic aridity because direct observations of long term q are not publicly available in the region we consider the difference between p and actual evapotranspiration e as a surrogate of q at the mean annual scale bala et al 2008 byrne and o gorman 2015 zhang et al 2021a therefore we obtained a satellite based monthly e retrieval i e the global land evaporation amsterdam model or gleam 0 25 spatial resolution martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 for 1982 2016 and calculated mean annual q as mean annual p e 2 1 2 future climate model outputs to assess future aridity changes monthly outputs from 15 climate models that participated in the coupled model intercomparison project phase six cmip6 for the historical run 1995 2014 and future run 2021 2100 under a high emission scenario ssp585 were used meinshausen et al 2011 eyring et al 2016 https esgf node llnl gov projects cmip6 last accessed 19 june 2021 all 15 models provide the required variables for calculating ai 12 models provide estimates of q and 10 models provide estimates of lai table 1 all model outputs were resampled to a 0 5 spatial resolution using the first order conservative remapping scheme jones 1999 in addition we also obtained relevant modeling outputs from five cmip6 models i e access esm1 5 canesm2 cesm2 giss e2 1 g and ipsl cm6a lr that participated in the experiments with altered plant physiology specifically relevant outputs from the controlled ctrl experiment and the radiative only rad experiment were obtained from the cmip6 data archive http esgf node llnl gov last accessed 19 june 2021 in both experiments co2 steadily increases from the preindustrial level 285 ppm in 1850 at a rate of 1 per year for 140 years i e 1850 1989 the increased co2 impacts both radiative forcing and plant physiology in the ctrl experiment but only impacts radiative forcing in the rad experiment as a result the difference between ctrl and rad quantifies the impact of vegetation response to rising co2 on the aridity changes and the associated shifts of the arid humid divides 2 2 calculation of potential evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration for climate models is calculated using the original penman monteith reference crop evapotranspiration model allen et al 1998 and a modified penman monteith reference crop evapotranspiration model that accounts for the plant physiological response to elevated co2 yang et al 2019 the original penman monteith reference crop evapotranspiration model calculates e p as allen et al 1998 1 e p 0 408 Œ¥ r n Œ≥ 900 t 273 u d Œ¥ Œ≥ 1 0 34 Œº where r n is the net radiation mj m 2 day 1 Œ¥ is the slope of vapor

modified penman monteith reference crop evapotranspiration model considers the effect of elevated co2 on plant water use and calculates e p denoted as e p co2 as yang et al 2019 2 e p c o 2 0 408 Œ¥ r

model meteorological outputs usually have large biases in the spatial pattern seager et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 to avoid such biases we adopted a simple bias correction for cmip6 model based ai to ensure the spatial pattern of cmip6 model based ai is consistent with that of observation based ai while retaining the temporal changes in cmip6 models seager et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 specifically we firstly obtained the fractional change in cmip6 model based ai for each grid cell eq 3 and then multiplied that fractional change with the observation based ai for the historical period eq 4 3 Œ± a i c m i p 6 f a i c m i p 6 h 4 a i f Œ± a i cru h where subscripts cmip6 and cru refer to cmip6 models and cru climate data and subscripts h and f refer to historical and future periods respectively 2 4 the budyko model for runoff calculation the budyko hydro climatological model is used here to estimate mean annual q as an independent analysis of the impact of vegetation response to elevated co2 on hydrologic aridity choudhury s 1999 formulation of the budyko curve is used 5 q p e p p e p p n e p n 1 n where n is a unitless parameter encoding all factors other than mean annual p and mean annual e p that affects the surface hydrologic partitioning a universal value of n 1 9 is used here choudhury 1999 yang et al 2019 the impact of vegetation response to elevated co2 on q is assessed by comparing the budyko estimated q forced with e p and e p co2 termed as q budyko and q budyko co2 please note that we also used the original curve of budyko 1974 and obtained more or less the same results supplementary fig s1 2 5 determination of arid humid divide to determine the arid humid divide we first define the hu line region as the region 10 northwest and southeast surrounding the original hu line and divide the region into eight northwest southeast oriented strips an interval of 6 see fig 1 a then we apply the polyfit maximum approach yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 for each aridity metric i e lai ai and q and consider the greatest change in the northwest southeast gradient of a metric as the effective hu line or the effective arid humid divide of that metric specifically for each of the eight northwest southeast oriented strips we use a fourth degree polynomial function to fit the relationship between the objective variable i e lai ai q and the corresponding location index Œª starts from 1 for the northwest grid and increases sequentially to 20 000 at an interval of 0 001 which defines the southeast boundary of the hu line region see fig 1 6 y b 0 b 1 Œª b 2 Œª 2 b 3 Œª 3 b 4 Œª 4 where bi i 0 1 2 3 4 are fitted coefficients and y is the objective variable i e lai ai q a first order partial differential with respect to Œª is performed for the fitted eq 6 and the Œª corresponding to the local maximum was deemed to be the location of the effective arid humid divide for that northwest southeast strip fig 1 shows an example of determining the mean effective arid humid divide of lai over the hu line region for the 1982 2016 historical period a test of using different fitting curves is summarized in supplementary figs s2 and s3 and table s1 3 results 3 1 historical shifts of the arid humid divides the spatial patterns of mean annual lai ai and q over 1982 2016 are shown in fig 2 a c a clear northwest southeast gradient for all three aridity metrics exists across the hu line region with lower aridity in the southeast and higher aridity in the northwest by applying the polyfit maximum approach for each historical decade i e the 1980s 1990s 2000s and 2010s we identify the effective arid humid divide for the three perspectives for each decade we find that compared with the 1980s the mean lai or agroecological aridity divide exhibits a clear northwest shift in the 1990s 0 33 2000s 0 23 and 2010s 0 48 suggesting an overall decreasing agroecological aridity during the past 35 years fig 2d however the movement of the lai divide is neither uniform across the hu line region nor monotonic over time compared with the 1980s larger shifts of the lai divide are generally found in the northern parts of the region in the 1990s and the central parts in the 2000s and 2010s in addition the shifts in the lai divide in the 2000s are generally smaller than those in the 1990s and 2010s for nearly all sub regions implying a decreased regional greening trend in the 2000s which is likely caused by a relatively drier climate condition during that decade a similar approach is used to assess the shifts of the effective arid humid divide from the atmospheric and hydrologic perspectives fig 2e and f different from the lai divide the mean ai and q divides remain more or less unchanged over the past 35 years the mean ai and q divides moved 0 002 and 0 08 towards the northwest respectively in 2010 2016 compared to 1982 1989 suggesting that the mean atmospheric and hydrologic aridity perspectives remained relatively constant nevertheless the relatively small mean shifts in the ai and q divides are caused by the northwest shifts of the divides in the northern parts of the region that are largely offset by the southwest shifts of the divides in the central parts of the region moreover both ai and q divides show southeast movements in the 2000s which is consistent with the reduced greening trend reported there during that period park and sohn 2010 3 2 shifts of the arid humid divides under future climate change the shifts of the future arid humid divides are assessed by comparing the divides in each sequential 20 year period over 2021 2100 i e 2021 2040 2041 2060 2061 2080 and 2081 2100 against those in the historical baseline period i e 1995 2014 in addition as the plant responses to elevated co2 are accounted for in cmip6 models e p co2 is used to calculate ai denoted ai co2 to assess atmospheric aridity change results show that the mean arid humid divides from all three perspectives exhibit consistent northwest movements towards the end of the 21st century in the ensemble mean of the cmip6 models figs 3 and 4 the largest shift was found in the lai divide followed by the q divide and the ai co2 divide compared with the 1995 2014 baseline in 2081 2100 the mean divide for the three perspectives are projected to move northwestward indicated by a negative value by i 3 0 for lai ranges between 0 004 and 4 33 for the 10 individual models ii 0 73 for q ranges between 0 02 and 1 79 for the 12 individual models and iii 0 27 for ai co2 ranges between 1 79 and 0 65 for the 15 individual models table 2 in other words for lai q and ai co2 respectively the dividing line is projected to move at 0 36 0 10 and 0 03 per decade over the coming century fig 4 these results indicate an overall decreasing aridity trend from all three perspectives for the coming century in the cmip6 projections under the high emission scenario i e ssp585 spatially the northwest movements of the lai and q divides are more uniformly distributed across the region although both divides show larger shifts in the north compared to those in the south additionally the northwest movements of the lai and q divides are also more consistently found in individual cmip6 models all individual models that report lai or q predict a northwest movement in the lai or q divide table 2 in comparison the shifts of the ai co2 divide show a more complex zonal pattern with the divide in the far northeast region and the central region showing a southwest movement and other regions showing a northwest movement of the 15 cmip6 models used here 10 models predict an overall northwest movement of the ai co2 divide while the remaining 5 models predict an overall southeast movement of the ai co2 divide table 2 3 3 impact of vegetation response to elevated co2 on the shift of the arid humid divides fig 5 a shows that atmospheric aridity based on ai without plant response to elevated co2 shows widespread increases across the hu line region at the end of the 21st century 2081 2100 compared with the 1995 2014 baseline resulting in a spatially averaged southeast movement of the ai divide by 0 49 between the two periods ranges between 0 90 and 3 60 for the 15 individual models fig 5c and table 2 in direct contrast atmospheric aridity assessed with ai co2 with plant response to elevated co2 shows much milder positive changes or even negative changes in the hu line region leading to a spatially averaged northwest movement of the ai co2 divide by 0 27 between the two periods fig 5a 5c and table 2 as for the hydrologic aridity the arid humid divide assessed with q budyko and q budyko co2 both show a northwest movement relative to the 1995 2014 baseline the mean q budyko divide moves 0 50 northwest ranges between 1 90 and 0 38 for the 15 individual models in 2081 2100 in comparison the mean q budyko co2 divide moves 0 73 to the northwest ranges between 2 18 and 0 07 for the 15 individual models between the two periods which is consistent with the direct cmip6 q output and suggests that vegetation response to elevated co2 will lead to a further northwest movement of the hydrologic divide by 0 23 over the coming century fig 6 shows cmip6 modelled average changes from the five cmip6 models previously mentioned in section 2 1 2 that encoded co2 dependent plant physiological processes in lai aridity index and q under experiments with ctrl and without rad plant response to elevated co2 and the associated shifts of the arid humid divides between the first and last 20 year modeling periods it is clearly seen that compared with rad changes in lai ai co2 and q are universally more positive throughout the hu line region under the ctrl experiment which again confirms that vegetation response to elevated co2 reduces aridity from all three perspectives consequently the effective arid humid divides show further movements toward the northwest in ctrl compared with rad between the two modeling periods in rad the agroecological and hydrologic divides move northwest by 0 63 and 2 04 in the last 20 year period co2 is 1017 72 ppm relative to the first 20 year period co2 is 309 26 ppm whereas the two divides move northwest by 2 99 and 2 61 between the two periods under the ctrl experiment a larger contrast is found for the atmospheric divide which shows a mean shift toward the southeast 0 67 in rad and reverses to a northwest movement 0 23 in ctrl between the two modeling periods 4 discussion the hu line is a natural arid humid divide in china and like the 100th meridian in the usa and the sahel belt in northern africa it has profound impacts on human settlement and socioeconomic development with ongoing climate change aridity in the hu line region has experienced changes that resulted in shifts of the effective arid humid divides our results indicate that the effective arid humid divide moved northwest from atmospheric hydrologic and agroecological perspectives over the past 35 years revealing an overall decreased aridity from these three perspectives in the region fig 2 however the three aridity metrics show different changes and the effective arid humid divides based on these metrics also exhibit varying magnitudes of movement in comparison to the agroecological divide which experienced a notable northwest movement over the past 35 years the movements of the atmospheric and hydrologic divides are very minor fig 2 please note that similar results are also obtained based on the cmip6 model outputs for the historical period supplementary fig s4 a more evident contrast is found for the 2000s during which the agroecological divide moves in the opposite direction i e to the northwest compared to the movements of the atmospheric and hydrologic divides i e to the southeast relative to the 1980s fig 2 these results demonstrate a disconnection in the aridity changes from the three perspectives and highlight the need to assess aridity from different aspects to gain a complete picture of aridity changes as advocated previously yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a lian et al 2021 in addition the northwest shifts of the effective arid humid divides are projected to persist into future climate under a high emission scenario figs 3 and 4 we find that relative to the 1995 2014 baseline the atmospheric hydrologic and agroecological divides are simulated to move northwest by 0 27 0 73 and 3 00 respectively in the last 20 years of the 21st century i e 2081 2100 this indicates that future climate change would induce an overall wetting trend in the region which potentially favors an expansion of agriculture and human settlement toward more arid areas on the northwest side of the hu line under future climate change we further examined the impacts of vegetation response to elevated co2 on the regional aridity changes and found that the simulated future northwest movements of the effective arid humid divides are largely driven by the vegetation response to elevated co2 figs 5 and 6 on the one hand elevated co2 is the main ultimate driver of anthropogenic climate change leading to a higher e p and thus ai in the region that drives the ai divide moving toward the more humid southeast fig 5a 5c and 6d f on the other hand elevated co2 directly affects vegetation water use by inducing partial stomatal closure ainsworth and rogers 2007 norby et al 1999 a previous study demonstrated that the vegetation response to elevated co2 would incur an overall water saving effect in climate models and developed a simple e p co2 model eq 2 to account for that water saving effect yang et al 2019 here we adopted that approach and found that the 2081 2100 ai co 2 based atmospheric divide was simulated to move in the opposite direction compared with that based on ai without considering the vegetation response to co2 fig 5a 5c and 6d f this suggests that vegetation response to elevated co2 is the dominant process underlying the movement of the arid humid divide in the hu line region from the atmospheric perspective the response of vegetation to elevated co2 in also the key driver of the shift in the agroecological divide fig 6a c using outputs of five cmip6 climate models that encoded experiments with altered plant physiology we show that the agroecological divide moves northwest by 2 99 and 0 63 in the ctrl and rad experiments respectively between the last and first 20 year analysis periods fig 6c this indicates that vegetation response to elevated co2 alone has resulted in a northwest movement of the agroecological divide by 2 36 or 80 of the total shift this result is consistent with previous findings zhu et al 2016 chen et al 2019 that elevated co2 is primarily responsible for the observed vegetation greening across majority of the global terrestrial surface over the past few decades this increase in vegetation greening is mainly caused by enhanced vegetation water use efficiency as co2 rises that have been reported in glasshouse experiments field scale experiments and globally using satellite data donohue et al 2013 polley et al 1992 swann et al 2016 cernusak et al 2019 in comparison to the predominant control of vegetation response to elevated co2 on the shifts of the atmospheric and agroecological divides the impact of vegetation response to elevated co2 on the hydrologic divide is relatively smaller fig 5b 5d and 6g i compared between the last and first 20 year analysis periods in the experiments with altered plant physiology the hydrologic divide was simulated to move northwest by 2 61 and 2 04 in the ctrl and rad experiments respectively this implies that vegetation response to elevated co2 only accounts for 20 of the total movement a similar finding is obtained by comparing the budyko estimated q with and without considering the vegetation co2 effect on e p in that comparison we estimate about 30 of the total hydrologic divide movement that is induced by the vegetation co2 effect fig 5d this is not surprising as changes in q is generally more closely related to changes in p and often disconnected with changes in e p especially in relatively dry regions yang et al 2018 babst et al 2019 yang et al 2021 nevertheless despite the relatively minor role of the vegetation co2 effect on the shift of the hydrologic divide incorporating the vegetation co2 effect leads to a better agreement between the budyko estimated q and the direct q output of cmip6 models table 2 this demonstrates the importance of accounting for the vegetation co2 effect in the offline assessment of hydrological changes yang et al 2020 our findings for the shifts of the effective arid humid divides for the hu line region is largely consistent with zhang et al 2021 who examined the shifts of the 100th meridian in the usa under historical and future climate change they reported that the agroecological divide moves toward the more arid west and the vegetation response to elevated co2 considerably slowed the eastern movements of the atmospheric and hydrologic divides these suggest that anthropogenic climate change in particular elevated co2 would actually lead to an expansion of more humid zones in two of the largest countries in the world nevertheless whether and to what extent these findings hold for other regions require further effort to answer 5 conclusion in this study we examined the shifts of a sharp zonal aridity gradient i e china s hu line over the past 35 years 1982 2016 and for the coming century from the agroecological atmospheric and hydrologic perspectives we find that the effective arid humid divides from all three perspectives generally show consistent northwest movements over the study period suggesting an overall decreased agroecological atmospheric and hydrologic aridities in the region for historical assessments that are based on observations the agroecological atmospheric and hydrologic divides moved toward northwest by 0 48 0 002 and 0 08 respectively in the 2010s compared to the 1980s for future periods under a high emission climate change scenario the multi model ensemble means predict northwest shifts of the agroecological atmospheric and hydrologic divides by 3 0 0 27 and 0 73 respectively in the 2081 2100 period relative to the 1995 2014 baseline in addition we find that vegetation response to elevated co2 plays an important role in determining the predicted shifts of the effective arid humid divides which accelerates the northwest movements of the agroecological and hydrologic divides and reverses the direction of movement for the atmospheric divide from the southeast to the northwest for the coming century our findings indicate that future climate change would induce an overall wetting trend in the region which potentially favors an expansion of agriculture and human settlement toward more arid northwest under future climate change 6 data availability

2760,ongoing climate change considerably affects terrestrial aridity from multiple perspectives as a typical sharp zonal aridity gradient china s hu line effectively divides the country into the arid northwest and the humid southeast and has exerted profound impacts on human settlement agricultural and socio economic development previous studies of regions experiencing sharp zonal aridity gradients e g the 100th meridian in the usa and the sahel belt in northern africa reported significant and widespread aridity changes in the context of anthropogenic climate change yet how changes in aridity may geographically shift the hu line remains unknown here we assess the historical and future shifts of the hu line from agroecological atmospheric and hydrologic perspectives our results show that the effective arid humid divide from the agroecological perspective has moved northwest with a mean shift of 0 48 over 1982 2016 whereas from the atmospheric and hydrologic perspectives its position remains effectively unchanged very small northwest movements over the past 35 years for future periods under a high emission scenario ssp585 the effective arid humid divides from all three perspectives move northwest towards the end of the 21st century suggesting an overall decrease of agroecological atmospheric and hydrologic aridity in the region in addition we find that vegetation response to elevated atmospheric co2 concentration plays a key role in determining the predicted shifts of the hu line which alleviates aridity increases under warming and effectively drives the arid humid divides toward more arid northwest our finding of the northwest movement of the hu line under future climate change in particular due to rising co2 suggests a future potential for expansion of china s agricultural and socioeconomy northwest and also sheds light on studying other regions experiencing sharp zonal aridity gradients keywords the hu line aridity change agroecological aridity hydrologic aridity atmospheric aridity vegetation co2 fertilization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction there are several regions experiencing sharp zonal aridity gradients in the world and studying their dynamics under past and future climate change provided enhanced process understanding of these climate change hotspots two prominent examples are the 100th meridian in the usa powell 1879 seager et al 2018 and the sahel belt in northern africa br√∂nnimann et al 2015 thomas and nigam 2018 a third region exhibiting a sharp zonal aridity gradient named after a famous chinese geographer is the hu line hu 1935 which is an important internal division in china chen et al 2016 the hu line roughly corresponds to the frontier of the east asian monsoon and is a precipitation isopleth of 400 mm yr 1 which forms a sharp zonal aridity gradient from southeast to northwest in the surrounding region that effectively divides mainland china into the arid west and humid east liu 2019 zhang et al 2021b the hu line travels diagonally across china from the city of heihe in the northeast to tengchong in the southwest fig 1 a and divides china into the well populated east and sparsely populated west hu 1990 according to china s 2010 census 94 of the population lives on 43 of the country s area southeast of the hu line with the population density 22 times higher than that on the northwest side of the hu line 325 84 versus 14 68 people per km2 wu and zhu 2016 recent national economic statistics show that the per capita gdp in provinces east of the hu line is about 15 higher than those to the west yin et al 2016 this striking demographic and socioeconomic contrast is largely driven by the contrast of natural environmental conditions on the two sides of the hu line as a result the land to the east of the hu line is generally covered by forests and croplands with abundant water resources hu 1990 wang et al 1995 in direct contrast to the west the vegetation cover is low grassland and desert are the main land use types and water resources are often extremely limited hu 1990 wang et al 1995 anthropogenic climate change has exerted a profound impact on earth s climate system with changes in aridity widely documented in different parts of the world cook et al 2004 gao et al 2015 ramarao et al 2019 for the regions surrounding the hu line changes in aridity may geographically shift the hu line for example increased aridity in the region effectively indicates a movement of the hu line towards the more humid southeast which may substantially impact human settlement and agriculture development and consequently alter the socioeconomic structures zhang et al 2021a therefore this study aims to assess changes in aridity in the hu line region and to quantify the shift of the hu line for the historical period and under future climate change scenarios traditionally aridity is assessed using the aridity index ai which is defined as the ratio of mean annual precipitation p over mean annual potential evapotranspiration e p that quantifies the relative magnitudes of atmospheric water supply and demand feng and fu 2013 sherwood et al 2014 greve et al 2019 however aridity is a multifaced phenomenon lian et al 2021 whereas ai only measures aridity from an atmospheric perspective previous studies have demonstrated that changes in atmospheric aridity may be largely decoupled from changes in aridity over land yang et al 2018 indicating that using ai only is not an adequate single measure of the overall wetting drying trend over land roderick et al 2015 greve and seneviratne 2015 he et al 2019 here we follow a more comprehensive framework for assessing aridity change that considers aridity from atmospheric hydrologic and agroecological perspectives lian et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 in addition to ai to indicate atmospheric aridity surface runoff q and vegetation productivity are respectively used to assess aridity from hydrologic and agroecological perspectives lian et al 2021 dai 2016 roderick et al 2015 he et al 2019 compared with ai q and vegetation productivity are of more direct relevance to human needs as the changes may impose a larger impact on modifying the human settlement and agriculture development in section 2 the method for identifying the line of effective arid humid division and the data used in this study are described in section 3 we present results on aridity changes and the shifts of the effective arid humid divide lines from the three perspectives for the historical period 1982 2016 and future climate change towards to end of the 21st century under a high emission scenario ssp585 additionally the effects of vegetation responses to elevated atmospheric co2 concentration co2 on aridity changes and the associated shifts of the hu line are investigated discussions on key findings are made in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 data 2 1 1 historical observation data to assess agroecological aridity for the historical period we collected half monthly leaf area index lai data estimated based on the global inventory modeling and mapping studies 3 g gimms 3 g normalized difference vegetation index ndvi from 1982 to 2016 with a spatial resolution of 1 12 zhu et al 2013 for historical atmospheric aridity monthly gridded p and e p were taken from the climate research unit cru version 4 global terrestrial surface climate dataset at a spatial resolution of 0 5 for 1982 2016 harris et al 2020 for hydrologic aridity because direct observations of long term q are not publicly available in the region we consider the difference between p and actual evapotranspiration e as a surrogate of q at the mean annual scale bala et al 2008 byrne and o gorman 2015 zhang et al 2021a therefore we obtained a satellite based monthly e retrieval i e the global land evaporation amsterdam model or gleam 0 25 spatial resolution martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 for 1982 2016 and calculated mean annual q as mean annual p e 2 1 2 future climate model outputs to assess future aridity changes monthly outputs from 15 climate models that participated in the coupled model intercomparison project phase six cmip6 for the historical run 1995 2014 and future run 2021 2100 under a high emission scenario ssp585 were used meinshausen et al 2011 eyring et al 2016 https esgf node llnl gov projects cmip6 last accessed 19 june 2021 all 15 models provide the required variables for calculating ai 12 models provide estimates of q and 10 models provide estimates of lai table 1 all model outputs were resampled to a 0 5 spatial resolution using the first order conservative remapping scheme jones 1999 in addition we also obtained relevant modeling outputs from five cmip6 models i e access esm1 5 canesm2 cesm2 giss e2 1 g and ipsl cm6a lr that participated in the experiments with altered plant physiology specifically relevant outputs from the controlled ctrl experiment and the radiative only rad experiment were obtained from the cmip6 data archive http esgf node llnl gov last accessed 19 june 2021 in both experiments co2 steadily increases from the preindustrial level 285 ppm in 1850 at a rate of 1 per year for 140 years i e 1850 1989 the increased co2 impacts both radiative forcing and plant physiology in the ctrl experiment but only impacts radiative forcing in the rad experiment as a result the difference between ctrl and rad quantifies the impact of vegetation response to rising co2 on the aridity changes and the associated shifts of the arid humid divides 2 2 calculation of potential evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration for climate models is calculated using the original penman monteith reference crop evapotranspiration model allen et al 1998 and a modified penman monteith reference crop evapotranspiration model that accounts for the plant physiological response to elevated co2 yang et al 2019 the original penman monteith reference crop evapotranspiration model calculates e p as allen et al 1998 1 e p 0 408 Œ¥ r n Œ≥ 900 t 273 u d Œ¥ Œ≥ 1 0 34 Œº where r n is the net radiation mj m 2 day 1 Œ¥ is the slope of vapor

model meteorological outputs usually have large biases in the spatial pattern seager et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 to avoid such biases we adopted a simple bias correction for cmip6 model based ai to ensure the spatial pattern of cmip6 model based ai is consistent with that of observation based ai while retaining the temporal changes in cmip6 models seager et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 specifically we firstly obtained the fractional change in cmip6 model based ai for each grid cell eq 3 and then multiplied that fractional change with the observation based ai for the historical period eq 4 3 Œ± a i c m i p 6 f a i c m i p 6 h 4 a i f Œ± a i cru h where subscripts cmip6 and cru refer to cmip6 models and cru climate data and subscripts h and f refer to historical and future periods respectively 2 4 the budyko model for runoff calculation the budyko hydro climatological model is used here to estimate mean annual q as an independent analysis of the impact of vegetation response to elevated co2 on hydrologic aridity choudhury s 1999 formulation of the budyko curve is used 5 q p e p p e p p n e p n 1 n where n is a unitless parameter encoding all factors other than mean annual p and mean annual e p that affects the surface hydrologic partitioning a universal value of n 1 9 is used here choudhury 1999 yang et al 2019 the impact of vegetation response to elevated co2 on q is assessed by comparing the budyko estimated q forced with e p and e p co2 termed as q budyko and q budyko co2 please note that we also used the original curve of budyko 1974 and obtained more or less the same results supplementary fig s1 2 5 determination of arid humid divide to determine the arid humid divide we first define the hu line region as the region 10 northwest and southeast surrounding the original hu line and divide the region into eight northwest southeast oriented strips an interval of 6 see fig 1 a then we apply the polyfit maximum approach yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 for each aridity metric i e lai ai and q and consider the greatest change in the northwest southeast gradient of a metric as the effective hu line or the effective arid humid divide of that metric specifically for each of the eight northwest southeast oriented strips we use a fourth degree polynomial function to fit the relationship between the objective variable i e lai ai q and the corresponding location index Œª starts from 1 for the northwest grid and increases sequentially to 20 000 at an interval of 0 001 which defines the southeast boundary of the hu line region see fig 1 6 y b 0 b 1 Œª b 2 Œª 2 b 3 Œª 3 b 4 Œª 4 where bi i 0 1 2 3 4 are fitted coefficients and y is the objective variable i e lai ai q a first order partial differential with respect to Œª is performed for the fitted eq 6 and the Œª corresponding to the local maximum was deemed to be the location of the effective arid humid divide for that northwest southeast strip fig 1 shows an example of determining the mean effective arid humid divide of lai over the hu line region for the 1982 2016 historical period a test of using different fitting curves is summarized in supplementary figs s2 and s3 and table s1 3 results 3 1 historical shifts of the arid humid divides the spatial patterns of mean annual lai ai and q over 1982 2016 are shown in fig 2 a c a clear northwest southeast gradient for all three aridity metrics exists across the hu line region with lower aridity in the southeast and higher aridity in the northwest by applying the polyfit maximum approach for each historical decade i e the 1980s 1990s 2000s and 2010s we identify the effective arid humid divide for the three perspectives for each decade we find that compared with the 1980s the mean lai or agroecological aridity divide exhibits a clear northwest shift in the 1990s 0 33 2000s 0 23 and 2010s 0 48 suggesting an overall decreasing agroecological aridity during the past 35 years fig 2d however the movement of the lai divide is neither uniform across the hu line region nor monotonic over time compared with the 1980s larger shifts of the lai divide are generally found in the northern parts of the region in the 1990s and the central parts in the 2000s and 2010s in addition the shifts in the lai divide in the 2000s are generally smaller than those in the 1990s and 2010s for nearly all sub regions implying a decreased regional greening trend in the 2000s which is likely caused by a relatively drier climate condition during that decade a similar approach is used to assess the shifts of the effective arid humid divide from the atmospheric and hydrologic perspectives fig 2e and f different from the lai divide the mean ai and q divides remain more or less unchanged over the past 35 years the mean ai and q divides moved 0 002 and 0 08 towards the northwest respectively in 2010 2016 compared to 1982 1989 suggesting that the mean atmospheric and hydrologic aridity perspectives remained relatively constant nevertheless the relatively small mean shifts in the ai and q divides are caused by the northwest shifts of the divides in the northern parts of the region that are largely offset by the southwest shifts of the divides in the central parts of the region moreover both ai and q divides show southeast movements in the 2000s which is consistent with the reduced greening trend reported there during that period park and sohn 2010 3 2 shifts of the arid humid divides under future climate change the shifts of the future arid humid divides are assessed by comparing the divides in each sequential 20 year period over 2021 2100 i e 2021 2040 2041 2060 2061 2080 and 2081 2100 against those in the historical baseline period i e 1995 2014 in addition as the plant responses to elevated co2 are accounted for in cmip6 models e p co2 is used to calculate ai denoted ai co2 to assess atmospheric aridity change results show that the mean arid humid divides from all three perspectives exhibit consistent northwest movements towards the end of the 21st century in the ensemble mean of the cmip6 models figs 3 and 4 the largest shift was found in the lai divide followed by the q divide and the ai co2 divide compared with the 1995 2014 baseline in 2081 2100 the mean divide for the three perspectives are projected to move northwestward indicated by a negative value by i 3 0 for lai ranges between 0 004 and 4 33 for the 10 individual models ii 0 73 for q ranges between 0 02 and 1 79 for the 12 individual models and iii 0 27 for ai co2 ranges between 1 79 and 0 65 for the 15 individual models table 2 in other words for lai q and ai co2 respectively the dividing line is projected to move at 0 36 0 10 and 0 03 per decade over the coming century fig 4 these results indicate an overall decreasing aridity trend from all three perspectives for the coming century in the cmip6 projections under the high emission scenario i e ssp585 spatially the northwest movements of the lai and q divides are more uniformly distributed across the region although both divides show larger shifts in the north compared to those in the south additionally the northwest movements of the lai and q divides are also more consistently found in individual cmip6 models all individual models that report lai or q predict a northwest movement in the lai or q divide table 2 in comparison the shifts of the ai co2 divide show a more complex zonal pattern with the divide in the far northeast region and the central region showing a southwest movement and other regions showing a northwest movement of the 15 cmip6 models used here 10 models predict an overall northwest movement of the ai co2 divide while the remaining 5 models predict an overall southeast movement of the ai co2 divide table 2 3 3 impact of vegetation response to elevated co2 on the shift of the arid humid divides fig 5 a shows that atmospheric aridity based on ai without plant response to elevated co2 shows widespread increases across the hu line region at the end of the 21st century 2081 2100 compared with the 1995 2014 baseline resulting in a spatially averaged southeast movement of the ai divide by 0 49 between the two periods ranges between 0 90 and 3 60 for the 15 individual models fig 5c and table 2 in direct contrast atmospheric aridity assessed with ai co2 with plant response to elevated co2 shows much milder positive changes or even negative changes in the hu line region leading to a spatially averaged northwest movement of the ai co2 divide by 0 27 between the two periods fig 5a 5c and table 2 as for the hydrologic aridity the arid humid divide assessed with q budyko and q budyko co2 both show a northwest movement relative to the 1995 2014 baseline the mean q budyko divide moves 0 50 northwest ranges between 1 90 and 0 38 for the 15 individual models in 2081 2100 in comparison the mean q budyko co2 divide moves 0 73 to the northwest ranges between 2 18 and 0 07 for the 15 individual models between the two periods which is consistent with the direct cmip6 q output and suggests that vegetation response to elevated co2 will lead to a further northwest movement of the hydrologic divide by 0 23 over the coming century fig 6 shows cmip6 modelled average changes from the five cmip6 models previously mentioned in section 2 1 2 that encoded co2 dependent plant physiological processes in lai aridity index and q under experiments with ctrl and without rad plant response to elevated co2 and the associated shifts of the arid humid divides between the first and last 20 year modeling periods it is clearly seen that compared with rad changes in lai ai co2 and q are universally more positive throughout the hu line region under the ctrl experiment which again confirms that vegetation response to elevated co2 reduces aridity from all three perspectives consequently the effective arid humid divides show further movements toward the northwest in ctrl compared with rad between the two modeling periods in rad the agroecological and hydrologic divides move northwest by 0 63 and 2 04 in the last 20 year period co2 is 1017 72 ppm relative to the first 20 year period co2 is 309 26 ppm whereas the two divides move northwest by 2 99 and 2 61 between the two periods under the ctrl experiment a larger contrast is found for the atmospheric divide which shows a mean shift toward the southeast 0 67 in rad and reverses to a northwest movement 0 23 in ctrl between the two modeling periods 4 discussion the hu line is a natural arid humid divide in china and like the 100th meridian in the usa and the sahel belt in northern africa it has profound impacts on human settlement and socioeconomic development with ongoing climate change aridity in the hu line region has experienced changes that resulted in shifts of the effective arid humid divides our results indicate that the effective arid humid divide moved northwest from atmospheric hydrologic and agroecological perspectives over the past 35 years revealing an overall decreased aridity from these three perspectives in the region fig 2 however the three aridity metrics show different changes and the effective arid humid divides based on these metrics also exhibit varying magnitudes of movement in comparison to the agroecological divide which experienced a notable northwest movement over the past 35 years the movements of the atmospheric and hydrologic divides are very minor fig 2 please note that similar results are also obtained based on the cmip6 model outputs for the historical period supplementary fig s4 a more evident contrast is found for the 2000s during which the agroecological divide moves in the opposite direction i e to the northwest compared to the movements of the atmospheric and hydrologic divides i e to the southeast relative to the 1980s fig 2 these results demonstrate a disconnection in the aridity changes from the three perspectives and highlight the need to assess aridity from different aspects to gain a complete picture of aridity changes as advocated previously yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a lian et al 2021 in addition the northwest shifts of the effective arid humid divides are projected to persist into future climate under a high emission scenario figs 3 and 4 we find that relative to the 1995 2014 baseline the atmospheric hydrologic and agroecological divides are simulated to move northwest by 0 27 0 73 and 3 00 respectively in the last 20 years of the 21st century i e 2081 2100 this indicates that future climate change would induce an overall wetting trend in the region which potentially favors an expansion of agriculture and human settlement toward more arid areas on the northwest side of the hu line under future climate change we further examined the impacts of vegetation response to elevated co2 on the regional aridity changes and found that the simulated future northwest movements of the effective arid humid divides are largely driven by the vegetation response to elevated co2 figs 5 and 6 on the one hand elevated co2 is the main ultimate driver of anthropogenic climate change leading to a higher e p and thus ai in the region that drives the ai divide moving toward the more humid southeast fig 5a 5c and 6d f on the other hand elevated co2 directly affects vegetation water use by inducing partial stomatal closure ainsworth and rogers 2007 norby et al 1999 a previous study demonstrated that the vegetation response to elevated co2 would incur an overall water saving effect in climate models and developed a simple e p co2 model eq 2 to account for that water saving effect yang et al 2019 here we adopted that approach and found that the 2081 2100 ai co 2 based atmospheric divide was simulated to move in the opposite direction compared with that based on ai without considering the vegetation response to co2 fig 5a 5c and 6d f this suggests that vegetation response to elevated co2 is the dominant process underlying the movement of the arid humid divide in the hu line region from the atmospheric perspective the response of vegetation to elevated co2 in also the key driver of the shift in the agroecological divide fig 6a c using outputs of five cmip6 climate models that encoded experiments with altered plant physiology we show that the agroecological divide moves northwest by 2 99 and 0 63 in the ctrl and rad experiments respectively between the last and first 20 year analysis periods fig 6c this indicates that vegetation response to elevated co2 alone has resulted in a northwest movement of the agroecological divide by 2 36 or 80 of the total shift this result is consistent with previous findings zhu et al 2016 chen et al 2019 that elevated co2 is primarily responsible for the observed vegetation greening across majority of the global terrestrial surface over the past few decades this increase in vegetation greening is mainly caused by enhanced vegetation water use efficiency as co2 rises that have been reported in glasshouse experiments field scale experiments and globally using satellite data donohue et al 2013 polley et al 1992 swann et al 2016 cernusak et al 2019 in comparison to the predominant control of vegetation response to elevated co2 on the shifts of the atmospheric and agroecological divides the impact of vegetation response to elevated co2 on the hydrologic divide is relatively smaller fig 5b 5d and 6g i compared between the last and first 20 year analysis periods in the experiments with altered plant physiology the hydrologic divide was simulated to move northwest by 2 61 and 2 04 in the ctrl and rad experiments respectively this implies that vegetation response to elevated co2 only accounts for 20 of the total movement a similar finding is obtained by comparing the budyko estimated q with and without considering the vegetation co2 effect on e p in that comparison we estimate about 30 of the total hydrologic divide movement that is induced by the vegetation co2 effect fig 5d this is not surprising as changes in q is generally more closely related to changes in p and often disconnected with changes in e p especially in relatively dry regions yang et al 2018 babst et al 2019 yang et al 2021 nevertheless despite the relatively minor role of the vegetation co2 effect on the shift of the hydrologic divide incorporating the vegetation co2 effect leads to a better agreement between the budyko estimated q and the direct q output of cmip6 models table 2 this demonstrates the importance of accounting for the vegetation co2 effect in the offline assessment of hydrological changes yang et al 2020 our findings for the shifts of the effective arid humid divides for the hu line region is largely consistent with zhang et al 2021 who examined the shifts of the 100th meridian in the usa under historical and future climate change they reported that the agroecological divide moves toward the more arid west and the vegetation response to elevated co2 considerably slowed the eastern movements of the atmospheric and hydrologic divides these suggest that anthropogenic climate change in particular elevated co2 would actually lead to an expansion of more humid zones in two of the largest countries in the world nevertheless whether and to what extent these findings hold for other regions require further effort to answer 5 conclusion in this study we examined the shifts of a sharp zonal aridity gradient i e china s hu line over the past 35 years 1982 2016 and for the coming century from the agroecological atmospheric and hydrologic perspectives we find that the effective arid humid divides from all three perspectives generally show consistent northwest movements over the study period suggesting an overall decreased agroecological atmospheric and hydrologic aridities in the region for historical assessments that are based on observations the agroecological atmospheric and hydrologic divides moved toward northwest by 0 48 0 002 and 0 08 respectively in the 2010s compared to the 1980s for future periods under a high emission climate change scenario the multi model ensemble means predict northwest shifts of the agroecological atmospheric and hydrologic divides by 3 0 0 27 and 0 73 respectively in the 2081 2100 period relative to the 1995 2014 baseline in addition we find that vegetation response to elevated co2 plays an important role in determining the predicted shifts of the effective arid humid divides which accelerates the northwest movements of the agroecological and hydrologic divides and reverses the direction of movement for the atmospheric divide from the southeast to the northwest for the coming century our findings indicate that future climate change would induce an overall wetting trend in the region which potentially favors an expansion of agriculture and human settlement toward more arid northwest under future climate change 6 data availability

2761,evapotranspiration et plays an essential role in the water and energy balance between the surface and the atmosphere recent decades have witnessed the generation of various land evapotranspiration products it is important to quantify their uncertainties thus to identify which one exhibits the best performance therefore to assess the performance of three popular et products namely the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis era interim and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis across chinese mainland on monthly scale the root mean square error rmse of each product was calculated at the basin scale using extended triple collocation etc together with the water balance method the results indicated that the rmses of gleam era interim and modis based on the etc method and water balance method at the basin scale are 17 63 12 04 27 41 22 90 and 40 55 31 62 mm month on average while those at the grid scale are 8 47 9 71 and 10 52 mm month respectively this finding illustrates that gleam has the best performance taking up 60 in china while modis performs the worst in addition it indicates that the etc method is a potential tool for evaluating different products and estimating their uncertainty without knowing the true value keywords evapotranspiration extended triple collocation water balance multi scale data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is water that moves from a surface to the atmosphere mainly consisting of evaporation and transpiration and is a vital component in global water and carbon cycles allan et al 2020 jim√©nez et al 2011 konapala et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 evapotranspiration is the linkage between the land surface and atmosphere via water and heat exchange brutsaert and parlange 1998 ohmura and wild 2002 wang and dickinson 2012 hence it is essential to obtain precise quantifications of et to better understand the hydrological processes and the interactions among hydrology climate and vegetation systems rodell and famiglietti 2002 to measure et there are two commonly used methods instrumental observations e g weighting lysimetric and eddy covariance system and estimations based on the water balance equation unfortunately the former is generally applicable at the site or field scales and the latter is commonly suitable for basin scale research in recent years to obtain better estimations of global et various products have been derived in different ways such as remote sensing products reanalysis products land surface model simulations and site interpolation products dirmeyer et al 2006 jung et al 2009 miralles et al 2011 mu et al 2007 mu et al 2011 onogi et al 2007 rodell et al 2004 simmons 2006 yang et al 2013 zhang et al 2009 zhang et al 2010a those existing products have been extensively applied in hydrological component estimation and variability analysis roderick and farquhar 2011 significantly large scale et estimation still faces many deficiencies due to the high spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability of et xu and singh 2005 xue et al 2013 in previous studies significant differences in performance were revealed between the et products and between regions lee et al 2012 li et al 2022 liu et al 2018 liu et al 2016 long et al 2014 zhang et al 2010b therefore it is important to evaluate and choose appropriate et products before application regarding the large scale evaluation of et products the major restriction is the lack of reference observations pan et al 2020 a potential solution to the issue is to estimate the uncertainties of et products at the basin scale by comparing them with the reference et derived using the water balance equation according to precipitation runoff and storage change sheffield et al 2009 this has been widely used in previous studies on regional scales such as the united states han et al 2015 velpuri et al 2013 and the tibetan plateau jia et al 2020 li et al 2014 xue et al 2013 and on the global scale lian et al 2018 mueller et al 2011 zeng et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 it is noteworthy that the reference et from the water balance equation is only feasible at the basin scale han et al 2020 therefore the evaluation is only limited to the basin with the measurement of precipitation runoff and storage change collocation methods can be used to estimate the uncertainties of multi geophysical products without the true value stoffelen 1998 proposed the triple collocation tc method and mccoll et al 2014 suggested the extended triple collocation etc method to derive the determination of correlations of inputs in recent years the collocation methods have been widely applied in the uncertainty estimation of various hydrological variables such as precipitation dong et al 2020b li et al 2018a wu et al 2019 soil moisture kim et al 2021 wu et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 and vegetation leaf area fang et al 2012 jiang et al 2017 roebeling et al 2012 evaluated the spatial and temporal uncertainties of three precipitation datasets over europe which were derived from satellite ground based radar and gauge data respectively and showed that the etc method provides reliable error estimates alemohammad et al 2015 estimated the uncertainties of three different precipitations over the us and found that the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm product performed better than the others moreover using the triple collocation method christopher et al 2011 estimated the error of three soil moisture products from thermal infrared data passive microwave remote sensing data and land surface modeling while van dijk et al 2014 estimated the uncertainties of terrestrial water storage change from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite data prior estimates and the resulting gain matrix to assess the performance of the grace data hence previous studies show that the etc method could be an alternative to assess the uncertainties of different products without giving true value in summary for the evaluation of various et products on large scale previous studies have chosen either the etc method or the water balance method and only selected a few basins or regions for analysis khan et al 2018 li et al 2022 in this study we aim to assess the performance of three popular et products i e gleam era interim and modis on monthly scale to identify which one performs the best in chinese mainland and further evaluate the effectiveness of etc method first at the basin scale the three products were assessed in 224 basins from 2003 to 2016 using both the etc method and the water balance method furthermore at the grid scale 0 25 their performance from 1960 to 2020 was assessed using the etc method 2 data and method 2 1 data and study area there are different types of global et products which could be classified

their area ranges from 230 km2 to 143 000 km2 with a mean of 13 170 km2 and there are 121 basins larger than 5 000 km2 moreover the mean annual precipitation et and runoff range from 300 to 2 200 mm

equation i e 8 et p r Œ¥ t w s where et p and r represent monthly evapotranspiration mm precipitation mm and runoff mm of each basin respectively Œ¥ t w s mm represents the monthly change in

results 3 1 evaluation at the basin scale as shown in fig 2 the rmses of monthly et estimated using the etc method and water balance method exhibits a similar spatial pattern for each et product for gleam large rmses mainly appear in the yellow river basin and the haihe river basin for era interim large rmses can be found in the basins across southern and southwestern china for modis small rmses mainly appear in southern china regarding the ratio of the rmse from the etc method to that from the water balance method the best values 0 8 1 2 appear in most basins except southern china for gleam they appear mainly in the upstream and midstream of the yellow river and the yangtze river for era interim and they appear in most basins for modis as shown in fig 3 the ratio mainly ranges from 0 9 to 1 3 in most basins which indicates that the two methods give similar estimates of rmse for each product in other words the etc method can be used to estimate rmse without true value as shown in fig 4 among the three products gleam has the best performance in most basins and era interim has the best performance mainly in the upstream of the yellow river basin gleam era interim and modis have best performance in 80 basins 15 basins and 5 basins respectively in general for most basins gleam outperforms the other two products with the smallest rmse while modis performs relatively the worst it is also worth noting that in some regions such as the sub basins of the yellow river and the haihe river era interim has the best performance among the three et products in addition the evaluation results of three et products show good consistency with those from water balance method with over 80 of basins presenting the same evaluation results table 2 lists the statistical indexes of rmse cc r bias and nse between the monthly et series from each product and the reference et series from the water balance method it can be found that all the indices namely rmse cc r bias and nse indicate that gleam has the best performance on the whole significantly the rmse estimated based on the water balance method is 12 mm month 23 mm month and 32 mm month for gleam era interim and modis respectively and it is similar to that estimated by etc meanwhile it is worth noting that etc has a slightly larger estimate on rmse than the water balance method fig 5 shows the cumulative curves of the rmse cc r bias and nse it can be found that gleam has the best performance with nse exceeding 0 6 in more than 60 basins and corr larger than 0 85 in 80 basins while era interim and modis have a similar performance 3 2 evaluation at the grid scale fig 6 shows that the rmses for the three products at the grid scale are not larger than 20 mm month there are larger rmses in eastern china and smaller ones in western china by comparison among the three products gleam has the lowest uncertainty in eastern china while modis has the lowest uncertainty in western china as shown in fig 7 areal average et from gleam is larger than that from modis and smaller than that from ear interim meanwhile gleam has the smallest rmse fig 8 demonstrates that gleam has the best performance in most regions taking up about 60 area while era interim performs well in several dispersed regions e g the northern qiangtang plateau downstream of the lancang river the hetao plain and some sub basins of the yangtze river the haihe river the liaohe river and the heilong river and modis performs well in some arid and semi arid regions like the west of xinjiang province the west and middle part of the tibetan plateau it is noteworthy that the estimated rmses of the three et products are very similar in some areas as illustrated in fig 6 furthermore fig 9 shows the percentage of monthly et data within a 5 or 10 rmse floating width which means that the difference in rmse of two products are within 5 or 10 at 5 rmse floating width the era interim has an equivalent performance in nearly 40 of china while it increased to more than 60 at 10 rmse floating width however the modis product has comparatively lower performance in most regions one possible explanation is that the three products have quite similar et estimation over some regions since the covariance of different datasets are used to calculate variance the results could be very close once the inputs are similar gruber et al 2020 such situations have been reported in the evaluation of soil moisture products by previous studies chen et al 2018 dong and crow 2017 4 discussion 4 1 monthly et product evaluation our result shows that gleam has the best performance among the three et products in china using both the etc and the water balance methods similar results have been reported in previous studies yang et al 2017 evaluated the performance of gleam at various temporal scales using ec observations from chinaflux as a reference in eight different ecosystems and indicated that the gleam exhibited comparable accurate performance especially at grassland sites liu et al 2018 evaluated six et products on the tibetan plateau using the water balance method together with grace data for water storage change and found that the gleam performed the best in the east asian monsoon dominated and indian monsoon dominated basins chen et al 2021 explored the applicability of three evapotranspiration products gleam gldas and era interim in the yellow river basin using the etc method and found that gleam and era interim exhibited the smallest errors using the same method li et al 2014 evaluated five et products in the east of the tibetan plateau and concluded that modis had the biggest uncertainties among the five et products liu et al 2016 chose 35 basins around the world including 4 basins in china to compare the annual et estimated by different products and also found gleam with the best performance in our study we found the estimated rmses using the water balance method are slightly higher than those by the etc method over 70 of the 224 basins for gleam and 90 for modis and 98 for era interim as shown in fig 3 moreover the difference between the estimated rmses by the two methods are significantly larger in some sub basins including the upper songhua river basin the middle yellow river basin the middle yangtze river shown in fig 2 it should be noted that the estimated et using the water balance method also contains some uncertainties on the one hand we ignored the change in deep groundwater storage while estimating Œ¥ t w s which may lead to the overestimation of et when using the water balance equation on the other hand for many small basins especially less than 5 000 km2 the spatial resolution of grace data is much larger than the basin which may lead to uncertainty in the et estimation in addition the effect by human water abstraction activities for plain terrain basins and water from melting glaciers and permafrost for plateau and mountainous area basins have been ignored which would also lead to the overestimation of et in the meanwhile the uncertainties of precipitation of cgdpa product might influence the precision of evaluation of et products 4 2 etc method our results show that the rmse estimated from the etc method is close to that derived from the water balance method for each et products this finding indicates that the calculated rmse from the etc method can be used not only to select the best products but also as the reliable uncertainty estimation of the et product moreover we found that the rmses estimated from the water balance equation are slightly lower than those derived from the etc method in many basins and even the rmse ratios of the etc method to the water balance method are up to 2 for some basins as a possible cause many et products underestimate winter et whose estimation is very close to zero for some basins especially basins located in northern china li et al 2018b mueller et al 2011 the underestimated winter et increases the rmse this study has further demonstrated the effectiveness of the etc method in estimating the uncertainties of evapotranspiration products without knowing the true value it can be used in product evaluation and selection however we should note that for the same products the evaluation result may differ on different spatial scales and for instance in midstream of the yellow river basin fig 4 a indicates that ear interim has the best performance while fig 8 shows that in most grids gleam has the best performance it can be speculated that the two products only have a little difference in rmse in this region as shown in fig 9 the etc method can be used to estimate the uncertainty of each product which indicates a data fusion method to obtain a more precise product through considering the uncertainties as weight for instance chen et al 2021 assessed the uncertainties of three et products in the yellow river basin using tc and integrated them using a fusion method it is worth noting that the result of the etc method is interrelated with the products selected especially the independence among the products as mentioned in the method part one important assumption for the extended triple collocation method is that the random errors of given inputs are expected to be independent from each other denoted as the zero ecc assumption however since different products may employ the same input for estimation this assumption is often offended in practice dong et al 2020a thus careful selection of inputs is necessary before applying collocation methods in our study both gleam and era interim use historical meteorological data from era which violates the zero ecc assumption to some extent and may introduce bias yilmaz and crow 2014 to analyze the impact of error cross correlation li et al 2022 recently employed the extended double instrumental variable method eivd which is the development of tc method dong et al 2019 to calculate the ecc value between era interim and gleam their result demonstrated that the ecc value has a limited impact on the collocation results though the combination in this study is different this influence could be considered to have an acceptable influence in addition future studies could have a further investigation on this issue 5 conclusion in this study we use the etc method to evaluate three different et products on the monthly scale namely gleam era and modis at both grid and basin scales over chinese mainland at the same time we use the water balance method to evaluate these et products at the basin scale and compare the results against the etc method our conclusions are as follows 1 the gleam product has the smallest rmse in most of chinese mainland compared with the era and modis products the rmse of the three et products at the basin scale grid scale is 17 63 8 47 mm month for gleam 27 41 9 71 mm month for era and 40 55 10 52 mm month for modis 2 gleam has the best performance in most regions taking up 60 of chinese mainland era performs well in several dispersed regions e g the northern tibetan plateau downstream of the lancang river the hetao plain and some sub basins of the yangtze river haihe river liaohe river and heilong river and modis performs well in some western regions 3 there is a high consistency in the estimated rmses from the etc method and the water balance method for 224 basins across china it indicates that the etc method is an effective method for evaluating different products and estimating their uncertainty without knowing the true value author contributions yj lc and yh

2761,evapotranspiration et plays an essential role in the water and energy balance between the surface and the atmosphere recent decades have witnessed the generation of various land evapotranspiration products it is important to quantify their uncertainties thus to identify which one exhibits the best performance therefore to assess the performance of three popular et products namely the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis era interim and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis across chinese mainland on monthly scale the root mean square error rmse of each product was calculated at the basin scale using extended triple collocation etc together with the water balance method the results indicated that the rmses of gleam era interim and modis based on the etc method and water balance method at the basin scale are 17 63 12 04 27 41 22 90 and 40 55 31 62 mm month on average while those at the grid scale are 8 47 9 71 and 10 52 mm month respectively this finding illustrates that gleam has the best performance taking up 60 in china while modis performs the worst in addition it indicates that the etc method is a potential tool for evaluating different products and estimating their uncertainty without knowing the true value keywords evapotranspiration extended triple collocation water balance multi scale data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is water that moves from a surface to the atmosphere mainly consisting of evaporation and transpiration and is a vital component in global water and carbon cycles allan et al 2020 jim√©nez et al 2011 konapala et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 evapotranspiration is the linkage between the land surface and atmosphere via water and heat exchange brutsaert and parlange 1998 ohmura and wild 2002 wang and dickinson 2012 hence it is essential to obtain precise quantifications of et to better understand the hydrological processes and the interactions among hydrology climate and vegetation systems rodell and famiglietti 2002 to measure et there are two commonly used methods instrumental observations e g weighting lysimetric and eddy covariance system and estimations based on the water balance equation unfortunately the former is generally applicable at the site or field scales and the latter is commonly suitable for basin scale research in recent years to obtain better estimations of global et various products have been derived in different ways such as remote sensing products reanalysis products land surface model simulations and site interpolation products dirmeyer et al 2006 jung et al 2009 miralles et al 2011 mu et al 2007 mu et al 2011 onogi et al 2007 rodell et al 2004 simmons 2006 yang et al 2013 zhang et al 2009 zhang et al 2010a those existing products have been extensively applied in hydrological component estimation and variability analysis roderick and farquhar 2011 significantly large scale et estimation still faces many deficiencies due to the high spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability of et xu and singh 2005 xue et al 2013 in previous studies significant differences in performance were revealed between the et products and between regions lee et al 2012 li et al 2022 liu et al 2018 liu et al 2016 long et al 2014 zhang et al 2010b therefore it is important to evaluate and choose appropriate et products before application regarding the large scale evaluation of et products the major restriction is the lack of reference observations pan et al 2020 a potential solution to the issue is to estimate the uncertainties of et products at the basin scale by comparing them with the reference et derived using the water balance equation according to precipitation runoff and storage change sheffield et al 2009 this has been widely used in previous studies on regional scales such as the united states han et al 2015 velpuri et al 2013 and the tibetan plateau jia et al 2020 li et al 2014 xue et al 2013 and on the global scale lian et al 2018 mueller et al 2011 zeng et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 it is noteworthy that the reference et from the water balance equation is only feasible at the basin scale han et al 2020 therefore the evaluation is only limited to the basin with the measurement of precipitation runoff and storage change collocation methods can be used to estimate the uncertainties of multi geophysical products without the true value stoffelen 1998 proposed the triple collocation tc method and mccoll et al 2014 suggested the extended triple collocation etc method to derive the determination of correlations of inputs in recent years the collocation methods have been widely applied in the uncertainty estimation of various hydrological variables such as precipitation dong et al 2020b li et al 2018a wu et al 2019 soil moisture kim et al 2021 wu et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 and vegetation leaf area fang et al 2012 jiang et al 2017 roebeling et al 2012 evaluated the spatial and temporal uncertainties of three precipitation datasets over europe which were derived from satellite ground based radar and gauge data respectively and showed that the etc method provides reliable error estimates alemohammad et al 2015 estimated the uncertainties of three different precipitations over the us and found that the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm product performed better than the others moreover using the triple collocation method christopher et al 2011 estimated the error of three soil moisture products from thermal infrared data passive microwave remote sensing data and land surface modeling while van dijk et al 2014 estimated the uncertainties of terrestrial water storage change from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite data prior estimates and the resulting gain matrix to assess the performance of the grace data hence previous studies show that the etc method could be an alternative to assess the uncertainties of different products without giving true value in summary for the evaluation of various et products on large scale previous studies have chosen either the etc method or the water balance method and only selected a few basins or regions for analysis khan et al 2018 li et al 2022 in this study we aim to assess the performance of three popular et products i e gleam era interim and modis on monthly scale to identify which one performs the best in chinese mainland and further evaluate the effectiveness of etc method first at the basin scale the three products were assessed in 224 basins from 2003 to 2016 using both the etc method and the water balance method furthermore at the grid scale 0 25 their performance from 1960 to 2020 was assessed using the etc method 2 data and method 2 1 data and study area there are different types of global et products which could be classified

it increased to more than 60 at 10 rmse floating width however the modis product has comparatively lower performance in most regions one possible explanation is that the three products have quite similar et estimation over some regions since the covariance of different datasets are used to calculate variance the results could be very close once the inputs are similar gruber et al 2020 such situations have been reported in the evaluation of soil moisture products by previous studies chen et al 2018 dong and crow 2017 4 discussion 4 1 monthly et product evaluation our result shows that gleam has the best performance among the three et products in china using both the etc and the water balance methods similar results have been reported in previous studies yang et al 2017 evaluated the performance of gleam at various temporal scales using ec observations from chinaflux as a reference in eight different ecosystems and indicated that the gleam exhibited comparable accurate performance especially at grassland sites liu et al 2018 evaluated six et products on the tibetan plateau using the water balance method together with grace data for water storage change and found that the gleam performed the best in the east asian monsoon dominated and indian monsoon dominated basins chen et al 2021 explored the applicability of three evapotranspiration products gleam gldas and era interim in the yellow river basin using the etc method and found that gleam and era interim exhibited the smallest errors using the same method li et al 2014 evaluated five et products in the east of the tibetan plateau and concluded that modis had the biggest uncertainties among the five et products liu et al 2016 chose 35 basins around the world including 4 basins in china to compare the annual et estimated by different products and also found gleam with the best performance in our study we found the estimated rmses using the water balance method are slightly higher than those by the etc method over 70 of the 224 basins for gleam and 90 for modis and 98 for era interim as shown in fig 3 moreover the difference between the estimated rmses by the two methods are significantly larger in some sub basins including the upper songhua river basin the middle yellow river basin the middle yangtze river shown in fig 2 it should be noted that the estimated et using the water balance method also contains some uncertainties on the one hand we ignored the change in deep groundwater storage while estimating Œ¥ t w s which may lead to the overestimation of et when using the water balance equation on the other hand for many small basins especially less than 5 000 km2 the spatial resolution of grace data is much larger than the basin which may lead to uncertainty in the et estimation in addition the effect by human water abstraction activities for plain terrain basins and water from melting glaciers and permafrost for plateau and mountainous area basins have been ignored which would also lead to the overestimation of et in the meanwhile the uncertainties of precipitation of cgdpa product might influence the precision of evaluation of et products 4 2 etc method our results show that the rmse estimated from the etc method is close to that derived from the water balance method for each et products this finding indicates that the calculated rmse from the etc method can be used not only to select the best products but also as the reliable uncertainty estimation of the et product moreover we found that the rmses estimated from the water balance equation are slightly lower than those derived from the etc method in many basins and even the rmse ratios of the etc method to the water balance method are up to 2 for some basins as a possible cause many et products underestimate winter et whose estimation is very close to zero for some basins especially basins located in northern china li et al 2018b mueller et al 2011 the underestimated winter et increases the rmse this study has further demonstrated the effectiveness of the etc method in estimating the uncertainties of evapotranspiration products without knowing the true value it can be used in product evaluation and selection however we should note that for the same products the evaluation result may differ on different spatial scales and for instance in midstream of the yellow river basin fig 4 a indicates that ear interim has the best performance while fig 8 shows that in most grids gleam has the best performance it can be speculated that the two products only have a little difference in rmse in this region as shown in fig 9 the etc method can be used to estimate the uncertainty of each product which indicates a data fusion method to obtain a more precise product through considering the uncertainties as weight for instance chen et al 2021 assessed the uncertainties of three et products in the yellow river basin using tc and integrated them using a fusion method it is worth noting that the result of the etc method is interrelated with the products selected especially the independence among the products as mentioned in the method part one important assumption for the extended triple collocation method is that the random errors of given inputs are expected to be independent from each other denoted as the zero ecc assumption however since different products may employ the same input for estimation this assumption is often offended in practice dong et al 2020a thus careful selection of inputs is necessary before applying collocation methods in our study both gleam and era interim use historical meteorological data from era which violates the zero ecc assumption to some extent and may introduce bias yilmaz and crow 2014 to analyze the impact of error cross correlation li et al 2022 recently employed the extended double instrumental variable method eivd which is the development of tc method dong et al 2019 to calculate the ecc value between era interim and gleam their result demonstrated that the ecc value has a limited impact on the collocation results though the combination in this study is different this influence could be considered to have an acceptable influence in addition future studies could have a further investigation on this issue 5 conclusion in this study we use the etc method to evaluate three different et products on the monthly scale namely gleam era and modis at both grid and basin scales over chinese mainland at the same time we use the water balance method to evaluate these et products at the basin scale and compare the results against the etc method our conclusions are as follows 1 the gleam product has the smallest rmse in most of chinese mainland compared with the era and modis products the rmse of the three et products at the basin scale grid scale is 17 63 8 47 mm month for gleam 27 41 9 71 mm month for era and 40 55 10 52 mm month for modis 2 gleam has the best performance in most regions taking up 60 of chinese mainland era performs well in several dispersed regions e g the northern tibetan plateau downstream of the lancang river the hetao plain and some sub basins of the yangtze river haihe river liaohe river and heilong river and modis performs well in some western regions 3 there is a high consistency in the estimated rmses from the etc method and the water balance method for 224 basins across china it indicates that the etc method is an effective method for evaluating different products and estimating their uncertainty without knowing the true value author contributions yj lc and yh

2762,check dam is an important soil and water conservation engineering measure for the prevention and control of soil erosion on the loess plateau in china however how the check dams influence runoff at different catchments remains unclear this study uses a modified hydrological model swat pml to quantitatively distinguish the impact of check dams on the runoff from climate and vegetation changes and to identify the relationship between runoff reduction and check dam storage capacity for six check dam influenced catchments on the loess plateau results show that compared to the slow increase before 1997 leaf area index lai significantly p 0 01 increased in these six catchments after 1997 the construction of check dams started before 1997 in five catchments and reached a peak between 2005 and 2010 for all six catchments check dam construction and vegetation greening reduced runoff in all catchments while climate change reduced runoff in three catchments but increased runoff in the remaining three among the impact factors the check dams contributed the most to runoff change furthermore the cumulative reduction amount of runoff grew rapidly with the development of check dam storage capacity before the turning point around the year 2000 while it turned to a slow increase after the turning point this research provides reference and guidance for the construction and management of soil and water conservation measures as well as the planning and sustainable utilization of water resources on the loess plateau keywords check dam runoff climate change vegetation greening swat pml data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction check dams are soil and water conservation engineering facility built across channels or gullies for the purpose of retaining floods reducing flood peak discharge increasing concentration and lag time sequestering sediment and silting land abbasi et al 2019 li et al 2017 shi et al 2019 they can slow down the gradient of the ditch bottom and reduce the sediment carry capacity from floods hassanli and beecham 2010 on the loess plateau of china check dams have been widely constructed as the principal method to reserve floodwater and intercept soil sediments since the 1970s xu et al 2013 by reserving floodwater and sediment the check dam can effectively regulate the high sediment and flood in the flood season thereby reducing the sediment entering the yellow river and improving the local vegetation planting conditions for trees and grasses at the same time fu et al 2017 gao et al 2017a sun et al 2020a wu et al 2018 the ministry of water resources china cmwr predicted that the planned check dam construction would result in a runoff reduction of 4 3 5 5 billion m3 per year in the yellow river jin et al 2012 based on the size of storage capacity check dams are divided into three types large medium and small check dams with a storage capacity of 500 000 to 5 000 000 m3 are large sized also known as backbone dams a storage capacity of 100 000 to 500 000 m3 are medium sized and a storage capacity of 10 000 to 100 000 m3 are small sized liu et al 2018 due to topographic and environmental constraints most of the check dams on the loess plateau are arranged in small channel catchments with an area of 100 200 km2 among which most of the small and medium sized check dams are mainly distributed in the tributaries and furrows whereas large dams are mainly distributed in trunk and branch ditch since the initial purpose of the check dam construction was to prevent soil erosion reduce channel erosion intercept and reduce the sediment entering the river there are many studies on reserving sediment functions of the check dam zhang et al 2019a bai et al 2020 liu et al 2022 wang et al 2016 yin et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a b zhao et al 2020 dang et al 2020 the available research on the runoff reduction by check dams mainly focused on floods particularly flood process influenced by a typical check dam a certain dam system structure or some contrasting catchments chen et al 2021 wang et al 2021 yazdi 2017 yazdi et al 2018 abdelal et al 2021 for example feng et al 2021 investigated the effects of check dams on the dynamic process of runoff in wangmaogou catchments on the loess plateau based on dynamic coupling models mike she model and mike 11 model their results showed that check dams not only reduced the total volume of floods but also increased the flood duration and delayed the occurrence of flood peaks similarly yuan et al 2022 analyzed the effects of the number of check dams on runoff generation and concentration by simulating scenarios with various check dam numbers using a distributed hydrological model and found that check dams obviously reduced the flood peak and flood volume and mitigated flood process ran et al 2021 indicated that numerous aging check dams built on the loess plateau and worldwide are still useful and that sound maintenance and management of the check dam will be beneficial to attenuate flood risk and soil erosion in addition to check dams the runoff on the loess plateau has also been affected greatly by the dual influence of climate change and other human activities feng et al 2016 luan et al 2021 such as the remarkable ecological restoration revegetation measures and the landscape engineering measures e g terraces water diversion projects and reservoirs fu et al 2017 gao et al 2017a which were implemented to alleviate the severe soil loss on the loess plateau with the implementation of ecological restoration projects for decades feng et al 2016 mao et al 2013 piao et al 2015 wang et al 2016 including the natural forest conservation program since 1998 and the grain for green program since 1999 cao et al 2011 wei et al 2008 li et al 2020a the vegetation coverage on the loess plateau has been significantly improved and ecological restoration is attracting more attention from general public it becomes difficult and challenging to distinguish the runoff reduction of check dams from the comprehensive impacts of various soil and water conservation measures such as afforestation li et al 2016 applied the swat model to simulate monthly runoff and sediment load in the huangfuchuan basin in the middle reaches of the yellow river indicating check dams played a dominant role in the variation of runoff and sediment load in the basin shi et al 2016 found that check dams reduced runoff by 39 obtained using the digital yellow river integrated model sun et al 2020b quantified the contributions of climate variation land use change and engineering measures for the dramatic reduction in runoff and sediment in a typical loess catchment and their results showed that the landscape engineering measures played a major role with an increasing contribution in streamflow reduction from 54 4 in phase 1 to 94 7 in phase 2 and no substantial change on sediment load reduction 61 6 in phase 1 to 62 8 in phase 2 in addition there is no research reporting the relationship between the runoff reduction caused by the check dam and the check dam storage capacity for better river basin management it is crucial to comprehensively quantify the impacts of multiple contributors on the runoff change including climate vegetation greening and check dam measures to this end this study used a modified hydrology model swat pml in which the soil and water assessment tool swat model is coupled with the penman monteith leuning pml model zhang et al 2008 2010 2017b 2019b 2020 to incorporate the satellite observed leaf area index lai data for estimating actual evapotranspiration realistically doing so makes the modeling of vegetation change impact on hydrological processes runoff et etc more trusty ma et al 2019 using the improved distributed eco hydrological model swat pml this study conducted a comprehensive study on six catchments in the northern loess plateau we set up the following objectives i identifying the precipitation runoff vegetation growth and check dam conditions in the selected catchments ii quantifying the impact of climate change vegetation changes and check dam measures on the runoff and iii analyzing the relationship between the runoff reduction and the storage capacity of the check dam 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region the six selected catchments in this study are mainly located in ordos a northern region of the loess plateau in china fig 1 ordos is between 37 35 24 40 51 40 n latitude and 106 42 40 111 27 20

there were 1 462 check dams including 572 backbone dams 466 medium sized dams and 424 small sized dams until 2018 the soil and water conservation measures in the ordos mainly include the construction of check dams and ecological restoration of forests and grasses while other engineering measures such as terraced fields are almost absent the selected six catchments are maobulang id 1 xiliugou id 2

locations of these check dams 2 3 swat pml model the swat pml model couples the swat model with the pml model in which the original modules for calculating the evapotranspiration in swat were replaced with the corresponding pml model the coupled swat pml model can be used to simulate hydrological variables such as runoff evapotranspiration and soil water storage at daily time steps based on the daily meteorological data and lai data luan et al 2022 the swat model is a semi distributed basin scale hydrological model developed by the agricultural research service usda ars in the 1980s which can simulate the long term changes of various hydrological elements variables under various land use types soil types and land management measures in large and complex basins arnold and allen 1996 arnold et al 1998 2012 li et al 2021b the swat model is physically based easy to obtain input variables has high computational efficiency and has the long term simulation of basins the penman monteith leuning pml model zhang et al 2019b is simple to parameterize and can effectively separate soil evaporation es vegetation transpiration et and canopy interception evaporation ei using the penman monteith equation and it is widely used in global or regional et research zhang et al 2017a b ma and zhang 2022 zhang et al 2021a b 2 4 simulation scenario settings fig 2 depicts how the model simulations and bias corrections are carried out in nalinchuan catchment since construction of check dams was started from 1987 in nalinchuan basin we used the data from 1962 to 1987 as the baseline period to calibrate and validate the swat pml model based on the well calibrated swat pml model two simulation scenarios together with observations were used to separate the impacts of check dams from climate and vegetation changes fig 2 and table 2 both scenarios used the same meteorological forcing from 1998 to 2018 to eliminate the effects of climate while difference between the two is different lai inputs the first scenario s1 was driven by the averaged daily lai during 1981 1997 when was before the returning farmland to forest and grassland policy and avhrr lai data were available red line in fig 2 the second scenario s2 was driven by the observed daily lai for 1998 2018 the period of returning farmland to forest and grassland green line in fig 2 to partition the vegetation greening impact on runoff therefore according to fig 2 the entire study period can be divided into three periods namely the baseline period from 1962 to 1987 no influence of human activities the period affected by check dams from 1987 to 1998 and the dual impact period of vegetation greening and check dam action from 1998 to 2018 the model calibration and validation during the baseline period inevitably result in model bias as shown by the difference between the blue dash line and the blue solid line in fig 2 we assume that the bias percentage from the baseline period period ‚Ö∞ is propagated to the simulation periods period ii and iii therefore we can minimize the systematic bias by multiplying 1 bias percentage to the original simulations in the periods i ii and iii and obtain the simulations solid red line and solid green line which are then used for partitioning the impacts eqs 1 4 the impacts of different factors on runoff can be finally calculated according to the following formula 1 Œ¥ q q obiii q obi Œ¥ q c Œ¥ q ve Œ¥ q dam 2 Œ¥ q c q s 1 q obi 3 Œ¥ q ve q s 2 q s 1 4 Œ¥ q dam q obiii q s 2 where Œ¥q is the total change of runoff Œ¥qc Œ¥qve and Œ¥qdam are the impact of climate change vegetation greening and check dam on runoff respectively qob‚Ö∞ qobiii are the observed runoff in period ‚Ö∞ and period iii respectively qs1 is the runoff from 1998 to 2018 period iii simulated by the swat pml model based on the daily average lai in 1981 1997 qs2 is the runoff from 1998 to 2018 period iii simulated by the swat pml model based on the satellite observed lai 2 5 double mass curve dmc method the dmc method is a common method to test the consistency and the change in the relationship between two variables kohler 1949 searcy and hardison 1960 for two variables x reference variable or benchmark variable and y tested variable xi and yi represent their observations during n years where i 1 2 3 n first the cumulative values of x and y are calculated year by year according to 5 and 6 respectively the yearly cumulative time series xi and yi are calculated as follows 5 x i i 1 n x i 6 y i i 1 n y i then the relationship between the cumulative values corresponding to the two variables is plotted in the cartesian coordinate system for the double mass curve of runoff and precipitation if the slope of the curve does not deviate significantly it indicates that human activities have a marginal impact on streamflow and if the slope of the curve significantly deviates it indicates that human activities are noticeable or strong gao et al 2017b luan et al 2021 2 6 calibration and validation of swat pml model parameter calibration and validation for swat pml model were conducted in the swat cup premium software https www 2w2e com home swatcuppremium the swat pml model was calibrated and validated against the monthly runoff in the baseline period at six hydrological stations in which 70 of the data were used for calibration and 30 of the data were used for validation as indicated in section 2 4 the bias in the calibration and validation process is propagated to the simulation period and the systematic bias of the simulation period is considered to be consistent with the calibration and validation periods a comprehensive objective function f that combined r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and bias

the swat pml model are shown in fig 3 as the nse and r2 values are larger than 0 5 and the absolute values of bias are less than 0 15 the calibrated swat pml model is good enough in simulating runoff over the study region according to the evaluation criteria moriasi et al 2007 zhang and chiew 2009 3 results 3 1 precipitation runoff lai and check dam change in studied catchments the annual precipitation and runoff series from 1960 to 2018 id 1 is 1982 2018 id 3 is 1961 2018 and id 4 is 1967 2018 in the six study catchments were analyzed and found that the precipitation shows a fluctuating and almost constant trend while the runoff shows a decreasing trend in the fluctuation fig 4 the mann kendall mann 1945 kendall 1975 burn and elnur 2002 test also proved that the annual precipitation in the six catchments showed an insignificant trend and the runoff showed a significant decrease trend z 2 576 p 0 01 the temporal trend analysis of the annual averaged lai from 1981 to 2018 in six studied catchments reveals that the lai varied slightly from 1981 to 1997 followed by a significant increasing trend p 0 01 from 1997 to 2018 because of intensive human induced vegetation restoration since 1997 fig 5 which is also known as the grain for green programme according to the number of check dams and the corresponding storage capacity in the six catchments we found that in the early stage of check dam construction both the total number of dams and their storage capacity are relatively small since 2005 the dams number suddenly increased sharply reaching a peak between 2005 and 2010 except for maobulang the construction of check dams in the remaining five catchments was earlier than 1997 vegetation restoration measures based on the lai changes and check dam changes the baseline period for the runoff division of catchment 1 id 1 to catchment 6 id 6 was setup as 1982 1997 1960 1997 1961 1986 1967 1986 1960 1986 and 1960 1997 respectively the start year is the time when the hydrological station was established 3 2 contributions of climate change vegetation greening and check dams to catchment runoff fig 7 shows the simulated annual runoff under the s1 and s2 scenarios and observed annual runoff of the six study catchments from 1998 to 2018 left and the corresponding contributions of climate change vegetation change and check dam construction to runoff change right the red green and blue lines in the left panels correspond to those in fig 2 the contribution of climate change to changes in runoff ranged from 2 72 in maobulang id 1 to 42 63 in xiliugou id 2 the contribution of vegetation greening to change in runoff ranges from 5 43 in maobulang id 1 to 40 25 in xiliugou id 2 the change in runoff caused by check dam was the relatively largest with the ranges of 17 12 in xiliugou to 91 85 in maobulang overall runoff changes were most affected by check dams and the contributions of climate change and vegetation greening were less than 50 in all catchments while the contribution of check dams is greater than 50 in four catchments in terms of the direction of impact on runoff vegetation greening and construction of check dams reduced runoff in all six catchments whereas climate change has reduced runoff in three catchments id 1 maobulang id 2 xiliugou and id 6 huangfuchuan but increased runoff in the other three id 3 ulanmulun river id 4 boniuchuan and id 5 nalinchuan the contribution of the three factors the impact of climate change on the runoff is consistent with the impact of vegetation greening and check dam construction in three of the studied catchments id1 2 and 6 which are all negative while the impacts of climate change on the other three catchments are opposite to the impact of vegetation greening and check dam construction which are positive and negative respectively 3 3 double mass curve relationship between runoff reduction and storage capacity of check dam four catchments in which the contribution of check dams to runoff change is greater than 40 and with longer dam construction years 20 years were selected to establish the double mass curve between the annual runoff reduction caused by check dam construction and the storage capacity of check dams fig 8 there exists an obvious turning point in the double mass curve for the four catchments it was found that these four catchments all showed a sharp increase in the cumulative runoff reduction in the early stage of dam construction followed by a relatively slow increase in the cumulative runoff reduction after the turning point when the annual runoff reduction began to decline the green histogram in fig 8 compares the runoff reduction efficiency caused by check dam in the two periods before and after the turning point and it is found that the runoff reduction efficiency before the turning point is much greater than that after the turning point the runoff reduction does not show a proportional relationship with the increase in the storage capacity of the dam but the annual runoff reduction gradually decreases with the continuous increase of the number and storage capacity of check dams resulting in a relatively slow increase in cumulative runoff reduction of check dam after the turning point it also showed that the turning points in the four catchments are different fig 8 the turning point in boniuchuan id 4 appears the earliest from the check dam storage capacity perspective followed by the ulanmulun river id 3 nalinchuan id 5 and huangfuchuan id 6 this result suggests that the check dams have played a much smaller role in reducing runoff after the turning point compared to the pre turning point period 4 discussion to improve the vegetation coverage and reduce soil erosion on the loess plateau the project of returning farmland to forest or grass has been implemented since the late 1990s including the natural forest conservation program and the grain for green program cao et al 2011 wei et al 2008 li et al 2020a zhang et al 2017a after the implementation of this project for more than 20 years the vegetation coverage of the loess plateau has been significantly improved resulting in a remarkable effect of vegetation restoration feng et al 2016 piao et al 2015 wang et al 2019 it also makes china contributed 25 of the global net increase in green foliage from 2000 to 2017 chen et al 2019 the implementation of ecological restoration projects is getting more attention after decades our annual lai increasing results since 1998 are consistent with the implementation of this project there are abrupt change points in runoff changes through the precipitation runoff dmc method indicating that the runoff change from 1997 to 2018 in these catchments are primarily due to human activities vegetation greening and construction of check dam rather than climate change this is in accordance with the results in fig 9 and previous studies regarding attribution analysis of runoff change on the loess plateau liang 2017 luan et al 2020 2021 yin et al 2018 feng et al 2018 vegetation change affects the hydrological cycle by altering canopy transpiration canopy interception soil water infiltration root water uptake and the energy distribution process li et al 2020a as vegetation has the function of reserving water sources bai et al 2020 zastrow 2019 the runoff decreases continuously with the vegetation increase from the perspective of the contribution of vegetation greening to runoff change fig 7 the contribution of vegetation greening in the four catchments in id 3 6 is basically the same about 20 which is mainly due to the background value and variation of lai are similar in the four catchments fig 5 the contribution of vegetation greening to runoff change in id 1 maobulang catchment and id 2 xiliugou catchment is extremely different the contribution for id 2 is as high as 40 3 but is only 5 4 this is mainly caused by the different lai changes between the two the lai in id 2 increased by more than 0 2 while it in id 1 is less than 0 08 our results are consistent with this theory and the previous studies which showed that the increase in vegetation had a certain reduction effect on runoff on the loess plateau li et al 2016 shao et al 2019 li et al 2020a b liu et al 2016 reservoir information in this region was statistically analyzed including name location construction time storage capacity and upstream control area of the reservoir it was found that there are only 17 reservoirs in this region of which there is only 1 medium sized reservoir that is located in the upper reaches of the ulanmulun river and the others are small reservoirs compared with the storage capacity of 1400 of check dams the storage capacity of the reservoir is even smaller construction of check dams resulted in reduced runoff in all catchments the construction of the check dam intercepts not only sediment but also water resources at the basin scale leading to substantial changes in the runoff e g the flood peak reduction and increased infiltration of surface water sun et al 2020a b the turning points in the double mass curve between the runoff reduction caused by check dam and the storage capacity of the check dam for the four catchments indicate that the accumulative runoff reduction began to slow down obviously with the increase of the accumulative storage capacity after the turning point fig 6 these turning points mainly occurred around 2000 the occurrence of the turning point can be explained by the timeliness of sediment and water intercept ability of check dams and the significant increase in the vegetation coverage in these catchments the loss of the timeliness of the check dams sediment trapping function is the prominent reason once the sediment storage capacity reached its limit after years of service the check dam would lose its sediment trapping capacity resulting in a reduced function of controlling the soil erosion by its check land ran et al 2021 studies have shown that the design retention life is 10 30 years for large dams 5 10 years for medium sized dams and 3 5 years for small sized dams liu et al 2018 since the medium sized and small sized dams account for more than 60 of the studied catchments their sediment trapping capacity might be lost after 2000 making 2000 to be the turning point in addition with the increase of forest and grass coverage in the basin the soil and water reserving capacity increased liu et al 2018 making the actual runoff reduction per unit area of the dam decrease gradually this study applies an improved distributed eco hydrological model to separate the impact of check dam on the runoff from climate change and vegetation greening in six selected catchments on the northern loess plateau there are many attribution analysis methods for runoff change especially only the contribution of climate change and human activities the results obtained by different attribution analysis methods are various and there are certain uncertainties in different methods and errors in this method are inevitable luan et al 2021 we only distinguished the impact of climate change vegetation greening and check dam construction on the runoff while some other human activities such as terraces coal mining urbanization and direct water extraction by humans were not separated this may overestimate the contribution of check dams to runoff changes more detailed modeling studies including such human activities should be conducted to distinguish the influence of check dams from various human activities and to reveal their different impact mechanisms and contributions to the hydrological processes in future research this study can estimate the water reduction effect caused by the construction of check dams and provide reference and guidance for the evolution and future sustainable utilization of water resources on the loess plateau 5 conclusions this study separated the impact of check dam on the runoff from climate change and vegetation greening in six selected catchments on the northern loess plateau by an improved distributed eco hydrological model our results show that the annual precipitation remained almost unchanged and the annual runoff showed a significant downward trend p 0 01 during the whole study period and leaf area index increased significantly p 0 01 after 1997 the construction of check dams started before 1997 vegetation restoration measures in the five catchments besides maobulang and reached a peak between 2005 and 2010 for all six catchments the contribution of check dam to runoff changes is the largest among the three factors reducing runoff in all catchments there were obvious turning points around 2000 in the double mass curve between the runoff reduction caused by check dam and the storage capacity of the check dam runoff reduction is nonlinearly related to increasing in check dam storage capacity the accumulative runoff reduction began to slow down obviously with the increase of the check dam accumulative storage capacity after the turning point compared with that before the turning point this study provides a deep insight into the impacts of median to long term check dam construction on water availability at catchment to regional scales credit authorship

2762,check dam is an important soil and water conservation engineering measure for the prevention and control of soil erosion on the loess plateau in china however how the check dams influence runoff at different catchments remains unclear this study uses a modified hydrological model swat pml to quantitatively distinguish the impact of check dams on the runoff from climate and vegetation changes and to identify the relationship between runoff reduction and check dam storage capacity for six check dam influenced catchments on the loess plateau results show that compared to the slow increase before 1997 leaf area index lai significantly p 0 01 increased in these six catchments after 1997 the construction of check dams started before 1997 in five catchments and reached a peak between 2005 and 2010 for all six catchments check dam construction and vegetation greening reduced runoff in all catchments while climate change reduced runoff in three catchments but increased runoff in the remaining three among the impact factors the check dams contributed the most to runoff change furthermore the cumulative reduction amount of runoff grew rapidly with the development of check dam storage capacity before the turning point around the year 2000 while it turned to a slow increase after the turning point this research provides reference and guidance for the construction and management of soil and water conservation measures as well as the planning and sustainable utilization of water resources on the loess plateau keywords check dam runoff climate change vegetation greening swat pml data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction check dams are soil and water conservation engineering facility built across channels or gullies for the purpose of retaining floods reducing flood peak discharge increasing concentration and lag time sequestering sediment and silting land abbasi et al 2019 li et al 2017 shi et al 2019 they can slow down the gradient of the ditch bottom and reduce the sediment carry capacity from floods hassanli and beecham 2010 on the loess plateau of china check dams have been widely constructed as the principal method to reserve floodwater and intercept soil sediments since the 1970s xu et al 2013 by reserving floodwater and sediment the check dam can effectively regulate the high sediment and flood in the flood season thereby reducing the sediment entering the yellow river and improving the local vegetation planting conditions for trees and grasses at the same time fu et al 2017 gao et al 2017a sun et al 2020a wu et al 2018 the ministry of water resources china cmwr predicted that the planned check dam construction would result in a runoff reduction of 4 3 5 5 billion m3 per year in the yellow river jin et al 2012 based on the size of storage capacity check dams are divided into three types large medium and small check dams with a storage capacity of 500 000 to 5 000 000 m3 are large sized also known as backbone dams a storage capacity of 100 000 to 500 000 m3 are medium sized and a storage capacity of 10 000 to 100 000 m3 are small sized liu et al 2018 due to topographic and environmental constraints most of the check dams on the loess plateau are arranged in small channel catchments with an area of 100 200 km2 among which most of the small and medium sized check dams are mainly distributed in the tributaries and furrows whereas large dams are mainly distributed in trunk and branch ditch since the initial purpose of the check dam construction was to prevent soil erosion reduce channel erosion intercept and reduce the sediment entering the river there are many studies on reserving sediment functions of the check dam zhang et al 2019a bai et al 2020 liu et al 2022 wang et al 2016 yin et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a b zhao et al 2020 dang et al 2020 the available research on the runoff reduction by check dams mainly focused on floods particularly flood process influenced by a typical check dam a certain dam system structure or some contrasting catchments chen et al 2021 wang et al 2021 yazdi 2017 yazdi et al 2018 abdelal et al 2021 for example feng et al 2021 investigated the effects of check dams on the dynamic process of runoff in wangmaogou catchments on the loess plateau based on dynamic coupling models mike she model and mike 11 model their results showed that check dams not only reduced the total volume of floods but also increased the flood duration and delayed the occurrence of flood peaks similarly yuan et al 2022 analyzed the effects of the number of check dams on runoff generation and concentration by simulating scenarios with various check dam numbers using a distributed hydrological model and found that check dams obviously reduced the flood peak and flood volume and mitigated flood process ran et al 2021 indicated that numerous aging check dams built on the loess plateau and worldwide are still useful and that sound maintenance and management of the check dam will be beneficial to attenuate flood risk and soil erosion in addition to check dams the runoff on the loess plateau has also been affected greatly by the dual influence of climate change and other human activities feng et al 2016 luan et al 2021 such as the remarkable ecological restoration revegetation measures and the landscape engineering measures e g terraces water diversion projects and reservoirs fu et al 2017 gao et al 2017a which were implemented to alleviate the severe soil loss on the loess plateau with the implementation of ecological restoration projects for decades feng et al 2016 mao et al 2013 piao et al 2015 wang et al 2016 including the natural forest conservation program since 1998 and the grain for green program since 1999 cao et al 2011 wei et al 2008 li et al 2020a the vegetation coverage on the loess plateau has been significantly improved and ecological restoration is attracting more attention from general public it becomes difficult and challenging to distinguish the runoff reduction of check dams from the comprehensive impacts of various soil and water conservation measures such as afforestation li et al 2016 applied the swat model to simulate monthly runoff and sediment load in the huangfuchuan basin in the middle reaches of the yellow river indicating check dams played a dominant role in the variation of runoff and sediment load in the basin shi et al 2016 found that check dams reduced runoff by 39 obtained using the digital yellow river integrated model sun et al 2020b quantified the contributions of climate variation land use change and engineering measures for the dramatic reduction in runoff and sediment in a typical loess catchment and their results showed that the landscape engineering measures played a major role with an increasing contribution in streamflow reduction from 54 4 in phase 1 to 94 7 in phase 2 and no substantial change on sediment load reduction 61 6 in phase 1 to 62 8 in phase 2 in addition there is no research reporting the relationship between the runoff reduction caused by the check dam and the check dam storage capacity for better river basin management it is crucial to comprehensively quantify the impacts of multiple contributors on the runoff change including climate vegetation greening and check dam measures to this end this study used a modified hydrology model swat pml in which the soil and water assessment tool swat model is coupled with the penman monteith leuning pml model zhang et al 2008 2010 2017b 2019b 2020 to incorporate the satellite observed leaf area index lai data for estimating actual evapotranspiration realistically doing so makes the modeling of vegetation change impact on hydrological processes runoff et etc more trusty ma et al 2019 using the improved distributed eco hydrological model swat pml this study conducted a comprehensive study on six catchments in the northern loess plateau we set up the following objectives i identifying the precipitation runoff vegetation growth and check dam conditions in the selected catchments ii quantifying the impact of climate change vegetation changes and check dam measures on the runoff and iii analyzing the relationship between the runoff reduction and the storage capacity of the check dam 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region the six selected catchments in this study are mainly located in ordos a northern region of the loess plateau in china fig 1 ordos is between 37 35 24 40 51 40 n latitude and 106 42 40 111 27 20

there were 1 462 check dams including 572 backbone dams 466 medium sized dams and 424 small sized dams until 2018 the soil and water conservation measures in the ordos mainly include the construction of check dams and ecological restoration of forests and grasses while other engineering measures such as terraced fields are almost absent the selected six catchments are maobulang id 1 xiliugou id 2

with the corresponding pml model the coupled swat pml model can be used to simulate hydrological variables such as runoff evapotranspiration and soil water storage at daily time steps based on the daily meteorological data and lai data luan et al 2022 the swat model is a semi distributed basin scale hydrological model developed by the agricultural research service usda ars in the 1980s which can simulate the long term changes of various hydrological elements variables under various land use types soil types and land management measures in large and complex basins arnold and allen 1996 arnold et al 1998 2012 li et al 2021b the swat model is physically based easy to obtain input variables has high computational efficiency and has the long term simulation of basins the penman monteith

simulations and bias corrections are carried out in nalinchuan catchment since construction of check dams was started from 1987 in nalinchuan basin we used the data from 1962 to 1987 as the baseline period to calibrate and validate the swat pml model based on the well calibrated swat pml model two simulation scenarios together with observations were used to separate the impacts of check dams from climate and vegetation changes fig 2 and table 2 both scenarios used the same meteorological forcing from 1998 to 2018 to eliminate the effects of climate while difference between the two is different lai inputs the first scenario s1 was driven by the averaged daily lai during 1981 1997 when was before the returning farmland to forest and grassland policy and avhrr lai data were available red line in fig 2 the second scenario s2 was driven by the observed daily lai for 1998 2018 the period of returning farmland to forest and grassland green line in fig 2 to partition the vegetation greening impact on runoff therefore according to fig 2 the entire study period can be divided into three periods namely the baseline period from 1962 to 1987 no influence of human activities the period affected by check dams from 1987 to 1998 and the dual impact period of vegetation greening and check dam action from 1998 to 2018 the model calibration and validation during the baseline period inevitably result in model bias as shown by the difference between the blue dash line and the blue solid line in fig 2 we assume that the bias percentage from the baseline period period ‚Ö∞ is propagated to the simulation periods period ii and iii therefore we can minimize the systematic bias by multiplying 1 bias percentage to the original simulations in the periods i ii and iii and obtain the simulations solid red line and solid green line which are then used for partitioning the impacts eqs 1 4 the impacts of different factors on runoff can be finally calculated according to the following formula 1 Œ¥ q q obiii q obi Œ¥ q c Œ¥ q ve Œ¥ q dam 2 Œ¥ q c q s 1 q obi 3 Œ¥ q ve q s 2 q s 1 4 Œ¥ q dam q obiii q s 2 where Œ¥q is the total change of runoff Œ¥qc Œ¥qve and Œ¥qdam are the impact of climate change vegetation greening and check dam on runoff respectively qob‚Ö∞ qobiii are the observed runoff in period ‚Ö∞ and period iii respectively qs1 is the runoff from 1998 to 2018 period iii simulated by the swat pml model based on the daily average lai in 1981 1997 qs2 is the runoff from 1998 to 2018 period iii simulated by the swat pml model based on the satellite observed lai 2 5 double mass curve dmc method the dmc method is a common method to test the consistency and the change in the relationship between two variables kohler 1949 searcy and hardison 1960 for two variables x reference variable or benchmark variable and y tested variable xi and yi represent their observations during n years where i 1 2 3 n first the cumulative values of x and y are calculated year by year according to 5 and 6 respectively the yearly cumulative time series xi and yi are calculated as follows 5 x i i 1 n x i 6 y i i 1 n y i then the relationship between the cumulative values corresponding to the two variables is plotted in the cartesian coordinate system for the double mass curve of runoff and precipitation if the slope of the curve does not deviate significantly it indicates that human activities have a marginal impact on streamflow and if the slope of the curve significantly deviates it indicates that human activities are noticeable or strong gao et al 2017b luan et al 2021 2 6 calibration and validation of swat pml model parameter calibration and validation for swat pml model were conducted in the swat cup premium software https www 2w2e com home swatcuppremium the swat pml model was calibrated and validated against the monthly runoff in the baseline period at six hydrological stations in which 70 of the data were used for calibration and 30 of the data were used for validation as indicated in section 2 4 the bias in the calibration and validation process is propagated to the simulation period and the systematic bias of the simulation period is considered to be consistent with the calibration and validation periods a comprehensive objective function f that combined r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and bias

over the study region according to the evaluation criteria moriasi et al 2007 zhang and chiew 2009 3 results 3 1 precipitation runoff lai and check dam change in studied catchments the annual precipitation and runoff series from 1960 to 2018 id 1 is 1982 2018 id 3 is 1961 2018 and id 4 is 1967 2018 in the six study catchments were analyzed and found that the precipitation shows a fluctuating and almost constant trend while the runoff shows a decreasing trend in the fluctuation fig 4 the mann kendall mann 1945 kendall 1975 burn and elnur 2002 test also proved that the annual precipitation in the six catchments showed an insignificant trend and the runoff showed a significant decrease trend z 2 576 p 0 01 the temporal trend analysis of the annual averaged lai from 1981 to 2018 in six studied catchments reveals that the lai varied slightly from 1981 to 1997 followed by a significant increasing trend p 0 01 from 1997 to 2018 because of intensive human induced vegetation restoration since 1997 fig 5 which is also known as the grain for green programme according to the number of check dams and the corresponding storage capacity in the six catchments we found that in the early stage of check dam construction both the total number of dams and their storage capacity are relatively small since 2005 the dams number suddenly increased sharply reaching a peak between 2005 and 2010 except for maobulang the construction of check dams in the remaining five catchments was earlier than 1997 vegetation restoration measures based on the lai changes and check dam changes the baseline period for the runoff division of catchment 1 id 1 to catchment 6 id 6 was setup as 1982 1997 1960 1997 1961 1986 1967 1986 1960 1986 and 1960 1997 respectively the start year is the time when the hydrological station was established 3 2 contributions of climate change vegetation greening and check dams to catchment runoff fig 7 shows the simulated annual runoff under the s1 and s2 scenarios and observed annual runoff of the six study catchments from 1998 to 2018 left and the corresponding contributions of climate change vegetation change and check dam construction to runoff change right the red green and blue lines in the left panels correspond to those in fig 2 the contribution of climate change to changes in runoff ranged from 2 72 in maobulang id 1 to 42 63 in xiliugou id 2 the contribution of vegetation greening to change in runoff ranges from 5 43 in maobulang id 1 to 40 25 in xiliugou id 2 the change in runoff caused by check dam was the relatively largest with the ranges of 17 12 in xiliugou to 91 85 in maobulang overall runoff changes were most affected by check dams and the contributions of climate change and vegetation greening were less than 50 in all catchments while the contribution of check dams is greater than 50 in four catchments in terms of the direction of impact on runoff vegetation greening and construction of check dams reduced runoff in all six catchments whereas climate change has reduced runoff in three catchments id 1 maobulang id 2 xiliugou and id 6 huangfuchuan but increased runoff in the other three id 3 ulanmulun river id 4 boniuchuan and id 5 nalinchuan the contribution of the three factors the impact of climate change on the runoff is consistent with the impact of vegetation greening and check dam construction in three of the studied catchments id1 2 and 6 which are all negative while the impacts of climate change on the other three catchments are opposite to the impact of vegetation greening and check dam construction which are positive and negative respectively 3 3 double mass curve relationship between runoff reduction and storage capacity of check dam four catchments in which the contribution of check dams to runoff change is greater than 40 and with longer dam construction years 20 years were selected to establish the double mass curve between the annual runoff reduction caused by check dam construction and the storage capacity of check dams fig 8 there exists an obvious turning point in the double mass curve for the four catchments it was found that these four catchments all showed a sharp increase in the cumulative runoff reduction in the early stage of dam construction followed by a relatively slow increase in the cumulative runoff reduction after the turning point when the annual runoff reduction began to decline the green histogram in fig 8 compares the runoff reduction efficiency caused by check dam in the two periods before and after the turning point and it is found that the runoff reduction efficiency before the turning point is much greater than that after the turning point the runoff reduction does not show a proportional relationship with the increase in the storage capacity of the dam but the annual runoff reduction gradually decreases with the continuous increase of the number and storage capacity of check dams resulting in a relatively slow increase in cumulative runoff reduction of check dam after the turning point it also showed that the turning points in the four catchments are different fig 8 the turning point in boniuchuan id 4 appears the earliest from the check dam storage capacity perspective followed by the ulanmulun river id 3 nalinchuan id 5 and huangfuchuan id 6 this result suggests that the check dams have played a much smaller role in reducing runoff after the turning point compared to the pre turning point period 4 discussion to improve the vegetation coverage and reduce soil erosion on the loess plateau the project of returning farmland to forest or grass has been implemented since the late 1990s including the natural forest conservation program and the grain for green program cao et al 2011 wei et al 2008 li et al 2020a zhang et al 2017a after the implementation of this project for more than 20 years the vegetation coverage of the loess plateau has been significantly improved resulting in a remarkable effect of vegetation restoration feng et al 2016 piao et al 2015 wang et al 2019 it also makes china contributed 25 of the global net increase in green foliage from 2000 to 2017 chen et al 2019 the implementation of ecological restoration projects is getting more attention after decades our annual lai increasing results since 1998 are consistent with the implementation of this project there are abrupt change points in runoff changes through the precipitation runoff dmc method indicating that the runoff change from 1997 to 2018 in these catchments are primarily due to human activities vegetation greening and construction of check dam rather than climate change this is in accordance with the results in fig 9 and previous studies regarding attribution analysis of runoff change on the loess plateau liang 2017 luan et al 2020 2021 yin et al 2018 feng et al 2018 vegetation change affects the hydrological cycle by altering canopy transpiration canopy interception soil water infiltration root water uptake and the energy distribution process li et al 2020a as vegetation has the function of reserving water sources bai et al 2020 zastrow 2019 the runoff decreases continuously with the vegetation increase from the perspective of the contribution of vegetation greening to runoff change fig 7 the contribution of vegetation greening in the four catchments in id 3 6 is basically the same about 20 which is mainly due to the background value and variation of lai are similar in the four catchments fig 5 the contribution of vegetation greening to runoff change in id 1 maobulang catchment and id 2 xiliugou catchment is extremely different the contribution for id 2 is as high as 40 3 but is only 5 4 this is mainly caused by the different lai changes between the two the lai in id 2 increased by more than 0 2 while it in id 1 is less than 0 08 our results are consistent with this theory and the previous studies which showed that the increase in vegetation had a certain reduction effect on runoff on the loess plateau li et al 2016 shao et al 2019 li et al 2020a b liu et al 2016 reservoir information in this region was statistically analyzed including name location construction time storage capacity and upstream control area of the reservoir it was found that there are only 17 reservoirs in this region of which there is only 1 medium sized reservoir that is located in the upper reaches of the ulanmulun river and the others are small reservoirs compared with the storage capacity of 1400 of check dams the storage capacity of the reservoir is even smaller construction of check dams resulted in reduced runoff in all catchments the construction of the check dam intercepts not only sediment but also water resources at the basin scale leading to substantial changes in the runoff e g the flood peak reduction and increased infiltration of surface water sun et al 2020a b the turning points in the double mass curve between the runoff reduction caused by check dam and the storage capacity of the check dam for the four catchments indicate that the accumulative runoff reduction began to slow down obviously with the increase of the accumulative storage capacity after the turning point fig 6 these turning points mainly occurred around 2000 the occurrence of the turning point can be explained by the timeliness of sediment and water intercept ability of check dams and the significant increase in the vegetation coverage in these catchments the loss of the timeliness of the check dams sediment trapping function is the prominent reason once the sediment storage capacity reached its limit after years of service the check dam would lose its sediment trapping capacity resulting in a reduced function of controlling the soil erosion by its check land ran et al 2021 studies have shown that the design retention life is 10 30 years for large dams 5 10 years for medium sized dams and 3 5 years for small sized dams liu et al 2018 since the medium sized and small sized dams account for more than 60 of the studied catchments their sediment trapping capacity might be lost after 2000 making 2000 to be the turning point in addition with the increase of forest and grass coverage in the basin the soil and water reserving capacity increased liu et al 2018 making the actual runoff reduction per unit area of the dam decrease gradually this study applies an improved distributed eco hydrological model to separate the impact of check dam on the runoff from climate change and vegetation greening in six selected catchments on the northern loess plateau there are many attribution analysis methods for runoff change especially only the contribution of climate change and human activities the results obtained by different attribution analysis methods are various and there are certain uncertainties in different methods and errors in this method are inevitable luan et al 2021 we only distinguished the impact of climate change vegetation greening and check dam construction on the runoff while some other human activities such as terraces coal mining urbanization and direct water extraction by humans were not separated this may overestimate the contribution of check dams to runoff changes more detailed modeling studies including such human activities should be conducted to distinguish the influence of check dams from various human activities and to reveal their different impact mechanisms and contributions to the hydrological processes in future research this study can estimate the water reduction effect caused by the construction of check dams and provide reference and guidance for the evolution and future sustainable utilization of water resources on the loess plateau 5 conclusions this study separated the impact of check dam on the runoff from climate change and vegetation greening in six selected catchments on the northern loess plateau by an improved distributed eco hydrological model our results show that the annual precipitation remained almost unchanged and the annual runoff showed a significant downward trend p 0 01 during the whole study period and leaf area index increased significantly p 0 01 after 1997 the construction of check dams started before 1997 vegetation restoration measures in the five catchments besides maobulang and reached a peak between 2005 and 2010 for all six catchments the contribution of check dam to runoff changes is the largest among the three factors reducing runoff in all catchments there were obvious turning points around 2000 in the double mass curve between the runoff reduction caused by check dam and the storage capacity of the check dam runoff reduction is nonlinearly related to increasing in check dam storage capacity the accumulative runoff reduction began to slow down obviously with the increase of the check dam accumulative storage capacity after the turning point compared with that before the turning point this study provides a deep insight into the impacts of median to long term check dam construction on water availability at catchment to regional scales credit authorship

2763,soil usually experiences multiple wetting and drying cycles due to changes in climate conditions which directly lead to changes in the soil pore structure especially macropores thus affecting the mechanical properties and permeability in this paper the macropore structure of granite residual soil during three wetting and drying cycles is examined by x ray computed tomography ct the pore spatial distribution including connected pores and isolated pores pore number pore porosity and hydraulic conductivity are analysed and quantified the results show that the variation in the 2d porosity distribution curve continuously decreases in size and reaches the smallest size in the third cycle interestingly the variation in the connected pore porosity is greater than that of the porosity obtained based on all pores as well as isolated pores the cycles make the soil shrink the drying effect reduces the connectivity of the pore space and the number of isolated pores increases the wetting effect contributes to the recovery of the lost pores and connections and the pore space and porosity increase after wetting in addition the hydraulic conductivity decreases due to the connected porosity the pore throat radius decreases and the connected macropores play a decisive role in the saturated hydraulic conductivity keywords macropore structure porosity connected pore x ray computed tomography data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction granite residual soil a special soil widely distributed throughout the world accounts for 40 of the total surface area of guangdong province and 60 in shenzhen city zhao et al 2021 its particle size composition pore distribution and mineral composition are subject to different degrees of weathering water infiltration causes granite residual soil to easily collapse and soften and pore structural changes and a reduction in matric suction result in a loss of shear strength nikooee et al 2013 bogaard and greco 2016 which is the main reason for slope instability ground subsidence and foundation settlement zhan et al 2018 the rainfall landslide accident in guangming district shenzhen caused heavy losses to people s lives and property the wetting or drying process leads to soil pore structure changes thus affecting the mechanical properties and permeability therefore research on wetting and drying cycles is of great significance for the soil pore structure the macropores are filled with pore water during the wetting process and the soil particles rearrange during the drying process pires et al 2020 wetting and drying cycles can also lead to the formation of aggregates in the soil and the restoration of damaged structures of some soils newman and thomasson 1979 pires et al 2007 tang et al 2020 assouline et al 1997 found that wetting and drying cycles make the soil dense affect the soil physical properties such as microstructure and lead to changes in water retention characteristics pillai and mcgarry 1999 qi et al 2021 in addition chen and ng 2013 wen et al 2021a and an et al 2022 found that soil will undergo irreversible volume expansion or contraction during wetting or drying especially wetting and drying which have a great impact on mesopores and macropores the effect of wetting drying cycles on the macropore structure is significant zhou et al 2021 but existing studies involve mostly two dimensional section analysis ct scanning is a nondestructive technology that can be used to better study and evaluate the change in the 3d soil pore structure and its possible repair after the wetting process luo et al 2010 and liao et al 2020 statistically analysed soil pore characteristic parameters ma et al 2015 found that the proportions of soil porosity fractures 100 ¬µm and macropores changed significantly during wetting and drying cycles pires et al 2020 studied the pore size and shape changes of soil after wetting and drying cycles razavifar et al 2021 used the kolmogorov smirnov test to analyse the degree of similarity of pore and throat size distributions obtained from different methods i e x ray ct mercury intrusion porosimetry and nuclear magnetic resonance and demonstrated that ct provides a better description of the real pore size distribution of porous media the application of ct in soil pore evaluation has been widely discussed especially by balogun and cruvinel 2003 mady and shein 2020 singh et al 2021 and de oliveira et al 2021 there are few quantitative analyses on the macropore structure of granite residual soil and there is a lack of research on the three dimensional pore evolution characteristics during wetting and drying cycles the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the change in the macropore structure for granite residual soil and its possible repair by wetting and drying cycles using microfocus x ray ct the effect of wetting and drying cycles on the macropore structure as well as the distribution characteristics of connected pores isolated pores and hydraulic conductivity is analysed 2 materials and tests 2 1 sample preparation the core samples of granite residual soil were excavated at depths of 5 10 m using a bucket auger from a foundation pit excavation in shenzhen the core samples were classified as sc according to the unified soil classification system 2006 see zhao et al 2022 for more details the physical parameters are found in table 1 the natural grain size distribution is shown in fig 1 the compaction test was carried out on the granite residual soil according to astm d1557 2009 the samples were prepared was 30 mm in height and 30 mm in diameter 2 2 wetting and drying cycle procedures first the sample was subjected to vacuum saturation treatment for 24 h and then the sample was subjected to a drying test by increasing the matric suction 500 kpa with a pressure plate instrument sdswcc geo experts germany according to astm d6836 16 wen et al 2020 to carry out one complete wetting and drying cycle an 8 day period was necessary in total three cycles were performed after each wetting or drying the water content was measured and the sample was sealed in a transparent container then ct scanning was carried out in addition the saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured after each wetting path by conducting the falling head test a variable head infiltration metre was connected to a water pipe to monitor the extent of the hydraulic gradient on top of the tested sample zhao et al 2022 2 3 ct scanning tests and method the wetting and drying cycle will linearly increase the number of macropores but the effect on micropores is not obvious dong et al 2020 tang et al 2020 in addition due to the limitation of ct scanning resolution on the tested sample size of granite residual soil this paper focuses on the macropores 20 Œºm analysed by an x radia micro xct 400 instrument after each scan 1104 greyscale images of the tested sample were obtained matlab and avizo were used to process the images and the experimental results were quantitatively analysed the median filter and grey intensity were used to separate the pore space and solid ct images singh et al 2021 wu et al 2019 the soil particles and the pores were segmented using the region growing method haralick et al 1987 higo et al 2014 the connectivity algorithm was applied in the image processing to obtain the connected pore space after subtracting the connected pore space from all pore spaces the isolated pore space could be obtained the sphere represents a pore in fig 2 and the channel connecting the two pores is the pore throat based on the pore network model blunt 2001 vogel et al 2005 in addition the predicted saturated hydraulic conductivity could be calculated by a pore network model zhang et al 2020 all soil pores were normalized and represented by spheres and the equivalent pore radius r of pores can be expressed as 1 r 3 v 4 œÄ 3 where v is the pore volume the porosity of the 2d slice can be expressed as follows 2 n 2 d a i a where a i is the pore area and a is the same plane as the total area including the pore area and particle area similarly the 3d porosity can be expressed as follows 3 n 3 d v v roi where v roi is the volume of the region of interest roi 3 results and discussion 3 1 water content and pore distribution the water content changes with the wetting and drying cycle path and the ct scanning points in fig 3 with increasing wetting times the water content decreases to 0 32 0 31 and 0 307 in contrast the water content increases with the drying times in the drying stage which are 0 131 0 138 and 0 141 respectively this result indicated that the water content changed under the wetting and drying cycle due to the change in the pore structure of granite residual soil including the change in the position and contact state between soil particles and the dissolution of water soluble salt dong et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 in the ct section of the same location of the sample in fig 4 the white part is soil particles and the black part is pores 20 Œºm there are more macropores in the wetting stage than in the drying stage the water content decreases during the drying stage and the macropore water is discharged then the surface water film of the soil particles decreases and the soil water contact angle decreases leading to the movement of the soil particles and the decrease or disappearance of the macropores with increasing water content the crystal layer and soil particles expand and the pores are filled with water the distance between soil particles also increases and the macropores greatly increase 3 2 measured 2d porosity spatial distribution curve the variation in the distribution of the porosity curve of each ct slice with the slice number is analysed in fig 5 the overall isolated porosity value is the smallest fluctuating up and down by 5 with the number of slices and the variation in the isolated pores is the smallest interestingly the variation in the connected pore porosity is the largest as shown by the red arrow in fig 5 with increasing wetting and drying cycles the variation continuously decreases in size and reaches the smallest size in the third cycle the porosity decreased with the three wetting drying cycles and was 0 119 0 11 and 0 107 respectively as shown in fig 8 this indicates that the soil undergoes volume shrinkage deformation from wetting to drying during the wetting and drying cycle the pore structure of the soil changes with the water content after several wetting and drying cycles the macropores increase due to the dissolution of water soluble salt mady and shein 2020 furthermore this is mainly due to the movement of particles blocking macropores or the generation of new pores in different wetting and drying states resulting in great changes in pore connectivity chen and ng 2013 3 3 3d macropore characteristics the connected pore space of the soil is the largest and the isolated pore space is the smallest after the first wetting cycle in fig 6 the connected pore space begins to decrease when first drying and the isolated pore space increases indicating that the pores in the soil are deformed or displaced with increasing cycles the connected pore space gradually decreases while the isolated pore space increases some isolated pores are connected with other pores and increase the connected pore space during the wetting process additionally many new small isolated pores are produced making the pore connectivity worse during the drying process in the process of wetting the expansion of soil aggregates leads to the enlargement of macropores and the recovery of some pores while drying leads to the contraction of soil aggregates making the soil denser and the isolated pores disappear as shown in fig 7 this is consistent with ying et al 2021 in the subsequent wetting and drying cycle some pores of soil continue to undergo the transition of closure and recovery pires et al 2020 in the third wetting and drying cycle the change in connected isolated pore space is similar to that after the second wetting cycle but the pore change is relatively small and basically consistent the connected pore space increases while the isolated pore space decreases in the wetting process the change trends of these two pore spaces are opposite in the drying process this shows that the pores in the soil deform resulting in more isolated pores and poor connectivity during drying on the other hand it is helpful to repair the lost isolated pores or eliminate small pores in the soil during wetting as shown in fig 7 helliwell et al 2017 made the same observations and the effect of wetting and drying cycles on the macropore structure was significant 3 4 measured macropore number and porosity the pore number and porosity are shown in fig 8 the numbers of total pores and isolated pores are much greater than that of connected pores however the connected porosity is much larger than the isolated porosity the difference between the connected porosity and the isolated porosity decreases with an increasing wetting number the isolated porosity accounts for 14 24 and 28 of the total porosity in contrast the porosities of the connected pores are 13 3 10 1 and 8 5 accounting for 86 76 and 72 of the total pores respectively this result is basically consistent with the spatial distribution map of connected pores as shown in fig 6 in addition the total porosity is 15 4 13 18 and 11 88 after the three wetting cycles this shows that the soil pore structure has changed the pore structure of the drying path changes more than that of the wetting path furthermore the total porosity and isolated porosity of the samples treated with two and three drying cycles are relatively similar indicating that the pore structure changes less with increasing cycles this phenomenon shows that the wetting and drying cycle shrinks and deforms the soil kido et al 2020 wen et al 2021b the volume shrinkage of the soil sample is composed of two parts in the wetting and drying cycle process one part is irreversible and is mainly caused by the collapse of pores between aggregates which is the main cause of plastic deformation the other part is reversible and the water can refill the original space after water absorption due to the movement of free water on the surface of soil aggregates romero et al 1999 3 5 macropore network and hydraulic conductivity the pore network characteristics of samples treated with three wetting paths are shown in fig 9 which directly reflects the connectivity of pores and is directly related to hydraulic characteristics an et al 2022 the connected pore distribution can be clearly seen the good distribution shows that pore water has good fluidity in soil the properties of the pores of the samples and the predicted hydraulic conductivity are shown in table 2 furthermore fig 10 demonstrates variations in the throat pore radius distribution within the pore network models from fig 9 the peak throat radius distribution is concentrated in the range of 20 40 Œºm in addition the proportion of smaller throat radii increases with increasing wetting times fig 10a although the peak pore radius distribution was 125 Œºm there was a reduction in the frequency of larger pore radii 200 Œºm with an increasing number of wetting times and an increase in smaller pores 200 Œºm compared to the 1st wetting fig 10b these results reveal that the drying and wetting cycles tended to form smaller pores and throats the saturated hydraulic conductivity of granite residual soil increases with connected porosity in fig 11 and the predicted hydraulic conductivity is very close to the measured values with the increase in the wetting path the connected porosity and hydraulic conductivity decrease this is mainly due to the shrinkage deformation of the soil as the water content decreases as shown in fig 3 the cohesion of the soil structure decreases and the soil pore channels are squeezed and filled by fine particles or aggregates and separated into other isolated pores leading to decreases in the pores throat radii as shown in fig 7 and fig 10 it can be concluded that the connected macropores play a decisive role in the saturated hydraulic conductivity of granite residual soil p√©riard et al 2016 nguyen et al 2019 beven and german 1982 also found a similar conclusion they also found that connected pores with a diameter of 0 3 mm in soil samples play a major role in conducting water 4 conclusions the macropore structure of granite residual soil treated with up to three wetting and drying cycles was determined by using x ray ct the spatial distribution of macropores was analysed and quantified the following conclusions were derived the variation in the connected porosity is greater than that of the porosity obtained based on all pores as well as isolated pores this is mainly due to the movement of soil particles blocking macropores and the generation of new isolated pores in different wetting and drying states resulting in great changes in pore connectivity the drying effect reduces the connectivity of the pore space and the number of isolated pores increases the wetting effect contributes to the recovery of the lost pores and connections and the pore space and porosity increase after wetting however the pore connectivity and pore throat radius decrease with an increasing number of cycles the volume shrinkage of the soil sample mainly caused irreversible plastic deformation due to pore collapse and recoverable deformation due to water wetting of the soil aggregates with the increase in the wetting path the hydraulic conductivity decreases due to decreases in the connected porosity and pore throat radius and the predicted hydraulic conductivity is very close to the measured values it can be concluded that the connected macropores play a decisive role in the saturated hydraulic

particles blocking macropores and the generation of new isolated pores in different wetting and drying states resulting in great changes in pore connectivity the drying effect reduces the connectivity of the pore space and the number of isolated pores increases the wetting effect contributes to the recovery of the lost pores and connections and the pore space and porosity increase after wetting however the pore connectivity and pore throat radius decrease with an increasing number of cycles the volume shrinkage of the soil sample mainly caused irreversible plastic deformation due to pore collapse and recoverable deformation due to water wetting of the soil aggregates with the increase in the wetting path the hydraulic conductivity decreases due to decreases in the connected porosity and pore throat radius and the predicted hydraulic conductivity is very close to the measured values it can be concluded that the connected macropores play a decisive role in the saturated hydraulic

2764,the strong hydrological characteristics and complex biochemical environment of floodplain lake systems make it difficult to obtain accurate convincing results from sediment pigments used as paleoenvironmental indicators understanding pigment migration and preservation mechanisms under hydrological regulation will help explain past ecological changes in these lake systems this study investigates phytoplankton community structure chlorophyll distribution and associated environmental factors throughout a hydrological cycle in poyang lake china in conjunction with pigment sediment characteristics this study also compared pigment deposition and preservation mechanisms among three hydrological lake zones i e sub lakes main lake and water channel results show a critical loss in sediment pigment information in the main lake and the water channel resulting from the lake s strong hydrodynamic conditions moreover oxygen and sunlight had a general inhibitory effect on pigment in the overlying water while unfavourable ph environments could affect pigments in the sediment that devoid of protective cell mechanisms results also show that as a biological proxy index sub lakes sediment pigments accurately reflect phytoplankton community structure in overlying water additionally due to the relative stability of the sub lakes environment it can be considered the preferential

interactions between anthropic and natural factors while also responding rapidly to nutrient and temperature changes accordingly lake systems have been referred to as sentinels of global climate change gao et al 2020 pacheco et al 2021 as an important material sink of lake systems lake sediment faithfully preserves a large amount of information about the ecological evolution of such lake

succession information from lake sediment through a series of modern means can address deficiencies in measured data over long term scales thomas et al 2021 belle et al 2021 moreover sedimentary photosynthetic pigment records can be used to reveal phytoplankton community alterations deshpande et al 2014 klamt et al 2021 while at the same time sedimentary pigments represent productivity szymczak zyla et al 2011 phytoplankton classification freiberg et al 2011 and water environment conditions fietz et al 2007 montes et al 2021 hofmann et al 2021 using sedimentary pigments to reconstruct past phytoplankton community structure and productivity processes require a comprehensive understanding of pigment stability and degradation mechanisms hobbs et al 2010 there are significant differences between surface sediment pigments and those in overlying water which largely result from the many factors that cause pigment degradation or loss in water i e sunlight temperature and zooplankton predation leavitt 1993 mathew et al 2021 studies have shown that 95 of endogenous pigment in water degrades within a few days louda et al 2002 additionally owing to differences in chemical stability caused by the chemical structure of the pigment itself the pigment structure that ultimately reaches the surface of deposits may correspondingly alter buchaca and catalan 2008 furthermore selective degradation becomes progressively more obvious as burial depth increases reconstructing changes in lake environments and associated ecological succession factors using paleolimnology information contained in sediment pigment has progressed somewhat in certain lake systems within the qinghai tibet plateau lami et al 2010 and in certain lake systems in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river such as chao lake and tai lake xue et al 2007 song et al 2019 hu et al 2014 extracted sediment pigments from two lakes on the eastern tibetan plateau and by comparing them with other environmental proxies concluded that nitrogen deposition is a controlling factor leading to increased lake productivity and suggested that sediment pigments can well document the ecological succession of lakes caused by nitrogen deposition on the plateau zhang et al 2019 used sediment pigments to reconstruct the phytoplankton community succession in chaohu lake since the 1960s and found that the construction of the chaohu lake dam in 1963 increased n and p inputs and higher mean temperatures combined to cause the decline of the dinoflagellate community from 90 to 15 and the outbreak of the blue green algae community from 5 to 35 because the hydrological conditions of these lake systems are relatively stable pigments are more easily preserved however for subtropical floodplain lake systems vulnerable to seasonal flooding with correspondingly poor pigment preservation the effectiveness of paleolimnological information in sediment pigment requires further validation the effect of hydrodynamic conditions on lake pigments prior to their stable preservation in lakebed sediment via deposition has largely been underestimated especially in floodplain lake systems with strong hydrodynamic conditions pigments in floodplain lake surface sediment remain in overlying water longer under intense resuspension processes resulting in the degradation of greater than 90 of pigments into colorless compounds before being permanently buried which results in a mismatch between pigments in overlying water and that in lakebed sediment freiberg et al 2011 most pigment that derives from phytoplankton in lake systems degrade to colorless compounds under intense sunlight conditions and high oxygen content at the lakebed surface sch√ºller et al 2015 sanchini and grosjean 2020 additionally even though sediment pigments derive from planktonic and benthic phototrophic bacteria cyanobacteria and algae aquatic macrophytes and plant material from surrounding watersheds may also contribute sediment pigments even though this plant based and exogenous pigment may be an important component of the ecological information that interferes with sediment pigment their overall proportions are generally low buchaca et al 2019 owing to these reasons paleoclimatic information stored in floodplain lake sediment affected by multiple factors is very complex the aim of this study was to reveal pigment deposition characteristics in the water of a large subtropical floodplain lake system under seasonal hydrological regulation this study hypothesized that the high spatial heterogeneity associated with the hydrological regulation of poyang lake is the key factor that has led to the spatial differentiation in surface sediment pigmentation to validate this hypothesis we focused on three specific objectives i to clarify the signaling significance of sediment pigments as biomarkers under complex hydrological conditions ii to analyze the regulation mechanisms of environmental factors on lake pigments iii to explore pigment migration characteristics driven by hydrological factors prior to their stable burial in lakebed sediment 2

to associated factors e g hydrological connectivity and topography the poyang lake basin can be divided into three hydrological zones the main lake sub lakes and the water channel accounting for

phytoplankton communities poyang lake has a total of 172 phytoplankton species belonging to eight phyla cyanobacteria chlorophyta and bacillariophyta are the dominant phytoplankton species throughout the lake although the community structure varies greatly among the different regions of the lake no significant difference was observed in total algae density fig 2 in the water channel the dominant phytoplankton communities are chlorophyta 28 7 and bacillariophyta 25 2 while in the sub lakes the dominant phytoplankton communities are cyanobacteria 48 9 and chlorophyta 29 9 comparatively sub lakes bacillariophyta and cryptophyta density was lowest the annual average chl concentration in the poyang lake basin is 19 39 Œºg l but its spatial distribution is uneven chl concentrations in the main lake and the water channel are lower than the average level of the whole lake i e 17 31 Œºg l and 18 44 Œºg l respectively the average annual sub lakes chl concentration can reach as high as 22 66 Œºg l which is much higher than in the other two zones consequently the chl concentration in the southern region of poyang lake 30 98 Œºg l which is mainly comprised of sub lakes is significantly higher compared to the northern region 15 70 Œºg l p 0 05 3 2 distribution characteristics of surface sediment pigments surface sediment pigment distribution in the poyang lake basin is extremely uneven fig 3 a which is associated with irregular hydrological processes generally the total concentration of sub lakes sediment pigment with an average of 213 58 nmol g om was much higher compared to the main lake with an average of 10 62 nmol g om the s8 sampling point had the highest chl and carotenoid concentrations in the sub lakes zone namely 34 28 nmol g om and 56 03 nmol g om respectively it is interesting to note that we detected no pigments in the s9 sampling point in the sub lakes zone in the northeastern region of poyang lake among the identified chl forms chl a accounted for 59 77 100 of undegraded chl while chl b was only detected at sampling points s3 40 23 s6 15 62 and s8 31 39 degraded chlorophyll i e deg chl which includes phy a1 phy a2 phy b1 and phy b2 accounted for 95 14 100 of total chlorophyll tchl which was mainly composed of deg chl b fig 3b carotenoids being characteristic phytoplankton pigments were only detected at certain sampling points and the composition of carotenoids varied significantly among the different sampling points fig 3c carotenoid species were most abundant in sub lakes surface sediment while only one carotenoid species was identified in main lake surface sediment i e fucoxanthin fucox fucox is the most common carotenoid in poyang lake surface sediment with an average concentration of 0 77 nmol g om which may indicate that diatoms are the dominant phytoplankton species group in poyang lake on the other hand diatoxanthin diato lutein and zeaxanthin lut zeax and Œ≤ carotene Œ≤ carot were only detected in sub lakes surface sediment with mean concentrations of 0 42 16 42 and 7 75 nmol g om respectively 3 3 changes in the poyang lake water environment this study detected obvious differences in hydrological characteristics among the three poyang lake zones especially between the sub lakes and water channel zones table 1 hydrologically the water channel is characterized by its deep depth 13 10 3 76 m high velocity 0 48 0 06 m s and high transparency 0 42 0 09 m the sub lakes zone is a unique lake geographical unit type in poyang lake during the dry season which is intermittently connected to the main lake thus it acts relatively independently with a slow flow rate 0 29 0 08 m s and a shallow water depth 0 35 0 06 m obvious regional differences were observed in do wherein the sub lakes zone had the lowest average do 6 93 mg l followed by the main lake 8 45 mg l and the water channel with the highest overall do 9 11 mg l the tn concentration of the sub lakes zone was 1 30 0 06 mg l which was significantly lower compared to corresponding values of the main lake and the water channel zones i e 2 05 0 21 and 1 94 0 05 mg l respectively p 0 05 similar to tn content no3 n and nh4 n concentrations were lowest in the sub lakes zone for tn content in the main lake and the water channel no3 n was the main component accounting for 63 30 while its corresponding proportion was only 22 91 in the sub lakes zone like the high tn concentration at h10 in the main lake i e 2 41 mg l this sampling point also yielded a high no3 n concentration 1 49 mg l however the changing trend in tp was opposite of that of tn with significantly lower tp concentrations in the water channel 0 05 0 01 mg l compared to corresponding values in the other two zones p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 sediment pigment preservation characteristics in a floodplain lake system and their applicability as proxies surface sediment pigments derive from primary producers such as planktonic and benthic phototrophic bacteria lake algae and a small amount of plant debris distributed throughout the surrounding catchment leavitt and hodgson 2001 buchaca et al 2019 by observing the content and composition of surface sediment pigments we can indirectly infer the corresponding hydrological conditions of overlying water as well as the nutritional status of a lake system mcgowan et al 2005 waters et al 2015 for floodplain lake systems it has been shown that pigment dynamics in the upper sediment layer are not typically consistent with their dynamic performance in water freiberg et al 2011 fig 4 which is consistent with findings from our study moreover results showed no significant differences in chl content in water samples in the three poyang lake zones while a difference was found in the chl content in surface sediment main lake sub lakes water channel fig 4a this suggests that there are no significant differences in the main source of sediment pigment content i e water pigments in the floodplain lakes differences in the distribution of pigments in the sediment are mainly due to degradation during the deposition of pigments into the sediment and by adverse environmental conditions after deposition into the sediment sedimentation pigment dynamics were controlled by differences in physical and chemical properties in these three hydrological zones moreover sedimentary pigment that ultimately reached the surface sediment layer did not match that in overlying water cahoon and safi 2002 song et al 2019 additionally this study fitted chl concentrations in water and sediment to explore chl deposition characteristics fig 4b it is interesting to note that chl deposition characteristics in water varied significantly among the different zones where the sub lakes yielded the highest deposition ratio followed by the main lake and the water channel with the lowest deposition ratio for the water channel surface sediment pigment concentrations were not affected by overlying water pigment concentrations which were continuously maintained at approximately 10 36 nmol g om moreover chl concentrations in sub lakes surface sediment were affected by chl concentrations in overlying water which rapidly increased with an increase in the chl concentrations in overlying water especially when the chl concentration in water was greater than 25 Œºg l the ratio of chl to tchl was used to calculate sediment pigment preservation where the index ranged from 0 low pigment preservation indicating that environmental conditions are not conducive to pigment preservation and that pigment degradation is severe to 1 high pigment preservation indicating that environmental conditions are favourable for pigment preservation and that most of the pigments are not degraded buchaca and catalan 2007 deshpande et al 2014 singh and krishnan 2019 the sediment pigment preservation index of the poyang lake basin was generally low with an average value of 1 43 especially in the water channel where the preservation index at several sampling points was 0 this means that the degree of chl degradation in the water channel was high sedimentary pigments are considered important proxies in determining lake productivity phytoplankton community structure and aquatic environmental change zhen et al 2016 chen et al 2016 under influencing factors i e sunlight ph and hydrological condition surface sediment pigment diversity in poyang lake significantly differed in particular surface sediment pigments in the main lake and the water channel lost their significance as water ecology proxies due to their relatively low concentrations and lack of characteristic pigment species however surface sediment pigments in the sub lakes were relatively well preserved making this the key zone in which to obtain lake proxy indicators to further explore the applicability of sub lakes surface sediment of large floodplain lake systems to serve as proxies from which to determine phytoplankton community structure in lake water this study classified phytoplankton community structure and corresponding characteristic pigments fig 5 we found that the characteristics of corresponding pigments of the main phytoplankton species chlorophyta cyanobacteria cryptophyta and bacillariophyta in poyang lake were well preserved especially total algae Œ≤ carot and chl a chlorophyta chl b phy b1 and phy b2 and the cyano chloro mixture lut zeax it should be noted that since the degradation rate of chl occurs more rapidly than that of carotenoids josefson and hansen 2003 mikomagi et al 2016 especially in shallow lake systems sunlight can penetrate the overlying water and reach the lakebed thus corresponding degraded pigment should be accounted for when using chl as an algae reference pigment otherwise the status of the actual phytoplankton community may be underestimated dominant surface sediment pigments in poyang lake were chl b including its associated degradation products and lut zeax while their major producers i e chlorophyta and cyanobacteria were also dominant phytoplankton communities in the study area generally adequate sunlight reaches the lakebed of highly transparent lake systems this forms an autotrophic biofilm on surface sediment which in turn provides new pigments while chlorophyta and cyanobacteria are considered the main producers in this area yang et al 2019 buchaca and catalan 2008 this explains why sub lakes surface sediment pigment is controlled by its characteristic pigment previous studies found that pelagic plants were the main sources of fucox and diato bj√∏rnland et al 2003 trice et al 2004 alami et al 2012 throughout the study area the proportion of concentrations of these two pigments was 5 which was slightly lower than the proportion of bacillariophyta to total algae 9 62 thus in poyang lake the contribution of pelagic plants to sediment pigments is not significant additionally sediment c n ratio calculations with an average of 9 00 further strengthened our conclusion that sediment pigments mainly derived from lake phytoplankton sources zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 li et al 2021 we found that sub lakes surface sediment pigments in this floodplain lake system were less affected by exogenous factors while correlating well with its phytoplankton community which can be used to accurately reflect differences in algal community composition and density 4 2 lake environmental effects on pigments pigment degradation in overlying water is typically rapid and extensive and the rate of degradation is greatly reduced when pigments reach the sediment layer especially under anoxic conditions villanueva and hastings 2000 however pigments are always exposed to overlying water and are affected by chemical oxidation and biological disturbances before being buried deeper in sediment buchaca et al 2019 gao et al 2022 further analysis of the environmental physicochemical parameters that affect pigment preservation revealed differences in the response of different pigments to environmental factors fig 6 a among pigments chl is typically more unstable than carotenoids however its degradation products i e pheophorbide may persistent in sediment records rydberg et al 2020 moreover ph affects phytoplankton survival in aquatic environments while also preserving pigments in surface sediment li et al 2021 chorvatova et al 2020 our results emphasize the positive correlation that ph has with aqueous chl which is due to the combined effect of carbon dioxide co2 and bicarbonate hco3 absorption by phytoplankton in water kaijser et al 2021 as chl a increases co2 concentrations will decrease and ph will increase resulting from increased rates of phytoplankton consumption balmer and downing 2011 crawford et al 2016 moreover given that sediment chl and deg chl lack phytoplankton cell protection mechanisms they will be directly exposed to a high ph environment leading to the destruction of their chemical structure effectuating a negative correlation with ph the distribution of pigment of sediment in poyang lake was spread well along the axis of pc1 which explained 77 80 of the variation distribution of pigments while the distribution of chl in the water was well distributed along the pc2 axis 18 11 do was the main explanatory variables of pc2 accounting for 0 57 indicating that the oxygen environmental condition of water was the important factor causing the difference of pigment concentration fig 6a like other organic matter pigments will degrade less rapidly under anoxic conditions compared to oxidated conditions josefson et al 2012 our study found that do concentrations negatively correlated to pigment concentrations whether in overlying water or surface sediment especially carotenoids woulds and cowie 2009 reasoned that anoxic conditions affect pigment abundance by increasing concentrations of refractory pigments that are ultimately buried in sediment in our study we found that sediment pigments in poyang lake were severely degraded and most chl had converted into more stable pheophytin i e deg chl the sub lakes located within the protected area is largely protected from human activities and nutrient transport while the main lake and the water channel in contrast have increased nutrient input due to human activities such as navigation sand dredging and domestic sewage as we investigated the tn concentration in the sub lakes was significantly lower than in other areas p 0 05 table 1 nutrient input has exacerbated lake eutrophication to some extent as evidenced by the higher algal biomass in the main lake and water channel than in the sub lakes fig 2b algae are a major source of pigment however the high biomass is not reflected in the sediment pigments the aquatic conditions high ph high do in the main lake and water channel resulted in a loss of signal during pigment deposition and after reaching the sediment this loss is perhaps greater than the pigment recharge from the high algal biomass 4 3 hydrological driving mechanisms of pigment migration sunlight that reaches the lakebed will decrease as lake depth increases this lower light intensity reduces photodegradation thus better preserving lakebed pigments mcgowan 2007 however this study found that the deposition capacity and the preservation status of sediment pigments at a deep depth i e the water channel under low sunlight conditions were extremely poor the water depth and flow velocity as important hydrological parameters scored 0 31 and 0 34 on pc1 sediment pigment and 0 41 and 0 53 on pc2 water pigment respectively fig 6a therefore the strong hydrodynamic condition in this area is the key to this phenomenon potential reasons for this are as follows first high flow velocities will disturb pigment transportation dynamics in water bodies as they move into adjacent drainage basins thus reducing the deposition ratio into sediment second secondary suspension caused by high flow velocities will enable surface sediment pigments to once again resuspend into the overlying water which will enhance the degree of secondary degradation reuss et al 2005 florian et al 2015 in contrast sub lakes water depth was relatively shallow and its flow rate was slow although sunlight is strong in overlying water the extremely short distance before pigments settle ensures their stability the expediency of pigments in aqueous environments that reach the sediment surface is therefore maximized thus pigment deposition rates in such environments are high additionally low flow rates and low transparency also had a positive effect on sediment pigment preservation yielding a 1 56 average preservation index value to further clarify the controlling factors that cause spatial differences in surface sediment pigments in floodplain lake systems this study also determined the degree of interpretation of environmental factors i e the hydrological conditions and physical and chemical parameters of sediments on spatial variation using variance partitioning analysis vpa fig 6b results showed that the strong hydrological condition of this floodplain lake system accounted for 15 93 of spatial variability and was considered a key controlling factor of chl deposition previous studies on sediment pigment preservation and distribution have focused on traditional aquatic conditions with insufficient attention paid to lake dynamics processes kuefner et al 2021 sch√ºller et al 2015 this study emphasizes that the effect of intense hydrological conditions on pigment preservation may be underestimations in floodplain lake systems compared to corresponding temperate and high altitude lake systems fucox is extremely unstable and its degradation rate is even higher than that of chl a thus the fucox signal can easily be lost aneeshkumar and sujatha 2012 mathew et al 2021 however sub lakes sediment in this study still retained a clear fucox signal with an average concentration of 1 15n mol g om indicating that pigment degraded more slowly than expected under the influence of sunlight oxygen and other related factors during its descent compared to water channel sedimentation characteristics the hydrodynamic condition of the floodplain lake system was the controlling factor that affected water pigment sedimentation and its preservation rather than other chemical parameters in water this finding was also confirmed through vpa analysis fig 6b moreover this can also guide the assessment of limnetic paleoenvironmental issues for floodplain lake systems with strong hydrodynamic conditions relatively stable sub lakes zones are best for obtaining historical limnetic information the interconnection associated with lake water pigment migration dynamics are as follows 1 pigments first settle smoothly onto lakebed sediment 2 pigments then degrade under the physical and chemical environment of overlying water 3 pigments are eventually transported to the lower reaches of a watershed as per the specific hydrodynamic condition of the lake fig 7 understanding proportional differences among these three processes are key to accurately obtaining the paleolimnological information contained in lake sediment the effect of the factors that promote the degradation of pigments on the components of deposited pigments largely depends on the time it takes for pigments to reach the lakebed which is directly related to the distance between the pigment source and the sediment cuddington and leavitt 1999 buchaca and catalan 2008 this study determined that the degree of sediment pigment preservation information per zone was as follows water channel main lake sub lakes which was largely due to differences in water depth although an increase in water depth will reduce sunlight from reaching the lakebed an increase in settling time will also make pigments degrade more severely in overlying water e g through means of more intensive grazing processes buchaca and catalan 2007 additionally effects of hydrodynamic conditions on pigment deposition have largely been underestimated this is because flow rates in the main lake and the water channel of poyang lake are much higher compared to conventional lake systems due to regional specificity li et al 2014 qi et al 2019 currents drive water pigments which greatly impact the difficultly in their settling onto lakebed sediment moreover a portion of this pigment will be transported to the downstream basin area while that in the main lake will be transported to the water channel and that in the water channel will be eventually transported to the yangtze river it has been reported that the strong interaction between hydro geomorphological and sedimentary processes in the poyang lake water channel has affected local lakebed morphology yuan et al 2021 while the strong secondary suspension caused by hydraulic scouring has become an important factor affecting sediment pigments secondary suspension forces pigments that have already settled onto the lakebed to resuspend and mix with overlying water thus having to go through the settling process again gao et al 2021 2022 this means that few pigments ultimately get buried in sediment thus the accuracy of pigment limnological information in the main lake and water channel is lost 5 conclusions this study showed that sediment pigments in the main lake and the water channel of poyang lake were severely degraded and thus lost their significance as lake proxy indicators combined with phytoplankton community structure in overlying water and the physical and chemical parameters of lake water we found that phytoplankton growth increased the water column pigment levels while leading to co2 depletion and increased ph however high ph suppresses pigments in sediments that have lost their cytoprotective mechanisms additionally hypoxic conditions were conducive to sediment pigment preservation although carotenoids were particularly sensitive to oxygen pheophytin were not and were thus well preserved results from this study indicated that secondary suspension and hydrological transport caused by strong hydrodynamic conditions have a higher limiting effect on pigment preservation compared to other parameters and are therefore the main influencing factors prior to the stable burial of pigments in floodplain lakebed sediment because the sub lakes environment is relatively stable surface sediment pigments can still be used as biomarkers to accurately reflect phytoplankton community structure in overlying water this study was designed to provide additional information to explore material migration characteristics driven by floodplain hydrology and paleoenvironmental

characteristics this study also compared pigment deposition and preservation mechanisms among three hydrological lake zones i e sub lakes main lake and water channel results show a critical loss in sediment pigment information in the main lake and the water channel resulting from the lake s strong hydrodynamic conditions moreover oxygen and sunlight had a general inhibitory effect on pigment in the overlying water while unfavourable ph environments could affect pigments in the sediment that devoid of protective cell mechanisms results also show that as a biological proxy index sub lakes sediment pigments accurately reflect phytoplankton community structure in overlying water additionally due to the relative stability of the sub lakes environment it can be considered the preferential

available on request 1 introduction geographical units specific to lake systems are highly sensitive to climate and environmental changes they can reflect regional changes in natural environments and interactions between anthropic and natural factors while also responding rapidly to nutrient and temperature changes accordingly lake systems have been referred to as sentinels of global climate change gao et al 2020 pacheco et al 2021 as an important material sink of lake systems lake sediment faithfully preserves a large amount of information about the ecological evolution of such lake systems providing a basis from which to comprehensively discern lake ecosystem response processes under a background of climate change verleyen et al 2005 bourel et al 2021 obtaining ecological succession information from lake sediment through a series of modern means can address deficiencies in measured data over long term scales thomas et al 2021 belle et al 2021 moreover sedimentary photosynthetic pigment records can be used to reveal phytoplankton community alterations deshpande et al 2014 klamt et al 2021 while at the same time sedimentary pigments represent productivity szymczak zyla et al 2011 phytoplankton classification freiberg et al 2011 and water environment conditions fietz et al 2007 montes et al 2021 hofmann et al 2021 using sedimentary pigments to reconstruct past phytoplankton community structure and productivity processes require a comprehensive understanding of pigment stability and degradation mechanisms hobbs et al 2010 there are significant differences between surface sediment pigments and those in overlying water which largely result from the many factors that cause pigment degradation or loss in water i e sunlight temperature and zooplankton predation leavitt 1993 mathew et al 2021 studies have shown that 95 of endogenous pigment in water degrades within a few days louda et al 2002 additionally owing to differences in chemical stability caused by the chemical structure of the pigment itself the pigment structure that ultimately reaches the surface of deposits may correspondingly alter buchaca and catalan 2008 furthermore selective degradation becomes progressively more obvious as burial depth increases reconstructing changes in lake environments and associated ecological succession factors using paleolimnology information contained in sediment pigment has progressed somewhat in certain lake systems within the qinghai tibet plateau lami et al 2010 and in certain lake systems in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river such as chao lake and tai lake xue et al 2007 song et al 2019 hu et al 2014 extracted sediment pigments from two lakes on the eastern tibetan plateau and by comparing them with other environmental proxies concluded that nitrogen deposition is a controlling factor leading to increased lake productivity and suggested that sediment pigments can well document the ecological succession of lakes caused by nitrogen deposition on the plateau zhang et al 2019 used sediment pigments to reconstruct the phytoplankton community succession in chaohu lake since the 1960s and found that the construction of the chaohu lake dam in 1963 increased n and p inputs and higher mean temperatures combined to cause the decline of the dinoflagellate community from 90 to 15 and the outbreak of the blue green algae community from 5 to 35 because the hydrological conditions of these lake systems are relatively stable pigments are more easily preserved however for subtropical floodplain lake systems vulnerable to seasonal flooding with correspondingly poor pigment preservation the effectiveness of paleolimnological information in sediment pigment requires further validation the effect of hydrodynamic conditions on lake pigments prior to their stable preservation in lakebed sediment via deposition has largely been underestimated especially in floodplain lake systems with strong hydrodynamic conditions pigments in floodplain lake surface sediment remain in overlying water longer under intense resuspension processes resulting in the degradation of greater than 90 of pigments into colorless compounds before being permanently buried which results in a mismatch between pigments in overlying water and that in lakebed sediment freiberg et al 2011 most pigment that derives from phytoplankton in lake systems degrade to colorless compounds under intense sunlight conditions and high oxygen content at the lakebed surface sch√ºller et al 2015 sanchini and grosjean 2020 additionally even though sediment pigments derive from planktonic and benthic phototrophic bacteria cyanobacteria and algae aquatic macrophytes and plant material from surrounding watersheds may also contribute sediment pigments even though this plant based and exogenous pigment may be an important component of the ecological information that interferes with sediment pigment their overall proportions are generally low buchaca et al 2019 owing to these reasons paleoclimatic information stored in floodplain lake sediment affected by multiple factors is very complex the aim of this study was to reveal pigment deposition characteristics in the water of a large subtropical floodplain lake system under seasonal hydrological regulation this study hypothesized that the high spatial heterogeneity associated with the hydrological regulation of poyang lake is the key factor that has led to the spatial differentiation in surface sediment pigmentation to validate this hypothesis we focused on three specific objectives i to clarify the signaling significance of sediment pigments as biomarkers under complex hydrological conditions ii to analyze the regulation mechanisms of environmental factors on lake pigments iii to explore pigment migration characteristics driven by hydrological factors prior to their stable burial in lakebed sediment 2

to associated factors e g hydrological connectivity and topography the poyang lake basin can be divided into three hydrological zones the main lake sub lakes and the water channel accounting for

phytoplankton communities poyang lake has a total of 172 phytoplankton species belonging to eight phyla cyanobacteria chlorophyta and bacillariophyta are the dominant phytoplankton species throughout the lake although the community structure varies greatly among the different regions of the lake no significant difference was observed in total algae density fig 2 in the water channel the dominant phytoplankton communities are chlorophyta 28 7 and bacillariophyta 25 2 while in the sub lakes the dominant phytoplankton communities are cyanobacteria 48 9 and chlorophyta 29 9 comparatively sub lakes bacillariophyta and cryptophyta density was lowest the annual average chl concentration in the poyang lake basin is 19 39 Œºg l but its spatial distribution is uneven chl concentrations in the main lake and the water channel are lower than the average level of the whole lake i e 17 31 Œºg l and 18 44 Œºg l respectively the average annual sub lakes chl concentration can reach as high as 22 66 Œºg l which is much higher than in the other two zones consequently the chl concentration in the southern region of poyang lake 30 98 Œºg l which is mainly comprised of sub lakes is significantly higher compared to the northern region 15 70 Œºg l p 0 05 3 2 distribution characteristics of surface sediment pigments surface sediment pigment distribution in the poyang lake basin is extremely uneven fig 3 a which is associated with irregular hydrological processes generally the total concentration of sub lakes sediment pigment with an average of 213 58 nmol g om was much higher compared to the main lake with an average of 10 62 nmol g om the s8 sampling point had the highest chl and carotenoid concentrations in the sub lakes zone namely 34 28 nmol g om and 56 03 nmol g om respectively it is interesting to note that we detected no pigments in the s9 sampling point in the sub lakes zone in the northeastern region of poyang lake among the identified chl forms chl a accounted for 59 77 100 of undegraded chl while chl b was only detected at sampling points s3 40 23 s6 15 62 and s8 31 39 degraded chlorophyll i e deg chl which includes phy a1 phy a2 phy b1 and phy b2 accounted for 95 14 100 of total chlorophyll tchl which was mainly composed of deg chl b fig 3b carotenoids being characteristic phytoplankton pigments were only detected at certain sampling points and the composition of carotenoids varied significantly among the different sampling points fig 3c carotenoid species were most abundant in sub lakes surface sediment while only one carotenoid species was identified in main lake surface sediment i e fucoxanthin fucox fucox is the most common carotenoid in poyang lake surface sediment with an average concentration of 0 77 nmol g om which may indicate that diatoms are the dominant phytoplankton species group in poyang lake on the other hand diatoxanthin diato lutein and zeaxanthin lut zeax and Œ≤ carotene Œ≤ carot were only detected in sub lakes surface sediment with mean concentrations of 0 42 16 42 and 7 75 nmol g om respectively 3 3 changes in the poyang lake water environment this study detected obvious differences in hydrological characteristics among the three poyang lake zones especially between the sub lakes and water channel zones table 1 hydrologically the water channel is characterized by its deep depth 13 10 3 76 m high velocity 0 48 0 06 m s and high transparency 0 42 0 09 m the sub lakes zone is a unique lake geographical unit type in poyang lake during the dry season which is intermittently connected to the main lake thus it acts relatively independently with a slow flow rate 0 29 0 08 m s and a shallow water depth 0 35 0 06 m obvious regional differences were observed in do wherein the sub lakes zone had the lowest average do 6 93 mg l followed by the main lake 8 45 mg l and the water channel with the highest overall do 9 11 mg l the tn concentration of the sub lakes zone was 1 30 0 06 mg l which was significantly lower compared to corresponding values of the main lake and the water channel zones i e 2 05 0 21 and 1 94 0 05 mg l respectively p 0 05 similar to tn content no3 n and nh4 n concentrations were lowest in the sub lakes zone for tn content in the main lake and the water channel no3 n was the main component accounting for 63 30 while its corresponding proportion was only 22 91 in the sub lakes zone like the high tn concentration at h10 in the main lake i e 2 41 mg l this sampling point also yielded a high no3 n concentration 1 49 mg l however the changing trend in tp was opposite of that of tn with significantly lower tp concentrations in the water channel 0 05 0 01 mg l compared to corresponding values in the other two zones p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 sediment pigment preservation characteristics in a floodplain lake system and their applicability as proxies surface sediment pigments derive from primary producers such as planktonic and benthic phototrophic bacteria lake algae and a small amount of plant debris distributed throughout the surrounding catchment leavitt and hodgson 2001 buchaca et al 2019 by observing the content and composition of surface sediment pigments we can indirectly infer the corresponding hydrological conditions of overlying water as well as the nutritional status of a lake system mcgowan et al 2005 waters et al 2015 for floodplain lake systems it has been shown that pigment dynamics in the upper sediment layer are not typically consistent with their dynamic performance in water freiberg et al 2011 fig 4 which is consistent with findings from our study moreover results showed no significant differences in chl content in water samples in the three poyang lake zones while a difference was found in the chl content in surface sediment main lake sub lakes water channel fig 4a this suggests that there are no significant differences in the main source of sediment pigment content i e water pigments in the floodplain lakes differences in the distribution of pigments in the sediment are mainly due to degradation during the deposition of pigments into the sediment and by adverse environmental conditions after deposition into the sediment sedimentation pigment dynamics were controlled by differences in physical and chemical properties in these three hydrological zones moreover sedimentary pigment that ultimately reached the surface sediment layer did not match that in overlying water cahoon and safi 2002 song et al 2019 additionally this study fitted chl concentrations in water and sediment to explore chl deposition characteristics fig 4b it is interesting to note that chl deposition characteristics in water varied significantly among the different zones where the sub lakes yielded the highest deposition ratio followed by the main lake and the water channel with the lowest deposition ratio for the water channel surface sediment pigment concentrations were not affected by overlying water pigment concentrations which were continuously maintained at approximately 10 36 nmol g om moreover chl concentrations in sub lakes surface sediment were affected by chl concentrations in overlying water which rapidly increased with an increase in the chl concentrations in overlying water especially when the chl concentration in water was greater than 25 Œºg l the ratio of chl to tchl was used to calculate sediment pigment preservation where the index ranged from 0 low pigment preservation indicating that environmental conditions are not conducive to pigment preservation and that pigment degradation is severe to 1 high pigment preservation indicating that environmental conditions are favourable for pigment preservation and that most of the pigments are not degraded buchaca and catalan 2007 deshpande et al 2014 singh and krishnan 2019 the sediment pigment preservation index of the poyang lake basin was generally low with an average value of 1 43 especially in the water channel where the preservation index at several sampling points was 0 this means that the degree of chl degradation in the water channel was high sedimentary pigments are considered important proxies in determining lake productivity phytoplankton community structure and aquatic environmental change zhen et al 2016 chen et al 2016 under influencing factors i e sunlight ph and hydrological condition surface sediment pigment diversity in poyang lake significantly differed in particular surface sediment pigments in the main lake and the water channel lost their significance as water ecology proxies due to their relatively low concentrations and lack of characteristic pigment species however surface sediment pigments in the sub lakes were relatively well preserved making this the key zone in which to obtain lake proxy indicators to further explore the applicability of sub lakes surface sediment of large floodplain lake systems to serve as proxies from which to determine phytoplankton community structure in lake water this study classified phytoplankton community structure and corresponding characteristic pigments fig 5 we found that the characteristics of corresponding pigments of the main phytoplankton species chlorophyta cyanobacteria cryptophyta and bacillariophyta in poyang lake were well preserved especially total algae Œ≤ carot and chl a chlorophyta chl b phy b1 and phy b2 and the cyano chloro mixture lut zeax it should be noted that since the degradation rate of chl occurs more rapidly than that of carotenoids josefson and hansen 2003 mikomagi et al 2016 especially in shallow lake systems sunlight can penetrate the overlying water and reach the lakebed thus corresponding degraded pigment should be accounted for when using chl as an algae reference pigment otherwise the status of the actual phytoplankton community may be underestimated dominant surface sediment pigments in poyang lake were chl b including its associated degradation products and lut zeax while their major producers i e chlorophyta and cyanobacteria were also dominant phytoplankton communities in the study area generally adequate sunlight reaches the lakebed of highly transparent lake systems this forms an autotrophic biofilm on surface sediment which in turn provides new pigments while chlorophyta and cyanobacteria are considered the main producers in this area yang et al 2019 buchaca and catalan 2008 this explains why sub lakes surface sediment pigment is controlled by its characteristic pigment previous studies found that pelagic plants were the main sources of fucox and diato bj√∏rnland et al 2003 trice et al 2004 alami et al 2012 throughout the study area the proportion of concentrations of these two pigments was 5 which was slightly lower than the proportion of bacillariophyta to total algae 9 62 thus in poyang lake the contribution of pelagic plants to sediment pigments is not significant additionally sediment c n ratio calculations with an average of 9 00 further strengthened our conclusion that sediment pigments mainly derived from lake phytoplankton sources zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 li et al 2021 we found that sub lakes surface sediment pigments in this floodplain lake system were less affected by exogenous factors while correlating well with its phytoplankton community which can be used to accurately reflect differences in algal community composition and density 4 2 lake environmental effects on pigments pigment degradation in overlying water is typically rapid and extensive and the rate of degradation is greatly reduced when pigments reach the sediment layer especially under anoxic conditions villanueva and hastings 2000 however pigments are always exposed to overlying water and are affected by chemical oxidation and biological disturbances before being buried deeper in sediment buchaca et al 2019 gao et al 2022 further analysis of the environmental physicochemical parameters that affect pigment preservation revealed differences in the response of different pigments to environmental factors fig 6 a among pigments chl is typically more unstable than carotenoids however its degradation products i e pheophorbide may persistent in sediment records rydberg et al 2020 moreover ph affects phytoplankton survival in aquatic environments while also preserving pigments in surface sediment li et al 2021 chorvatova et al 2020 our results emphasize the positive correlation that ph has with aqueous chl which is due to the combined effect of carbon dioxide co2 and bicarbonate hco3 absorption by phytoplankton in water kaijser et al 2021 as chl a increases co2 concentrations will decrease and ph will increase resulting from increased rates of phytoplankton consumption balmer and downing 2011 crawford et al 2016 moreover given that sediment chl and deg chl lack phytoplankton cell protection mechanisms they will be directly exposed to a high ph environment leading to the destruction of their chemical structure effectuating a negative correlation with ph the distribution of pigment of sediment in poyang lake was spread well along the axis of pc1 which explained 77 80 of the variation distribution of pigments while the distribution of chl in the water was well distributed along the pc2 axis 18 11 do was the main explanatory variables of pc2 accounting for 0 57 indicating that the oxygen environmental condition of water was the important factor causing the difference of pigment concentration fig 6a like other organic matter pigments will degrade less rapidly under anoxic conditions compared to oxidated conditions josefson et al 2012 our study found that do concentrations negatively correlated to pigment concentrations whether in overlying water or surface sediment especially carotenoids woulds and cowie 2009 reasoned that anoxic conditions affect pigment abundance by increasing concentrations of refractory pigments that are ultimately buried in sediment in our study we found that sediment pigments in poyang lake were severely degraded and most chl had converted into more stable pheophytin i e deg chl the sub lakes located within the protected area is largely protected from human activities and nutrient transport while the main lake and the water channel in contrast have increased nutrient input due to human activities such as navigation sand dredging and domestic sewage as we investigated the tn concentration in the sub lakes was significantly lower than in other areas p 0 05 table 1 nutrient input has exacerbated lake eutrophication to some extent as evidenced by the higher algal biomass in the main lake and water channel than in the sub lakes fig 2b algae are a major source of pigment however the high biomass is not reflected in the sediment pigments the aquatic conditions high ph high do in the main lake and water channel resulted in a loss of signal during pigment deposition and after reaching the sediment this loss is perhaps greater than the pigment recharge from the high algal biomass 4 3 hydrological driving mechanisms of pigment migration sunlight that reaches the lakebed will decrease as lake depth increases this lower light intensity reduces photodegradation thus better preserving lakebed pigments mcgowan 2007 however this study found that the deposition capacity and the preservation status of sediment pigments at a deep depth i e the water channel under low sunlight conditions were extremely poor the water depth and flow velocity as important hydrological parameters scored 0 31 and 0 34 on pc1 sediment pigment and 0 41 and 0 53 on pc2 water pigment respectively fig 6a therefore the strong hydrodynamic condition in this area is the key to this phenomenon potential reasons for this are as follows first high flow velocities will disturb pigment transportation dynamics in water bodies as they move into adjacent drainage basins thus reducing the deposition ratio into sediment second secondary suspension caused by high flow velocities will enable surface sediment pigments to once again resuspend into the overlying water which will enhance the degree of secondary degradation reuss et al 2005 florian et al 2015 in contrast sub lakes water depth was relatively shallow and its flow rate was slow although sunlight is strong in overlying water the extremely short distance before pigments settle ensures their stability the expediency of pigments in aqueous environments that reach the sediment surface is therefore maximized thus pigment deposition rates in such environments are high additionally low flow rates and low transparency also had a positive effect on sediment pigment preservation yielding a 1 56 average preservation index value to further clarify the controlling factors that cause spatial differences in surface sediment pigments in floodplain lake systems this study also determined the degree of interpretation of environmental factors i e the hydrological conditions and physical and chemical parameters of sediments on spatial variation using variance partitioning analysis vpa fig 6b results showed that the strong hydrological condition of this floodplain lake system accounted for 15 93 of spatial variability and was considered a key controlling factor of chl deposition previous studies on sediment pigment preservation and distribution have focused on traditional aquatic conditions with insufficient attention paid to lake dynamics processes kuefner et al 2021 sch√ºller et al 2015 this study emphasizes that the effect of intense hydrological conditions on pigment preservation may be underestimations in floodplain lake systems compared to corresponding temperate and high altitude lake systems fucox is extremely unstable and its degradation rate is even higher than that of chl a thus the fucox signal can easily be lost aneeshkumar and sujatha 2012 mathew et al 2021 however sub lakes sediment in this study still retained a clear fucox signal with an average concentration of 1 15n mol g om indicating that pigment degraded more slowly than expected under the influence of sunlight oxygen and other related factors during its descent compared to water channel sedimentation characteristics the hydrodynamic condition of the floodplain lake system was the controlling factor that affected water pigment sedimentation and its preservation rather than other chemical parameters in water this finding was also confirmed through vpa analysis fig 6b moreover this can also guide the assessment of limnetic paleoenvironmental issues for floodplain lake systems with strong hydrodynamic conditions relatively stable sub lakes zones are best for obtaining historical limnetic information the interconnection associated with lake water pigment migration dynamics are as follows 1 pigments first settle smoothly onto lakebed sediment 2 pigments then degrade under the physical and chemical environment of overlying water 3 pigments are eventually transported to the lower reaches of a watershed as per the specific hydrodynamic condition of the lake fig 7 understanding proportional differences among these three processes are key to accurately obtaining the paleolimnological information contained in lake sediment the effect of the factors that promote the degradation of pigments on the components of deposited pigments largely depends on the time it takes for pigments to reach the lakebed which is directly related to the distance between the pigment source and the sediment cuddington and leavitt 1999 buchaca and catalan 2008 this study determined that the degree of sediment pigment preservation information per zone was as follows water channel main lake sub lakes which was largely due to differences in water depth although an increase in water depth will reduce sunlight from reaching the lakebed an increase in settling time will also make pigments degrade more severely in overlying water e g through means of more intensive grazing processes buchaca and catalan 2007 additionally effects of hydrodynamic conditions on pigment deposition have largely been underestimated this is because flow rates in the main lake and the water channel of poyang lake are much higher compared to conventional lake systems due to regional specificity li et al 2014 qi et al 2019 currents drive water pigments which greatly impact the difficultly in their settling onto lakebed sediment moreover a portion of this pigment will be transported to the downstream basin area while that in the main lake will be transported to the water channel and that in the water channel will be eventually transported to the yangtze river it has been reported that the strong interaction between hydro geomorphological and sedimentary processes in the poyang lake water channel has affected local lakebed morphology yuan et al 2021 while the strong secondary suspension caused by hydraulic scouring has become an important factor affecting sediment pigments secondary suspension forces pigments that have already settled onto the lakebed to resuspend and mix with overlying water thus having to go through the settling process again gao et al 2021 2022 this means that few pigments ultimately get buried in sediment thus the accuracy of pigment limnological information in the main lake and water channel is lost 5 conclusions this study showed that sediment pigments in the main lake and the water channel of poyang lake were severely degraded and thus lost their significance as lake proxy indicators combined with phytoplankton community structure in overlying water and the physical and chemical parameters of lake water we found that phytoplankton growth increased the water column pigment levels while leading to co2 depletion and increased ph however high ph suppresses pigments in sediments that have lost their cytoprotective mechanisms additionally hypoxic conditions were conducive to sediment pigment preservation although carotenoids were particularly sensitive to oxygen pheophytin were not and were thus well preserved results from this study indicated that secondary suspension and hydrological transport caused by strong hydrodynamic conditions have a higher limiting effect on pigment preservation compared to other parameters and are therefore the main influencing factors prior to the stable burial of pigments in floodplain lakebed sediment because the sub lakes environment is relatively stable surface sediment pigments can still be used as biomarkers to accurately reflect phytoplankton community structure in overlying water this study was designed to provide additional information to explore material migration characteristics driven by floodplain hydrology and paleoenvironmental
