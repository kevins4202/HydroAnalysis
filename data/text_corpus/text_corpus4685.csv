computational approach elastic fe analysis 1 introduction welding as a normal joining method due to its lots of advantages is commonly employed to assemble steel and its alloy meanwhile welding distortion in particular shrinkages out of plane welding distortion is an essential engineering problem which is inevitably generated and always influence the final fabrication precision when thin plate sections are designed and fabricated not only the conventional welding distortion but also welding induced buckling will be generated welding induced buckling will result in loss of dimensional control and structural integrity and may delay the fabrication schedule and increase the fabrication cost when mitigation is carried out wang et al 2015 during the correction it is difficult to completely reduce the welding induced buckling due to its features of diversity and instability therefore it is better to avoid welding induced buckling generation whenever it is possible due to the limitation of welding experiment computational approach in particular fe analysis was widely employed tsai et al 2006 examined the mechanism of welding induced buckling with an integrated experimental and numerical approach as the bifurcation phenomenon of buckling starts during the cooling cycle and this may continue to grow until the completion of the cooling process thermal elastic plastic fe analysis considering large deformation with abaqus was carried out to represent buckling distortion behavior during the thin plates ship panel fabrication vanli and michaleris 2001 employed transient tep fe analysis to examine the buckling behavior of fillet welded joints with different dimensional size in abaqus in which large deformation theory was considered predicted welding distortion has a good agreement with measurement however the computing process consumes large computer cost and computing time deng and murakawa 2008a also studied the welding induced buckling with large deformation tep fe analysis where butt welded joint by low carbon steel sheet with 1 mm in thickness was selected comparing the simulation results with measurement there is a good agreement between predictive and measured values wang et al 2012 investigated the welding induced buckling in the fabrication of stiffened welded structure with 6 mm thin plate transient tep fe analysis with solid elements model was carried out in which large deformation theory was considered good agreements between measured and computed out of plane distortion are observed in order to decrease the computer consumption and practice in actual application a series of efficient fe analysis with equilibrium welding load such as compressive residual stress inherent deformation was proposed deng and murakawa 2008b developed a welding distortion calculation code which combines tep fe method and large deformation elastic fe method based on inherent deformation theory the inherent deformations of typical welded joints used in a large thin plate structure were evaluated using tep fe analysis then an elastic fe analysis using these inherent deformations was employed to investigate the influence of heat input welding procedure welding sequence plate thickness and spacing between the stiffeners on buckling propensity of examined thin plate welded structure later wang et al 2013a 2014 and ma et al 2016 investigated welding induced buckling with an elastic fe analysis based on the inherent deformation for the stiffened welded structure with thin plates inherent deformation was evaluated from typical welded joint by means of transient tep fe analysis and measurement the buckling behavior not only deformed shape but also magnitude of out of plane welding distortion can be observed from the comparison of computed and measured data although the elastic fe analysis with inherent deformation was already used for scientific research and welding mechanical problem solving for several years these publications almost focus on the prediction accuracy computational efficiency and mechanism clarification of the welding distortion as well as welding induced buckling michaleris and debiccari 1996 evaluated compressive residual stress parallel to welding line so called applied weld load awl by performing local transient tep fe analysis of the welding process first and actual ship panel model using coarse shell elements was made to determine the minimum resistance to buckling so called critical buckling load cbl caused by welding residual stress then they concluded that the compressive residual stress as awl contributes a loading that eventually results in buckling if this stress exceeds the critical buckling load of the welded structure huang et al 2004 2007 focused on the fabrication technology of lightweight structures with thin plates an optical measurement system and advanced computational tools were employed to investigate the generation mechanism of buckling distortion influential process parameter and effective mitigation techniques which should not only reduce the buckling driving force but also increase the buckling resistant although the welding induced buckling was examined with experimental and computational approaches in the above mentioned literature it is still not published that computational framework to completely clarify the prediction and mitigation of welding induced buckling in fabrication of large lightweight welded structure in this study experimental measurement and transient non linear tep fe analysis on typical fillet welded joint were carried out and computed results was employed to evaluate inherent deformation after measurement validation also angular distortions obtained by experiment transient non linear tep fe analysis and elastic fe analysis with inherent deformation of examined fillet welded joint have a good agreement with each other later unit ship panel assembled with previous conducted fillet welding with 6 mm thin plates was examined in which not only welding induced buckling was represented but also critical buckling condition was calculated and intermittent zigzag welding procedure was proposed to decrease the magnitude of in plane inherent deformation for welding buckling mitigation 2 theory and method of computation as summarized before transient non linear tep fe analysis is a classic computational tool for welding mechanics investigation but with a certain limitation in case of large and complex welded structure elastic fe analysis with inherent deformation and interface element is an ideal practical and potential choice in actual application where transient non linear tep fe analysis was still carried out for inherent deformation evaluation beforehand and finite strain was employed to consider the contribution of non linear part to out of plane welding distortion the flow chat of employed tep fe computation and elastic fe analysis with inherent deformation was presented wang et al 2015 and then relevant subjects were introduced as follows 2 1 thermal elastic plastic fe analysis thermal process and mechanical process were always considered in a transient non linear tep fe analysis and the uncoupled formulation between them was employed due to the physical interaction during welding process in detail transient temperature field caused by moving heat source was computed with considering the influence of non linear temperature dependent thermal physical properties then linear thermal expansion behavior is a critical point to consider the contribution of transient temperature field to mechanical response and the obtained transient temperature distribution was applied as a thermal load to predict the distribution and magnitude of residual stresses plastic strains and welding distortion 2 2 inherent deformation and elastic fe analysis generally the total strain during the welding process can be divided into the strain components given by eq 1 namely elastic strain plastic strain thermal strain creep strain and that induced by phase transformation respectively inherent strain which is a summation of plastic strain thermal strain creep strain and that induced by the phase transformation as given by eq 2 is usually considered as all total strain components except the elastic strain thus total strain can be rearranged as a summation of the elastic strain and the inherent strain 1 ε t o t a l ε e l a s t i c ε t h e r m a l ε p l a s t i c ε p h a s e ε c r e e p 2 ε i n h e r e n t ε ε t h e r m a l ε p l a s t i c ε p h a s e ε c r e e p from the transient non linear tep fe analysis and experimental measurement ueda et al 2007 pointed out that welding distortion and residual stress are generated by inherent strain which mostly depends on the type of welded joint material thermal mechanical properties plate thickness and welding heat input when the welded joint is large enough taking account of an assumed welded joint with large enough size as example the inherent strain at each location is determined by the highest temperature reached at this location during the welding process and the constraint supported by the surrounding cold material in the actual application it is much more difficult to apply inherent strain to solid elements model with fine mesh and elastic fe analysis will still require large computer memory and computing time due to the solid elements model concentrating on the welding distortion prediction shell elements model can be employed to decrease the consumption of computer resource and inherent deformation was proposed to replace the distribution of inherent strain on each cross section with one value since the displacement or deformation is the integration of strain inherent deformation which is an integration of the inherent strain as given by eq 3 can be used to predict welding distortion without a significant loss of accuracy moreover the plastic strain is the dominant component of inherent strain when phase transformation and high temperature creep don t occur and examined specimen cools down to room temperature therefore it can be concluded that inherent deformations generally are the results of plastic strains 3 δ x 1 h ε x d y d z θ x 12 h 3 z h 2 ε x d y d z δ y 1 h ε y d y d z θ y 12 h 3 z h 2 ε y d y d z where δ x and δ y are the inherent deformation in longitudinal and transverse directions θ x and θ y are the inherent bending in longitudinal and transverse directions h is the thickness of welded joint and x y z are the welding direction transverse direction and thickness direction respectively based on the definition inherent deformation mostly depends on the joint parameters such as configuration material properties plate thickness and welding heat input comparing with inherent strain the influence of length and width of a welded joint on magnitude of inherent deformation is much smaller when the size of plate is large enough vega et al 2007 moreover the magnitudes of inherent deformation can be approximated as constant values due to the fact that its distributions have an almost uniform feature along the welding line if the end effect is neglected these constant values are then introduced into the elastic shell elements model as loads shrinkage forces displacements and bending moments to predict welding distortion wang et al 2011 for the complex and sequential assembly structure geometrical error such as sliding gaps and misalignments may be generated by welding and the already assembled parts no longer have the designed geometry or dimensions in order to consider the geometrical error generated by previous welding interface element which is a nonlinear spring was proposed and arranged between the parts to be welded for considering its influence on the current welding process murakawa et al 2009 furthermore geometrical error during parts assembly process on final dimensional accuracy of complex welded structure also can be examined 2 3 approach for inherent deformation evaluation based on the definitions as given by eq 3 inherent deformation of butt welded joint with thin plate can be evaluated with integrating plastic strains on each cross section wang et al 2016 where thin plate is fully penetrated with arc heating and plastic strains are the dominant components of inherent strain after welding due to the generation mechanism of inherent deformation there are strong and much weaker self constraints supported by surrounding cold material away from welding line in longitudinal and transverse directions respectively for fillet welded joint wang et al 2017a longitudinal inherent deformation can be converted to tendon force as given by eq 4 to represent the fact that longitudinal shrinkage appears with extreme close to the welding line transverse inherent deformation and inherent bending can be evaluated directly by welding displacement and longitudinal inherent bending is usually neglected because of its much smaller magnitude 4 f t e n d o n e ε x d a e h 1 h ε x d a e h δ x where ε x and δ x are the inherent strain and inherent deformation in longitudinal direction h is the thickness of welded joint wang et al 2013b 2 4 finite strain theory and eigenvalue analysis when a continuum body is subjected to an external force there are two possible mechanical behaviors rigid body motion and shape size deformation the eulerian strain was proposed for infinitesimal strain theory in which the displacement and its gradient are small and the relation between strain and displacement is given by eq 5 correspondingly finite strain theory which is also called large deformation theory was presented to deal with the case in which both rotations and strains are arbitrarily large the non linear relation between strain and displacement is considered in green lagrangian strain as given by eq 6 the higher order term is essential to describe this non linear response 5 e 1 2 x u x u t 1 2 u i j u j i u 1 x 1 1 2 u 1 x 2 u 2 x 1 1 2 u 1 x 3 u 3 x 1 1 2 u 2 x 1 u 1 x 2 u 2 x 2 1 2 u 2 x 3 u 3 x 2 1 2 u 3 x 1 u 1 x 3 1 2 u 3 x 2 u 2

structure thus finite strain theory is employed for representing welding induced buckling and eigenvalue analysis is usually employed to calculate the buckling force of a structure assumed as an ideal linear elastic body for a classical eigenvalue analysis eigenvalues are computed with regarding to the applied compressive force such as tendon force along the welding line and rigid body motion constraints of welded joint each applied configuration has a minimum critical buckling value when the welded joint or structure buckles and a corresponding buckling mode meanwhile eigenvalue analysis can give other possible higher order buckling modes and their associated critical buckling values 3 experiment and tep fea validation in fig 1 a typical fillet welded joint was selected for welding distortion measurement and later tep fe analysis validation these computed results then will be employed to evaluate inherent deformation caused by applied welding condition the examined fillet welded joint was assembled by two components flange with 300 mm 300 mm 6 mm and web with 300 mm 100 mm 6 mm respectively in this experiment the co2 arc welding process was carried out and two welding lines were sequentially performed and welding conditions are shown in table 1 in order to easily and clearly measure the angular distortion after welding the angular distortion of one edge was measured while the other edge was moved back to the original position from the geometry profile of examined fillet welded joint fe analysis model was created with normal brick solid elements with 8 nodes as shown in fig 2 fig 2 also shows sequence of welding passes and welding direction which is parallel to the positive direction of x axis and rigid body motion as boundary condition for mechanical analysis was employed temperature dependent material thermal mechanical properties of sm490 as shown in fig 3 were used for the transient non linear thermal elastic plastic fe analysis of fillet welding meanwhile a body heat source with uniform power density caused by welding arc was employed for transient non linear tep fe computation where this power density can be calculated with net heat input divided by the cross section area of molten pool taking account to the experimental procedure two welding lines were performed sequentially with the numerical simulation fig 2 also shows the initial undeformed shape and the deformed shape after welding of examined fillet welded joint and the locations of measured points are also indicated in fig 2 with comparison between the measured data and computed result magnitudes of welding angular distortion at the measured points have a good agreement with each other as shown in fig 4 welding angular distortion is generated due to the temperature gradient through the thickness of flange plate by welding heat input moreover the above transient non linear tep fe analysis also computed the plastic strain which will be employed for inherent deformation evaluation later 4 investigation of welding buckling with elastic fe analysis with the computed results of transient non linear tep fe analysis which was validated by measured welding distortion inherent deformation to represent the mechanical characteristic of welding line should be evaluated beforehand then an elastic fe analysis with previous evaluated inherent deformation as input parameter was carried out to investigate the buckling behavior during the fabrication of lightweight ship panel also critical condition such as critical inherent deformation when welding induced buckling occurs was calculated to guide and optimize the welding procedure 4 1 evaluation of inherent deformation based on the definition of inherent deformation inherent strain mostly plastic strain integration was employed to evaluate its magnitude inherent strains can be obtained from computed results of previous transient non linear tep fe analysis which was already validated with experiments fillet welding is usually used to assemble stiffener to plates and fillet welded joints are typical in ship structure during the evaluation of inherent deformation of fillet welded joint due to the fact that longitudinal inherent shrinkage is converted to tendon force because of un uniform shrinkage and strong self constraint in longitudinal direction tendon force was evaluated based on the previous computed plastic strains during the sequential experimental welding on each cross section of examined fillet welded joint tendon force can be integrated as shown in fig 5 it also can be seen that almost uniform distribution in the middle region then the magnitudes of tendon force by means of proposed integration approach after first and second welding line were evaluated as 215 877 kn and 259 055 kn respectively when the end effect was neglected furthermore due to the weak self constraint in transverse direction the transverse inherent shrinkage and inherent bending can be evaluated using the computed displacement directly without precision loss fig 6 gives the distribution of transverse shrinkage on each cross section in the case of examined sequential welding and angular distortion along welding line direction is also showed in fig 6 ignoring the end effect the constant magnitude of inherent transverse shrinkage and inherent bending are 0 54829 mm and 0 018 rad respectively in particular web part will support large stiffness for fillet welded joint and then longitudinal bending will be too small to be considered in the elastic fe analysis 4 2 validation of elastic fe analysis in order to validate the accuracy of evaluated inherent deformation an elastic fe analysis in which inherent deformation as input for above examined fillet welded joint was carried out fig 7 shows the shell elements model of experimental welded joint and the distribution of computed welding angular distortion was obtained as shown in fig 8 considering the measured points as shown in fig 2 it may be seen that the angular distortions predicted by means of elastic fe analysis were compared to the measured results with good agreement as show in fig 9 meanwhile a little bit large differences between computed results of elastic fe analysis and measurements in the welding start stage also end stage can be understood as that the welding arc in start region is not stable and heated temperature is increasing to the molten temperature however the inherent deformation used in elastic fe analysis was obtained in the middle region and end effect is ignored therefore it is a little bit weaker for computational accuracy of elastic fe analysis near the regions to start or end of welding arc 4 3 buckling prediction of stiffened thin plate sections with the above validation of elastic fe analysis the prediction of welding distortion in fabrication of lightweight ship panel can be carried out as an actual application of elastic fe analysis in detail a unit ship panel with 6 mm thickness plates was selected as studied objective which is assembled by a skin plate with 13 120 mm in length and 3 205 mm in width 3 longitudinal stiffeners with 100 mm in height as a l section angle bar and 4 transverse stiffeners with 394 mm in height as a t section fillet bar the shell elements model of considered unit ship panel was depicted in fig 10 in which different parts to be fitted and then welded together are indicated by different color between the adjacent parts previous evaluated inherent deformation will be applied to represent the mechanical features of welding line as shown in fig 10 boundary condition was employed to fix the rigid body motion line 1 and line 2 were also selected to closely investigate the out of plane welding distortion applying inherent deformation and large deformation theory elastic fe analysis of the shell elements model was carried out and out of plane welding distortion was predicted in particular the possible buckling behavior generated by in plane welding shrinkage was observed in fabrication of examined unit ship panel significant features of buckling from not only the magnitude but also the deformed mode of out of plane welding distortion can be observed as shown in fig 11 also it may be concluded that the inherent deformations generated by current welding procedure can make the examined ship panel buckle in fig 12 the computed out of plane welding distortions of points on line 1 and line 2 were demonstrated and it may be seen that welding induced buckling with half wave deformed mode occurs since out of plane welding distortion is produced by three causes welding bending moment in plane inherent shrinkage and bending moment due to shrinkage force when the welding induced buckling occurs buckling deformation will be the dominant component to contribute the out of plane welding distortion and in plane inherent shrinkage will be the dominant cause of out of plane welding distortion meanwhile other components of inherent deformation as well as initial deflection are together considered as the disturbance to trigger the welding induced buckling they will not determine the buckling mode but influence the magnitude of out of plane welding distortion and the relatively large bending deformation produced by welding bending moment may obscure the phenomenon of welding induced buckling 4 4 calculation of critical buckling condition although buckling behavior is represented and distribution of welding induced buckling was predicted by means of elastic fe analysis with inherent deformation and large deformation theory it is much more desirable to know the critical buckling condition for mitigation of welding induced buckling wang et al 2017b still using the above created shell elements model as shown in fig 10 eigenvalue analysis was employed to calculate the critical value of inherent deformation as shown in fig 13 the lowest buckling mode of considered unit ship panel and associated critical values of inherent deformation were obtained from the theory of eigenvalue analysis the buckling behavior will occur when eigenvalue is less than 1 0 taking account of the lowest buckling mode as example the associated eigenvalue is 0 58165 and the critical values of inherent deformation can be calculated in eq 7 when the critical welding buckling condition is given lots of practical techniques can be performed to make sure that the applied load is less than critical welding buckling condition for welding induced buckling prevention 7 f c r i t i c a l 1 s t e i

prevention can be achieved by advanced welding procedure to generate less magnitudes of inherent deformation in actual case due to the practicability and flexibility intermittent zigzag welding procedure is often employed to replace the parallel continuous welding procedure for reducing welding buckling distortion in fabrication of unit ship panel tajiama et al 2007 fig 14 illustrates the image of proposed procedure to accomplish the fillet welding in which the used welding conditions are the same to the experiment case as listed in table 1 with non linear transient tep fe analysis the computed angular distortion and welding plastic strains of fillet welded joint with intermittent zigzag welding procedure were obtained distribution and magnitude of longitudinal plastic strain as shown in fig 15 will be employed to evaluate tendon force and comparisons of computed longitudinal and transverse plastic strains generated by sequential and zigzag welding procedures on the middle cross section were also obtained as shown in fig 16 other components of inherent deformation also can be evaluated as summarized in table 2 from the comparison in plane welding inherent deformation with intermittent zigzag welding procedure are both less than the calculated critical values of inherent deformations in advance and then it can be concluded that the intermittent zigzag welding procedure in the examined case can effectively decrease the magnitude of inherent deformation and avoid the occurrence of welding induced buckling in order to closely examine the out of plane welding distortion elastic fe analysis with inherent deformation generated by intermittent zigzag welding procedure was carried out again to predict out of plane welding distortion of examined unit ship panel the mitigation effort with intermittent zigzag welding procedure to reduce out of plane welding distortion is illustrated in fig 17 in which not only the magnitude but also deformed mode was significantly changed out of plane welding distortions of points on line 1 and line 2 as shown in fig 10 were also plotted and compared with data summarized in fig 12 in fig 18 it is obviously indicated that intermittent zigzag welding procedure can produce negligible out of plane welding distortion in the middle region of examined unit ship panel and acceptable out of plane welding distortion in the edge region due to that edge region is usually corrected after welding to be assembled with other components or blocks in actual fabrication with intermittent zigzag welding procedure the welding induced buckling can be avoided due to less in plane inherent deformation however the out of plane welding distortion may not be prevented because of contribution of bending moment due to shrinkage force 6 conclusions from the investigation presented above framework of computation with inherent deformation on welding buckling during thin plate section assembly was introduced and clarified also the following conclusions can be summarized 1 transient non linear tep fe analysis of conducted fillet welded joint has a good computed angular distortion by comparing with measured data 2 welding inherent deformation of fillet welded joint can be separately evaluated based on transient non linear tep fe analysis which was validated with experimental results 3 elastic fe analysis with shell elements model and inherent deformation was validated in case of fillet welded joint and then was applied to investigate out of plane welding distortion during fabrication of lightweight ship panel 4 elastic fe analysis was carried out to represent buckling behavior in fabrication of unit ship panel and eigenvalue analysis was employed to calculate critical values of inherent deformation when welding induced buckling occurs 5 by comparing with critical welding buckling conditions intermittent zigzag welding procedure can generate less in plane inherent deformation and avoid the generation of welding induced buckling but not out of plane welding distortion acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by the

deformation in longitudinal direction h is the thickness of welded joint wang et al 2013b 2 4 finite strain theory and eigenvalue analysis when a continuum body is subjected to an external force there are two possible mechanical behaviors rigid body motion and shape size deformation the eulerian strain was proposed for infinitesimal strain theory in which the displacement and its gradient are small and the relation between strain and displacement is given by eq 5 correspondingly finite strain theory which is also called large deformation theory was presented to deal with the case in which both rotations and strains are arbitrarily large the non linear relation between strain and displacement is considered in green lagrangian strain as given by eq 6 the higher order term is essential to describe this non linear response 5 e 1 2 x u x u t 1 2 u i j u j i u 1 x 1 1 2 u 1 x 2 u 2 x 1 1 2 u 1 x 3 u 3 x 1 1 2 u 2 x 1 u 1 x 2 u 2 x 2 1 2 u 2 x 3 u 3 x 2 1 2 u 3 x 1 u 1 x 3 1 2 u 3 x 2 u 2

structure thus finite strain theory is employed for representing welding induced buckling and eigenvalue analysis is usually employed to calculate the buckling force of a structure assumed as an ideal linear elastic body for a classical eigenvalue analysis eigenvalues are computed with regarding to the applied compressive force such as tendon force along the welding line and rigid body motion constraints of welded joint each applied configuration has a minimum critical buckling value when the welded joint or structure buckles and a corresponding buckling mode meanwhile eigenvalue analysis can give other possible higher order buckling modes and their associated critical buckling values 3 experiment and tep fea validation in fig 1 a typical fillet welded joint was selected for welding distortion measurement and later tep fe analysis validation these computed results then will be employed to evaluate inherent deformation caused by applied welding condition the examined fillet welded joint was assembled by two components flange with 300 mm 300 mm 6 mm and web with 300 mm 100 mm 6 mm respectively in this experiment the co2 arc welding process was carried out and two welding lines were sequentially performed and welding conditions are shown in table 1 in order to easily and clearly measure the angular distortion after welding the angular distortion of one edge was measured while the other edge was moved back to the original position from the geometry profile of examined fillet welded joint fe analysis model was created with normal brick solid elements with 8 nodes as shown in fig 2 fig 2 also shows sequence of welding passes and welding direction which is parallel to the positive direction of x axis and rigid body motion as boundary condition for mechanical analysis was employed temperature dependent material thermal mechanical properties of sm490 as shown in fig 3 were used for the transient non linear thermal elastic plastic fe analysis of fillet welding meanwhile a body heat source with uniform power density caused by welding arc was employed for transient non linear tep fe computation where this power density can be calculated with net heat input divided by the cross section area of molten pool taking account to the experimental procedure two welding lines were performed sequentially with the numerical simulation fig 2 also shows the initial undeformed shape and the deformed shape after welding of examined fillet welded joint and the locations of measured points are also indicated in fig 2 with comparison between the measured data and computed result magnitudes of welding angular distortion at the measured points have a good agreement with each other as shown in fig 4 welding angular distortion is generated due to the temperature gradient through the thickness of flange plate by welding heat input moreover the above transient non linear tep fe analysis also computed the plastic strain which will be employed for inherent deformation evaluation later 4 investigation of welding buckling with elastic fe analysis with the computed results of transient non linear tep fe analysis which was validated by measured welding distortion inherent deformation to represent the mechanical characteristic of welding line should be evaluated beforehand then an elastic fe analysis with previous evaluated inherent deformation as input parameter was carried out to investigate the buckling behavior during the fabrication of lightweight ship panel also critical condition such as critical inherent deformation when welding induced buckling occurs was calculated to guide and optimize the welding procedure 4 1 evaluation of inherent deformation based on the definition of inherent deformation inherent strain mostly plastic strain integration was employed to evaluate its magnitude inherent strains can be obtained from computed results of previous transient non linear tep fe analysis which was already validated with experiments fillet welding is usually used to assemble stiffener to plates and fillet welded joints are typical in ship structure during the evaluation of inherent deformation of fillet welded joint due to the fact that longitudinal inherent shrinkage is converted to tendon force because of un uniform shrinkage and strong self constraint in longitudinal direction tendon force was evaluated based on the previous computed plastic strains during the sequential experimental welding on each cross section of examined fillet welded joint tendon force can be integrated as shown in fig 5 it also can be seen that almost uniform distribution in the middle region then the magnitudes of tendon force by means of proposed integration approach after first and second welding line were evaluated as 215 877 kn and 259 055 kn respectively when the end effect was neglected furthermore due to the weak self constraint in transverse direction the transverse inherent shrinkage and inherent bending can be evaluated using the computed displacement directly without precision loss fig 6 gives the distribution of transverse shrinkage on each cross section in the case of examined sequential welding and angular distortion along welding line direction is also showed in fig 6 ignoring the end effect the constant magnitude of inherent transverse shrinkage and inherent bending are 0 54829 mm and 0 018 rad respectively in particular web part will support large stiffness for fillet welded joint and then longitudinal bending will be too small to be considered in the elastic fe analysis 4 2 validation of elastic fe analysis in order to validate the accuracy of evaluated inherent deformation an elastic fe analysis in which inherent deformation as input for above examined fillet welded joint was carried out fig 7 shows the shell elements model of experimental welded joint and the distribution of computed welding angular distortion was obtained as shown in fig 8 considering the measured points as shown in fig 2 it may be seen that the angular distortions predicted by means of elastic fe analysis were compared to the measured results with good agreement as show in fig 9 meanwhile a little bit large differences between computed results of elastic fe analysis and measurements in the welding start stage also end stage can be understood as that the welding arc in start region is not stable and heated temperature is increasing to the molten temperature however the inherent deformation used in elastic fe analysis was obtained in the middle region and end effect is ignored therefore it is a little bit weaker for computational accuracy of elastic fe analysis near the regions to start or end of welding arc 4 3 buckling prediction of stiffened thin plate sections with the above validation of elastic fe analysis the prediction of welding distortion in fabrication of lightweight ship panel can be carried out as an actual application of elastic fe analysis in detail a unit ship panel with 6 mm thickness plates was selected as studied objective which is assembled by a skin plate with 13 120 mm in length and 3 205 mm in width 3 longitudinal stiffeners with 100 mm in height as a l section angle bar and 4 transverse stiffeners with 394 mm in height as a t section fillet bar the shell elements model of considered unit ship panel was depicted in fig 10 in which different parts to be fitted and then welded together are indicated by different color between the adjacent parts previous evaluated inherent deformation will be applied to represent the mechanical features of welding line as shown in fig 10 boundary condition was employed to fix the rigid body motion line 1 and line 2 were also selected to closely investigate the out of plane welding distortion applying inherent deformation and large deformation theory elastic fe analysis of the shell elements model was carried out and out of plane welding distortion was predicted in particular the possible buckling behavior generated by in plane welding shrinkage was observed in fabrication of examined unit ship panel significant features of buckling from not only the magnitude but also the deformed mode of out of plane welding distortion can be observed as shown in fig 11 also it may be concluded that the inherent deformations generated by current welding procedure can make the examined ship panel buckle in fig 12 the computed out of plane welding distortions of points on line 1 and line 2 were demonstrated and it may be seen that welding induced buckling with half wave deformed mode occurs since out of plane welding distortion is produced by three causes welding bending moment in plane inherent shrinkage and bending moment due to shrinkage force when the welding induced buckling occurs buckling deformation will be the dominant component to contribute the out of plane welding distortion and in plane inherent shrinkage will be the dominant cause of out of plane welding distortion meanwhile other components of inherent deformation as well as initial deflection are together considered as the disturbance to trigger the welding induced buckling they will not determine the buckling mode but influence the magnitude of out of plane welding distortion and the relatively large bending deformation produced by welding bending moment may obscure the phenomenon of welding induced buckling 4 4 calculation of critical buckling condition although buckling behavior is represented and distribution of welding induced buckling was predicted by means of elastic fe analysis with inherent deformation and large deformation theory it is much more desirable to know the critical buckling condition for mitigation of welding induced buckling wang et al 2017b still using the above created shell elements model as shown in fig 10 eigenvalue analysis was employed to calculate the critical value of inherent deformation as shown in fig 13 the lowest buckling mode of considered unit ship panel and associated critical values of inherent deformation were obtained from the theory of eigenvalue analysis the buckling behavior will occur when eigenvalue is less than 1 0 taking account of the lowest buckling mode as example the associated eigenvalue is 0 58165 and the critical values of inherent deformation can be calculated in eq 7 when the critical welding buckling condition is given lots of practical techniques can be performed to make sure that the applied load is less than critical welding buckling condition for welding induced buckling prevention 7 f c r i t i c a l 1 s t e i g e n v a l u e 1 s t f a p p l i e d 0 58165 259 055 150 6793 k n 0 58165 0 54829 0 3189 m m 5 technique for welding buckling prevention as mentioned in previous section the welding induced buckling prevention can be achieved by advanced welding procedure to generate less magnitudes of inherent deformation in actual case due to the practicability and flexibility intermittent zigzag welding procedure is often employed to replace the parallel continuous welding procedure for reducing welding buckling distortion in fabrication of unit ship panel tajiama et al 2007 fig 14 illustrates the image of proposed procedure to accomplish the fillet welding in which the used welding conditions are the same to the experiment case as listed in table 1 with non linear transient tep fe analysis the computed angular distortion and welding plastic strains of fillet welded joint with intermittent zigzag welding procedure were obtained distribution and magnitude of longitudinal plastic strain as shown in fig 15 will be employed to evaluate tendon force and comparisons of computed longitudinal and transverse plastic strains generated by sequential and zigzag welding procedures on the middle cross section were also obtained as shown in fig 16 other components of inherent deformation also can be evaluated as summarized in table 2 from the comparison in plane welding inherent deformation with intermittent zigzag welding procedure are both less than the calculated critical values of inherent deformations in advance and then it can be concluded that the intermittent zigzag welding procedure in the examined case can effectively decrease the magnitude of inherent deformation and avoid the occurrence of welding induced buckling in order to closely examine the out of plane welding distortion elastic fe analysis with inherent deformation generated by intermittent zigzag welding procedure was carried out again to predict out of plane welding distortion of examined unit ship panel the mitigation effort with intermittent zigzag welding procedure to reduce out of plane welding distortion is illustrated in fig 17 in which not only the magnitude but also deformed mode was significantly changed out of plane welding distortions of points on line 1 and line 2 as shown in fig 10 were also plotted and compared with data summarized in fig 12 in fig 18 it is obviously indicated that intermittent zigzag welding procedure can produce negligible out of plane welding distortion in the middle region of examined unit ship panel and acceptable out of plane welding distortion in the edge region due to that edge region is usually corrected after welding to be assembled with other components or blocks in actual fabrication with intermittent zigzag welding procedure the welding induced buckling can be avoided due to less in plane inherent deformation however the out of plane welding distortion may not be prevented because of contribution of bending moment due to shrinkage force 6 conclusions from the investigation presented above framework of computation with inherent deformation on welding buckling during thin plate section assembly was introduced and clarified also the following conclusions can be summarized 1 transient non linear tep fe analysis of conducted fillet welded joint has a good computed angular distortion by comparing with measured data 2 welding inherent deformation of fillet welded joint can be separately evaluated based on transient non linear tep fe analysis which was validated with experimental results 3 elastic fe analysis with shell elements model and inherent deformation was validated in case of fillet welded joint and then was applied to investigate out of plane welding distortion during fabrication of lightweight ship panel 4 elastic fe analysis was carried out to represent buckling behavior in fabrication of unit ship panel and eigenvalue analysis was employed to calculate critical values of inherent deformation when welding induced buckling occurs 5 by comparing with critical welding buckling conditions intermittent zigzag welding procedure can generate less in plane inherent deformation and avoid the generation of welding induced buckling but not out of plane welding distortion acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by the

23426,an investigation into the dynamic behavior of the piston pump is an important method to reduce its vibration and noise in this paper an approach to predict the dynamics of a seawater hydraulic piston pump swhpp from output only transmissibility measurements is introduced in order to eliminate the harmonic interference generated by spindle rotation the excitation in this method is the pressure which caused by the swhpp operating at a constant speed and under different loading conditions the first four modes of the swhpp were estimated utilizing the method proposed in this paper and the influence of the pressure on the dynamics of the swhpp structure was further studied the experimental results indicated that peak occurred around the frequency of 20 hz and the reason is that the estimated second order natural frequency 19 8 hz is near to the frequency of 20 hz which is the excitation frequency of the swash plate and the flat valve of the swhpp in addition this method can identify modal parameters of the piston pump structure in the working state so it can effectively predict the dynamic behaviors of the piston pump keywords transmissibility natural frequency damping ratio pressure seawater hydraulic piston pump 1 introduction owing to high working pressure and high volumetric efficiency the piston pump is widely used to adjust buoyancy in submarines and autonomous underwater vehicles auvs however the vibration and noise generated by the piston pump will not only interfere with the concealment of the submarine and auvs but also be one of the main factors that cause the mechanical failure which has great influence on the personal and property safety with the advancement of submarines and auvs the vibration and noise control of piston pump must be investigated xu et al 2016 the research on piston pump vibration and noise control has gotten more attention in recent years pettersson et al 1991 described the mechanism of vibration and noise generation in piston pumps and the vibration of piston pump can be divided into the fluid vibration and the mechanical vibration quan et al 2016 palmen 2004 found that the vibration and noise of piston pump could be reduced by optimizing the pump housing wu et al 2017 discovered that the port valves materials have an effect on the noise of water hydraulic pump through experimental and theory simulation methods however other scholars have proven that the fluid born noise generated in the pump also contributes significantly to its dynamic pettersson et al 1991 ericson 2005 but fluid vibration and mechanical vibration coexist within the actual working process of the piston pump xu et al 2015 in general in order to reveal the dynamic behaviors of the piston pump effectively it needs to extract the vibration modes such as natural frequencies damping coefficients and mode shapes from measured data at pump operation therefore it is of great significance to analyze the dynamic behavior of the piston pump structure under the working conditions in the last few decades modal analysis has become a key technology in structural dynamics analysis maia and silva 1997 peeters et al 2004 there are three methods to identify the dynamic parameters of the piston pump the first method is computational modal analysis palmen 2004 used computational modal analysis to estimate the dynamic behavior of the piston pump shell due to the complex structure of the piston pump this method can not accurately predict the dynamic parameters of the piston pump the second method is experimental modal analysis ema and ema usually measures input forces and output responses using artificial excitation menon and zhao 2005 xu et al 2016 used ema method to optimize the piston pump housing and the experiment results indicated that the vibration and noise of the optimized piston pump were reduced significantly minette et al 2016 estimated the modal parameters of an electrical submersible pump using the ema technique and results showed that the identified natural frequencies were within the operational frequency range however the ema can only be applied in the stationary state of the pump therefore this is the disadvantage of using ema to identify the modal parameters of piston pump but the modal parameters identified in the stationary state might be different with those measured in the actual operating condition wang et al 2012 found that the torsional natural frequency of pump system shifts with changed with the load condition therefore the modal parameters of the piston pump in the working state should be considered the third method is operational modal analysis oma and oma has been developed to predict the modal parameters from the structure under its operational conditions lardies and larbi 2001a 2001b parloo et al 2002 cauberghe et al 2003 thus the aforementioned disadvantage exists in ema but it will not appear in oma however the classical oma method can be applied under the assumption that the input forces are white noise this requirement is not met for the piston pump because the piston pump structures contain rotating parts e g crankshaft swash plate and bearing and the harmonic interferences will be present in the response during the working process of the piston pump the classical oma techniques may encounter difficulties to correctly identify the modal parameters of the piston pump mohanty and rixen 2004 carden and lindblad 2015 demonstrated the use of oma to identify torsional modes on a water pump however it needs to measure the speed of shafts in the method this will increase the settings and the cost of the experiment in order to effectively identify the modal parameters of piston pump under operating condition a recently developed modal analysis technique will be studied transmissibility based operational modal analysis toma devriendt 2010 the advantage of the toma technique is that it does not rely on the presupposition that the input excitations must be white noise signals devriendt et al 2009 so this method can be used in the applications that the input signals contain harmonic excitation components devriendt and guillaume 2007 used the toma technique to estimate modal parameters of a beam which the excitation acting on the beam is a multi sine excitation since the conditions of a laboratory forced vibration test are always significantly different from the actual working conditions there are few literature to estimate the dynamic parameters of the piston pump using this method therefore the dynamic behaviors of the piston pump under operating conditions need further study in this paper a transmissibility based method to predict the modal parameters of piston pump under pressure excitation was developed and experiments were carried out for identifying the dynamic behavior of a swhpp besides the influence of the pressure on the dynamics of the piston pump was studied 2 excitation force of the swhpp this section detailed the working principle of experimental system and the excitation source and its corresponding excitation frequency of the swhpp were analyzed 2 1 the working principle of experimental system fig 1 details the working principle of experimental system the swhpp 5 is driven by variable frequency motor 6 to realize the process of absorbing and draining water the discharge pressure of the swhpp 5 is adjusted with the hole size of throttle valve 10 in this experiment the discharge pressure can be measured by pressure gauge 9 the speed of variable frequency motor 6 can be to maintain constant by adjusting the frequency of the variable frequency power source 7 all tests in the current paper are carried out on a swhpp the configurations of the swhpp as shown in fig 2 the swhpp is made up of end cover oriented ring pump casing cylinder block outlet port valve port inlet port base plate crankshaft bearing swash plate piston and flat valve the pump with this structure has the characteristics of high pressure large flow and low noise luo et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a 2016b the main parameters of the pump in this paper are listed in table 1 2 2 excitation of the swhpp the swhpp is an axial piston pump and the excitation source and its corresponding excitation frequency of the axial piston pump are shown in table 2 ye et al 2017 a conclusion can be obtained from table 2 excitations appear in cycles the frequency of the excitation is related to the rotational speed of the swhpp and the frequency of excitation is an invariant when the speed of the swhpp maintains a constant that is only the amplitude of the excitation varies and the frequency of excitation remains the same when the discharge pressure of the swhpp changes and the speed remains constant according to pascal s principle blanco and oro 2012 the pressure is transmitted in a closed static fluid without attenuation therefore the instantaneous pressure distributed in the pump outlet can be considered equivalency and uniformity in order to effectively eliminate harmonic interference which generated by the spindle rotation of the swhpp the pressure is used as the excitation of the proposed method which generated by the swhpp operating at a constant speed and under different loading conditions 3 theoretical background 3 1 modal model of the swhpp the dynamic equation of the swhpp can be described in the form 1 m x c x k x f where m c and k are the mass the damping and the stiffness matrices of the swhpp respectively x x and x are column vectors that represent the acceleration velocity and displacement respectively f represent the excitations which include mechanical excitation and hydrodynamic excitation xu et al 2015 the fourier transform of eq 1 is 2 x w h w f w the frequency response function can be calculated by eq 2 3 h w x w f w with 4 h w r 1 n φ r l r t j w λ r φ r l r h j w λ r the solution of eq 4 is 5 λ r ζ r w r i 1 ζ r 2 w r 6 f r w r 2 π where f r is natural frequency ζ r is damping ratio φ r represents the modal shape vector and l r represents the modal participation vector h w is the frequency response function from the discussion above the modal parameters can be estimated from the frequency response function h w when measured the excitation force f w and the vibration responses x w simultaneously however due to the complexity of the hydraulic system the excitation forces of the swhpp are difficult to measure 3 2 the basic theory of toma algorithm the transmissibility function t ij w was defined by ewins 1984 as follows 7 t i j w x i w x j w where x i w x j w denote the responses of the point i and point j under the pressure a respectively when the input force f w is a single force by combining eq 2 and eq 7 the transmissibility function t ij w can be expressed as the following form 8 t i j w x i w x j w h i w f w h j w f w h i w h j w obviously in this case the transmissibility is independent of the properties and amplitude of the force but only depends on the location of the force by combining eq 4 when jw is close to the system s poles the limit value of the transmissibility eq 8 9 lim j w λ r t i j w lim j w λ r h i w h j w φ i r φ j r this means that the transmissibility function t ij w depends neither on the locations nor on the amplitudes of the input force at the system poles however as discussed in section 2 2 there is not only one source of excitation for the swhpp and the excitation frequency of excitation source is related to the rotation speed of the pump this means the excitations of the pump are caused by the rotation of the spindle xu et al 2016 the input forces f k k 1 n are fully correlated devriendt et al 2009 that is 10 f k c k p w eq 7 can be written as follows 11 t i j w k 1 n h i k w c k p w m 1 n h j m w c m p w p w k 1 n h i k w c k p w m 1 n h j m w c m k 1 n h i k w c k m 1 n h j m w c m where c k and c m are constant related to the location and amplitude of the input forces f k and p w is the relevant portion of the input forces f k this shows that in this case transmissibility function t ij w is irrelevant to the properties of the input forces and it depends only on the amplitudes and the locations of the unknown input forces f k by making use of eq 4 when the limit value jw of the transmissibility function t ij w approaches the system s poles λ r the limit value of eq 11 is 12 lim j w λ r t i j w lim j w λ r k 1 n h i k w c k lim j w λ r m 1 n h j m w c m k 1 n φ i r l r c k m 1 n φ j r l r c m φ i r k 1 n c k φ j r m 1 n c m a φ i r φ j r and 13 a k 1 n c k m 1 n c m where c k is a constant when the swhpp works at the same pressure and speed a is a constant the transmissibility function has no relation with the locations and the amplitudes of the input forces f k when the measuring points i j are invariant the subtraction of two transmissibility functions which measured at different pressure conditions a b is 14 δ t i j w t i j a w t i j b w when the limit value jw of the transmissibility function t ij w approaches the system s poles λ r eq 14 satisfies 15 lim j w λ r δ t i j w lim j w λ r t i j a w t i j b w 0 this indicates that the poles of the system λ r are the zeroes of the rational function δ t i j w and its inverse δ 1 t i j w is 16 δ 1 t i j w 1 t i j a w t i j b w this result shows that the poles of the system equal to the poles of rational function δ 1 t i j w then the modal parameters of the swhpp could be estimated from the rational functions δ 1 t i j w utilizing the operational modal analysis 4 modal analysis of the swhpp in this section the modal parameters of the swhpp were identified by the toma method and ema was conducted to validate the toma 4 1 experimental setup 4 1 1 toma of the swhpp the speed of the motor is 750 r min in toma experiment and the reduction ratio of the gear box is 5 1 so the speed of the pump is 150 r min the rated discharge pressure of the swhpp is 3 mpa as the discussion in section 3 2 the rational function needs to be measured at two different pressure conditions so 0 and 3 mpa were selected as the test conditions fig 3 showed the toma experimental system of the swhpp the schematic drawing of the toma experimental system was showed in fig 4 1 in order to obtain the modal model of the swhpp 12 test points were selected the points of the circle shown in fig 4b experiments have been carried out for measuring the dynamic characteristics of the swhpp in the z direction 12 test points are evenly distributed in the swhpp outlet and the swhpp outlet is a nickel brass ring with an internal diameter of 0 25 m 2 to measure the vibrations in the z directions six accelerometers type 4514 b 001 brüel kjær were attached to the test points due to the number of accelerometers was fewer than that of test points one accelerometer was mounted at a fixed test point as reference and the remaining five accelerometers were switched three times to monitor the vibration generally peak deflection points or non nodal are selected as the reference point batel 2002 as shown in fig 4b the reference point was the point at the swhpp outlet in this experiment 3 all accelerometers were connected to the same acquisition system lan xi type 3050 b 060 6ch brüel kjær and the data analysis was conducted in pulse labshop 14 1 brüel kjær and matlab software because the speed of the pump shaft was 150 r min so its rotational frequency f 150 60 2 5 hz the frequency band of interest was set from 0 hz up to 100 hz the sampling rate of the system was 256 hz and sampling time was 64 s 4 to keep the speed of the pump constant in the whole processing the motor speed was adjusted by the frequency of the variable frequency power source 4 1 2 ema of the swhpp in this section the modal parameters of the swhpp were predicted from the experimental modal analysis module in the pulse software brüel kjær 1 the accelerometers and test points were the same with those in the toma experiment as described in section 4 1 1 2 as shown in fig 5 the hammer excitations were performed in the z direction at the excitation point by a powerful hammer type hdfc dfc 1 4 2 results and discussions the stability diagram of the toma of the swhpp is presented in fig 6 the green curve denotes the rational function the frequencies are presented on the abscissa axis the amplitudes are displayed on the left ordinate axis and the model orders are displayed on the right ordinate axis the symbol o represents the pole is not stable the symbol v represents the pole vector does not change within the tolerance the symbol s represents frequency damping and pole vector are all stable within the tolerances as can be seen from the diagram there are four modes between 0 hz and 100 hz table 3 is the modal parameters of the swhpp identified by toma and ema experiments for the first three modes the natural frequencies estimated by toma are quite similar to those obtained from ema for the fourth mode the natural frequency identified by ema is bigger than that of the toma by 5 6 hz however the damping ratios of all modes estimated by toma are smaller than those obtained from ema these differences are the result of many factors such as the ema is conducted in the static state and the toma is carried out in the working state when the damping ratios measured in working condition of the swhpp there is the fluid structure coupling effect in the pump the change of the friction between the combined surfaces and the boundary condition li et al 2013 these reasons led to the damping ratios identified by toma were smaller than the parameters identified by ema the mode shapes of the swhpp are presented in fig 7 the dotted line in the picture indicates the stationary state of the structure and the solid line represents the directions of the modal vibrations from the figure it can be seen that the vibration of the first two modes is the most obvious especially in the second mode however there are no obvious vibrations of the swhpp for the last two modes 5 the influence of the pressure on the dynamics of the swhpp structure in this section in order to investigate the influence of the pressure on the dynamics of the swhpp structure an experiment was established as shown in fig 8 the sampling time is 64 s the analysis frequency range is 0 hz 100 hz and the sampling rate is 256 hz 1 the accelerometer reference 4514 b 001 brüel kjær which mounts on the swhpp outlet to measure the vibration in z direction 2 the accelerometer is connected to the acquisition system lan xi type 3050 b 060 6ch brüel kjær and the data analysis is conducted in pulse labshop 14 1 3 to keep the speed constant the motor speed is measured by a tachometer reference dm6234p victor and the speed of the motor is set to a constant of 750 r min the experimental results are shown in figs 9 11 as shown in fig 9 four discharge pressures were tried as well about 0 1 2 and 3 mpa the blue curve in fig 10 shows the amplitudes of the auto power spectra of the outlet vibration during the swhpp working at different pressure from these results we can get the conclusion that the amplitude of the vibrations increases as the pressure increases due to the interference of the rotation frequency of the swhpp harmonics appear in the fundamental frequency and its frequency multiplication in the power spectrum curve it is validated as the discussion of table 2 the excitation frequency of the swash plate and the flat valve of the swhpp is 20 hz so the amplitude peaks occur around the fundamental frequency 20 hz and its frequency multiplication 40 hz 60 hz 80 hz and 100 hz the amplitudes of the harmonics which are excited under the high pressure are larger than those excited under the low pressure because the speed of the swhpp keeps a constant in the whole processing the harmonics amplitudes increase proportionally to the discharge pressure with no change of harmonics frequency this is also verified after five harmonics are selected and the amplitudes of them are compared as shown in fig 11 the red curves in fig 10 represent the lower envelope of amplitude spectrum of the vibration at 0 1 2 and 3 mpa respectively by comparing these curves we can obtain a conclusion the amplitude of the curves fluctuated greatly with the pressure increases peak appeared at 20 hz when the working pressure is 0 mpa when the working pressure of the swhpp is 1 2 and 3 mpa the peaks occurred around 20 hz and 40 hz this is because of the modes are excited with the high pressure as discussed in section 4 2 19 8 hz and 39 1 hz was the natural frequency estimated by toma technique it caused peaks to occur around these natural frequencies correspond to fig 7 the excitation frequency of the swash plate and the flat valve of the swhpp 20 hz is around 19 8 hz which is the natural frequency obtained from toma so the modal shape of the swhpp is the maximum deformation at the frequency of 19 8 hz 6 conclusion in this paper the working principle of experimental system was introduced the excitation source and its corresponding excitation frequency of the swhpp were analyzed and pressure was selected as the excitation of the swhpp then a toma method is presented for predicting the modal parameters of the swhpp under pressure excitation the first four modal parameters of the swhpp identified by toma were compared with those estimated by ema the natural frequencies of the swhpp which were predicted by ema method were 16 6 hz 18 7 hz 39 0 hz and 85 9 hz the natural frequencies of the swhpp which were identified by the toma technique were 15 8 hz 19 8 hz 39 1 hz and 80 3 hz however due to the change of the factors such as boundary conditions and friction conditions in the operating state all the damping ratios identified by toma are smaller than those identified by ema next the influence of the pressure on the dynamics of the swhpp structure was further studied at several different pressures 0 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 mpa the results indicated that the vibration of the swhpp increased greatly as the pressure increased the frequency of the harmonics was invariant with the pump was running at a constant speed of 150 r min in addition since the excitation frequency of the swash plate and the flat valve of the swhpp is 20 hz as shown in table 2 the estimated natural frequency 19 8 hz 39 1 hz and 80 3 hz is around the fundamental frequency and its frequency multiplication so peaks occurred around 20 hz 40 hz and 80 hz as shown in fig 10 finally because there are no need artificial inputs the proposed method can predict the operational modal parameters of the pump structure efficiently

23426,an investigation into the dynamic behavior of the piston pump is an important method to reduce its vibration and noise in this paper an approach to predict the dynamics of a seawater hydraulic piston pump swhpp from output only transmissibility measurements is introduced in order to eliminate the harmonic interference generated by spindle rotation the excitation in this method is the pressure which caused by the swhpp operating at a constant speed and under different loading conditions the first four modes of the swhpp were estimated utilizing the method proposed in this paper and the influence of the pressure on the dynamics of the swhpp structure was further studied the experimental results indicated that peak occurred around the frequency of 20 hz and the reason is that the estimated second order natural frequency 19 8 hz is near to the frequency of 20 hz which is the excitation frequency of the swash plate and the flat valve of the swhpp in addition this method can identify modal parameters of the piston pump structure in the working state so it can effectively predict the dynamic behaviors of the piston pump keywords transmissibility natural frequency damping ratio pressure seawater hydraulic piston pump 1 introduction owing to high working pressure and high volumetric efficiency the piston pump is widely used to adjust buoyancy in submarines and autonomous underwater vehicles auvs however the vibration and noise generated by the piston pump will not only interfere with the concealment of the submarine and auvs but also be one of the main factors that cause the mechanical failure which has great influence on the personal and property safety with the advancement of submarines and auvs the vibration and noise control of piston pump must be investigated xu et al 2016 the research on piston pump vibration and noise control has gotten more attention in recent years pettersson et al 1991 described the mechanism of vibration and noise generation in piston pumps and the vibration of piston pump can be divided into the fluid vibration and the mechanical vibration quan et al 2016 palmen 2004 found that the vibration and noise of piston pump could be reduced by optimizing the pump housing wu et al 2017 discovered that the port valves materials have an effect on the noise of water hydraulic pump through experimental and theory simulation methods however other scholars have proven that the fluid born noise generated in the pump also contributes significantly to its dynamic pettersson et al 1991 ericson 2005 but fluid vibration and mechanical vibration coexist within the actual working process of the piston pump xu et al 2015 in general in order to reveal the dynamic behaviors of the piston pump effectively it needs to extract the vibration modes such as natural frequencies damping coefficients and mode shapes from measured data at pump operation therefore it is of great significance to analyze the dynamic behavior of the piston pump structure under the working conditions in the last few decades modal analysis has become a key technology in structural dynamics analysis maia and silva 1997 peeters et al 2004 there are three methods to identify the dynamic parameters of the piston pump the first method is computational modal analysis palmen 2004 used computational modal analysis to estimate the dynamic behavior of the piston pump shell due to the complex structure of the piston pump this method can not accurately predict the dynamic parameters of the piston pump the second method is experimental modal analysis ema and ema usually measures input forces and output responses using artificial excitation menon and zhao 2005 xu et al 2016 used ema method to optimize the piston pump housing and the experiment results indicated that the vibration and noise of the optimized piston pump were reduced significantly minette et al 2016 estimated the modal parameters of an electrical submersible pump using the ema technique and results showed that the identified natural frequencies were within the operational frequency range however the ema can only be applied in the stationary state of the pump therefore this is the disadvantage of using ema to identify the modal parameters of piston pump but the modal parameters identified in the stationary state might be different with those measured in the actual operating condition wang et al 2012 found that the torsional natural frequency of pump system shifts with changed with the load condition therefore the modal parameters of the piston pump in the working state should be considered the third method is operational modal analysis oma and oma has been developed to predict the modal parameters from the structure under its operational conditions lardies and larbi 2001a 2001b parloo et al 2002 cauberghe et al 2003 thus the aforementioned disadvantage exists in ema but it will not appear in oma however the classical oma method can be applied under the assumption that the input forces are white noise this requirement is not met for the piston pump because the piston pump structures contain rotating parts e g crankshaft swash plate and bearing and the harmonic interferences will be present in the response during the working process of the piston pump the classical oma techniques may encounter difficulties to correctly identify the modal parameters of the piston pump mohanty and rixen 2004 carden and lindblad 2015 demonstrated the use of oma to identify torsional modes on a water pump however it needs to measure the speed of shafts in the method this will increase the settings and the cost of the experiment in order to effectively identify the modal parameters of piston pump under operating condition a recently developed modal analysis technique will be studied transmissibility based operational modal analysis toma devriendt 2010 the advantage of the toma technique is that it does not rely on the presupposition that the input excitations must be white noise signals devriendt et al 2009 so this method can be used in the applications that the input signals contain harmonic excitation components devriendt and guillaume 2007 used the toma technique to estimate modal parameters of a beam which the excitation acting on the beam is a multi sine excitation since the conditions of a laboratory forced vibration test are always significantly different from the actual working conditions there are few literature to estimate the dynamic parameters of the piston pump using this method therefore the dynamic behaviors of the piston pump under operating conditions need further study in this paper a transmissibility based method to predict the modal parameters of piston pump under pressure excitation was developed and experiments were carried out for identifying the dynamic behavior of a swhpp besides the influence of the pressure on the dynamics of the piston pump was studied 2 excitation force of the swhpp this section detailed the working principle of experimental system and the excitation source and its corresponding excitation frequency of the swhpp were analyzed 2 1 the working principle of experimental system fig 1 details the working principle of experimental system the swhpp 5 is driven by variable frequency motor 6 to realize the process of absorbing and draining water the discharge pressure of the swhpp 5 is adjusted with the hole size of throttle valve 10 in this experiment the discharge pressure can be measured by pressure gauge 9 the speed of variable frequency motor 6 can be to maintain constant by adjusting the frequency of the variable frequency power source 7 all tests in the current paper are carried out on a swhpp the configurations of the swhpp as shown in fig 2 the swhpp is made up of end cover oriented ring pump casing cylinder block outlet port valve port inlet port base plate crankshaft bearing swash plate piston and flat valve the pump with this structure has the characteristics of high pressure large flow and low noise luo et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a 2016b the main parameters of the pump in this paper are listed in table 1 2 2 excitation of the swhpp the swhpp is an axial piston pump and the excitation source and its corresponding excitation frequency of the axial piston pump are shown in table 2 ye et al 2017 a conclusion can be obtained from table 2 excitations appear in cycles the frequency of the excitation is related to the rotational speed of the swhpp and the frequency of excitation is an invariant when the speed of the swhpp maintains a constant that is only the amplitude of the excitation varies and the frequency of excitation remains the same when the discharge pressure of the swhpp changes and the speed remains constant according to pascal s principle blanco and oro 2012 the pressure is transmitted in a closed static fluid without attenuation therefore the instantaneous pressure distributed in the pump outlet can be considered equivalency and uniformity in order to effectively eliminate harmonic interference which generated by the spindle rotation of the swhpp the pressure is used as the excitation of the proposed method which generated by the swhpp operating at a constant speed and under different loading conditions 3 theoretical background 3 1 modal model of the swhpp the dynamic equation of the swhpp can be described in the form 1 m x c x k x f where m c and k are the mass the damping and the stiffness matrices of the swhpp respectively x x and x are column vectors that represent the acceleration velocity and displacement respectively f represent the excitations which include mechanical excitation and hydrodynamic excitation xu et al 2015 the fourier transform of eq 1 is 2 x w h w f w the frequency response function can be calculated by eq 2 3 h w x w f w with 4 h w r 1 n φ r l r t j w λ r φ r l r h j w λ r the solution of eq 4 is 5 λ r ζ r w r i 1 ζ r 2 w r 6 f r w r 2 π where f r is natural frequency ζ r is damping ratio φ r represents the modal shape vector and l r represents the modal participation vector h w is the frequency response function from the discussion above the modal parameters can be estimated from the frequency response function h w when measured the excitation force f w and the vibration responses x w simultaneously however due to the complexity of the hydraulic system the excitation forces of the swhpp are difficult to measure 3 2 the basic theory of toma algorithm the transmissibility function t ij w was defined by ewins 1984 as follows 7 t i j w x i w x j w where x i w x j w denote the responses of the point i and point j under the pressure a respectively when the input force f w is a single force by combining eq 2 and eq 7 the transmissibility function t ij w can be expressed as the following form 8 t i j w x i w x j w h i w f w h j w f w h i w h j w obviously in this case the transmissibility is independent of the properties and amplitude of the force but only depends on the location of the force by combining eq 4 when jw is close to the system s poles the limit value of the transmissibility eq 8 9 lim j w λ r t i j w lim j w λ r h i w h j w φ i r φ j r this means that the transmissibility function t ij w depends neither on the locations nor on the amplitudes of the input force at the system poles however as discussed in section 2 2 there is not only one source of excitation for the swhpp and the excitation frequency of excitation source is related to the rotation speed of the pump this means the excitations of the pump are caused by the rotation of the spindle xu et al 2016 the input forces f k k 1 n are fully correlated devriendt et al 2009 that is 10 f k c k p w eq 7 can be written as follows 11 t i j w k 1 n h i k w c k p w m 1 n h j m w c m p w p w k 1 n h i k w c k p w m 1 n h j m w c m k 1 n h i k w c k m 1 n h j m w c m where c k and c m are constant related to the location and amplitude of the input forces f k and p w is the relevant portion of the input forces f k this shows that in this case transmissibility function t ij w is irrelevant to the properties of the input forces and it depends only on the amplitudes and the locations of the unknown input forces f k by making use of eq 4 when the limit value jw of the transmissibility function t ij w approaches the system s poles λ r the limit value of eq 11 is 12 lim j w λ r t i j w lim j w λ r k 1 n h i k w c k lim j w λ r m 1 n h j m w c m k 1 n φ i r l r c k m 1 n φ j r l r c m φ i r k 1 n c k φ j r m 1 n c m a φ i r φ j r and 13 a k 1 n c k m 1 n c m where c k is a constant when the swhpp works at the same pressure and speed a is a constant the transmissibility function has no relation with the locations and the amplitudes of the input forces f k when the measuring points i j are invariant the subtraction of two transmissibility functions which measured at different pressure conditions a b is 14 δ t i j w t i j a w t i j b w when the limit value jw of the transmissibility function t ij w approaches the system s poles λ r eq 14 satisfies 15 lim j w λ r δ t i j w lim j w λ r t i j a w t i j b w 0 this indicates that the poles of the system λ r are the zeroes of the rational function δ t i j w and its inverse δ 1 t i j w is 16 δ 1 t i j w 1 t i j a w t i j b w this result shows that the poles of the system equal to the poles of rational function δ 1 t i j w then the modal parameters of the swhpp could be estimated from the rational functions δ 1 t i j w utilizing the operational modal analysis 4 modal analysis of the swhpp in this section the modal parameters of the swhpp were identified by the toma method and ema was conducted to validate the toma 4 1 experimental setup 4 1 1 toma of the swhpp the speed of the motor is 750 r min in toma experiment and the reduction ratio of the gear box is 5 1 so the speed of the pump is 150 r min the rated discharge pressure of the swhpp is 3 mpa as the discussion in section 3 2 the rational function needs to be measured at two different pressure conditions so 0 and 3 mpa were selected as the test conditions fig 3 showed the toma experimental system of the swhpp the schematic drawing of the toma experimental system was showed in fig 4 1 in order to obtain the modal model of the swhpp 12 test points were selected the points of the circle shown in fig 4b experiments have been carried out for measuring the dynamic characteristics of the swhpp in the z direction 12 test points are evenly distributed in the swhpp outlet and the swhpp outlet is a nickel brass ring with an internal diameter of 0 25 m 2 to measure the vibrations in the z directions six accelerometers type 4514 b 001 brüel kjær were attached to the test points due to the number of accelerometers was fewer than that of test points one accelerometer was mounted at a fixed test point as reference and the remaining five accelerometers were switched three times to monitor the vibration generally peak deflection points or non nodal are selected as the reference point batel 2002 as shown in fig 4b the reference point was the point at the swhpp outlet in this experiment 3 all accelerometers were connected to the same acquisition system lan xi type 3050 b 060 6ch brüel kjær and the data analysis was conducted in pulse labshop 14 1 brüel kjær and matlab software because the speed of the pump shaft was 150 r min so its rotational frequency f 150 60 2 5 hz the frequency band of interest was set from 0 hz up to 100 hz the sampling rate of the system was 256 hz and sampling time was 64 s 4 to keep the speed of the pump constant in the whole processing the motor speed was adjusted by the frequency of the variable frequency power source 4 1 2 ema of the swhpp in this section the modal parameters of the swhpp were predicted from the experimental modal analysis module in the pulse software brüel kjær 1 the accelerometers and test points were the same with those in the toma experiment as described in section 4 1 1 2 as shown in fig 5 the hammer excitations were performed in the z direction at the excitation point by a powerful hammer type hdfc dfc 1 4 2 results and discussions the stability diagram of the toma of the swhpp is presented in fig 6 the green curve denotes the rational function the frequencies are presented on the abscissa axis the amplitudes are displayed on the left ordinate axis and the model orders are displayed on the right ordinate axis the symbol o represents the pole is not stable the symbol v represents the pole vector does not change within the tolerance the symbol s represents frequency damping and pole vector are all stable within the tolerances as can be seen from the diagram there are four modes between 0 hz and 100 hz table 3 is the modal parameters of the swhpp identified by toma and ema experiments for the first three modes the natural frequencies estimated by toma are quite similar to those obtained from ema for the fourth mode the natural frequency identified by ema is bigger than that of the toma by 5 6 hz however the damping ratios of all modes estimated by toma are smaller than those obtained from ema these differences are the result of many factors such as the ema is conducted in the static state and the toma is carried out in the working state when the damping ratios measured in working condition of the swhpp there is the fluid structure coupling effect in the pump the change of the friction between the combined surfaces and the boundary condition li et al 2013 these reasons led to the damping ratios identified by toma were smaller than the parameters identified by ema the mode shapes of the swhpp are presented in fig 7 the dotted line in the picture indicates the stationary state of the structure and the solid line represents the directions of the modal vibrations from the figure it can be seen that the vibration of the first two modes is the most obvious especially in the second mode however there are no obvious vibrations of the swhpp for the last two modes 5 the influence of the pressure on the dynamics of the swhpp structure in this section in order to investigate the influence of the pressure on the dynamics of the swhpp structure an experiment was established as shown in fig 8 the sampling time is 64 s the analysis frequency range is 0 hz 100 hz and the sampling rate is 256 hz 1 the accelerometer reference 4514 b 001 brüel kjær which mounts on the swhpp outlet to measure the vibration in z direction 2 the accelerometer is connected to the acquisition system lan xi type 3050 b 060 6ch brüel kjær and the data analysis is conducted in pulse labshop 14 1 3 to keep the speed constant the motor speed is measured by a tachometer reference dm6234p victor and the speed of the motor is set to a constant of 750 r min the experimental results are shown in figs 9 11 as shown in fig 9 four discharge pressures were tried as well about 0 1 2 and 3 mpa the blue curve in fig 10 shows the amplitudes of the auto power spectra of the outlet vibration during the swhpp working at different pressure from these results we can get the conclusion that the amplitude of the vibrations increases as the pressure increases due to the interference of the rotation frequency of the swhpp harmonics appear in the fundamental frequency and its frequency multiplication in the power spectrum curve it is validated as the discussion of table 2 the excitation frequency of the swash plate and the flat valve of the swhpp is 20 hz so the amplitude peaks occur around the fundamental frequency 20 hz and its frequency multiplication 40 hz 60 hz 80 hz and 100 hz the amplitudes of the harmonics which are excited under the high pressure are larger than those excited under the low pressure because the speed of the swhpp keeps a constant in the whole processing the harmonics amplitudes increase proportionally to the discharge pressure with no change of harmonics frequency this is also verified after five harmonics are selected and the amplitudes of them are compared as shown in fig 11 the red curves in fig 10 represent the lower envelope of amplitude spectrum of the vibration at 0 1 2 and 3 mpa respectively by comparing these curves we can obtain a conclusion the amplitude of the curves fluctuated greatly with the pressure increases peak appeared at 20 hz when the working pressure is 0 mpa when the working pressure of the swhpp is 1 2 and 3 mpa the peaks occurred around 20 hz and 40 hz this is because of the modes are excited with the high pressure as discussed in section 4 2 19 8 hz and 39 1 hz was the natural frequency estimated by toma technique it caused peaks to occur around these natural frequencies correspond to fig 7 the excitation frequency of the swash plate and the flat valve of the swhpp 20 hz is around 19 8 hz which is the natural frequency obtained from toma so the modal shape of the swhpp is the maximum deformation at the frequency of 19 8 hz 6 conclusion in this paper the working principle of experimental system was introduced the excitation source and its corresponding excitation frequency of the swhpp were analyzed and pressure was selected as the excitation of the swhpp then a toma method is presented for predicting the modal parameters of the swhpp under pressure excitation the first four modal parameters of the swhpp identified by toma were compared with those estimated by ema the natural frequencies of the swhpp which were predicted by ema method were 16 6 hz 18 7 hz 39 0 hz and 85 9 hz the natural frequencies of the swhpp which were identified by the toma technique were 15 8 hz 19 8 hz 39 1 hz and 80 3 hz however due to the change of the factors such as boundary conditions and friction conditions in the operating state all the damping ratios identified by toma are smaller than those identified by ema next the influence of the pressure on the dynamics of the swhpp structure was further studied at several different pressures 0 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 mpa the results indicated that the vibration of the swhpp increased greatly as the pressure increased the frequency of the harmonics was invariant with the pump was running at a constant speed of 150 r min in addition since the excitation frequency of the swash plate and the flat valve of the swhpp is 20 hz as shown in table 2 the estimated natural frequency 19 8 hz 39 1 hz and 80 3 hz is around the fundamental frequency and its frequency multiplication so peaks occurred around 20 hz 40 hz and 80 hz as shown in fig 10 finally because there are no need artificial inputs the proposed method can predict the operational modal parameters of the pump structure efficiently

23427,fire remains a serious threat to a floating liquefied natural gas facility it is of greater concern given the remote locations and limited accessibility of emergency services this study aims to present a rigorous procedure to study potential accident scenarios in an offshore floating processing facility with different ignition source locations and verify the effectiveness of safety measures using computational fluid dynamics code the uniqueness of the present study is the integration of release dispersion and fire modeling scenarios simplifying the fire analysis and increasing its effectiveness from the offshore process system design and analysis perspectives the first step of the procedure is to identify the range of potential release scenarios and their strength of dispersion in confined and semi confined spaces subsequently potential fire scenarios are analyzed considering the influence of the location computational fluid dynamics models are used to analyze these three steps of the scenarios application of the procedure is demonstrated on an offshore facility by analyzing 14 credible scenarios the ranges of safety measures of these fires are also studied to determine their effectiveness to prevent fires and mitigate their impact this study provides a simple and efficient way to analyze the impact of key design parameters in this study the transition from fire to explosion is not considered and all the environmental factors are assumed to be constants in the simulation keywords release simulation fire simulation offshore processing offshore process safety floating lng computational fluid dynamics 1 introduction global energy demand is continuously rising natural gas being one of the cleanest sources of energy its demand is sharply rising because of the growing demand many oil companies are currently increasing their investment in floating liquefied natural gas flng facilities such as floating storage and regasification units lng fsru and floating production storage and offloading lng fpso with the development of shipbuilding and offshore industries the concept of the flng was recently proposed xie et al 2014 an flng facility uses various types of technologies developed for conventional land based lng offshore oil and gas and marine transport industries aronsson 2012 an flng facility can implement gas extraction gas pre treatment natural gas liquefaction condensate treatment water treatment lng storage lng offloading and combined technologies in one offshore facility which creates a congested and complicated layout bunnag et al 2011 fire and explosion accidents such as the piper alpha disaster ramsay et al 1994 the bp texas city disaster kalantarnia et al 2010 the bp deepwater horizon explosion sammarco et al 2013 the cleveland explosion de angelis et al 2012 and buncefield oil depot fire ottemöller and evers 2008 have demonstrated the importance of safety in oil and gas operations in a typical onshore oil refinery or chemical plant hazardous facilities are usually separated from other parts of the plant however on an flng facilities have to be arranged in a congested layout while this layout brings economic and environmental benefits lee et al 2014 it has a higher fire risk compared to a conventional natural gas processing unit xin et al 2015 in addition offshore and remote operations usually have limited infrastructure and resources support all these make it more challenging to assure fire safety in offshore facilities fire accidents caused by flammable hydrocarbons leakage have been well studied by many researchers dadashzadeh et al 2013 dan et al 2014 darbra et al 2010 fay 2003 hansen et al 2007 hissong 2007 ichard et al 2010 johnson and cornwell 2007 luketa hanlin 2006 pitblado et al 2005 sun et al 2014 yun sheng and hua gang 2008 the overpressure resulting from a flammable gas explosion is not significant in open areas while places with confined layouts are dangerous dadashzadeh et al 2013 luketa hanlin 2006 studied the behaviour of lng spills and pool formations on water and discussed the modeling of lng spills taking combustion events such as pool fires and vapour cloud fires into consideration fay constructed a model to predict the dynamics of spills from lng and oil tankers the pool fire area duration and heat release rate were determined using this model 2003 jet fires explosions and flash fires occurring on the topside of lng fpsos were analyzed considering different leakage hole sizes it can be concluded that even though the lng is safe enough under alarp criteria there is a need to select independent protection layers to meet a higher standard dan et al 2014 sun validated the cfd model of fire radiation by comparing the simulation results and experimental data followed by a hazard analysis of an lng satellite station the distance between dike walls and avv banks was suggested to be enlarged by the author 2014 hissong described the key factors used to model an lng spill on water the results from pool fires on land were compared with the results of pool fires on water 2007 using computational fluid dynamics cfd tools to model the consequences of fire accidents and conduct an analysis has been well validated by many studies and experiments dadashzadeh et al proposed an integrated approach for fire and explosion simulation flacs was used to simulate the evaporation and dispersion of flammable gas and delayed ignition while the fire dynamics simulator fds code was used to model the ignition of the rest of the fuel over the liquid pool 2013 baalisampang et al used the fds code to study fire occurring on a typical flng processing facility and its impact on personnel and assets in his study a water deluge system was applied to mitigate the impact of fire 2017 in another study conducted by baalisampang et al three credible scenarios were identified and the impact of fire on personnel and assets was determined by combining the fds code and probit method 2017 baalisampang et al also proposed a method to determine an inherently safe layout design and highlight the importance of improved layout design and passive control strategies 2016 in the study conducted by hansen et al 2007 flacs was used to develop a cfd model to validate the studies of lng vapour dispersion humidity and other effects were considered in this study to design a pool spread model phast was used by pitblado et al to predict the hazard zone caused by an accident or deliberate attack a range of credible scenarios was developed in this study 2005 berg et al identified an optimal safety design for an fpso by using a cfd model to quantify the overpressure an explosion can cause and also assessed the risk reduction measures using a quantitative method the effects of barrier walls separation gaps and other influencing factors were discussed in this study 2000 van hees listed many previous validation studies and also conducted several simulations to validate the fds model the results of these studies show good correspondence between fds simulation and experiment results 2013 binbin conducted a comparative analysis by fire simulation using fluent and fds and found that although fluent and cfx have more extensive simulation areas and other advantages in terms of meshing the result of fds has high consistency with measured results in some situations 2011 table 1 shows the main differences of fds fluent and cfx in this study the fire analysis is mainly based on the fds code a specialty cfd tool developed to study fire dynamics many previous studies have explored natural gas fire accidents baalisampang 2017a 2017b fay 2003 hansen et al 2007 hissong 2007 jin and jang 2015 luketa hanlin 2006 pitblado et al 2005 with focus on leakage parameters such as the leakage point leakage probability release rate and environmental parameters such as wind speed and direction however these studies ignore the impact of the location of the ignition source in this study the influence of the effect of the ignition source location is mainly considered the objective of this study is to present a rigorous procedure to study potential accident scenarios in an offshore floating processing facility with different ignition source locations and verify the effectiveness of safety measures based on the consequences of potential flng fire accident scenarios the scenarios with different ignition source locations are modeled using the fds code under the assumption that all the environmental factors are constants in the simulation another unique aspect of the present study is consideration of a fire s impact using areas of influence and temperature distribution safety measures firewalls and fire suppression systems are analyzed for their effectiveness in mitigating the effect of fire a limitation of this study is that it does not consider the transition from fire to explosion during simulation 2 the proposed methodology this study focuses on the simulation of fires caused by ignition sources located in different places on an flng and the verification of the effectiveness of safety measures it incorporates the release and dispersion modeling of an lng for the development of various credible scenarios and employs cfd simulations for each scenario to analyze the fire s impact on the flng to determine the most dangerous scenario this is followed by the implementation of safety measures such as a firewall and automatic fire suppression system to mitigate the fire s impact on human beings adjacent assets and structures fig 1 demonstrates the procedure of this study 2 1 step 1 scenario development when developing a credible scenario many parameters which could contribute to a fire must be considered such as miscellaneous parameters pressure temperature and humidity fuel parameters chemical and physical properties leak parameters rate location duration and direction wind parameters speed and direction and so on in order to study the impact of locations of ignition sources on safety measure design all the parameters except the location of the ignition source remain unchanged in all scenarios developed in this study the users of this approach may choose other parameters that are not limited to those used in this study 2 2 step 2 fuel release and dispersion analysis fire occurs when the concentration of gas fuel reaches the combustion limit crowl and louvar 2001 it is considered that the combustion limit of natural gas is 5 15 mokhatab et al 2013 the release and dispersion simulations are conducted using the fds model in this study to determine the distribution of the concentration of gas fuel so that the size of the fuel vapour cloud can be calculated to develop credible scenarios lng released from a tank can vaporize quickly due to the ambient temperature lng vaporization occurs in two ways johnson and cornwell 2007 1 heat transfer from the ambient temperature when no fuel is ignited 2 heat transfer from the fire occurring in the surrounding area when natural gas is ignited natural gas is a combustible hydrocarbon gas mixture formed primarily of methane ethane propane butane pentane and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide nitrogen hydrogen sulfide or helium hissong 2007 in fds lagrangian particles are used to represent objects that cannot be resolved on the numerical grid mcgrattan et al 2013a 2013b liquid droplets are the most common example in this study the liquid fuel is lng and needs to be represented by lagrangian particles a sprinkler is used to represent the fuel release from a hole in the tank in this study in this fds simulation a mixture of gas species such as air is simplified as a lumped species which is considered to transport and react together the transport equation for both lumped species and a single species utilized by fds is shown in equation 1 mcgrattan et al 2013a 1 ρ t ρ z α ρ z α u ρ d α z

volume of species α by chemical reactions and m b α is the mass production rate per unit volume of species α by evaporating droplets particles 2 3 step 3 fire consequence analysis eliminating the existence of ignition sources can prevent a fire however there are many types of ignition sources that cannot be completely identified and eliminated crowl and louvar 2001 thus it is necessary to investigate how ignition sources would affect the potential consequences of flng fire accidents this study focuses on the impact of an ignition source s location on the consequences caused by fire all parameters except the location of the ignition source remain unchanged to find the most dangerous scenarios caused by different ignition sources location considering the results of the release and dispersion model various credible scenarios can be developed the fds code is used to conduct simulations of various credible scenarios fds is a computational fluid dynamics cfd model of fire driven fluid flow developed by the national institute of standards and technology nist fds has been validated by nist and also by a large number of studies and experiments mcgrattan et al 2000 rinne et al 2007 wen et al 2007 to decrease the computational cost most combustion models in fds use a single step the mixing controlled infinitely fast chemical reaction of lumped species each reaction using a

the literature was conducted the results obtained were compared with the results reported in the literature they showed a good agreement this partially validates the fds code according to the previous studies baalisampang 2017a 2017b milke 2016 at 538 c the yield strength of steel will be reduced to approximately 60 of its normal value which does not have the ability to support the steel structure s function according to the american institute for steel construction aisc 1978 in this study a temperature higher than 538 c is defined as dangerous while the area that the dangerous temperature caused by a fire can reach is defined as the dangerous zone in the current study the fire s impact on adjacent assets and structures is evaluated through these aspects the maximum temperature the fire can cause the duration of the dangerous temperature and the size of the dangerous zone 2 4 step 4 safety measure design and effectiveness analysis considering the serious impact of fire on adjacent assets and structures some safety measures including active and passive measures are used to mitigate this impact apart from applying active safer designs passive measures including protective equipment cannot be ignored due to the chemical properties of flammable hydrogen the term passive measures refers to designs that could mitigate the impact of accidents among these safety measures firewalls water deluge systems and carbon dioxide fire suppression systems are considered effective methods to mitigate the impact of fire in this section the simulations are conducted using the fds code after applying safety measures three evaluation aspects are used to analyze the impact of fire the maximum temperature the fire can cause the duration of the dangerous temperature and the size of the dangerous zone the results from the fds simulation are used to compare with the results from the simulation without applying any safety measure to study the effect that safety measures would have on the fire 2 4 1 firewall in traditional onshore chemical plants each module is separately located at an adequate distance however in offshore facilities due to their compact layouts firewalls are typically used to implement segregation stouffer et al 2011 in this study the firewall is installed around the leakage tank to prevent the spread of fuel and fire 2 4 2 fire suppression system an auto fire suppression system is an effective way to provide protection against fire in the current study in order to effectively mitigate the impact of fire on adjacent assets and structures a carbon dioxide fire suppression system as well as a water deluge system are installed on an flng facility a carbon dioxide fire suppression system is also a reliable way to mitigate the impact of fire carbon dioxide is a colourless odourless electrically non conductive and easily available gas that is highly efficient as a fire suppression agent while a water spray could reduce the temperature by water evaporation carbon dioxide can be used to reduce the flammable gas concentration and thus smother fires this method to extinguish a fire is called clean agent fire suppression by the national fire protection association 2001 in this study the carbon dioxide fire suppression system is installed according to the national fire protection association 2001 3 application of the methodology 3 1 step 1 scenario development the geometry of the target offshore structure is an flng processing facility shown in fig 2 the information for the target offshore structure is extracted from a typical flng processing facility the target structure model is comprised of a life module central control room and helicopter deck process and utility modules hull and ship systems a turret and fluid transmission control rotary joint and mooring and riser systems among them the process unit is considered one of the most hazardous areas and needs more attention xin et al 2015 in this study liquid fuel is assumed to be released from a tank in the process and utility modules considering its higher risk the simulation volume is set as 72 m 80 m 36 m and the grid cell is 0 5 m 0 5 m 0 5 m the total number of grid cells in each scenario is 1658880 fig 3 shows the simulation area in the target structure according to ichard et al a finer as well as a coarse grid cell have been used in sensitivity studies to guarantee that the grid solution is independent of the cell size 2010 a coarse mesh with 964800 cells and a fine mesh with 1878750 cells were selected fig 4 shows good correspondence between the simulation results of temperature changes over time in certain slice files with different meshes the simulation period of 60s is considered for each scenario higher simulation duration may be considered however in the present study simulation results did not make much difference therefore this scenario is restricted to a first minute simulation in the current study the ambient pressure is set to be atmospheric pressure and the ambient temperature is set to be 5 c considering cold region operating conditions wind speed is assumed to be 3 m s and the wind comes from the x axis while the atmospheric stability class is d which is a credible scenario according to pitblado et al 2005 for release factors the leakage point is assumed to be on the tank in the process and utility modules lng is released at the speed of 10 m s due to the inner pressure of the tank and considering the high wind zone offshore according to pitblado et al s study the maximum credible hole caused by accidental operational events is 750 mm 2005 the release rate of lng can be calculated using 10 m s and 750 mm as the release velocity and hole size instead of treating release as instantaneous or at a constant rate as in most studies the release rate in this study is treated as a time varying value the release starts at 0s gradually reaches the specified rate at 3 s and then remains constant from 57s the release rate decreases gradually and finally stops 3 2 step 2 release and dispersion simulation in the dispersion simulation the ambient pressure is set to be atmospheric pressure and the ambient temperature is set to be 5 c considering cold region operating conditions the wind speed is 3 m s and the wind comes from the x axis ten planes are selected and evenly distributed on an x axis to show the concentration of gas fuel based on the results of the simulation lng vaporizes quickly after release from the tank due to conditions in the surrounding environment with wind action natural gas disperses quickly and in approximately 20 s natural gas covers most of the entire simulation area in an actual offshore operation the release rate and leakage point may change and environmental factors such as wind speed and temperature might cause natural gas to vaporize and disperse at an even higher speed fig 5 shows an example of the results using the fds code 3 3 step 3 fire simulation and analysis the area where the concentration of gas fuel reaches the flammable limit is selected as a credible fire scenario based on the results of the release and dispersion simulation a total of fourteen different accident scenarios with different locations of the ignition source in the process and utilities module are developed in this study while only one scenario is developed on the second deck because of the low likelihood that the gas fuel can disperse to the second deck 13 ignition locations are evenly developed throughout the first deck the fds code is used to conduct a fire simulation for each scenario table 2 describes the 14 credible scenarios with different locations fig 6 shows the location of the ignition source in this section the fds code is used to conduct fire simulation for 14 credible scenarios in order to obtain precise data at a specific point in the simulation 66 thermocouples are set in the target structure these 66 thermocouples are distributed evenly over the target structure and can record the temperature of the monitoring points changing over time fig 7 indicates the location of 66 thermocouples additionally 10 slices are selected and placed evenly on an x axis to show the concentration of gas fuel and temperature change over time in smokeview fig 8 indicates the location of 10 slices in scenario 2 with the wind action the fuel gas disperses rapidly and is exposed to the ignition source at about 21s the vapour gas is ignited when the fuel gas reaches the flammable limit and the temperature reaches the ignition temperature due to the existence of confined geometry around the ignition source in scenario 2 the fire occurs and the temperature rises rapidly after the fuel vapour is ignited the flame rapidly returns to the leakage point and ignites all the fuel released from the vessel the spill fire then forms until the leak stops in this scenario the longest time of all 14 scenarios is needed to ignite the vapour cloud so the flame has the shortest duration and the period of the damage to the adjacent assets and structure is short however the highest maximum temperature of all 14 scenarios is found in scenario 2 which will be analyzed in detail in the next section fig 9 shows the contours of the fire change over time for scenario 2 in smokeview six monitoring points are selected as examples of temperature change over time for scenario 2 as shown in fig 10 note that for most monitoring points the temperature reaches a peak after 30s indicating a very high rate of temperature rise giving less time for safe mustering fig 11 shows the maximum temperature that fire could cause in each scenario according to the result scenario 2 has the highest temperature while scenario 6 has the lowest apparently the highest temperatures of scenarios 3 6 9 and 14 have different degrees of reduction which indicates that due to the existence of some structures between the location of the ignition source and the leakage point the gas fuel may not spread far and thus the fire will not cause as serious a result as others within the simulation period as shown in fig 12 some thermocouples are selected in scenario 11 to indicate the difference between 538 c and the temperature recorded at some monitoring points this is highlighted in fig 12 which shows the period of dangerous temperature rise the duration of the dangerous temperature caused by a fire is monitored by measuring points and plotted in fig 11 analysis of the results of all credible scenarios shows that scenario 11 has the maximum time duration of a dangerous temperature while scenario 6 has the minimal time duration of a dangerous temperature it can be concluded that due to the close distance and a scarcity of other structures between the location of the ignition source and the leakage point in scenario 11 fire could occur more easily than in other scenarios so a fire caused by a close ignition source could last for a long time the size of the dangerous zone can be shown using a slice file that is perpendicular to the z axis fig 13 shows the slice file of the temperature in scenario 13 of all credible scenarios scenario 2 can cause the largest dangerous zone a long period before ignition gives gas fuel the opportunity to disperse further which leads to it being the largest dangerous zone for the leakage occurring in a specific tank the location of the ignition source affects the result of the fire to sum up based on the fire analysis of all credible scenarios in this case considering the aforementioned three aspects that measure the impact of fire scenarios 2 11 and 13 are considered the three most dangerous scenarios overall in terms of thermal effect considering the confined layout of an flng transition from fire to explosion may possibly occur in this study flacs a cfd software used extensively for explosion modeling was used to simulate a possible explosion occurring under the same conditions since this study mainly focuses on the fire s effect on an offshore facility the explosion simulation result is presented briefly the ignition location is selected based on the release and dispersion simulation results achieved through flacs fig 14 shows the pressure caused by explosion changing over time in the flacs simulation according to the results ignition occurred at about 30s overpressure caused by the explosion is not high enough to cause damage to assets in this case and thus thermal radiation is considered to be the main impact in this study 3 4 step 4 fire suppression simulation and analysis in this section a firewall and an auto fire suppression system are installed in the flng facility and then a cfd simulation is conducted with the same parameters as are used in the previous sections the deluge system is simulated using the fds code with lagrangian particles sprinkler heads with a 12 m 2 coverage area are installed and the distance between the sprinkler heads is set to be 4 5 m according to the nfpa 13 standard 2013 when the sprinkler heads are exposed to fire and the temperature around them reaches 60 c they will be activated automatically baalisampang 2017b fig 15 shows the maximum temperature at which the fire can reach the target structure in the absence of any safety measures and the maximum temperature at which the fire can reach the target structure under the protection of a firewall and fire suppression system in the three most dangerous scenarios obviously due to the existence of a firewall and fire suppression system the maximum temperature of all scenarios is decreased in varying degrees in scenario 2 the firewall is very helpful because it can prevent the spreading of fuel and the fire since scenario 2 has the longest distance from the leakage point to the ignition source preventing the spreading of fuel can highly decrease the opportunity for natural gas to meet the ignition source and thus highly decrease the impact of a fire however in the other two scenarios the fire suppression system plays a more vital role in mitigating the effects of the fire in terms of maximum temperature the fire can cause in scenarios 11 and 13 the distances between the leakage points and ignition sources are very short so the natural gas is still very likely to meet the ignition sources in spite of the existence of a firewall therefore the fire suppression system can be a more effective way to mitigate the impact of fire in this case in figs 16 and 17 4 monitoring points are selected to show the temperature changes over time in scenarios 2 and 13 in each scenario the figures show the results both before and after the application of safety measures in this section the dangerous temperature line is set to show the difference between the dangerous temperature and the temperature caused by fire the part that exceeds the dangerous temperature has been highlighted in the figures thus the duration of a dangerous temperature can be explicitly demonstrated according to the results shown in figs 16 and 17 both the firewall and the fire suppression system can effectively mitigate the impact of fire to varying degrees in terms of the duration of a dangerous temperature for scenario 2 the firewall plays a more vital role than the fire suppression system compared to the scenario without applying safety measures it is obvious that in scenario 2 ignition is delayed at some specific monitoring points such as points 13 and 39 due to the existence of a firewall for scenario 13 the firewall is ineffective to delay ignition because of the short distance between the leakage point and ignition source however the flng avoids a more serious impact of fire with the help of the fire suppression system in figs 18 and 19 slice files are used to show the temperature of the cross section perpendicular to the z axis and the slice plane and the largest size of the dangerous zone is recorded in each scenario in scenario 2 the firewall is not very useful to prevent the spreading of fire but it effectively reduces the high temperature the insignificant opportunity for natural gas to meet the ignition gas contributes to this result a small amount of natural gas meeting an ignition source brings a comparatively low temperature but the firewall cannot effectively reduce the size of a fire when the fire has already started in scenario 13 due to the existence of a firewall the spread of fuel gas and flames is highly suppressed therefore the high temperature mainly concentrates within the firewall and for this reason the dangerous zone can be reduced however the area within the firewall has a comparatively higher temperature although a fire suppression system cannot influence the spread of fuel gas and flames it can reduce the size of a dangerous zone by reducing the overall temperature in the flng the results in this section further demonstrate that for different scenarios the effectiveness of the safety measure varies in summary both firewalls and auto fire suppression systems can effectively mitigate the impact of fire in terms of the maximum temperature the fire can cause the duration of the dangerous temperature and the size of the dangerous zone however for different scenarios these two safety measures have different effectiveness for a scenario in which the ignition source is far from the leakage point the firewall can effectively prevent the spread of natural gas and thus reduce its opportunity to meet the ignition source for a scenario in which the ignition source is close to the leakage point such as in scenarios 11 and 13 the firewall cannot delay the occurrence of fire but it can limit most of the fire to inside the firewall and thus effectively reduce the size of the dangerous area however introducing a firewall will increase the confinement of the flng layout this may increase the chance of explosion an auto fire suppression system can reduce the flammable gas concentration and reduce the heat through vaporization and thus effectively mitigate the impact of a fire 4 conclusions this paper proposes a procedure for analyzing the effectiveness of safety measures in reducing the impact of fire caused by an lng release in an flng facility considering the impact of ignition source location the fire simulations are conducted for credible scenarios with different ignition source locations and the results extracted to determine the most dangerous scenarios in this study three aspects are considered to model the impact of accident scenarios they are the maximum temperature the fire can cause the duration of the dangerous temperature and the size of the dangerous zone the results of the study confirm that the release of lng is a serious threat to personnel on board and the assets the relatively small differences in ignition source locations can increase the effect of the consequences of a fire to mitigate the impact of fire a firewall and fire suppression system are selected and implemented fds is used as a tool to analyze the impact of each scenario with different ignition source locations after applying safety measures comparing the results before and after applying safety measures it can be concluded that safety measures such as firewalls and auto fire suppression help to limit the impact of fire however the threat still remains significant using the proper layout to isolate the danger is identified as most effective in terms of limiting the impact of potential accidents this study emphasizes that a flng layout must be considered with the utmost care this step is the most effective measure in limiting a potential lng release and subsequent dispersion effect and directly influences the fire dynamics and thus limits the potential damage the scope of this study is limited to fire safety analysis through a numerical simulation approach the transition from fire to explosion will be studied in future work the proposed approach will be further validated through control experiment field data reported in the literature 
23427,fire remains a serious threat to a floating liquefied natural gas facility it is of greater concern given the remote locations and limited accessibility of emergency services this study aims to present a rigorous procedure to study potential accident scenarios in an offshore floating processing facility with different ignition source locations and verify the effectiveness of safety measures using computational fluid dynamics code the uniqueness of the present study is the integration of release dispersion and fire modeling scenarios simplifying the fire analysis and increasing its effectiveness from the offshore process system design and analysis perspectives the first step of the procedure is to identify the range of potential release scenarios and their strength of dispersion in confined and semi confined spaces subsequently potential fire scenarios are analyzed considering the influence of the location computational fluid dynamics models are used to analyze these three steps of the scenarios application of the procedure is demonstrated on an offshore facility by analyzing 14 credible scenarios the ranges of safety measures of these fires are also studied to determine their effectiveness to prevent fires and mitigate their impact this study provides a simple and efficient way to analyze the impact of key design parameters in this study the transition from fire to explosion is not considered and all the environmental factors are assumed to be constants in the simulation keywords release simulation fire simulation offshore processing offshore process safety floating lng computational fluid dynamics 1 introduction global energy demand is continuously rising natural gas being one of the cleanest sources of energy its demand is sharply rising because of the growing demand many oil companies are currently increasing their investment in floating liquefied natural gas flng facilities such as floating storage and regasification units lng fsru and floating production storage and offloading lng fpso with the development of shipbuilding and offshore industries the concept of the flng was recently proposed xie et al 2014 an flng facility uses various types of technologies developed for conventional land based lng offshore oil and gas and marine transport industries aronsson 2012 an flng facility can implement gas extraction gas pre treatment natural gas liquefaction condensate treatment water treatment lng storage lng offloading and combined technologies in one offshore facility which creates a congested and complicated layout bunnag et al 2011 fire and explosion accidents such as the piper alpha disaster ramsay et al 1994 the bp texas city disaster kalantarnia et al 2010 the bp deepwater horizon explosion sammarco et al 2013 the cleveland explosion de angelis et al 2012 and buncefield oil depot fire ottemöller and evers 2008 have demonstrated the importance of safety in oil and gas operations in a typical onshore oil refinery or chemical plant hazardous facilities are usually separated from other parts of the plant however on an flng facilities have to be arranged in a congested layout while this layout brings economic and environmental benefits lee et al 2014 it has a higher fire risk compared to a conventional natural gas processing unit xin et al 2015 in addition offshore and remote operations usually have limited infrastructure and resources support all these make it more challenging to assure fire safety in offshore facilities fire accidents caused by flammable hydrocarbons leakage have been well studied by many researchers dadashzadeh et al 2013 dan et al 2014 darbra et al 2010 fay 2003 hansen et al 2007 hissong 2007 ichard et al 2010 johnson and cornwell 2007 luketa hanlin 2006 pitblado et al 2005 sun et al 2014 yun sheng and hua gang 2008 the overpressure resulting from a flammable gas explosion is not significant in open areas while places with confined layouts are dangerous dadashzadeh et al 2013 luketa hanlin 2006 studied the behaviour of lng spills and pool formations on water and discussed the modeling of lng spills taking combustion events such as pool fires and vapour cloud fires into consideration fay constructed a model to predict the dynamics of spills from lng and oil tankers the pool fire area duration and heat release rate were determined using this model 2003 jet fires explosions and flash fires occurring on the topside of lng fpsos were analyzed considering different leakage hole sizes it can be concluded that even though the lng is safe enough under alarp criteria there is a need to select independent protection layers to meet a higher standard dan et al 2014 sun validated the cfd model of fire radiation by comparing the simulation results and experimental data followed by a hazard analysis of an lng satellite station the distance between dike walls and avv banks was suggested to be enlarged by the author 2014 hissong described the key factors used to model an lng spill on water the results from pool fires on land were compared with the results of pool fires on water 2007 using computational fluid dynamics cfd tools to model the consequences of fire accidents and conduct an analysis has been well validated by many studies and experiments dadashzadeh et al proposed an integrated approach for fire and explosion simulation flacs was used to simulate the evaporation and dispersion of flammable gas and delayed ignition while the fire dynamics simulator fds code was used to model the ignition of the rest of the fuel over the liquid pool 2013 baalisampang et al used the fds code to study fire occurring on a typical flng processing facility and its impact on personnel and assets in his study a water deluge system was applied to mitigate the impact of fire 2017 in another study conducted by baalisampang et al three credible scenarios were identified and the impact of fire on personnel and assets was determined by combining the fds code and probit method 2017 baalisampang et al also proposed a method to determine an inherently safe layout design and highlight the importance of improved layout design and passive control strategies 2016 in the study conducted by hansen et al 2007 flacs was used to develop a cfd model to validate the studies of lng vapour dispersion humidity and other effects were considered in this study to design a pool spread model phast was used by pitblado et al to predict the hazard zone caused by an accident or deliberate attack a range of credible scenarios was developed in this study 2005 berg et al identified an optimal safety design for an fpso by using a cfd model to quantify the overpressure an explosion can cause and also assessed the risk reduction measures using a quantitative method the effects of barrier walls separation gaps and other influencing factors were discussed in this study 2000 van hees listed many previous validation studies and also conducted several simulations to validate the fds model the results of these studies show good correspondence between fds simulation and experiment results 2013 binbin conducted a comparative analysis by fire simulation using fluent and fds and found that although fluent and cfx have more extensive simulation areas and other advantages in terms of meshing the result of fds has high consistency with measured results in some situations 2011 table 1 shows the main differences of fds fluent and cfx in this study the fire analysis is mainly based on the fds code a specialty cfd tool developed to study fire dynamics many previous studies have explored natural gas fire accidents baalisampang 2017a 2017b fay 2003 hansen et al 2007 hissong 2007 jin and jang 2015 luketa hanlin 2006 pitblado et al 2005 with focus on leakage parameters such as the leakage point leakage probability release rate and environmental parameters such as wind speed and direction however these studies ignore the impact of the location of the ignition source in this study the influence of the effect of the ignition source location is mainly considered the objective of this study is to present a rigorous procedure to study potential accident scenarios in an offshore floating processing facility with different ignition source locations and verify the effectiveness of safety measures based on the consequences of potential flng fire accident scenarios the scenarios with different ignition source locations are modeled using the fds code under the assumption that all the environmental factors are constants in the simulation another unique aspect of the present study is consideration of a fire s impact using areas of influence and temperature distribution safety measures firewalls and fire suppression systems are analyzed for their effectiveness in mitigating the effect of fire a limitation of this study is that it does not consider the transition from fire to explosion during simulation 2 the proposed methodology this study focuses on the simulation of fires caused by ignition sources located in different places on an flng and the verification of the effectiveness of safety measures it incorporates the release and dispersion modeling of an lng for the development of various credible scenarios and employs cfd simulations for each scenario to analyze the fire s impact on the flng to determine the most dangerous scenario this is followed by the implementation of safety measures such as a firewall and automatic fire suppression system to mitigate the fire s impact on human beings adjacent assets and structures fig 1 demonstrates the procedure of this study 2 1 step 1 scenario development when developing a credible scenario many parameters which could contribute to a fire must be considered such as miscellaneous parameters pressure temperature and humidity fuel parameters chemical and physical properties leak parameters rate location duration and direction wind parameters speed and direction and so on in order to study the impact of locations of ignition sources on safety measure design all the parameters except the location of the ignition source remain unchanged in all scenarios developed in this study the users of this approach may choose other parameters that are not limited to those used in this study 2 2 step 2 fuel release and dispersion analysis fire occurs when the concentration of gas fuel reaches the combustion limit crowl and louvar 2001 it is considered that the combustion limit of natural gas is 5 15 mokhatab et al 2013 the release and dispersion simulations are conducted using the fds model in this study to determine the distribution of the concentration of gas fuel so that the size of the fuel vapour cloud can be calculated to develop credible scenarios lng released from a tank can vaporize quickly due to the ambient temperature lng vaporization occurs in two ways johnson and cornwell 2007 1 heat transfer from the ambient temperature when no fuel is ignited 2 heat transfer from the fire occurring in the surrounding area when natural gas is ignited natural gas is a combustible hydrocarbon gas mixture formed primarily of methane ethane propane butane pentane and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide nitrogen hydrogen sulfide or helium hissong 2007 in fds lagrangian particles are used to represent objects that cannot be resolved on the numerical grid mcgrattan et al 2013a 2013b liquid droplets are the most common example in this study the liquid fuel is lng and needs to be represented by lagrangian particles a sprinkler is used to represent the fuel release from a hole in the tank in this study in this fds simulation a mixture of gas species such as air is simplified as a lumped species which is considered to transport and react together the transport equation for both lumped species and a single species utilized by fds is shown in equation 1 mcgrattan et al 2013a 1 ρ t ρ z α ρ z α u ρ d α z α m α m b α where ρ is the mass density t is the time u is the velocity vector z α is the mass fraction of lumped species α d α is the diffusivity of species α dα is the mass production rate per unit volume of species α by chemical reactions and m b α is the mass production rate per unit volume of species α by evaporating droplets particles 2 3 step 3 fire consequence analysis eliminating the existence of ignition sources can prevent a fire however there are many types of ignition sources that cannot be completely identified and eliminated crowl and louvar 2001 thus it is necessary to investigate how ignition sources would affect the potential consequences of flng fire accidents this study focuses on the impact of an ignition source s location on the consequences caused by fire all parameters except the location of the ignition source remain unchanged to find the most dangerous scenarios caused by different ignition sources location considering the results of the release and dispersion model various credible scenarios can be developed the fds code is used to conduct simulations of various credible scenarios fds is a computational fluid dynamics cfd model of fire driven fluid flow developed by the national institute of standards and technology nist fds has been validated by nist and also by a large number of studies and experiments mcgrattan et al 2000 rinne et al 2007 wen et al 2007 to decrease the computational cost most combustion models in fds use a single step the mixing controlled infinitely fast chemical reaction of lumped species each reaction using a simple chemistry model is assumed to be of the form as in equation 2 mcgrattan et al 2013a 2013b 2 c x h z o z n v v o 2 o 2 v c o c o 2 v h 2 o h 2 o v c o c o v s s o o t v n 2 n 2 temperature and the concentration of fuel gas caused by the leakage and combustion in various scenarios are extracted from the simulation to conduct a detailed fire analysis the thermal radiation model used in fds is defined by equations 3 and 4 mcgrattan et al 2013a 3 q r q r x k x u x 4 π i b x 4 u x 4 π i x s d s where k x is the absorption coefficient i b x is the source term i x s is the solution of the radiation transport equation rte for a non scattering gray gas and is explained in equation 5 5 s i x s k x i b x i x s to validate the fds code a set of simulations with known conditions reported in the literature was conducted the results obtained were compared with the results reported in the literature they showed a good agreement this partially validates the fds code according to the previous studies baalisampang 2017a 2017b milke 2016 at 538 c the yield strength of steel will be reduced to approximately 60 of its normal value which does not have the ability to support the steel structure s function according to the american institute for steel construction aisc 1978 in this study a temperature higher than 538 c is defined as dangerous while the area that the dangerous temperature caused by a fire can reach is defined as the dangerous zone in the current study the fire s impact on adjacent assets and structures is evaluated through these aspects the maximum temperature the fire can cause the duration of the dangerous temperature and the size of the dangerous zone 2 4 step 4 safety measure design and effectiveness analysis considering the serious impact of fire on adjacent assets and structures some safety measures including active and passive measures are used to mitigate this impact apart from applying active safer designs passive measures including protective equipment cannot be ignored due to the chemical properties of flammable hydrogen the term passive measures refers to designs that could mitigate the impact of accidents among these safety measures firewalls water deluge systems and carbon dioxide fire suppression systems are considered effective methods to mitigate the impact of fire in this section the simulations are conducted using the fds code after applying safety measures three evaluation aspects are used to analyze the impact of fire the maximum temperature the fire can cause the duration of the dangerous temperature and the size of the dangerous zone the results from the fds simulation are used to compare with the results from the simulation without applying any safety measure to study the effect that safety measures would have on the fire 2 4 1 firewall in traditional onshore chemical plants each module is separately located at an adequate distance however in offshore facilities due to their compact layouts firewalls are typically used to implement segregation stouffer et al 2011 in this study the firewall is installed around the leakage tank to prevent the spread of fuel and fire 2 4 2 fire suppression system an auto fire suppression system is an effective way to provide protection against fire in the current study in order to effectively mitigate the impact of fire on adjacent assets and structures a carbon dioxide fire suppression system as well as a water deluge system are installed on an flng facility a carbon dioxide fire suppression system is also a reliable way to mitigate the impact of fire carbon dioxide is a colourless odourless electrically non conductive and easily available gas that is highly efficient as a fire suppression agent while a water spray could reduce the temperature by water evaporation carbon dioxide can be used to reduce the flammable gas concentration and thus smother fires this method to extinguish a fire is called clean agent fire suppression by the national fire protection association 2001 in this study the carbon dioxide fire suppression system is installed according to the national fire protection association 2001 3 application of the methodology 3 1 step 1 scenario development the geometry of the target offshore structure is an flng processing facility shown in fig 2 the information for the target offshore structure is extracted from a typical flng processing facility the target structure model is comprised of a life module central control room and helicopter deck process and utility modules hull and ship systems a turret and fluid transmission control rotary joint and mooring and riser systems among them the process unit is considered one of the most hazardous areas and needs more attention xin et al 2015 in this study liquid fuel is assumed to be released from a tank in the process and utility modules considering its higher risk the simulation volume is set as 72 m 80 m 36 m and the grid cell is 0 5 m 0 5 m 0 5 m the total number of grid cells in each scenario is 1658880 fig 3 shows the simulation area in the target structure according to ichard et al a finer as well as a coarse grid cell have been used in sensitivity studies to guarantee that the grid solution is independent of the cell size 2010 a coarse mesh with 964800 cells and a fine mesh with 1878750 cells were selected fig 4 shows good correspondence between the simulation results of temperature changes over time in certain slice files with different meshes the simulation period of 60s is considered for each scenario higher simulation duration may be considered however in the present study simulation results did not make much difference therefore this scenario is restricted to a first minute simulation in the current study the ambient pressure is set to be atmospheric pressure and the ambient temperature is set to be 5 c considering cold region operating conditions wind speed is assumed to be 3 m s and the wind comes from the x axis while the atmospheric stability class is d which is a credible scenario according to pitblado et al 2005 for release factors the leakage point is assumed to be on the tank in the process and utility modules lng is released at the speed of 10 m s due to the inner pressure of the tank and considering the high wind zone offshore according to pitblado et al s study the maximum credible hole caused by accidental operational events is 750 mm 2005 the release rate of lng can be calculated using 10 m s and 750 mm as the release velocity and hole size instead of treating release as instantaneous or at a constant rate as in most studies the release rate in this study is treated as a time varying value the release starts at 0s gradually reaches the specified rate at 3 s and then remains constant from 57s the release rate decreases gradually and finally stops 3 2 step 2 release and dispersion simulation in the dispersion simulation the ambient pressure is set to be atmospheric pressure and the ambient temperature is set to be 5 c considering cold region operating conditions the wind speed is 3 m s and the wind comes from the x axis ten planes are selected and evenly distributed on an x axis to show the concentration of gas fuel based on the results of the simulation lng vaporizes quickly after release from the tank due to conditions in the surrounding environment with wind action natural gas disperses quickly and in approximately 20 s natural gas covers most of the entire simulation area in an actual offshore operation the release rate and leakage point may change and environmental factors such as wind speed and temperature might cause natural gas to vaporize and disperse at an even higher speed fig 5 shows an example of the results using the fds code 3 3 step 3 fire simulation and analysis the area where the concentration of gas fuel reaches the flammable limit is selected as a credible fire scenario based on the results of the release and dispersion simulation a total of fourteen different accident scenarios with different locations of the ignition source in the process and utilities module are developed in this study while only one scenario is developed on the second deck because of the low likelihood that the gas fuel can disperse to the second deck 13 ignition locations are evenly developed throughout the first deck the fds code is used to conduct a fire simulation for each scenario table 2 describes the 14 credible scenarios with different locations fig 6 shows the location of the ignition source in this section the fds code is used to conduct fire simulation for 14 credible scenarios in order to obtain precise data at a specific point in the simulation 66 thermocouples are set in the target structure these 66 thermocouples are distributed evenly over the target structure and can record the temperature of the monitoring points changing over time fig 7 indicates the location of 66 thermocouples additionally 10 slices are selected and placed evenly on an x axis to show the concentration of gas fuel and temperature change over time in smokeview fig 8 indicates the location of 10 slices in scenario 2 with the wind action the fuel gas disperses rapidly and is exposed to the ignition source at about 21s the vapour gas is ignited when the fuel gas reaches the flammable limit and the temperature reaches the ignition temperature due to the existence of confined geometry around the ignition source in scenario 2 the fire occurs and the temperature rises rapidly after the fuel vapour is ignited the flame rapidly returns to the leakage point and ignites all the fuel released from the vessel the spill fire then forms until the leak stops in this scenario the longest time of all 14 scenarios is needed to ignite the vapour cloud so the flame has the shortest duration and the period of the damage to the adjacent assets and structure is short however the highest maximum temperature of all 14 scenarios is found in scenario 2 which will be analyzed in detail in the next section fig 9 shows the contours of the fire change over time for scenario 2 in smokeview six monitoring points are selected as examples of temperature change over time for scenario 2 as shown in fig 10 note that for most monitoring points the temperature reaches a peak after 30s indicating a very high rate of temperature rise giving less time for safe mustering fig 11 shows the maximum temperature that fire could cause in each scenario according to the result scenario 2 has the highest temperature while scenario 6 has the lowest apparently the highest temperatures of scenarios 3 6 9 and 14 have different degrees of reduction which indicates that due to the existence of some structures between the location of the ignition source and the leakage point the gas fuel may not spread far and thus the fire will not cause as serious a result as others within the simulation period as shown in fig 12 some thermocouples are selected in scenario 11 to indicate the difference between 538 c and the temperature recorded at some monitoring points this is highlighted in fig 12 which shows the period of dangerous temperature rise the duration of the dangerous temperature caused by a fire is monitored by measuring points and plotted in fig 11 analysis of the results of all credible scenarios shows that scenario 11 has the maximum time duration of a dangerous temperature while scenario 6 has the minimal time duration of a dangerous temperature it can be concluded that due to the close distance and a scarcity of other structures between the location of the ignition source and the leakage point in scenario 11 fire could occur more easily than in other scenarios so a fire caused by a close ignition source could last for a long time the size of the dangerous zone can be shown using a slice file that is perpendicular to the z axis fig 13 shows the slice file of the temperature in scenario 13 of all credible scenarios scenario 2 can cause the largest dangerous zone a long period before ignition gives gas fuel the opportunity to disperse further which leads to it being the largest dangerous zone for the leakage occurring in a specific tank the location of the ignition source affects the result of the fire to sum up based on the fire analysis of all credible scenarios in this case considering the aforementioned three aspects that measure the impact of fire scenarios 2 11 and 13 are considered the three most dangerous scenarios overall in terms of thermal effect considering the confined layout of an flng transition from fire to explosion may possibly occur in this study flacs a cfd software used extensively for explosion modeling was used to simulate a possible explosion occurring under the same conditions since this study mainly focuses on the fire s effect on an offshore facility the explosion simulation result is presented briefly the ignition location is selected based on the release and dispersion simulation results achieved through flacs fig 14 shows the pressure caused by explosion changing over time in the flacs simulation according to the results ignition occurred at about 30s overpressure caused by the explosion is not high enough to cause damage to assets in this case and thus thermal radiation is considered to be the main impact in this study 3 4 step 4 fire suppression simulation and analysis in this section a firewall and an auto fire suppression system are installed in the flng facility and then a cfd simulation is conducted with the same parameters as are used in the previous sections the deluge system is simulated using the fds code with lagrangian particles sprinkler heads with a 12 m 2 coverage area are installed and the distance between the sprinkler heads is set to be 4 5 m according to the nfpa 13 standard 2013 when the sprinkler heads are exposed to fire and the temperature around them reaches 60 c they will be activated automatically baalisampang 2017b fig 15 shows the maximum temperature at which the fire can reach the target structure in the absence of any safety measures and the maximum temperature at which the fire can reach the target structure under the protection of a firewall and fire suppression system in the three most dangerous scenarios obviously due to the existence of a firewall and fire suppression system the maximum temperature of all scenarios is decreased in varying degrees in scenario 2 the firewall is very helpful because it can prevent the spreading of fuel and the fire since scenario 2 has the longest distance from the leakage point to the ignition source preventing the spreading of fuel can highly decrease the opportunity for natural gas to meet the ignition source and thus highly decrease the impact of a fire however in the other two scenarios the fire suppression system plays a more vital role in mitigating the effects of the fire in terms of maximum temperature the fire can cause in scenarios 11 and 13 the distances between the leakage points and ignition sources are very short so the natural gas is still very likely to meet the ignition sources in spite of the existence of a firewall therefore the fire suppression system can be a more effective way to mitigate the impact of fire in this case in figs 16 and 17 4 monitoring points are selected to show the temperature changes over time in scenarios 2 and 13 in each scenario the figures show the results both before and after the application of safety measures in this section the dangerous temperature line is set to show the difference between the dangerous temperature and the temperature caused by fire the part that exceeds the dangerous temperature has been highlighted in the figures thus the duration of a dangerous temperature can be explicitly demonstrated according to the results shown in figs 16 and 17 both the firewall and the fire suppression system can effectively mitigate the impact of fire to varying degrees in terms of the duration of a dangerous temperature for scenario 2 the firewall plays a more vital role than the fire suppression system compared to the scenario without applying safety measures it is obvious that in scenario 2 ignition is delayed at some specific monitoring points such as points 13 and 39 due to the existence of a firewall for scenario 13 the firewall is ineffective to delay ignition because of the short distance between the leakage point and ignition source however the flng avoids a more serious impact of fire with the help of the fire suppression system in figs 18 and 19 slice files are used to show the temperature of the cross section perpendicular to the z axis and the slice plane and the largest size of the dangerous zone is recorded in each scenario in scenario 2 the firewall is not very useful to prevent the spreading of fire but it effectively reduces the high temperature the insignificant opportunity for natural gas to meet the ignition gas contributes to this result a small amount of natural gas meeting an ignition source brings a comparatively low temperature but the firewall cannot effectively reduce the size of a fire when the fire has already started in scenario 13 due to the existence of a firewall the spread of fuel gas and flames is highly suppressed therefore the high temperature mainly concentrates within the firewall and for this reason the dangerous zone can be reduced however the area within the firewall has a comparatively higher temperature although a fire suppression system cannot influence the spread of fuel gas and flames it can reduce the size of a dangerous zone by reducing the overall temperature in the flng the results in this section further demonstrate that for different scenarios the effectiveness of the safety measure varies in summary both firewalls and auto fire suppression systems can effectively mitigate the impact of fire in terms of the maximum temperature the fire can cause the duration of the dangerous temperature and the size of the dangerous zone however for different scenarios these two safety measures have different effectiveness for a scenario in which the ignition source is far from the leakage point the firewall can effectively prevent the spread of natural gas and thus reduce its opportunity to meet the ignition source for a scenario in which the ignition source is close to the leakage point such as in scenarios 11 and 13 the firewall cannot delay the occurrence of fire but it can limit most of the fire to inside the firewall and thus effectively reduce the size of the dangerous area however introducing a firewall will increase the confinement of the flng layout this may increase the chance of explosion an auto fire suppression system can reduce the flammable gas concentration and reduce the heat through vaporization and thus effectively mitigate the impact of a fire 4 conclusions this paper proposes a procedure for analyzing the effectiveness of safety measures in reducing the impact of fire caused by an lng release in an flng facility considering the impact of ignition source location the fire simulations are conducted for credible scenarios with different ignition source locations and the results extracted to determine the most dangerous scenarios in this study three aspects are considered to model the impact of accident scenarios they are the maximum temperature the fire can cause the duration of the dangerous temperature and the size of the dangerous zone the results of the study confirm that the release of lng is a serious threat to personnel on board and the assets the relatively small differences in ignition source locations can increase the effect of the consequences of a fire to mitigate the impact of fire a firewall and fire suppression system are selected and implemented fds is used as a tool to analyze the impact of each scenario with different ignition source locations after applying safety measures comparing the results before and after applying safety measures it can be concluded that safety measures such as firewalls and auto fire suppression help to limit the impact of fire however the threat still remains significant using the proper layout to isolate the danger is identified as most effective in terms of limiting the impact of potential accidents this study emphasizes that a flng layout must be considered with the utmost care this step is the most effective measure in limiting a potential lng release and subsequent dispersion effect and directly influences the fire dynamics and thus limits the potential damage the scope of this study is limited to fire safety analysis through a numerical simulation approach the transition from fire to explosion will be studied in future work the proposed approach will be further validated through control experiment field data reported in the literature 
23428,subsea communication and power cables are critical infrastructure whose protection is paramount especially on the continental shelf where fishing and ships anchors cause 70 of cable faults protection is often afforded by cable burial and this paper deals mainly with physical seabed recovery from that process varied sedimentary environments and different modes of cable burial mean that recovery is site specific repeated seabed surveys show restoration is fastest where cables are buried by ploughing in zones of high sediment supply and energetic waves currents such as on the inner to middle continental shelf 0 80 m water depth wd there recovery can take weeks to 1 2yr as sediment supply and wave current activity reduce offshore recovery from ploughing on the outer shelf 80 130 m wd is typically longer than in shallower depths recovery from water jetted trenching which can be more disturbing than ploughing can take 5yr on the upper continental slope 130 2000m wd trenches infill after 8yr where sediment supply is high but 15yr where supply is low surveys also suggest that benthic communities recover at rates similar to physical restoration with few exceptions the

assessments eia to be undertaken for offshore activities including the deployment and maintenance of cables an eia typically involves a synopsis of relevant environmental information but may also outline the need for new information repeated cable surveys have been requested to ascertain any changes in the seabed after cable burial e g carter et al 2009 sherwood et al 2016 these surveys are enlightening as they provide time series that address the main point of this paper how long does it take for the seabed to recover from protective burial of cables to address that question we present new unpublished data from repeated surveys of subsea cables fig 1 together with information gleaned from open file reports and the peer reviewed literature the focus is on physical change and recovery in predominantly terrigenous sediments however the response of benthic biota associated with those sediments is also briefly discussed using published studies that deal specifically with cables 2 cable installation and burial prior to installation marine surveys involving some combination of multibeam mapping side scan sonar sub bottom profiling seabed sampling and in situ testing of seabed

wide assemblies mounted on skids wheels or caterpillar tracks and are towed by a cable laying ship a basic unit uses a plough blade however more advanced systems have also been developed some ploughs incorporate water jets to allow deeper penetration while others have rock penetrating teeth attached to the leading edge of the plough to cut through consolidated sediment or rock meanwhile vibrating blades have been added to ploughs to better penetrate difficult substrates such as chalk and gravel or environmentally sensitive areas for example salt marshes berr 2008 kober et al 2000 linders et al 2003 as a plough traverses the seabed it excavates a narrow furrow into which the cable is placed gooding et al 2012 pyrah 2010 worzyk 2009 the excavated sediment is then allowed to fall back and fill the furrow berr 2008 kober et al 2000 typically a plough blade disturbs a swath of seabed 1 m wide and can extend down to 3 m sd however the precise extent of disturbed seabed depends on plough size

likely to range between 2 and 8 m width carter et al 2009 2 2 jetting jetting is the preferred method when i previously laid cables require reburial such as when they are exposed on the seabed

whereas broad ill defined v shaped profiles are typical of non cohesive deposits jetting also suspends sediment that may escape from the trench leaving it partly filled coarse sand and gravel ejected by jetting usually settles along trench margins to form berms meanwhile observational and modelling studies have found that fine sand commonly deposits within 100 m of the trench whereas suspended mud may disperse up to 2 km away gooding et al 2012 compared to ploughing the effects of jetting can be more widely felt berr 2008 2 3 mechanical trenchers for rocky substrates a tracked vehicle equipped with a mechanical chain excavator or rock wheel cutters may be used to excavate a trench berr 2008 gooding et al 2012 these cutters make incisions down to 1 5 m sd whereas chain excavators go to 3 m sd and deeper a trench is usually 1 m wide and can have a berm of rock sediment cuttings because mechanical trenchers are slow costly and damaging to the benthos laying cables in rocky areas is avoided when possible if the crossing of terrigenous rocky substrates is unavoidable one solution is to encase the cable in protective iron pipes that are laid on the seabed e g sherwood et al 2016 2

recovery case studies 4 1 nearshore zone 4 1 1 c cable norderney germany in 1997 a c cable was buried across salt marshes on the german island of norderney using a vibrating plough constructed specifically for mud flat operations the plough had 1 5 m wide tracks designed to exert minimal pressure on ground and hence minimise disturbance to the marsh ecosystem linders et al 2003 the area affected by the burial was divided into monitoring plots where the recovery of saltmarsh species such as puccinellia maritima and halimione portulacoides were analysed annually for 5yr and compared to control sites unaffected by burial most sections recovered to a pre burial condition after 5yr with some sites recovering within 2yr sites that were not fully restored after 5yr still showed significant revegetation whose rates suggested a return to original conditions in another 1 2yr linders et al 2003 4 1 2 seagrass meadows puget sound us austin et al 2004 assessed the effects of various cable installation methods including trenching directional drilling reusing existing conduits and surface laying on seagrass meadows in this instance zostera marina in puget sound washington state the study was prompted by the ecological value of the meadows as a habitat and spawning ground for marine organisms diver surveys of 19 sites showed directional drilling and surface laying were least disruptive in contrast trenching damaged meadows resulting in i loss of connectivity with other parts of the meadow and ii exposure of anoxic sediment unsuitable for z marina regrowth one trench site was monitored on an approximately annual basis between 1994 and 2001 mitigation measures were introduced in 1996 and 1997 and involved mixing beach sand with the anoxic sediment followed by z

was later used to refill the trench once the cable was laid benthic fauna and flora were surveyed in 2001 and immediately after the trench was infilled in march 2003 although this did not mark the end of disturbance because a fibre optic cable associated with the power component needed replacement subsequent resurveys were carried out in 2004 comparison of the before after information together with reference to control sites unaffected by burial operations revealed the following apart from localised increased mud contents at the most shoreward part of the infilled trench that were attributed to trenching the composition of surface sediments was unaffected dong energy 2006 seagrass living close to the trench declined immediately after trenching but recovered into late 2003 2004 when shoot and rhizome biomass increased more at the trench than at the control sites dong energy 2006 mud snails hydrobia sp were the most affected benthic animals but within 1yr their abundance increased albeit at a lesser rate than at the control sites overall birklund 2005 and dong energy 2006 conclude that the direct and indirect impacts of cable installation on benthic flora and fauna were limited both spatially and temporally 4 2 2 basslink p cable australia the 250 km long basslink p cable is a 400kv system that connects the australian states of victoria and tasmania across the inner to middle continental shelf of bass strait sherwood et al 2016 most of the cable route is situated around 80 m wd and the cable was buried by jet trenching to 0 5 1 5 m sd for 95 of its length at the coast the cable comes ashore via horizontal directionally drilled conduits however the presence of a 500 m wide zone of basaltic rocky reef with patches of gravel near the tasmanian landing also required the cable to be encased in protective half shell horizontally sliced iron pipes laid across the reef cable installation commenced in may 2004 and was completed by november 2005 seabed characteristics were determined before and during construction but apart from existing information epibenthic communities were not surveyed before installation seabed recovery in 20 m wd was monitored via video footage obtained by divers at each of two sites off victoria and tasmania repeat surveys were carried out off victoria 2005 2006 and tasmania 2006 2007 and 2008 for deeper parts of bass strait 32 72 m wd towed video transects were run at 6 stations comprising 12 transects per station only one deep water survey was run and this was 2 3 months after cable installation in addition the magnetic field associated with the cable was measured and was found to reduce to natural background levels within 20 m of the cable off victoria in 15 m wd the trench containing the cable filled with sand and became indistinguishable from the natural seabed within 1yr sherwood et al 2016 ascribe this rapid burial to strong tide dominant currents up to 1 2 m s 1 reinforced by storms plus a substantial longshore sediment drift of 100 000 m3 y 1 porter smith et al 2004 low animal numbers prevented a statistical appraisal of the epibiota however off the rocky tasmanian coast the protective iron pipes became encrusted by an epifauna similar to that inhabiting the natural reef within 3 5yr for deeper parts of the route down to 80 m wd it took 2yr for the trench containing the cable to fill completely with sediment leaving no visible evidence of the cable or trench this change occurred over one third of the route elsewhere the trench was still evident and was seen to contain biological material that had drifted into the depression this debris provided surfaces for the colonisation of epibiota however judging by the dearth of epibiota when the trench was fully infilled with mainly terrigenous sediment it is reasonable to assume that the epibiota occupying partly filled sections of trench is a temporary feature sherwood et al 2016 4 2 3 southern cross segment d c cable california segment d of the

2005 2010 and 2015 as part of the permit conditions to lay the cable the rov was equipped with a bathymetric profiler and a calibrated tss 350 sensing system this system detects the position of the buried cable by a low frequency tone sent down the cable from the shore terminal searle et al 2014 the rov s position was determined relative to a transponder and this method was subject to calibration and repeatability trials sediment thickness data showed that most of the cable remained buried at 0 4 1 5 m sd for over 15 years the only exceptions were a few areas of shallow 0 5 m burial where i one c cable crossed another and ii where the seabed was rocky global marine systems ltd 2015 overall just 0 3 of the cable was exposed along the full 95 km long shelf slope section burial cover thickness also changed with time on the inner shelf the sediment cover locally thinned by up to 0 7 m compared to the middle shelf where the cover locally thickened by 0 3 m burial thicknesses on the outer shelf were larger in 2015 compared to 2000 but not as large as those recorded in 2002 2005 and 2010 effects on the resident biota were not determined but detailed assays from other cables on the california csus provide relevant data see section 5 3 also kogan et al 2006 kuhnz et al 2015 4 2 4 monterey accelerated research system mars c p cable california us the 51 km long

cable that was deployed using horizontal directional drilling from shore to 19 m wd seaward of which ploughing was undertaken jet trenching was used on the upper slope approaching the science node following a post lay inspection in year 2007 the cable was resurveyed in 2007 2008 2010 and 2014 2015 in 115 m wd the cable has remained buried in sand and sandy mud 0 6 1 0 m sd with little or no detectable effect on seabed morphology grain size on the shelf varies widely but cannot be attributed to burial operations kuhnz et al 2015 overall there was little effect on the abundance and distribution of the benthic macro and mega fauna observed within 0 100 m of the cable some variability in the abundance of some taxa was recorded but kuhnz et al 2015 conclude that this was due more to sampling methods or natural variability rather than cable installation similar conclusions were reached by kogan et al 2006 who assessed effects of the surface laid acoustic thermometry of ocean

hibernia b c cable runs along the northern edge of stellwagen bank national marine sanctuary at 20 130 m wd grannis 2005 the bank top at 20 55 m wd is mantled with sand and gravel whereas adjacent basins contain mud in september 2000 the cable was buried 0 5 0 75 m sd in mainly sand using a water jet equipped plough the plough s footprint including trench and traction mechanism was up to 5 m wide the cable traversed an area open to trawl fishing and another closed to fishing at the time of survey in august 2001 the trench was still visible but in the non fishing zone there were no detectable differences in the composition and abundance of the epifauna on and off the cable route grannis 2005 in other words the epifauna had recovered within 1yr in contrast the trench in the fishing zone supported a more abundant epifauna compared to outside the trench this was attributed to exposure of consolidated sediment during trenching and by disturbance due to trawling after 5yr the trench was still visible confirming the low sediment supply to the seabed national marine sanctuary program 2007 4 2 6 swepol p cable sweden to poland the swepol p cable extends 254 km across the

other half served as control sites and were located from 185 to 1852m horizontally from the route comparison of video and photographic surveys made before 1999 and after 2000 cable burial showed the seabed had returned to its natural physical state i e within 1yr of installation measurements of the cable s magnetic field showed it declined rapidly to natural levels within 20 m of the cable furthermore analysis of the macrozoobenthos revealed no changes in benthic species composition biomass or abundance this implies that the benthos had also returned to pre burial conditions 4 2 7

the hibernia network there strong tidal flows dominate the shelf circulation accordingly sediments are mobile sand ribbons and sand waves such bedforms indicate near bottom current speeds of 0 6 1 3 m

southern cross segment d c cable california the uppermost continental slope section of the southern cross route down to 980 m wd consists mainly of unconsolidated sandy silt interspersed with small

topography that extends to 1850m wd the end of the repeat survey lines at 1050 m wd the seabed was firmer with increased rock outcrops and patches of coarse gravel there the cable was placed in a jetted trench that over the past 15yr has infilled to cover most of the cable fig 5 overall 99 5 of the cable along the surveyed route has remained buried however exposed sections of cable are found on rocky ridges and in some sections of the trench global marine systems ltd 2015 4 3 2 monterey accelerated research system mars c p cable california between 116 and 453 m wd a 6 9 km long section of the mars cable was not buried due to the presence of rocky substrates kuhnz et al 2015 by 2015 some tracts of the cable remained exposed but were interspersed by buried sections possibly due to relaxed cable tension and subsequent sinking into the mud seaward of 435 m wd the cable was buried by jetting downslope to the science node located at 890 m wd at the time of the installation in 2007 the trench was partly sediment filled but has since become 90 100 full the mean grain size of continental slope sediments was not significantly different between control and burial sites suggesting that any variability was likely to reflect natural causes rather than burial operations similarly natural variability was also deemed to have a greater effect on the macrofaunal assemblages rather than the mars cable kuhnz et al 2015 4 3 3 pacific crossing 1 c cable washington state on the outer continental shelf and upper slope 100 300 m wd off washington state the pacific crossing 1 c cable between japan and the usa was subject to a pre lay survey followed by three post lay surveys the cable was originally buried in 1999 2000 by ploughing and jetting however in some sectors cable burial was either too shallow or incomplete a condition attributed to zones of rocky seabed and elevated cable tension noaa 2005 a new route was devised and the cable was re laid to improve burial weiner and davis 2008 surveys prior to the cable being relaid found that after 4yr the trench and associated berms were visible in areas of coarse grained sediment or consolidated substrate trench berms contained gravelly debris which partially resulted from currents winnowing out fine sand and mud from the berm some of this finer sediment accumulated in the trench noaa 2005 in the case of the mud dominant seabed plough marks were visible 0 5yr after burial but disappeared after 4yr benthic communities recovered most readily in areas of poorly consolidated mud and sand where the trench incised consolidated seabed deposits faunal differences were evident where mud partly filled the trench and where coarse berm deposits provided substrates for an epibenthos noaa 2005 5 discussion rates of recovery presented here table 1 are influenced by the timing of the surveys which were run mainly on annual to multi annual time scales consequently the surveys may not capture single or multiple events such as storms which could be the sole or dominant cause of recovery and which can occur at sub annual frequencies e g carter and lewis 1995 hill et al 2007 survey schedules aside rates of physical recovery from burial basically reflect i sediment supply to the csus and ii the competency of waves and currents to erode transport and deposit that sediment although these factors vary widely in response to continental margin morphology geology tectonics biology oceanography climate and weather e g nittrouer et al 2007 the recovery case studies presented in this paper can be discussed broadly with reference to margins subject to i high or low inputs of fluvial sediment and ii energetic or weak wave current regimes with exception of the two semi sheltered nearshore case studies the remaining studies involve exposed ocean sites where wave current energy can be simply expressed as a function of csus water depth 5 1 inner to outer shelf recovery the california margin along which the mars and southern cross segment d cables are situated receives substantial volumes of sediment delivered by small rivers draining high yielding catchments inman and jenkins 1999 milliman and syvitski 1992 thanks to a suite of regional studies the physical processes likely to affect recovery from burial are well established e g cacchione et al 2009 edwards 2002 nittrouer et al 2007 sommerfield et al 2007 the inner shelf off california is a dynamic zone where waves and currents suspend the mud dominant river discharge and transport it as turbid plumes along and across the shelf fig 2 in essence mud largely bypasses the inner shelf leaving a seaward thinning wedge of sand in its wake edwards 2002 under fair weather conditions wave stirring and current transport are likely to extend to 15 m wd davis jr 1983 nichols 2009 however this process is magnified during storms when strengthened wave activity can resuspend mud down to 50 m wd or deeper these disturbances occur several times a year on the californian shelf and elsewhere e g hill et al 2007 in such a dynamic regime burial disturbance is likely to be short lived inner shelves receiving limited amounts of fluvial sediment swepol baltic sea basslink bass strait nysted north sea are also subject to storms that will rework existing shelf sediments as well as introducing sediment transported elsewhere from the shelf via for example longshore drift e g sherwood et al 2016 thus it is unsurprising that recovery from burial is swift with a return to a natural substrate within 1 2yr andrulewicz et al 2003 sherwood et al 2016 van der veer and bergman 1985 mud that bypasses the inner shelf accumulates on the middle to outer shelf and onto the continental slope deposition on the californian mid shelf is highest near rivers and declines northward along the shelf under the influence of ocean and storm forced currents fig 3 edwards 2002 again rain storms are a prominent driver with a single flood event depositing between 1 and 7 cm sediment nittrouer et al 2007 overall the mid shelf favours burial and recovery because i muddy sediments are conducive to ploughing which is usually the least disruptive burial technique ii it is a zone of rapid sediment deposition and iii currents are capable of smoothing plough marks especially when reinforced by storms fig 2 certainly the depth of burial surveys of the mars and southern cross cables show static to increased burial depth over periods of 8 15yr and little visual evidence of ploughing especially in areas of mobile sand global marine systems ltd 2015 kuhnz et al 2015 recovery rates on the mid shelf in areas of low sediment supply vary considerably off stellwagen bank recovery has been slow with the trench still visible after 5yr grannis 2005 national marine sanctuary program 2007 this situation results from a low sediment deposition on the bank tops that is reflected by a cover of mainly relict gravel sand however supply may be higher in the nearby troughs as suggested by the core data of crusius et al 2004 who record approximate maximum sedimentation rates of 0 3 cm yr 1 for trough muds south of the cable in contrast to stellwagen bank one third of the trench on the bass strait mid shelf returned to its natural state in 2yr with the remaining two thirds of the trench in various stages of infill porter smith et al 2004 sherwood et al 2016 recovery was fastest for the kelvin hibernia segment b cable in the northern irish sea diurnal tidal flows are sufficiently powerful to transport sand on a daily basis thus the seabed returned to its natural state within 14 days of burial fig 4 recently deposited muds can extend over the outer shelf off high discharge rivers fig 3 however where the fluvial input is low the mud blanket is often thin and patchy exposing older sand gravel consolidated sediment and rock this is especially the case at the shelf break where the near flat shelf steepens onto the continental slope fig 2 there topographic intensification of currents possibly aided by breaking internal waves and infrequent large storms create a hydrodynamic setting less favourable for mud deposition nichols 2009 prothero and schwab 2014 such variable seabed conditions do not favour cable burial as evinced by the experience of pacific crossing 1 noaa 2005 generally rocky substrates inhibit burial necessitating surface laying where trenching is possible recovery depends upon depositional rates of suspended load and bed load see section 5 2 5 2 upper slope recovery the hydrodynamic regime at the shelf break fig 2 weakens with depth to allow fine suspended mud particles to accumulate depending upon the amount of mud accumulating on the slope underlying deposits of older coarse sediment or rock will be exposed to varying degrees as is observed on the californian slope global marine systems ltd 2015 kuhnz et al 2015 upper slopes are often incised by submarine canyons which act as conduits to the deep ocean this is especially the case off tectonically active margins where earthquakes storms and other triggers remobilise sediment to form landslides and turbidity currents that pass down canyon onto the abyssal floor breaking cables en route e g carter et al 2014 cattaneo et al 2012 for that reason canyons should be avoided where possible muddy sediment escaping the continental shelf will also accumulate between canyons and potentially favour trench recovery for mars the trenched slope section north of monterey canyon has been infilling with sediment since 2007 by 2015 it was 90 100 full kuhnz et al 2015 a reflection of the locally high input of fluvial mud in contrast the southern cross trench which is more distant from direct river sources is infilling more slowly with sections of the trench still visible after 15yr fig 5 however it should be noted that even intercanyon areas can be subject to seismically triggered landslides with the potential to expose or even remove sections of buried cable in the case of weakly seismic margins buried or surface laid cables are less exposed to submarine landslides and turbidity currents but damaging events do occur albeit rarely in 1929 the magnitude 7 2 grand banks earthquake offshore newfoundland generated landslides and a powerful turbidity current that collectively broke 12 submarine telegraph cables in 28 places in water depths down to at least 5300 m heezen and ewing 1952 5 3 biological responses to cable burial restoration in the nearshore zone as recorded in a salt marsh and a seagrass meadow depends upon the time it takes for the vegetation to recover austin et al 2004 linders et al 2003 in both case studies recovery was within 4 7yr with some salt marsh vegetation returning after 2yr however it is important to note that biological recovery can be species dependent growth of the seagrass z marina is much faster than that of posidonia oceanica which in the mediterranean sea may not fully recover within human time scales telesca et al 2015 in other studies involving the nearshore zone very little damage occurred as the zone was bypassed using horizontal directional drilling e g kuhnz et al 2015 sherwood et al 2016 offshore biological surveys have focussed mainly on invertebrate faunas living in and on the seabed a basic question is whether the fauna responds to the physical presence of the cable and or to seabed disturbed by burial any direct effect of a c cable on marine organisms can be assessed from surface laid cables i e unaffected by burial a survey of the surface laid atoc coaxial c cable by kogan et al 2006 found no statistical difference in the abundance and distribution of a largely invertebrate fauna located within 1 m and 100 m of the cable kuhnz et al 2015 came to a similar conclusion for exposed sections of the mars c p cable fig 3 however surface laid cables can provide hard substrates that support an epifauna in an otherwise epifauna poor muddy sandy seabed kogan et al 2006 cables also provide substrates when exposed in trenches grannis 2005 but this condition can be temporary as the epifauna is lost when sediment completely fills the trench sherwood et al 2016 biological recovery appears related to physical recovery judging by the studies of andrulewicz et al 2003 kuhnz et al 2015 and sherwood et al 2016 thus inner shelf invertebrates return to natural levels within 1 year after burial operations full recovery is usually longer on the middle shelf ranging from 1 to 2yr depending on sediment supply and wave current action the picture becomes complex on the outer shelf and upper slope there i incomplete burial of the cable ii exposure of consolidated sediment in trenches and associated berms and iii the capture of biological drift material all provide substrates to support epibiota kogan et al 2006 grannis 2005 noaa 2005 sherwood et al 2016 even so an epibiotic presence is limited by the time it takes to fill a jetted trench with terrigenous sediment as suggested by the results of kuhnz et al 2015 and sherwood et al 2016 it is also worth noting that biological reworking or bioturbation of sediments may contribute to the natural restoration of the seabed rose and kuehl 2010 for example demonstrated that continental shelves including those with strong physical signals such as storms and large fluvial discharges have their middle to outer reaches dominated by bioturbation that largely removes evidence of previous flood and storm activity the effect of sediment plumes generated by cable burial on the resident biota also depends upon several variables these include i the mode of burial with jetting likely to produce more suspended sediment than ploughing ii sediment type with mud producing longer lived plumes compared to sand and gravel iii rate of plume dispersal by waves and currents and iv the response of the biota to increased turbidity e g gooding et al 2012 meiβner et al 2006 as a generalisation when mainly sandy deposits of the inner shelf are ploughed the resultant plume is short lived because of the coarse sediment grain size which will encourage rapid deposition close 100 m to the trench swanson et al 2006 gooding et al 2012 it should also be noted that plumes form naturally on the inner shelf through frequent wave current disturbance or from river discharge this would suggest that inner shelf biota should tolerate turbid conditions e g storms can produce a 6 8 fold increase in turbidity over calm weather concentrations meiβner et al 2006 hill et al 2007 cable burial in mid to outer shelf and upper slope mud deposits is also likely to generate sediment plumes these have the potential to last for days by virtue of the fine grain size of the suspensates however active shelf currents especially along the shelf edge may affect plume stability and its dilution gooding et al 2012 suggest that plumes may travel 50 m to 2 km from a trench however their effect on benthic communities will depend on sediment concentrations in the plume and the ability of the benthos to cope with such perturbations in the case of the mars cable benthic surveys within 1yr of cable burial by plough revealed no significant difference in the megafauna near the cable and 50 m away suggesting the effect of any plume was minimal kuhnz et al 2015 while not directly related to burial and recovery some studies of specific benthic communities and actual or potential threats from cables are instructive dunham et al 2015 document damage to glass sponges and associated megafauna that resulted from deployment of three high voltage alternating current p cables on the seabed surface of the strait of georgia canada repeated surveys showed that after 3 5yr there was 100 sponge mortality within the 140 mm wide cable footprint and recovery to 15 mortality in the 1 5 m wide cable corridor megafaunal abundance was slightly less in cable survey transects but any effect of the cables presence was not statiscally significant in a global review of cold water corals freiwald et al 2004 suggested that cables may potentially damage those lifeforms however direct evidence has yet to be seen e g ragnarsson et al 2017 nevertheless the possibility of a threat cannot be dismissed it can be argued that a potential threat can be minimised or eliminated via environmental impact assessments and appropriate cable route surveys and burial techniques modern surveys especially those involving ground truthed side scan sonar and multibeam mapping systems can accurately map communities where they form structures on the seabed e g huvenne et al 2016 such mapping allows cable routes to be designed that have least or nil effect on the relevant benthos 6 conclusions 1 rates of seabed recovery from cable burial on the csus depend on sediment supply and the potential of waves and currents to erode transport and deposit sediment those factors reflect the regional tectonic framework oceanography biology climate and bathymetry given the environmental variability of the csus coupled with differences in cable burial tools it is essential that seabed recovery is assessed on a case by case basis nevertheless the studies presented here not only serve as specific examples but they also provide a general framework to better gauge recovery 2 data from the nearshore zone are poorly represented in the published literature two studies indicate recovery from burial occurs within 2 7yr 3 active waves and currents and an adequate supply of sediment favour rapid physical recovery 1yr on the inner shelf 0 30 m wd reduced wave current activity and enhanced deposition of modern sediment on the mid shelf 30 80m wd result in recovery within 2yr although this may extend to 5yr or more where the sediment supply is low recovery is slower on the outer shelf 80 130 m wd and upper slope 130 2000m wd due to reduced wave current action and sediment supply in some areas the modern sediment cover is patchy thus exposing underlying consolidated deposits and rocks substrates that locally impede burial where burial is achieved trenches can take 8 15yr and longer to infill completely 4 shelves dominated by strong tidal flows that exceed thresholds of sand movement will recover from burial at most depths within weeks as long as there are adequate amounts sediment 5 with exceptions biological time series of mainly invertebrate infauna and epifauna show that the presence and burial of a telecommunication or power cable have little significant effect on those biological communities studied variance in communities can result from natural environmental change and different sampling methods rather than the presence of a cable or burial disturbance acknowledgements this research would not have been possible without the help from members of the non profit international cable protection committee icpc who provided expertise and time series data regarding the physical changes in the seabed following cable burial the input of dean veverka and alasdair wilkie is especially appreciated the icpc and the european submarine cable association also provided financial support for the first author christoph kraus we also thank the four journal reviewers particularly reviewer 2 for their positive reviews and commentaries 
23428,subsea communication and power cables are critical infrastructure whose protection is paramount especially on the continental shelf where fishing and ships anchors cause 70 of cable faults protection is often afforded by cable burial and this paper deals mainly with physical seabed recovery from that process varied sedimentary environments and different modes of cable burial mean that recovery is site specific repeated seabed surveys show restoration is fastest where cables are buried by ploughing in zones of high sediment supply and energetic waves currents such as on the inner to middle continental shelf 0 80 m water depth wd there recovery can take weeks to 1 2yr as sediment supply and wave current activity reduce offshore recovery from ploughing on the outer shelf 80 130 m wd is typically longer than in shallower depths recovery from water jetted trenching which can be more disturbing than ploughing can take 5yr on the upper continental slope 130 2000m wd trenches infill after 8yr where sediment supply is high but 15yr where supply is low surveys also suggest that benthic communities recover at rates similar to physical restoration with few exceptions the

assessments eia to be undertaken for offshore activities including the deployment and maintenance of cables an eia typically involves a synopsis of relevant environmental information but may also outline the need for new information repeated cable surveys have been requested to ascertain any changes in the seabed after cable burial e g carter et al 2009 sherwood et al 2016 these surveys are enlightening as they provide time series that address the main point of this paper how long does it take for the seabed to recover from protective burial of cables to address that question we present new unpublished data from repeated surveys of subsea cables fig 1 together with information gleaned from open file reports and the peer reviewed literature the focus is on physical change and recovery in predominantly terrigenous sediments however the response of benthic biota associated with those sediments is also briefly discussed using published studies that deal specifically with cables 2 cable installation and burial prior to installation marine surveys involving some combination of multibeam mapping side scan sonar sub bottom profiling seabed sampling and in situ testing of seabed physical properties are usually carried out to refine knowledge of the seabed in particular the type and thickness of sediment suitable for cable burial burnett et al 2013 jonkergouw 2001 that

wide assemblies mounted on skids wheels or caterpillar tracks and are towed by a cable laying ship a basic unit uses a plough blade however more advanced systems have also been developed some ploughs incorporate water jets to allow deeper penetration while others have rock penetrating teeth attached to the leading edge of the plough to cut through consolidated sediment or rock meanwhile vibrating blades have been added to ploughs to better penetrate difficult substrates such as chalk and gravel or environmentally sensitive areas for example salt marshes berr 2008 kober et al 2000 linders et al 2003 as a plough traverses the seabed it excavates a narrow furrow into which the cable is placed gooding et al 2012 pyrah 2010 worzyk 2009 the excavated sediment is then allowed to fall back and fill the furrow berr 2008 kober et al 2000 typically a plough blade disturbs a swath of seabed 1 m wide and can extend down to 3 m sd however the precise extent of disturbed seabed depends on plough size the depth of burial and substrate type e g jonkergouw 2001 the skids wheels or tracks that support the plough may compress sediment either side of the furrow overall the total disturbance strip is likely to range between 2 and 8 m width carter et al 2009 2 2 jetting jetting is the preferred method when i previously laid cables require reburial such as when they are exposed on the seabed following repair or ii seabed conditions are unfavourable for ploughing e g steep slopes pyrah 2010 cables are usually buried to 1 3 m sd but this can extend to larger depths where necessary alcatel lucent 2013 berr 2008 jetting works by pumping water at 5 15 bar to liquefy the seabed thereby allowing the cable to sink into the trench there the cable is covered with sediment settling out from the slurry gooding et al 2012 pyrah 2010 worzyk 2009 substrate disturbance is pervasive in a jetted trench which is commonly 1 m wide steep sided u shaped trench profiles often form in cohesive sediments whereas broad ill defined v shaped profiles are typical of non cohesive deposits jetting also suspends sediment that may escape from the trench leaving it partly filled coarse sand and gravel ejected by jetting usually settles along trench margins to form berms meanwhile observational and modelling studies have found that fine sand commonly deposits within 100 m of the trench whereas suspended mud may disperse up to 2 km away gooding et al 2012 compared to ploughing the effects of jetting can be more widely felt berr 2008 2 3 mechanical trenchers for rocky substrates a tracked vehicle equipped with a mechanical chain excavator or rock wheel cutters may be used to excavate a trench berr 2008 gooding et al 2012 these cutters make incisions down to 1 5 m sd whereas chain excavators go to 3 m sd and deeper a trench is usually 1 m wide and can have a berm of rock sediment cuttings because mechanical trenchers are slow costly and damaging to the benthos laying cables in rocky areas is avoided when possible if the crossing of terrigenous rocky substrates is unavoidable one solution is to encase the cable in protective iron pipes that are laid on the seabed e g sherwood et al 2016 2

al 2004 berr 2008 kuhnz et al 2015 sherwood et al 2016 drilling begins by making a pilot hole with a pre determined curvature that guides the drill stem from an onshore rig the drill passes seaward under sensitive zones and exits at the required location that is usually the inner continental shelf if required the resultant hole is enlarged to allow insertion of a conduit through which the cable

recovery case studies 4 1 nearshore zone 4 1 1 c cable norderney germany in 1997 a c cable was buried across salt marshes on the german island of norderney using a vibrating plough constructed specifically for mud flat operations the plough had 1 5 m wide tracks designed to exert minimal pressure on ground and hence minimise disturbance to the marsh ecosystem linders et al 2003 the area affected by the burial was divided into monitoring plots where the recovery of saltmarsh species such as puccinellia maritima and halimione portulacoides were analysed annually for 5yr and compared to control sites unaffected by burial most sections recovered to a pre burial condition after 5yr with some sites recovering within 2yr sites that were not fully restored after 5yr still showed significant revegetation whose rates suggested a return to original conditions in another 1 2yr linders et al 2003 4 1 2 seagrass meadows puget sound us austin et al 2004 assessed the effects of various cable installation methods including trenching directional drilling reusing existing conduits and surface laying on seagrass meadows in this instance zostera marina in puget sound washington state the study was prompted by the ecological value of the meadows as a habitat and spawning ground for marine organisms diver surveys of 19 sites showed directional drilling and surface laying were least disruptive in contrast trenching damaged meadows resulting in i loss of connectivity with other parts of the meadow and ii exposure of anoxic sediment unsuitable for z marina regrowth one trench site was monitored on an approximately annual basis between 1994 and 2001 mitigation measures were introduced in 1996 and 1997 and involved mixing beach sand with the anoxic sediment followed by z

km long 132 kv p cable that was placed in a 1 3 m wide and 1 3 m deep trench cut by a barge mounted backhoe in 2002 and 2003 birklund 2005 dong energy 2006 spoil was placed on the trench margins and was later used to refill the trench once the cable was laid benthic fauna and flora were surveyed in 2001 and immediately after the trench was infilled in march 2003 although this did not mark the end of disturbance because a fibre optic cable associated with the power component needed replacement subsequent resurveys were carried out in 2004 comparison of the before after information together with reference to control sites unaffected by burial operations revealed the following apart from localised increased mud contents at the most shoreward part of the infilled trench that were attributed to trenching the composition of surface sediments was unaffected dong energy 2006 seagrass living close to the trench declined immediately after trenching but recovered into late 2003 2004 when shoot and rhizome biomass increased more at the trench than at the control sites dong energy 2006 mud snails hydrobia sp were the most affected benthic animals but within 1yr their abundance increased albeit at a lesser rate than at the control sites overall birklund 2005 and dong energy 2006 conclude that the direct and indirect impacts of cable installation on benthic flora and fauna were limited both spatially and temporally 4 2 2 basslink p cable australia the 250 km long basslink p cable is a 400kv system that connects the australian states of victoria and tasmania across the inner to middle continental shelf of bass strait sherwood et al 2016 most of the cable route is situated around 80 m wd and the cable was buried by jet trenching to 0 5 1 5 m sd for 95 of its length at the coast the cable comes ashore via horizontal directionally drilled conduits however the presence of a 500 m wide zone of basaltic rocky reef with patches of gravel near the tasmanian landing also required the cable to be encased in protective half shell horizontally sliced iron pipes laid across the reef cable installation commenced in may 2004 and was completed by november 2005 seabed characteristics were determined before and during construction but apart from existing information epibenthic communities were not surveyed before installation seabed recovery in 20 m wd was monitored via video footage obtained by divers at each of two sites off victoria and tasmania repeat surveys were carried out off victoria 2005 2006 and tasmania 2006 2007 and 2008 for deeper parts of bass strait 32 72 m wd towed video transects were run at 6 stations comprising 12 transects per station only one deep water survey was run and this was 2 3 months after cable installation in addition the magnetic field associated with the cable was measured and was found to reduce to natural background levels within 20 m of the cable off victoria in 15 m wd the trench containing the cable filled with sand and became indistinguishable from the natural seabed within 1yr sherwood et al 2016 ascribe this rapid burial to strong tide dominant currents up to 1 2 m s 1 reinforced by storms plus a substantial longshore sediment drift of 100 000 m3 y 1 porter smith et al 2004 low animal numbers prevented a statistical appraisal of the epibiota however off the rocky tasmanian coast the protective iron pipes became encrusted by an epifauna similar to that inhabiting the natural reef within 3 5yr for deeper parts of the route down to 80 m wd it took 2yr for the trench containing the cable to fill completely with sediment leaving no visible evidence of the cable or trench this change occurred over one third of the route elsewhere the trench was still evident and was seen to contain biological material that had drifted into the depression this debris provided surfaces for the colonisation of epibiota however judging by the dearth of epibiota when the trench was fully infilled with mainly terrigenous sediment it is reasonable to assume that the epibiota occupying partly filled sections of trench is a temporary feature sherwood et al 2016 4 2 3 southern cross segment d c cable california segment d of the southern cross c cable was buried across the csus to 1850m wd by plough and where appropriate by jet trenching fig 3 the seabed consists of soft sand and shells with some pebbly areas present down to 12 m wd further offshore these deposits grade into unconsolidated silts with occasional rocky outcrops global marine systems ltd 2015 following cable installation in 2000 rov surveys were made in 2003 2005 2010 and 2015 as part of the permit conditions to lay the cable the rov was equipped with a bathymetric profiler and a calibrated tss 350 sensing system this system detects the position of the buried cable by a low frequency tone sent down the cable from the shore terminal searle et al 2014 the rov s position was determined relative to a transponder and this method was subject to calibration and repeatability trials sediment thickness data showed that most of the cable remained buried at 0 4 1 5 m sd for over 15 years the only exceptions were a few areas of shallow 0 5 m burial where i one c cable crossed another and ii where the seabed was rocky global marine systems ltd 2015 overall just 0 3 of the cable was exposed along the full 95 km long shelf slope section burial cover thickness also changed with time on the inner shelf the sediment cover locally thinned by up to 0 7 m compared to the middle shelf where the cover locally thickened by 0 3 m burial thicknesses on the outer shelf were larger in 2015 compared to 2000 but not as large as those recorded in 2002 2005 and 2010 effects on the resident biota were not determined but detailed assays from other cables on the california csus provide relevant data see section 5 3 also kogan et al 2006 kuhnz et al 2015 4 2 4 monterey accelerated research system mars c p cable california us the 51 km long mars science cable connects the monterey bay aquarium research institute to an instrumented science observatory or node on the continental slope at 891 m wd fig 3 initially the cable traverses an inner to middle shelf mantled with rippled sand around 60 m wd surface sediments transition to muddy sand that extends to around 115 m wd near the shelf edge mars is a hybrid power communications cable that was deployed using horizontal directional drilling from shore to 19 m wd seaward of which ploughing was undertaken jet trenching was used on the upper slope approaching the science node following a post lay inspection in year 2007 the cable was resurveyed in 2007 2008 2010 and 2014 2015 in 115 m wd the cable has remained buried in sand and sandy mud 0 6 1 0 m sd with little or no detectable effect on seabed morphology grain size on the shelf varies widely but cannot be attributed to burial operations kuhnz et al 2015 overall there was little effect on the abundance and distribution of the benthic macro and mega fauna observed within 0 100 m of the cable some variability in the abundance of some taxa was recorded but kuhnz et al 2015 conclude that this was due more to sampling methods or natural variability rather than cable installation similar conclusions were reached by kogan et al 2006 who assessed effects of the surface laid acoustic thermometry of ocean climate atoc coaxial c cable on the biota in half moon bay north of monterey bay fig 3 4 2 5 hibernia b c cable stellwagen bank national marine sanctuary massachusetts us a 19 8 km long section of the hibernia b c cable runs along the northern edge of stellwagen bank national marine sanctuary at 20 130 m wd grannis 2005 the bank top at 20 55 m wd is mantled with sand and gravel whereas adjacent basins contain mud in september 2000 the cable was buried 0 5 0 75 m sd in mainly sand using a water jet equipped plough the plough s footprint including trench and traction mechanism was up to 5 m wide the cable traversed an area open to trawl fishing and another closed to fishing at the time of survey in august 2001 the trench was still visible but in the non fishing zone there were no detectable differences in the composition and abundance of the epifauna on and off the cable route grannis 2005 in other words the epifauna had recovered within 1yr in contrast the trench in the fishing zone supported a more abundant epifauna compared to outside the trench this was attributed to exposure of consolidated sediment during trenching and by disturbance due to trawling after 5yr the trench was still visible confirming the low sediment supply to the seabed national marine sanctuary program 2007 4 2 6 swepol p cable sweden to poland the swepol p cable extends 254 km across the baltic sea to link sweden and poland the intervening seabed is 5 90 m deep and comprises mixed sand gravel nearshore zones separated by a mud covered basin the 450kv swepol system was installed to 1 m sd mainly by jetting abrahamsson et al 2001 siem offshore contractors 2016 effects of cable burial along the polish side of the cable were assessed by andrulewicz et al 2003 five study areas were selected down to 33 m wd in order to characterise the different substrates that ranged from fine sand to gravel thirty six sample stations were selected of which one half were on the cable route the other half served as control sites and were located from 185 to 1852m horizontally from the route comparison of video and photographic surveys made before 1999 and after 2000 cable burial showed the seabed had returned to its natural physical state i e within 1yr of installation measurements of the cable s magnetic field showed it declined rapidly to natural levels within 20 m of the cable furthermore analysis of the macrozoobenthos revealed no changes in benthic species composition biomass or abundance this implies that the benthos had also returned to pre burial conditions 4 2 7 kelvin hibernia segment b c cable northern ireland the kelvin hibernia segment b c cable extends across the continental shelf off northern ireland to link with the northernmost trans atlantic cable of

burial to 0 8 1 4 m sd within the 14 days between surveys all traces of ploughing were erased and the seabed returned to its current rippled condition fig 4 4 3 continental slope 130 2000m wd 4 3 1 southern cross segment d c cable california the uppermost continental slope section of the southern cross route down to 980 m wd consists mainly of unconsolidated sandy silt interspersed with small patches of pebbles the cable was ploughed to 1 m sd and over the past 15 years the burial depth has consistently remained within 1 1 5 m sd seaward of 980 m wd the seabed has rough ridge like topography that extends to 1850m wd the end of the repeat survey lines at 1050 m wd the seabed was firmer with increased rock outcrops and patches of coarse gravel there the cable was placed in a jetted trench that over the past 15yr has infilled to cover most of the cable fig 5 overall 99 5 of the cable along the surveyed route has remained buried however exposed sections of cable are found on rocky ridges and in some sections of the trench global marine systems ltd 2015 4 3 2 monterey accelerated research system mars c p cable california between 116 and 453 m wd a 6 9 km long section of the mars cable was not buried due to the presence of rocky substrates kuhnz et al 2015 by 2015 some tracts of the cable remained exposed but were interspersed by buried sections possibly due to relaxed cable tension and subsequent sinking into the mud seaward of 435 m wd the cable was buried by jetting downslope to the science node located at 890 m wd at the time of the installation in 2007 the trench was partly sediment filled but has since become 90 100 full the mean grain size of continental slope sediments was not significantly different between control and burial sites suggesting that any variability was likely to reflect natural causes rather than burial operations similarly natural variability was also deemed to have a greater effect on the macrofaunal assemblages rather than the mars cable kuhnz et al 2015 4 3 3 pacific crossing 1 c cable washington state on the outer continental shelf and upper slope 100 300 m wd off washington state the pacific crossing 1 c cable between japan and the usa was subject to a pre lay survey followed by three post lay surveys the cable was originally buried in 1999 2000 by ploughing and jetting however in some sectors cable burial was either too shallow or incomplete a condition attributed to zones of rocky seabed and elevated cable tension noaa 2005 a new route was devised and the cable was re laid to improve burial weiner and davis 2008 surveys prior to the cable being relaid found that after 4yr the trench and associated berms were visible in areas of coarse grained sediment or consolidated substrate trench berms contained gravelly debris which partially resulted from currents winnowing out fine sand and mud from the berm some of this finer sediment accumulated in the trench noaa 2005 in the case of the mud dominant seabed plough marks were visible 0 5yr after burial but disappeared after 4yr benthic communities recovered most readily in areas of poorly consolidated mud and sand where the trench incised consolidated seabed deposits faunal differences were evident where mud partly filled the trench and where coarse berm deposits provided substrates for an epibenthos noaa 2005 5 discussion rates of recovery presented here table 1 are influenced by the timing of the surveys which were run mainly on annual to multi annual time scales consequently the surveys may not capture single or multiple events such as storms which could be the sole or dominant cause of recovery and which can occur at sub annual frequencies e g carter and lewis 1995 hill et al 2007 survey schedules aside rates of physical recovery from burial basically reflect i sediment supply to the csus and ii the competency of waves and currents to erode transport and deposit that sediment although these factors vary widely in response to continental margin morphology geology tectonics biology oceanography climate and weather e g nittrouer et al 2007 the recovery case studies presented in this paper can be discussed broadly with reference to margins subject to i high or low inputs of fluvial sediment and ii energetic or weak wave current regimes with exception of the two semi sheltered nearshore case studies the remaining studies involve exposed ocean sites where wave current energy can be simply expressed as a function of csus water depth 5 1 inner to outer shelf recovery the california margin along which the mars and southern cross segment d cables are situated receives substantial volumes of sediment delivered by small rivers draining high yielding catchments inman and jenkins 1999 milliman and syvitski 1992 thanks to a suite of regional studies the physical processes likely to affect recovery from burial are well established e g cacchione et al 2009 edwards 2002 nittrouer et al 2007 sommerfield et al 2007 the inner shelf off california is a dynamic zone where waves and currents suspend the mud dominant river discharge and transport it as turbid plumes along and across the shelf fig 2 in essence mud largely bypasses the inner shelf leaving a seaward thinning wedge of sand in its wake edwards 2002 under fair weather conditions wave stirring and current transport are likely to extend to 15 m wd davis jr 1983 nichols 2009 however this process is magnified during storms when strengthened wave activity can resuspend mud down to 50 m wd or deeper these disturbances occur several times a year on the californian shelf and elsewhere e g hill et al 2007 in such a dynamic regime burial disturbance is likely to be short lived inner shelves receiving limited amounts of fluvial sediment swepol baltic sea basslink bass strait nysted north sea are also subject to storms that will rework existing shelf sediments as well as introducing sediment transported elsewhere from the shelf via for example longshore drift e g sherwood et al 2016 thus it is unsurprising that recovery from burial is swift with a return to a natural substrate within 1 2yr andrulewicz et al 2003 sherwood et al 2016 van der veer and bergman 1985 mud that bypasses the inner shelf accumulates on the middle to outer shelf and onto the continental slope deposition on the californian mid shelf is highest near rivers and declines northward along the shelf under the influence of ocean and storm forced currents fig 3 edwards 2002 again rain storms are a prominent driver with a single flood event depositing between 1 and 7 cm sediment nittrouer et al 2007 overall the mid shelf favours burial and recovery because i muddy sediments are conducive to ploughing which is usually the least disruptive burial technique ii it is a zone of rapid sediment deposition and iii currents are capable of smoothing plough marks especially when reinforced by storms fig 2 certainly the depth of burial surveys of the mars and southern cross cables show static to increased burial depth over periods of 8 15yr and little visual evidence of ploughing especially in areas of mobile sand global marine systems ltd 2015 kuhnz et al 2015 recovery rates on the mid shelf in areas of low sediment supply vary considerably off stellwagen bank recovery has been slow with the trench still visible after 5yr grannis 2005 national marine sanctuary program 2007 this situation results from a low sediment deposition on the bank tops that is reflected by a cover of mainly relict gravel sand however supply may be higher in the nearby troughs as suggested by the core data of crusius et al 2004 who record approximate maximum sedimentation rates of 0 3 cm yr 1 for trough muds south of the cable in contrast to stellwagen bank one third of the trench on the bass strait mid shelf returned to its natural state in 2yr with the remaining two thirds of the trench in various stages of infill porter smith et al 2004 sherwood et al 2016 recovery was fastest for the kelvin hibernia segment b cable in the northern irish sea diurnal tidal flows are sufficiently powerful to transport sand on a daily basis thus the seabed returned to its natural state within 14 days of burial fig 4 recently deposited muds can extend over the outer shelf off high discharge rivers fig 3 however where the fluvial input is low the mud blanket is often thin and patchy exposing older sand gravel consolidated sediment and rock this is especially the case at the shelf break where the near flat shelf steepens onto the continental slope fig 2 there topographic intensification of currents possibly aided by breaking internal waves and infrequent large storms create a hydrodynamic setting less favourable for mud deposition nichols 2009 prothero and schwab 2014 such variable seabed conditions do not favour cable burial as evinced by the experience of pacific crossing 1 noaa 2005 generally rocky substrates inhibit burial necessitating surface laying where trenching is possible recovery depends upon depositional rates of suspended load and bed load see section 5 2 5 2 upper slope recovery the hydrodynamic regime at the shelf break fig 2 weakens with depth to allow fine suspended mud particles to accumulate depending upon the amount of mud accumulating on the slope underlying deposits of older coarse sediment or rock will be exposed to varying degrees as is observed on the californian slope global marine systems ltd 2015 kuhnz et al 2015 upper slopes are often incised by submarine canyons which act as conduits to the deep ocean this is especially the case off tectonically active margins where earthquakes storms and other triggers remobilise sediment to form landslides and turbidity currents that pass down canyon onto the abyssal floor breaking cables en route e g carter et al 2014 cattaneo et al 2012 for that reason canyons should be avoided where possible muddy sediment escaping the continental shelf will also accumulate between canyons and potentially favour trench recovery for mars the trenched slope section north of monterey canyon has been infilling with sediment since 2007 by 2015 it was 90 100 full kuhnz et al 2015 a reflection of the locally high input of fluvial mud in contrast the southern cross trench which is more distant from direct river sources is infilling more slowly with sections of the trench still visible after 15yr fig 5 however it should be noted that even intercanyon areas can be subject to seismically triggered landslides with the potential to expose or even remove sections of buried cable in the case of weakly seismic margins buried or surface laid cables are less exposed to submarine landslides and turbidity currents but damaging events do occur albeit rarely in 1929 the magnitude 7 2 grand banks earthquake offshore newfoundland generated landslides and a powerful turbidity current that collectively broke 12 submarine telegraph cables in 28 places in water depths down to at least 5300 m heezen and ewing 1952 5 3 biological responses to cable burial restoration in the nearshore zone as recorded in a salt marsh and a seagrass meadow depends upon the time it takes for the vegetation to recover austin et al 2004 linders et al 2003 in both case studies recovery was within 4 7yr with some salt marsh vegetation returning after 2yr however it is important to note that biological recovery can be species dependent growth of the seagrass z marina is much faster than that of posidonia oceanica which in the mediterranean sea may not fully recover within human time scales telesca et al 2015 in other studies involving the nearshore zone very little damage occurred as the zone was bypassed using horizontal directional drilling e g kuhnz et al 2015 sherwood et al 2016 offshore biological surveys have focussed mainly on invertebrate faunas living in and on the seabed a basic question is whether the fauna responds to the physical presence of the cable and or to seabed disturbed by burial any direct effect of a c cable on marine organisms can be assessed from surface laid cables i e unaffected by burial a survey of the surface laid atoc coaxial c cable by kogan et al 2006 found no statistical difference in the abundance and distribution of a largely invertebrate fauna located within 1 m and 100 m of the cable kuhnz et al 2015 came to a similar conclusion for exposed sections of the mars c p cable fig 3 however surface laid cables can provide hard substrates that support an epifauna in an otherwise epifauna poor muddy sandy seabed kogan et al 2006 cables also provide substrates when exposed in trenches grannis 2005 but this condition can be temporary as the epifauna is lost when sediment completely fills the trench sherwood et al 2016 biological recovery appears related to physical recovery judging by the studies of andrulewicz et al 2003 kuhnz et al 2015 and sherwood et al 2016 thus inner shelf invertebrates return to natural levels within 1 year after burial operations full recovery is usually longer on the middle shelf ranging from 1 to 2yr depending on sediment supply and wave current action the picture becomes complex on the outer shelf and upper slope there i incomplete burial of the cable ii exposure of consolidated sediment in trenches and associated berms and iii the capture of biological drift material all provide substrates to support epibiota kogan et al 2006 grannis 2005 noaa 2005 sherwood et al 2016 even so an epibiotic presence is limited by the time it takes to fill a jetted trench with terrigenous sediment as suggested by the results of kuhnz et al 2015 and sherwood et al 2016 it is also worth noting that biological reworking or bioturbation of sediments may contribute to the natural restoration of the seabed rose and kuehl 2010 for example demonstrated that continental shelves including those with strong physical signals such as storms and large fluvial discharges have their middle to outer reaches dominated by bioturbation that largely removes evidence of previous flood and storm activity the effect of sediment plumes generated by cable burial on the resident biota also depends upon several variables these include i the mode of burial with jetting likely to produce more suspended sediment than ploughing ii sediment type with mud producing longer lived plumes compared to sand and gravel iii rate of plume dispersal by waves and currents and iv the response of the biota to increased turbidity e g gooding et al 2012 meiβner et al 2006 as a generalisation when mainly sandy deposits of the inner shelf are ploughed the resultant plume is short lived because of the coarse sediment grain size which will encourage rapid deposition close 100 m to the trench swanson et al 2006 gooding et al 2012 it should also be noted that plumes form naturally on the inner shelf through frequent wave current disturbance or from river discharge this would suggest that inner shelf biota should tolerate turbid conditions e g storms can produce a 6 8 fold increase in turbidity over calm weather concentrations meiβner et al 2006 hill et al 2007 cable burial in mid to outer shelf and upper slope mud deposits is also likely to generate sediment plumes these have the potential to last for days by virtue of the fine grain size of the suspensates however active shelf currents especially along the shelf edge may affect plume stability and its dilution gooding et al 2012 suggest that plumes may travel 50 m to 2 km from a trench however their effect on benthic communities will depend on sediment concentrations in the plume and the ability of the benthos to cope with such perturbations in the case of the mars cable benthic surveys within 1yr of cable burial by plough revealed no significant difference in the megafauna near the cable and 50 m away suggesting the effect of any plume was minimal kuhnz et al 2015 while not directly related to burial and recovery some studies of specific benthic communities and actual or potential threats from cables are instructive dunham et al 2015 document damage to glass sponges and associated megafauna that resulted from deployment of three high voltage alternating current p cables on the seabed surface of the strait of georgia canada repeated surveys showed that after 3 5yr there was 100 sponge mortality within the 140 mm wide cable footprint and recovery to 15 mortality in the 1 5 m wide cable corridor megafaunal abundance was slightly less in cable survey transects but any effect of the cables presence was not statiscally significant in a global review of cold water corals freiwald et al 2004 suggested that cables may potentially damage those lifeforms however direct evidence has yet to be seen e g ragnarsson et al 2017 nevertheless the possibility of a threat cannot be dismissed it can be argued that a potential threat can be minimised or eliminated via environmental impact assessments and appropriate cable route surveys and burial techniques modern surveys especially those involving ground truthed side scan sonar and multibeam mapping systems can accurately map communities where they form structures on the seabed e g huvenne et al 2016 such mapping allows cable routes to be designed that have least or nil effect on the relevant benthos 6 conclusions 1 rates of seabed recovery from cable burial on the csus depend on sediment supply and the potential of waves and currents to erode transport and deposit sediment those factors reflect the regional tectonic framework oceanography biology climate and bathymetry given the environmental variability of the csus coupled with differences in cable burial tools it is essential that seabed recovery is assessed on a case by case basis nevertheless the studies presented here not only serve as specific examples but they also provide a general framework to better gauge recovery 2 data from the nearshore zone are poorly represented in the published literature two studies indicate recovery from burial occurs within 2 7yr 3 active waves and currents and an adequate supply of sediment favour rapid physical recovery 1yr on the inner shelf 0 30 m wd reduced wave current activity and enhanced deposition of modern sediment on the mid shelf 30 80m wd result in recovery within 2yr although this may extend to 5yr or more where the sediment supply is low recovery is slower on the outer shelf 80 130 m wd and upper slope 130 2000m wd due to reduced wave current action and sediment supply in some areas the modern sediment cover is patchy thus exposing underlying consolidated deposits and rocks substrates that locally impede burial where burial is achieved trenches can take 8 15yr and longer to infill completely 4 shelves dominated by strong tidal flows that exceed thresholds of sand movement will recover from burial at most depths within weeks as long as there are adequate amounts sediment 5 with exceptions biological time series of mainly invertebrate infauna and epifauna show that the presence and burial of a telecommunication or power cable have little significant effect on those biological communities studied variance in communities can result from natural environmental change and different sampling methods rather than the presence of a cable or burial disturbance acknowledgements this research would not have been possible without the help from members of the non profit international cable protection committee icpc who provided expertise and time series data regarding the physical changes in the seabed following cable burial the input of dean veverka and alasdair wilkie is especially appreciated the icpc and the european submarine cable association also provided financial support for the first author christoph kraus we also thank the four journal reviewers particularly reviewer 2 for their positive reviews and commentaries 
23429,recently the need for a more efficient method for ship route planning was raised due to the financial crisis in the shipping industry a strengthening of emission regulations and the limitations of the existing methods so far numerous ship route planning methods have been developed but most of them do not correctly reflect the effect of a change of the ship speed in the path determination stage for this study a ship route planning problem was formulated as an optimization problem to solve this a method for a simultaneous determination of the path and the speed of a ship is proposed to check the efficiency and the applicability of the proposed method sensitivity analyses and a comparative test regarding some other methods was performed the proposed method was applied to various examples of ship route planning and the results show that the proposed method can reduce the total fuel consumption compared with the other methods keywords ship route planning path and speed optimization fuel consumption weather conditions 1 introduction 1 1 research background ship route planning is generally the responsibility of the captain and the chief mate in most cases they decide the route depending on their experience at the time of planning and while this does not necessarily cause any problems it can be improved path finding methods and commercial programs can be of assistance and many methods can be used many of the methods however have not fully satisfied user expectations while the available methods and programs for the determination of the optimal route are numerous the existing methods are limited in terms of speed optimization that is an optimization method for which the path and the speed are considered at the same time is absent for these reasons a new method for ship route planning for which the path and the speed are considered simultaneously is proposed in this study 1 2 related studies several of the existing methods can be divided according to cell usage including cell based and cell free methods here a cell means a small region generated from a grid table 1 shows a comparison of cell based and the cell free methods the cell based method generates a path by connecting the center points of the cells on the other hand the cell free method does not use any cell to generate a path it is inevitable that the cell based method must limit the searching direction because the cell shapes are fixed therefore when cell based methods are used the path is rough and angled shaped and post treatments are consequently needed to smooth the route further the concept of time is not contained in the cell based method so the speed optimization should be operated separately alternatively the cell free methods such as the isochrone method do not limit the searching direction and the application of speed optimization into the method is relatively easy many ship route planning studies use a cell based method and the path optimization and the speed optimization are accordingly separated joo et al 2012 found the optimal path in a fixed speed state by using the so called a star algorithm and they modified the path in consideration of the weather conditions by using the dijkstra algorithm afterward the speed on the path was adjusted similarly bang and kwon 2014 found the optimal path in a fixed speed state by using the a star algorithm but they modified the found path in consideration of the weather conditions by using an evolutionary strategy and lastly they adjusted the speed on the path choi et al 2015 targeted the ship route planning for the arctic sea since the weather condition included constant hourly ice changes they developed an ice model in consideration of ice behavior uncertainties they proposed a method for the determination of the optimal path under a time varying weather condition with the use of the a star algorithm however they did not perform a speed optimization on the path park and kim 2015 found the optimal path in a fixed speed state by using the a star algorithm and then adjusted the speed on the path by using geometric programming kim et al 2016 used the hybrid a star algorithm to find the optimal path without any adjustment of ship speed the studies of joo et al 2012 bang and kwon 2014 and park and kim 2015 implemented speed optimization with a separation stage for each of the studies a different optimization method was used but for all three the shortest path was identified in the first stage followed by the adjustment of the speed on the path in the second stage vettor and soares 2016 formulated a ship route planning problem in terms of a multi objective optimization problem for which the positions and speeds are design variables they mainly used the evolutionary algorithm for the formulation of a route that comprises several nodes and specifically the dijkstra algorithm was used to calculate the objective functions between the neighbor nodes this method was therefore named the es evolution strategy dijkstra method due to its similarity to the dijkstra algorithm whereby the speed can be changed at each segment between the nodes several cell free methods have been developed roh 2013 proposed an improved isochrone method for ship route planning whereby obstacles such as land are considered wei and zhou 2012 used three dimensional 3d dynamic programming to propose a method for ship route planning that is similar to the isochrone method similarly chen 2013 developed a program that is based on 3d dynamic programming 3d dynamic programming has been used in many studies since then zaccone et al 2016 used 3d dynamic programming to perform the optimization of path and speed profile zaccone and figari 2017 complemented the part of ship response modeling in the previous study to optimize the path and speed of the ship developed by shi 2016 en energy saver is a commercial program for ship route planning that finds the path by using an improved isochrone method and then performs speed optimization using a genetic algorithm eniram route eniram 2017 is a commercial program that uses empirical data that are based on the actual ship route in this study a method that is a type of cell free method is proposed to determine the path and the speed simultaneously to overcome the limitations of the existing methods table 2 is a summary of the related studies 2 method for a simultaneous determination of path and speed 2 1 problem definition solving a ship route planning problem is finding the route from the departure to arrival ports the route can be referred to as the combination of the path and the speed in shipping operations the path is determined by a series of ship directions while the speed is determined by a series of engine revolutions per minute rpm settings meanwhile the route is determined by numerous criteria such as the fuel oil consumption foc sea keeping operability etc among these criteria the total fuel oil consumption tfoc which indicates the monetary providence of the route is the most representative to obtain the tfoc of a given route some information in table 3 should be given as input data as shown when constructing the route the data described in table 3 at specific locations within each node or segment is required therefore geographical information or weather conditions information are needed from the departure to the arrival port in the case of weather information since the information may change with the progress of time in each example of this study we used weather information from one day before departure to 3 days after eta with this information the tfoc can be estimated using a specific method in ship route planning the determined route should satisfy a number of constraints such as the avoidance of obstacles such as land and an adherence to the arrival time in table 3 the geographic information is used to determine whether the position where a ship passes is land or not in this study we have identified the geographic information by dividing a map into a square grid and judged whether the corresponding latitude and longitude are land or sea by binary value for each grid using the geographic information we can calculate the avoidance of obstacles which is one of the constraints of the problem for ship route planning 2 2 formulation of the optimization problem to determine an economical route the optimal route problem is formulated as an optimization problem each component of the problem is described in the subsequent sub sections 2 2 1 design variables in this study it is assumed that one route consists of a series of nodes nodes are the intermediate points between the departure and arrival ports the design variables of the optimization problem are therefore the direction or heading angle θ θ 0 θ 1 θ i θ n 1 and the engine rpm rpm rpm 0 rpm 1 rpm i rpm n in equation 2 of the ship at each node as shown in fig 1 in addition it is assumed that the time between two adjacent nodes is a constant value for example 12 h as shown in fig 1 if the directions are determined the positions of nodes can be determined the direction is related to the path and the engine rpm is related to the speed of the ship if the number of nodes is n from p 1 to p n n directions from θ 0 to θ n 1 and n 1 rpms from rpm 0 to rpm n should be determined as the design variables the direction at the last node p n is not needed since the arrival port p arrival or p n 1 is given and the direction from p n to p arrival is automatically determined the total number of design variables in this problem is therefore 2n 1 by connecting all the nodes including the departure and arrival ports the route path and speed can be obtained 2 2 2 objective function in this study the tfoc is used as an objective function which is a criterion for the selection of the best from a number of alternatives the tfoc depends on the route that is the values of the design variables including the weather condition the tfoc estimation is described as shown in equation 1 1 minimize t f o c θ r p m this objective function can be easily changed into others such as arrival time total distance and so on in order to take all of the above into consideration various preferences from the captain or the ship owner should be reflected 2 2 3 constraints four constraints are used in this study first the ship should not arrive at the arrival port beyond the latest time of arrival eta max equation 2 second the route for the ship should not pass through obstacles such as land equation 3 in addition in the case of the heading angle the ship is constrained from moving in the wrong direction that is the heading angle is constrained to change no more than 30 it can be changed according to the designer s preference from the orientation of the previous node and the first node is unrestricted equation 4 the engine rpm is constrained to change from its minimum to maximum values e g 70 to 85 they can be changed according to engine specifications equation 5 although the foc of the transient segment due to the change of the engine rpm between each node should be taken into consideration we assumed that the interval of the node presented in this study is more than an hour and the foc by this transient segment is negligible in tfoc in equation 3 the constant ε land represents the minimum distance between the route and the land considering some margin e g longitude and latitude of 0 25 it can be changed according to the designer s preference for safe voyage such as the avoidance of the land shallow water etc 2 e t a θ r p m e t a max 0 3 ε l a n d l a n d p i p i θ r p m 0 4 θ i 1 30 θ i θ i 1 30 5 r p m min r p m i r p m max this optimization problem is therefore a kind of constrained optimization problem that comprises 2n 1 design variables one objective function and four forms of the inequality constraints 2 3 estimation of the foc the performance of a ship changes according to the weather conditions roh 2013 with a problematic sea state such as high waves for example the total ship resistance increases the ship speed also reduces due to the increasing ship resistance in case of constant propulsion setting and additional power is needed to correct the reduced ship speed thereby leading to additional fuel consumption either a theory based or practice based method can be used for the estimation of the tfoc to estimate the tfoc according to the sea state with the use of a theory based method iso 15016 2015 the amount of increased ship resistance should first be calculated second it is necessary to calculate the reduced ship speed according to the increase of the ship resistance third the increased power for the recovery of the ship speed should be calculated lastly it is necessary to calculate the additional fuel consumption according to the increase of power at this time a two stage method is also available to predict fuel consumption coraddu et al 2013 alternatively for the practice based method a regression model that is made using past ship operation data is applied the theory based method is systematic and elaborate but the estimated value needs to be adjusted with the operation data to increase the estimation accuracy while the practice based method is easy to use it is difficult to apply it in building a regression model between these two methods the practice based method is used in this study with the help of one of the shipping companies that is the nonlinear multiple regression model is used to estimate the route based foc of the ship in consideration of the weather conditions meanwhile the heading angle one of the design variables is the heading angle in over water over ground angle and speed are used to estimate the direction and speed of a ship from the theory based method in the theory based method it is a general procedure to obtain the speed that is increased or decreased due to environmental loads wave wind current and swell and the changed direction by using over ground angle and speed however as mentioned in section 2 3 we did not use the theory based method described above but rather the practice based method using past ship operation data one of the advantages of the practice based method is that it does not require complicated procedures to get over water angle and speed since it is the measurement of the ship operation data including environmental loads the heading angle and speed can be calculated in over water considering the environmental loads the nonlinear multiple regression model consists of three equations for the three pieces of output information the reduced ship speed power and ufoc fuel consumption per unit time which were generated from 14 sets of input data engine rpm aft draft forward draft heading angle wind direction wind speed wave direction wave height wave period swell direction swell height swell period current direction and current speed these equations include a coefficient a i and an exponent b i for each variable as shown in equation 6 and they were determined by multiple regression analysis using the past ship operation data of about 30 000 measured in pacific ocean the model was provided by samsung heavy industries and the error of the model is within 0 5 comparing with the actual data in order to check the feasibility of the model a test was carried out on a well known relation for example a ship power is proportional to the third power of the engine rpm and the ship power is proportional to the third power of speed using the proposed model curves of rpm power rpm ufoc curve and speed power were generated as shown in fig 2 when generating the curves weather related variables were set to 0 and the design draft was used 6 u

r e c t i o n b 14 the weather conditions in table 3 and the route information are given as the input data by multiplying the ufoc by the time duration the fuel consumption can be estimated for the given distance fig 3 shows the procedure for foc estimation including the input and output data 2 4 generation of the route the departure and arrival positions are ones of input data not constraints the optimal route problem in this study has design variables of the direction and the engine rpm of the ship at each node including departure and arrival positions therefore the first pair of design variables θ 0 rpm 0 represents the direction and the engine rpm of the ship at the departure position the final heading angle is not specified as a design variable since the final heading angle is determined at the last node p n by using the arrival position given as input data by constructing the route in this way we can eliminate constraints on departure and arrival positions in the optimal route problem if the direction and the engine rpm at the present node are the design variables and the time duration between the two nodes is given the position of the next node is p i 1 as shown in equation 7 and fig 4 more specifically to move from a specific position p i to the next position p i 1 three pieces of information are required the heading angle θ i and rpm i at p i generated from the optimization algorithm and the user defined time duration δt are required using the weather and ship information at p i ship performance power speed and ufoc can be calculated as described in section 2 3 then using the calculated speed and heading angle the next position p i 1 can be obtained by equation 7 if this step is performed for all the nodes and then all the nodes are connected and the route can be obtained in addition the tfoc is also obtained by accumulating the foc from all the nodes 7 p i 1 p i x v i sin θ i δ t p i y v i cos θ i δ t 2 5 avoidance of obstacles when generating the route the segment between two nodes can interfere with obstacles such as land therefore a suitable method is required to check whether the segment interferes with any land masses or water too shallow for the ship in this study a geographic map that has been generated from the geographic information on the route is used the determination like whether the route passes through the land is carried out in segments between adjacent nodes design variables such as heading angle and rpm determine the position of nodes and segments using the geographic map we can recognize whether the position is land or not therefore land in equation 5 can be said to be the function using information for detecting land and sea given by geographic map and position p i at this time a certain margin denoted as ε land in equation 3 is considered to secure the safe route having no interference with the land including shallow water the constant ε land represents the minimum distance between the route and the land considering some margin e g longitude and latitude of 0 25 it can be changed according to the designer s preference for the safe voyage such as the avoidance of the land shallow water etc since the geographic information includes the information on the land and the sea it is possible to check whether a certain point on the route is on the land or at sea first a world map is divided into a number of cells through the insertion of evenly distributed horizontal and vertical lines into the world map e g longitude and latitude of 1 in fig 5 a accordingly the map is called geographic map in this study for each cell the geographic information is used to check whether the centroid of the cell is on land considering the margin ε land or at sea if it is on land the value of the cell is 1 and if it is not on land the cell value is 0 here to use the centroid of the cell can be inaccurate however if some margin ε land is considered this method can be acceptable of course we can use four points of the cell instead of its centroid although it requires more computation time each route segment is then divided into several portions e g 1 in fig 5 a or 0 5 in fig 5 b and then several checking points are made for each checking point the cell is found on the geographic map and if the value of the cell is 1 the checking point is on land due to the possibility that the segment including the checking point could interfere with the land the route that comprises the segment cannot be selected as an optimal route at this time the accuracy of the method depends on the level of detail of the geographic map that is as the cell sizes are decreased e g longitude and latitude of 0 5 in fig 5 b the accuracy of the method is increased and the computation time of the method is lengthened one more thing we can check whether a certain point is on the land or at sea is to use an additional map for water depth and a new constraint for water depth e g w d min w d θ r p m 0 where wd θ rpm is the water depth of the given point from the map and wd min is the minimum depth for voyage 2 6 optimization algorithm optimization algorithms are generally divided into global and local optimization algorithms and the former comprises several types including the genetic algorithm ga goldberg 1989 several classes of the local optimization algorithm including sequential quadratic programming sqp arora 2011 also exist each of these local optimization algorithms can be used to effectively find the optimum however in some cases these local optimization algorithms find an optimum that is relatively close to the starting point to overcome the existing limitation the nsga non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii deb et al 2002 global optimization algorithm which is a well known and proven ga was selected for this study to solve the ship route planning optimization problem that was formulated in each step 3 implementation of the prototype program a prototype program that is based on the proposed method for which the c language is used was developed for this study in the prototype program multi layered maps are used to find the optimal route the multi layered maps consist of three different maps first the geographic map includes the geographic information regarding the route and each cell in the map has a binary value that represents the land and the sea the route based tfoc of the ship depends on the weather condition the weather map includes the on route weather conditions and a specific weather condition is relevant for each cell at a certain time the last map is the world image map which includes the shape of the world including the land and the sea that is used to visualise the result of the ship route planning with these maps the geographic information weather conditions information and pixel information can all be obtained for a certain ship position moreover the level of detail of each map can be different 4 sensitivity analyses and comparative test 4 1 sensitivity analyses if a model is set global sensitivity and uncertainty analyses gsua should be done gsua aims to understand the origin and control of uncertainty convertino et al 2014 in general gsua is used to verify humanities and chemical models however gsua can also be applied to structural engineering design and optimal design of experiments kontoravdi et al 2005 most gsua are conducted using independent design variables unfortunately in this study some of the design variables among θ 0 and θ n 1 among rpm 0 and rpm n for the optimization are correlated and coupled input samples for coupled design variables are more laborious to generate and even worse the sample size needed to compute sensitivity measures for non independent samples is much higher than in the case of uncorrelated samples saltelli et al 2008 for this reason we have performed sensitivity analyses of several available variables in this section four sensitivity analyses are conducted first the effect of changing the constraint for ship heading angle was analysed here we changed corresponding constraints and investigated the effects fig 6 and table 4 show the results of the analysis from the results the change of the constraint for ship heading angle by 15 and 60 did not change the solution therefore an angle restriction of 30 is considered suitable in most cases second the effect of changing the constraint for engine rpm was analysed in the proposed method the engine rpm for each segment can freely change this gives a much higher variability in the speed variation thus the change of the speed seems more frequent which can affect fuel consumption to check the effect on the optimization we considered two cases fig 7 and table 5 show the results if there is the limitation on the number of changes of the engine rpm the result is unsatisfactory due to the limitation on free speed control in terms of tfoc and total distance next the effect of changing the time duration was analysed we changed the time duration to 3 6 12 and 24 h and compared the results of each case fig 8 and table 6 show the results if the time duration is too short the result is unsatisfactory due to too frequent change of the heading angle and engine rpm on the other hand if the time duration is too long the number of cases where speed control is possible is reduced and the solution is worse finally fig 9 and table 7 show the results for the variation of the objective function this analysis shows that the proposed method can be used for various purposes by changing the objective function the results show that if the objective function is changed the route is correctly searched for the corresponding purpose 4 2 comparative test to check the efficiency and the applicability of the proposed method a comparative test regarding the other methods was performed as shown in table 8 in this table the es a star method implemented by the authors was made possible by the replacement of the dijkstra algorithm in the es dijkstra method with the a star algorithm in the case of the improved isochrone method one of commercial programs was used here and lastly proposed2 is a version of the proposed method for which the path design variables were changed from the directions to the positions the route from busan korea to long beach usa was solved and compared for one of the examples and table 9 shows the results of the comparative test the isochrone method yielded the route with the shortest distance but the highest tfoc the a star algorithm yielded the route with the shortest computation time but the longest distance the proposed method yielded the route with the least tfoc from this comparison with the other methods the capacity of the proposed method enables the provision of the most economical route in terms of the minimum tfoc 5 applications 5 1 definition of cases the proposed method and the prototype program were also applied to various examples and the results are described and discussed in this section a summary of all the cases is shown in table 10 case 1 and case 2 are pacific ocean routes in terms of these routes the land impact is relatively small except near the departure and arrival ports but the impact of the weather conditions appears prominently especially the weather conditions at the departure time in march case 1 is problematic but that of the departure time in june case 2 is favourable cases 3 corresponds to the complicated route where there are many islands between the departure and arrival ports a 4600 teu container ship was used for these applications the detail information of the ship is shown in table 11 5 2 results and discussion 5 2 1 case 1 fig 10 shows a visualisation of the results of the ship route planning for case 1 in the case of the isochrone and the proposed methods the time duration of each segment is 12 h table 12 shows detailed information of the results the proposed method yielded the best route in terms of the tfoc although the total distance is longer than the isochrone method in terms of the computation time the result of the a star algorithm is the shortest time whereas the es dijkstra method required the longest time in the cases of the cell free methods the isochrone and the proposed methods smoother shaped routes were generated compared with the cell based methods the dijkstra algorithm the a star algorithm and the es dijkstra method fig 11 shows a comparison between the results the proposed method performed a simultaneous optimization of the path and speed on the route alternatively for comparative purposes the isochrone method used a fixed engine rpm in this figure the yellow circles represent the favourable weather condition regions whereas the green circles represent the problematic weather condition regions four graphs are shown along the longitude in this figure as follows engine rpm ship speed foc and foc per unit distance in these graphs the blue line is the result of the isochrone method and the red line is the result of the proposed method in the engine rpm graph top left in fig 11 the engine rpm is variable for the proposed method whereas it is fixed for the isochrone method for the proposed method the engine rpm in the favourable weather condition regions increased whereas the engine rpm in the problematic weather condition regions decreased in the graph of the ship speed top right in fig 11 for the proposed method the ship speed in the favourable weather condition regions increased whereas it decreased in the problematic weather condition regions here the increase of the ship speed in the favourable weather condition regions compensates for the loss of the ship speed in the problematic weather condition regions to satisfy the eta requirement in the foc graph bottom left in fig 11 for the proposed method the change of the foc according to the weather condition is similar to that of the engine rpm alternatively since the engine rpm of the isochrone method is maintained even in the problematic weather condition regions the foc increased suddenly in these regions from the results of this case the impact of the speed optimization on the minimisation of the tfoc is major actually the tfoc of the proposed method is less than that of the isochrone method by approximately 4 8 as shown in table 12 5 2 2 case 2 fig 12 shows visualisation of the results for the ship route planning for case 2 according to the five methods here the results are for favourable weather conditions with a low wave height and a low wind speed table 13 shows detailed information of the results the proposed method yielded the best route in terms of the tfoc the a star algorithm yielded the route with the highest tfoc and the longest distance but its route computation time is the shortest furthermore the route shape of the a star algorithm is rougher compared with the other methods fig 13 shows a comparison between the results akin to the other cases the proposed method yielded a more economical route than that of the isochrone method through the speed optimization 5 2 3 case 3 fig 14 and table 14 show the results for the ship route planning for the route from singapore to karachi the results of this case are for a complicated route and calm sea conditions with no waves or wind the proposed method yielded a suitable route that passes through the strait of malacca however the other methods yielded routes with the land interference of thailand 5 2 4 summary of the results a summary of all the results and the corresponding comparison are shown in table 15 as is discussed previously the proposed method produced the best result for all of the cases 6 conclusion and future works in this study an efficient method for ship route planning was proposed through the mathematical formulation of a ship route planning problem as an optimization problem whereby a simultaneous optimization of the path and the speed of the ship was enabled in addition to sensitivity analyses the performance of the proposed method was evaluated alongside those of some other methods according to a comparative test the results show that the proposed method can yield the route with the lowest tfoc although the total distance is not the shortest to check the applicability of the proposed method it was applied to three cases in all the cases the proposed method yielded the best tfoc result through the generation of smooth routes and the use of the speed optimization the mean tfoc reduction using the proposed method is approximately 12 1 compared with the dijkstra algorithm and it is approximately 10 2 compared with the isochrone method as shown in the summary of table 15 in addition the proposed method yielded a correct route for a complicated region in the future various objective functions such as sea keeping operability and structural safety will be included besides the tfoc in the optimization problem we will improve the methods for estimating ship performance of this study from the practice based to theory based methods that is using the results obtained from the practice based method the existing theory based method will be improved through this process the estimation methods that can be used more universally for ship performance will be able to be developed further the results of the proposed method will be validated through a comparison with the actual operation data of a shipping company and the post treatments will be developed to improve the quality and the smoothness of the routes a more refined gsua than in this study will be performed in the future finally we will use an additional map for water depth to check accurately whether a certain point is on the land or at sea and will apply the proposed method to the arctic sea acknowledgments this work was partially supported by a samsung heavy industries co ltd republic of korea and b research institute of marine systems

23429,recently the need for a more efficient method for ship route planning was raised due to the financial crisis in the shipping industry a strengthening of emission regulations and the limitations of the existing methods so far numerous ship route planning methods have been developed but most of them do not correctly reflect the effect of a change of the ship speed in the path determination stage for this study a ship route planning problem was formulated as an optimization problem to solve this a method for a simultaneous determination of the path and the speed of a ship is proposed to check the efficiency and the applicability of the proposed method sensitivity analyses and a comparative test regarding some other methods was performed the proposed method was applied to various examples of ship route planning and the results show that the proposed method can reduce the total fuel consumption compared with the other methods keywords ship route planning path and speed optimization fuel consumption weather conditions 1 introduction 1 1 research background ship route planning is generally the responsibility of the captain and the chief mate in most cases they decide the route depending on their experience at the time of planning and while this does not necessarily cause any problems it can be improved path finding methods and commercial programs can be of assistance and many methods can be used many of the methods however have not fully satisfied user expectations while the available methods and programs for the determination of the optimal route are numerous the existing methods are limited in terms of speed optimization that is an optimization method for which the path and the speed are considered at the same time is absent for these reasons a new method for ship route planning for which the path and the speed are considered simultaneously is proposed in this study 1 2 related studies several of the existing methods can be divided according to cell usage including cell based and cell free methods here a cell means a small region generated from a grid table 1 shows a comparison of cell based and the cell free methods the cell based method generates a path by connecting the center points of the cells on the other hand the cell free method does not use any cell to generate a path it is inevitable that the cell based method must limit the searching direction because the cell shapes are fixed therefore when cell based methods are used the path is rough and angled shaped and post treatments are consequently needed to smooth the route further the concept of time is not contained in the cell based method so the speed optimization should be operated separately alternatively the cell free methods such as the isochrone method do not limit the searching direction and the application of speed optimization into the method is relatively easy many ship route planning studies use a cell based method and the path optimization and the speed optimization are accordingly separated joo et al 2012 found the optimal path in a fixed speed state by using the so called a star algorithm and they modified the path in consideration of the weather conditions by using the dijkstra algorithm afterward the speed on the path was adjusted similarly bang and kwon 2014 found the optimal path in a fixed speed state by using the a star algorithm but they modified the found path in consideration of the weather conditions by using an evolutionary strategy and lastly they adjusted the speed on the path choi et al 2015 targeted the ship route planning for the arctic sea since the weather condition included constant hourly ice changes they developed an ice model in consideration of ice behavior uncertainties they proposed a method for the determination of the optimal path under a time varying weather condition with the use of the a star algorithm however they did not perform a speed optimization on the path park and kim 2015 found the optimal path in a fixed speed state by using the a star algorithm and then adjusted the speed on the path by using geometric programming kim et al 2016 used the hybrid a star algorithm to find the optimal path without any adjustment of ship speed the studies of joo et al 2012 bang and kwon 2014 and park and kim 2015 implemented speed optimization with a separation stage for each of the studies a different optimization method was used but for all three the shortest path was identified in the first stage followed by the adjustment of the speed on the path in the second stage vettor and soares 2016 formulated a ship route planning problem in terms of a multi objective optimization problem for which the positions and speeds are design variables they mainly used the evolutionary algorithm for the formulation of a route that comprises several nodes and specifically the dijkstra algorithm was used to calculate the objective functions between the neighbor nodes this method was therefore named the es evolution strategy dijkstra method due to its similarity to the dijkstra algorithm whereby the speed can be changed at each segment between the nodes several cell free methods have been developed roh 2013 proposed an improved isochrone method for ship route planning whereby obstacles such as land are considered wei and zhou 2012 used three dimensional 3d dynamic programming to propose a method for ship route planning that is similar to the isochrone method similarly chen 2013 developed a program that is based on 3d dynamic programming 3d dynamic programming has been used in many studies since then zaccone et al 2016 used 3d dynamic programming to perform the optimization of path and speed profile zaccone and figari 2017 complemented the part of ship response modeling in the previous study to optimize the path and speed of the ship developed by shi 2016 en energy saver is a commercial program for ship route planning that finds the path by using an improved isochrone method and then performs speed optimization using a genetic algorithm eniram route eniram 2017 is a commercial program that uses empirical data that are based on the actual ship route in this study a method that is a type of cell free method is proposed to determine the path and the speed simultaneously to overcome the limitations of the existing methods table 2 is a summary of the related studies 2 method for a simultaneous determination of path and speed 2 1 problem definition solving a ship route planning problem is finding the route from the departure to arrival ports the route can be referred to as the combination of the path and the speed in shipping operations the path is determined by a series of ship directions while the speed is determined by a series of engine revolutions per minute rpm settings meanwhile the route is determined by numerous criteria such as the fuel oil consumption foc sea keeping operability etc among these criteria the total fuel oil consumption tfoc which indicates the monetary providence of the route is the most representative to obtain the tfoc of a given route some information in table 3 should be given as input data as shown when constructing the route the data described in table 3 at specific locations within each node or segment is required therefore geographical information or weather conditions information are needed from the departure to the arrival port in the case of weather information since the information may change with the progress of time in each example of this study we used weather information from one day before departure to 3 days after eta with this information the tfoc can be estimated using a specific method in ship route planning the determined route should satisfy a number of constraints such as the avoidance of obstacles such as land and an adherence to the arrival time in table 3 the geographic information is used to determine whether the position where a ship passes is land or not in this study we have identified the geographic information by dividing a map into a square grid and judged whether the corresponding latitude and longitude are land or sea by binary value for each grid using the geographic information we can calculate the avoidance of obstacles which is one of the constraints of the problem for ship route planning 2 2 formulation of the optimization problem to determine an economical route the optimal route problem is formulated as an optimization problem each component of the problem is described in the subsequent sub sections 2 2 1 design variables in this study it is assumed that one route consists of a series of nodes nodes are the intermediate points between the departure and arrival ports the design variables of the optimization problem are therefore the direction or heading angle θ θ 0 θ 1 θ i θ n 1 and the engine rpm rpm rpm 0 rpm 1 rpm i rpm n in equation 2 of the ship at each node as shown in fig 1 in addition it is assumed that the time between two adjacent nodes is a constant value for example 12 h as shown in fig 1 if the directions are determined the positions of nodes can be determined the direction is related to the path and the engine rpm is related to the speed of the ship if the number of nodes is n from p 1 to p n n directions from θ 0 to θ n 1 and n 1 rpms from rpm 0 to rpm n should be determined as the design variables the direction at the last node p n is not needed since the arrival port p arrival or p n 1 is given and the direction from p n to p arrival is automatically determined the total number of design variables in this problem is therefore 2n 1 by connecting all the nodes including the departure and arrival ports the route path and speed can be obtained 2 2 2 objective function in this study the tfoc is used as an objective function which is a criterion for the selection of the best from a number of alternatives the tfoc depends on the route that is the values of the design variables including the weather condition the tfoc estimation is described as shown in equation 1 1 minimize t f o c θ r p m this objective function can be easily changed into others such as arrival time total distance and so on in order to take all of the above into consideration various preferences from the captain or the ship owner should be reflected 2 2 3 constraints four constraints are used in this study first the ship should not arrive at the arrival port beyond the latest time of arrival eta max equation 2 second the route for the ship should not pass through obstacles such as land equation 3 in addition in the case of the heading angle the ship is constrained from moving in the wrong direction that is the heading angle is constrained to change no more than 30 it can be changed according to the designer s preference from the orientation of the previous node and the first node is unrestricted equation 4 the engine rpm is constrained to change from its minimum to maximum values e g 70 to 85 they can be changed according to engine specifications equation 5 although the foc of the transient segment due to the change of the engine rpm between each node should be taken into consideration we assumed that the interval of the node presented in this study is more than an hour and the foc by this transient segment is negligible in tfoc in equation 3 the constant ε land represents the minimum distance between the route and the land considering some margin e g longitude and latitude of 0 25 it can be changed according to the designer s preference for safe voyage such as the avoidance of the land shallow water etc 2 e t a θ r p m e t a max 0 3 ε l a n d l a n d p i p i θ r p m 0 4 θ i 1 30 θ i θ i 1 30 5 r p m min r p m i r p m max this optimization problem is therefore a kind of constrained optimization problem that comprises 2n 1 design variables one objective function and four forms of the inequality constraints 2 3 estimation of the foc the performance of a ship changes according to the weather conditions roh 2013 with a problematic sea state such as high waves for example the total ship resistance increases the ship speed also reduces due to the increasing ship resistance in case of constant propulsion setting and additional power is needed to correct the reduced ship speed thereby leading to additional fuel consumption either a theory based or practice based method can be used for the estimation of the tfoc to estimate the tfoc according to the sea state with the use of a theory based method iso 15016 2015 the amount of increased ship resistance should first be calculated second it is necessary to calculate the reduced ship speed according to the increase of the ship resistance third the increased power for the recovery of the ship speed should be calculated lastly it is necessary to calculate the additional fuel consumption according to the increase of power at this time a two stage method is also available to predict fuel consumption coraddu et al 2013 alternatively for the practice based method a regression model that is made using past ship operation data is applied the theory based method is systematic and elaborate but the estimated value needs to be adjusted with the operation data to increase the estimation accuracy while the practice based method is easy to use it is difficult to apply it in building a regression model between these two methods the practice based method is used in this study with the help of one of the shipping companies that is the nonlinear multiple regression model is used to estimate the route based foc of the ship in consideration of the weather conditions meanwhile the heading angle one of the design variables is the heading angle in over water over ground angle and speed are used to estimate the direction and speed of a ship from the theory based method in the theory based method it is a general procedure to obtain the speed that is increased or decreased due to environmental loads wave wind current and swell and the changed direction by using over ground angle and speed however as mentioned in section 2 3 we did not use the theory based method described above but rather the practice based method using past ship operation data one of the advantages of the practice based method is that it does not require complicated procedures to get over water angle and speed since it is the measurement of the ship operation data including environmental loads the heading angle and speed can be calculated in over water considering the environmental loads the nonlinear multiple regression model consists of three equations for the three pieces of output information the reduced ship speed power and ufoc fuel consumption per unit time which were generated from 14 sets of input data engine rpm aft draft forward draft heading angle wind direction wind speed wave direction wave height wave period swell direction swell height swell period current direction and current speed these equations include a coefficient a i and an exponent b i for each variable as shown in equation 6 and they were determined by multiple regression analysis using the past ship operation data of about 30 000 measured in pacific ocean the model was provided by samsung heavy industries and the error of the model is within 0 5 comparing with the actual data in order to check the feasibility of the model a test was carried out on a well known relation for example a ship power is proportional to the third power of the engine rpm and the ship power is proportional to the third power of speed using the proposed model curves of rpm power rpm ufoc curve and speed power were generated as shown in fig 2 when generating the curves weather related variables were set to 0 and the design draft was used 6 u

r e c t i o n b 14 the weather conditions in table 3 and the route information are given as the input data by multiplying the ufoc by the time duration the fuel consumption can be estimated for the given distance fig 3 shows the procedure for foc estimation including the input and output data 2 4 generation of the route the departure and arrival positions are ones of input data not constraints the optimal route problem in this study has design variables of the direction and the engine rpm of the ship at each node including departure and arrival positions therefore the first pair of design variables θ 0 rpm 0 represents the direction and the engine rpm of the ship at the departure position the final heading angle is not specified as a design variable since the final heading angle is determined at the last node p n by using the arrival position given as input data by constructing the route in this way we can eliminate constraints on departure and arrival positions in the optimal route problem if the direction and the engine rpm at the present node are the design variables and the time duration between the two nodes is given the position of the next node is p i 1 as shown in equation 7 and fig 4 more specifically to move from a specific position p i to the next position p i 1 three pieces of information are required the heading angle θ i and rpm i at p i generated from the optimization algorithm and the user defined time duration δt are required using the weather and ship information at p i ship performance power speed and ufoc can be calculated as described in section 2 3 then using the calculated speed and heading angle the next position p i 1 can be obtained by equation 7 if this step is performed for all the nodes and then all the nodes are connected and the route can be obtained in addition the tfoc is also obtained by accumulating the foc from all the nodes 7 p i 1 p i x v i sin θ i δ t p i y v i cos θ i δ t 2 5 avoidance of obstacles when generating the route the segment between two nodes can interfere with obstacles such as land therefore a suitable method is required to check whether the segment interferes with any land masses or water too shallow for the ship in this study a geographic map that has been generated from the geographic information on the route is used the determination like whether the route passes through the land is carried out in segments between adjacent nodes design variables such as heading angle and rpm determine the position of nodes and segments using the geographic map we can recognize whether the position is land or not therefore land in equation 5 can be said to be the function using information for detecting land and sea given by geographic map and position p i at this time a certain margin denoted as ε land in equation 3 is considered to secure the safe route having no interference with the land including shallow water the constant ε land represents the minimum distance between the route and the land considering some margin e g longitude and latitude of 0 25 it can be changed according to the designer s preference for the safe voyage such as the avoidance of the land shallow water etc since the geographic information includes the information on the land and the sea it is possible to check whether a certain point on the route is on the land or at sea first a world map is divided into a number of cells through the insertion of evenly distributed horizontal and vertical lines into the world map e g longitude and latitude of 1 in fig 5 a accordingly the map is called geographic map in this study for each cell the geographic information is used to check whether the centroid of the cell is on land considering the margin ε land or at sea if it is on land the value of the cell is 1 and if it is not on land the cell value is 0 here to use the centroid of the cell can be inaccurate however if some margin ε land is considered this method can be acceptable of course we can use four points of the cell instead of its centroid although it requires more computation time each route segment is then divided into several portions e g 1 in fig 5 a or 0 5 in fig 5 b and then several checking points are made for each checking point the cell is found on the geographic map and if the value of the cell is 1 the checking point is on land due to the possibility that the segment including the checking point could interfere with the land the route that comprises the segment cannot be selected as an optimal route at this time the accuracy of the method depends on the level of detail of the geographic map that is as the cell sizes are decreased e g longitude and latitude of 0 5 in fig 5 b the accuracy of the method is increased and the computation time of the method is lengthened one more thing we can check whether a certain point is on the land or at sea is to use an additional map for water depth and a new constraint for water depth e g w d min w d θ r p m 0 where wd θ rpm is the water depth of the given point from the map and wd min is the minimum depth for voyage 2 6 optimization algorithm optimization algorithms are generally divided into global and local optimization algorithms and the former comprises several types including the genetic algorithm ga goldberg 1989 several classes of the local optimization algorithm including sequential quadratic programming sqp arora 2011 also exist each of these local optimization algorithms can be used to effectively find the optimum however in some cases these local optimization algorithms find an optimum that is relatively close to the starting point to overcome the existing limitation the nsga non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii deb et al 2002 global optimization algorithm which is a well known and proven ga was selected for this study to solve the ship route planning optimization problem that was formulated in each step 3 implementation of the prototype program a prototype program that is based on the proposed method for which the c language is used was developed for this study in the prototype program multi layered maps are used to find the optimal route the multi layered maps consist of three different maps first the geographic map includes the geographic information regarding the route and each cell in the map has a binary value that represents the land and the sea the route based tfoc of the ship depends on the weather condition the weather map includes the on route weather conditions and a specific weather condition is relevant for each cell at a certain time the last map is the world image map which includes the shape of the world including the land and the sea that is used to visualise the result of the ship route planning with these maps the geographic information weather conditions information and pixel information can all be obtained for a certain ship position moreover the level of detail of each map can be different 4 sensitivity analyses and comparative test 4 1 sensitivity analyses if a model is set global sensitivity and uncertainty analyses gsua should be done gsua aims to understand the origin and control of uncertainty convertino et al 2014 in general gsua is used to verify humanities and chemical models however gsua can also be applied to structural engineering design and optimal design of experiments kontoravdi et al 2005 most gsua are conducted using independent design variables unfortunately in this study some of the design variables among θ 0 and θ n 1 among rpm 0 and rpm n for the optimization are correlated and coupled input samples for coupled design variables are more laborious to generate and even worse the sample size needed to compute sensitivity measures for non independent samples is much higher than in the case of uncorrelated samples saltelli et al 2008 for this reason we have performed sensitivity analyses of several available variables in this section four sensitivity analyses are conducted first the effect of changing the constraint for ship heading angle was analysed here we changed corresponding constraints and investigated the effects fig 6 and table 4 show the results of the analysis from the results the change of the constraint for ship heading angle by 15 and 60 did not change the solution therefore an angle restriction of 30 is considered suitable in most cases second the effect of changing the constraint for engine rpm was analysed in the proposed method the engine rpm for each segment can freely change this gives a much higher variability in the speed variation thus the change of the speed seems more frequent which can affect fuel consumption to check the effect on the optimization we considered two cases fig 7 and table 5 show the results if there is the limitation on the number of changes of the engine rpm the result is unsatisfactory due to the limitation on free speed control in terms of tfoc and total distance next the effect of changing the time duration was analysed we changed the time duration to 3 6 12 and 24 h and compared the results of each case fig 8 and table 6 show the results if the time duration is too short the result is unsatisfactory due to too frequent change of the heading angle and engine rpm on the other hand if the time duration is too long the number of cases where speed control is possible is reduced and the solution is worse finally fig 9 and table 7 show the results for the variation of the objective function this analysis shows that the proposed method can be used for various purposes by changing the objective function the results show that if the objective function is changed the route is correctly searched for the corresponding purpose 4 2 comparative test to check the efficiency and the applicability of the proposed method a comparative test regarding the other methods was performed as shown in table 8 in this table the es a star method implemented by the authors was made possible by the replacement of the dijkstra algorithm in the es dijkstra method with the a star algorithm in the case of the improved isochrone method one of commercial programs was used here and lastly proposed2 is a version of the proposed method for which the path design variables were changed from the directions to the positions the route from busan korea to long beach usa was solved and compared for one of the examples and table 9 shows the results of the comparative test the isochrone method yielded the route with the shortest distance but the highest tfoc the a star algorithm yielded the route with the shortest computation time but the longest distance the proposed method yielded the route with the least tfoc from this comparison with the other methods the capacity of the proposed method enables the provision of the most economical route in terms of the minimum tfoc 5 applications 5 1 definition of cases the proposed method and the prototype program were also applied to various examples and the results are described and discussed in this section a summary of all the cases is shown in table 10 case 1 and case 2 are pacific ocean routes in terms of these routes the land impact is relatively small except near the departure and arrival ports but the impact of the weather conditions appears prominently especially the weather conditions at the departure time in march case 1 is problematic but that of the departure time in june case 2 is favourable cases 3 corresponds to the complicated route where there are many islands between the departure and arrival ports a 4600 teu container ship was used for these applications the detail information of the ship is shown in table 11 5 2 results and discussion 5 2 1 case 1 fig 10 shows a visualisation of the results of the ship route planning for case 1 in the case of the isochrone and the proposed methods the time duration of each segment is 12 h table 12 shows detailed information of the results the proposed method yielded the best route in terms of the tfoc although the total distance is longer than the isochrone method in terms of the computation time the result of the a star algorithm is the shortest time whereas the es dijkstra method required the longest time in the cases of the cell free methods the isochrone and the proposed methods smoother shaped routes were generated compared with the cell based methods the dijkstra algorithm the a star algorithm and the es dijkstra method fig 11 shows a comparison between the results the proposed method performed a simultaneous optimization of the path and speed on the route alternatively for comparative purposes the isochrone method used a fixed engine rpm in this figure the yellow circles represent the favourable weather condition regions whereas the green circles represent the problematic weather condition regions four graphs are shown along the longitude in this figure as follows engine rpm ship speed foc and foc per unit distance in these graphs the blue line is the result of the isochrone method and the red line is the result of the proposed method in the engine rpm graph top left in fig 11 the engine rpm is variable for the proposed method whereas it is fixed for the isochrone method for the proposed method the engine rpm in the favourable weather condition regions increased whereas the engine rpm in the problematic weather condition regions decreased in the graph of the ship speed top right in fig 11 for the proposed method the ship speed in the favourable weather condition regions increased whereas it decreased in the problematic weather condition regions here the increase of the ship speed in the favourable weather condition regions compensates for the loss of the ship speed in the problematic weather condition regions to satisfy the eta requirement in the foc graph bottom left in fig 11 for the proposed method the change of the foc according to the weather condition is similar to that of the engine rpm alternatively since the engine rpm of the isochrone method is maintained even in the problematic weather condition regions the foc increased suddenly in these regions from the results of this case the impact of the speed optimization on the minimisation of the tfoc is major actually the tfoc of the proposed method is less than that of the isochrone method by approximately 4 8 as shown in table 12 5 2 2 case 2 fig 12 shows visualisation of the results for the ship route planning for case 2 according to the five methods here the results are for favourable weather conditions with a low wave height and a low wind speed table 13 shows detailed information of the results the proposed method yielded the best route in terms of the tfoc the a star algorithm yielded the route with the highest tfoc and the longest distance but its route computation time is the shortest furthermore the route shape of the a star algorithm is rougher compared with the other methods fig 13 shows a comparison between the results akin to the other cases the proposed method yielded a more economical route than that of the isochrone method through the speed optimization 5 2 3 case 3 fig 14 and table 14 show the results for the ship route planning for the route from singapore to karachi the results of this case are for a complicated route and calm sea conditions with no waves or wind the proposed method yielded a suitable route that passes through the strait of malacca however the other methods yielded routes with the land interference of thailand 5 2 4 summary of the results a summary of all the results and the corresponding comparison are shown in table 15 as is discussed previously the proposed method produced the best result for all of the cases 6 conclusion and future works in this study an efficient method for ship route planning was proposed through the mathematical formulation of a ship route planning problem as an optimization problem whereby a simultaneous optimization of the path and the speed of the ship was enabled in addition to sensitivity analyses the performance of the proposed method was evaluated alongside those of some other methods according to a comparative test the results show that the proposed method can yield the route with the lowest tfoc although the total distance is not the shortest to check the applicability of the proposed method it was applied to three cases in all the cases the proposed method yielded the best tfoc result through the generation of smooth routes and the use of the speed optimization the mean tfoc reduction using the proposed method is approximately 12 1 compared with the dijkstra algorithm and it is approximately 10 2 compared with the isochrone method as shown in the summary of table 15 in addition the proposed method yielded a correct route for a complicated region in the future various objective functions such as sea keeping operability and structural safety will be included besides the tfoc in the optimization problem we will improve the methods for estimating ship performance of this study from the practice based to theory based methods that is using the results obtained from the practice based method the existing theory based method will be improved through this process the estimation methods that can be used more universally for ship performance will be able to be developed further the results of the proposed method will be validated through a comparison with the actual operation data of a shipping company and the post treatments will be developed to improve the quality and the smoothness of the routes a more refined gsua than in this study will be performed in the future finally we will use an additional map for water depth to check accurately whether a certain point is on the land or at sea and will apply the proposed method to the arctic sea acknowledgments this work was partially supported by a samsung heavy industries co ltd republic of korea and b research institute of marine systems
