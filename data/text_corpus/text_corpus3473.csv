17365,the presence of lead in drinking water creates a public health crisis as lead causes neurological damage at low levels of exposure the objective of this research is to explore modeling approaches to predict the risk of lead at private drinking water systems this research uses bayesian network approaches to explore interactions among household characteristics geological parameters observations of tap water and laboratory tests of water quality parameters a knowledge discovery framework is developed by integrating methods for data discretization feature selection and bayes classifiers forward selection and backward selection are explored for feature selection discretization approaches including domain knowledge statistical and information based approaches are tested to discretize continuous features bayes classifiers that are tested include general bayesian network naive bayes and tree augmented naive bayes which are applied to identify directed acyclic graphs dags bayesian inference is used to fit conditional probability tables for each dag the bayesian framework is applied to fit models for a dataset collected by the virginia household water quality program vahwqp which collected water samples and conducted household surveys at 2 146 households that use private water systems including wells and springs in virginia during 2012 and 2013 relationships among laboratory tested water quality parameters observations of tap water and household characteristics including plumbing type source water household location and on site water treatment are explored to develop features for predicting water lead levels results demonstrate that naive bayes classifiers perform best based on recall and precision when compared with other classifiers copper is the most significant predictor of lead and other important predictors include county ph and on site water treatment feature selection methods have a marginal effect on performance and discretization methods can greatly affect model performance when paired with classifiers owners of private wells remain disadvantaged and may be at an elevated level of risk because utilities and governing agencies are not responsible for ensuring that lead levels meet the lead and copper rule for private wells insight gained from models can be used to identify water quality parameters plumbing characteristics and household variables that increase the likelihood of high water lead levels to inform decisions about lead testing and treatment keywords bayesian belief network lead in drinking water contamination classification water quality 1 introduction lead is a common contaminant in drinking water and can cause serious neurological problems even at low levels of exposure the world health organization identifies lead as one of the major chemical contaminants threatening public health world health organization 2016 the presence of lead in drinking water creates a public health crisis and the u s environmental protection agency usepa developed the lead and copper rule lcr to regulate lead in public drinking water systems although there is no known safe level of lead exposure vorvolakos et al 2016 world health organization 2016 the lcr specifies that public drinking water systems must control the corrosivity of drinking water and if more than 10 of tap water samples exceed the lead action level of 15 parts per billion ppb additional actions to mitigate lead are required united states environmental protection agency 1991 high levels of lead have been identified in drinking water at locations across the globe including australia harvey et al 2016 canada deshommes et al 2016 safruk et al 2017 germany fertmann et al 2004 zietz et al 2001 hong kong lee et al 2016 and the u k moore et al 1977 lead in water has significantly affected some u s cities including washington d c edwards et al 2009 greenville nc durham nc renner 2009 and flint mi hanna attisha et al 2016 pieper et al 2018 during these water contamination crises the concentration of lead in tap water exceeded regulatory thresholds and the percentage of children with elevated blood lead levels increased guidotti et al 2007 hanna attisha et al 2016 repercussions for children are more significant because childhood exposure to lead poisoning is known to have long term irreversible effects such as loss of academic performance decline in problem solving skills hyperactivity and increased risk of alzheimer s disease later in life reuben 2018 wani et al 2015 detecting and removing lead in water is a problem of global importance that should be addressed to protect future generations the attention of both the public and the research community has been drawn to issues around lead in water through recent and notable crises such as the flint water crisis of 2014 households that are exposed to high water lead levels wlls should be identified rapidly to mitigate exposure through preventative measures however widespread testing is expensive and preventative mitigation across households in a community through replacing service lines and premise plumbing is impractical predicting wlls in tap water through a modeling approach can generate insight to target households that are at high risk of lead the development of predictive models to accurately classify or quantify lead in water is limited however because the presence of lead in drinking water is attributed to a combination of complex characteristics including lead bearing plumbing corrosive water and corrosion control pieper et al 2019 other water quality parameters such as iron copper and ph and observations of tap water including odor taste and discoloration may also be correlated with the presence of lead pieper et al 2019 a comprehensive understanding of the relationships among household characteristics plumbing materials source water treatment options water quality parameters and observations about tap water can provide new mechanisms for developing predictive models to classify wlls in this research new data associated with household and tap water characteristics are explored to identify relationships among features for predicting wlls this research explores these relationships to develop data driven models that predict the risk of lead in household tap water many complex environmental systems have been modeled using data driven approaches which include machine learning and statistical approaches chau 2006 yetilmezsoy et al 2011 data driven models rely on large data sets that describe observations of system parameters rather than using insight about underlying mechanistic processes data driven models have a wide range of applicability and have been applied to diagnose predict control and describe complicated and non linear problems chen et al 2008 nishant et al 2020 data driven models have been developed to monitor and assess water quality gharibi et al 2012 sengorur et al 2015 predict water production sakizadeh and rahmatinia 2017 zhang et al 2019 and identify water contamination khalil et al 2005 owusu et al 2020 sakizadeh and rahmatinia 2017 ucun ozel et al 2020 wang et al 2019 these studies develop models using deep neural networks ensembles of decision trees and extreme gradient boosting nishant et al 2020 efforts in developing data driven models can be summarized into two broad categories descriptive and predictive studies in descriptive studies models are developed to derive meaningful insights about the system understand system processes and capture existing rules or patterns that emerge in data etaati 2018 friedenthal et al 2015 predictive approaches use data driven techniques to learn patterns from data and estimate future outcomes kuhn and johnson 2013 descriptive modeling has been applied to understand the spatial and temporal patterns of wlls in the flint michigan water distribution system during the 2014 crisis abokifa et al 2020 goovaerts 2017a 2017b time trend analysis was conducted for flint data to understand how temporal trends in wlls differed for state controlled and crowdsourced sampling programs and at locations across the city goovaerts 2017b goovaerts 2017a concluded that crowdsourced sampling efforts better represented the flint housing stock based on characteristics such as lead service lines lsls and construction year when compared to state controlled sampling efforts spatiotemporal trends of wlls collected through crowdsourced efforts were explored using spatial autocorrelation analysis abokifa et al 2020 the study identified spatial patterns including hotspot regions of high wlls and found that areas with a high density of lsls were significantly correlated with wll hotspots abokifa et al 2020 predictive models on the other hand have been developed using statistical and machine learning approaches to predict or classify wlls in public drinking water systems abernethy et al 2016 chojnacki et al 2017 goovaerts 2018 2019 hajiseyedjavadi et al 2020 a number of classifiers including random forest logistic regression linear discriminant analysis and extreme gradient boosting were explored to assess the risk of lead contamination in individual homes and neighborhoods in flint abernethy et al 2016 chojnacki et al 2017 these models were trained on a comprehensive database that includes residential water tests historical records city infrastructure data census data parcel data and household characteristics in their work abernethy et al 2016 and chojnacki et al 2017 identified that the most important features for the predictive models are geographical features i e location parcel id and property zip code water infrastructure properties i e lead service lines and hydrant types and household characteristics i e property age household value and land value multivariate geostatistical methods were applied to classify lead in drinking water using spatial information such as census data parcel data and lsls goovaerts 2018 2019 hajiseyedjavadi et al 2020 explored lead in the pittsburgh water and sewer authority system and applied random forest models gradient boosting and artificial neural networks to classify wlls above the action level 15 ppb gradient boosting was identified as the best predictive model among the three approaches in classifying lead contamination based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve the most important features for gradient boosting models include geographical location household characteristics and indicators of lateral materials hajiseyedjavadi et al 2020 machine learning approaches can accurately capture and predict complex systems but the models have complex structures are difficult to interpret and do not provide insight about the relationships among variables mittelstadt et al 2019 alternatively a bayesian belief network bbn is a statistical modeling method that uses a data driven approach to develop a compact and intuitive graphical model for representing probabilistic relationships among variables heckerman and wellman 1995 korb and nicholson 2004 bbns provide principled approaches to find explanations for observed evidence by modeling the quantitative strength of the relationship between variables and representing probabilistic beliefs about relationships these beliefs are updated based on observed data about the system pearl 2014 bbn models are commonly used in environmental assessment and management problems because they can handle diverse scales and uncertainty and they can effectively incorporate domain knowledge in the modeling process kelly et al 2013 bbn models have been used in water domains where data are scarce phan et al 2016 they have been implemented to model and assess a range of environmental and water quality systems carvajal et al 2017 kabir et al 2015 reckhow 1999 troldborg et al 2013 the ability of bbns to update beliefs or probabilities using new information about a subset of the variables which is known as partial evidence provides a robust tool to predict in uncertain conditions yuan et al 2011 further because bbns use a structured modeling approach the relationships among features can be readily inspected and understood from the dag that is generated through the modeling process the studies described above that utilize data from the flint water crisis and lead in the pittsburgh water and sewer authority system focus on public drinking water systems private drinking water systems on the other hand are not regulated by the usepa or subject to the requirements of the lcr united states environmental protection agency 1993 2012 though these systems serve approximately 14 of u s households maupin et al 2014 although owners of private drinking water systems are responsible for ensuring that their water is safe from contaminants they typically do not participate in testing to measure lead levels in tap water to gain information about their lead exposure consequently residents using private drinking water systems are more vulnerable to contaminated water because they lack the equipment pieper et al 2015b swistock et al 2013 and training morris et al 2016 to treat and manage lead in tap water to reduce the risk of exposure to lead in drinking water from private drinking water systems new tools are needed to measure and predict the risk of lead in individual households this research develops a bbn framework to classify wlls for private drinking water systems using household water quality and geological parameters the bbn framework is applied using data that were provided by the virginia cooperative extension s virginia household water quality program vahwqp this data set includes responses to surveys collected at households that use private water systems including observations by residents about their water the dataset includes features that were not available for developing predictive models in previous research abernethy et al 2016 chojnacki et al 2017 goovaerts 2018 2019 hajiseyedjavadi et al 2020 and observations about water discoloration odor and taste that are collected by residents may be subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to the subjective nature of these observations as described above the bbn approach is suited to handle uncertainty in input features and generate reliable predictions this research explores alternative bbn classifiers and methods for discretization and feature selection to construct a prediction tool for assessing the risk of lead for individual households that use private water systems the data discovery framework linking discretization feature selection and classifiers is applied to identify the dependent relationships among wlls plumbing type source of water household location treatment options and resident perceptions of water quality bbn models are trained to classify wlls above 15 ppb for private drinking water systems using the lcr regulation and results demonstrate the most effective combination of feature selection method discretization method and bayes classifier to classify lead features are explored for their importance in contributing to accurate lead classification 2 materials and methods 2 1 virginia private wells dataset drinking water samples were collected at 2 146 private drinking water systems including wells 96 of samples and springs 4 of samples by vahwqp during 2012 and 2013 the proportion of water samples collected in each county with wlls greater than 15 ppb is shown in fig s1 additional details about sample collection and analysis is documented elsewhere pieper et al 2015c in brief residents collected first draw samples that were analyzed for lead pb iron fe and copper cu and one minute flushed samples analyzed for sulfate so4 ph and hardness aesthetic properties and household characteristics were also collected through a questionnaire completed by residents residents described their source of water well type well depth type of treatment device if any water testing interval premise plumbing material and water characteristics such as taste color odor staining on the fixture and floating particles in the tap water samples were also analyzed for a number of other water quality constituents in total 42 features i e water quality and system characteristics were collected for each sample and the dataset was finalized through data integration and pre processing fig 1 the dataset was cleaned to remove samples with missing values which resulted when respondents did not answer survey questions or water quality parameters were not measured missing values were treated using the following rule if the total number of missing values for one feature exceeded a threshold i e 5 of the total number of samples then the feature was removed from the dataset otherwise the sample was removed from the dataset the dataset was reduced to 2 134 samples including 39 features and one predicted variable pbx which is the presence of lead at a concentration above the action level as measured in the first flush all variables are listed in table s1 2 2 bayesian belief network framework this research develops a data discovery framework fig 1 to identify models that classify water samples as contaminated or uncontaminated a model is constructed through the processes of discretization which is applied to five continuous variables ph hardness copper iron and sulfate feature selection and bayes classification each model is evaluated through cross validation based on a set of metrics that evaluate model performance framework components are described in the following sections 2 2 1 bayes classifiers bayes classifiers are built based on bayes theorem for developing inferences about relationships between variables through causal and probabilistic structures specified as a bbn heckerman and wellman 1995 a bbn is a probabilistic graphical model where nodes represent random variables that are connected via directed acyclic graphs dags schematics of three bbn dags are shown in fig s5 dags represent causal relationships between variables to facilitate predictive and diagnostic reasoning pearl 2014 the strength of the relationship between a pair of variables is quantified by a conditionally probability table cpt and each node is assigned a cpt to specify its relationship with a connected node han et al 2012 korb and nicholson 2004 bayes theorem updates probabilities in the cpt using new datapoints for the set of variables three classifiers described as follows are used in this research to explore the performance of alternative bbn structures naïve bayes nb is the simplest classifier fig s5a an nb model is constructed with one parent node or classification feature shown as c in fig s5a and all other feature nodes f i nodes in fig s5a are considered children of the parent node the parent node in this research is the variable pbx or the presence of lead at a concentration above the action level measured in the first flush the model is constructed with the assumption that the children nodes are independent and connections between children nodes are not allowed tree augmented naive bayes tan is similar to the nb model fig s5b for tan models however there is no assumption that children nodes are independent and network structures are formed that allow connections between pairs of children nodes general bayesian network gb is unlike the nb and tan models in that the classification attribute pbx is not treated distinctly from other attribute nodes fig s5c the classification attribute is not assumed to necessarily be the parent of other attribute nodes and may be a child or parent node in the network the bbn framework was coded in r and the bbn models were developed using the bnlearn package scutari 2010 2 2 2 discretization bayes classifiers are most often used with discrete or discretized variables discretizing variables that are continuous can improve the performance accuracy and interpretation of bbns madhu et al 2014 tsai et al 2008a yang and webb showed that discretization can effectively reduce the error of a nb classifier yang and webb 2002 2003 2009 both domain knowledge and data driven methods can be applied to transform continuous variables to discrete variables in domain knowledge approaches data are discretized based on expert knowledge previous studies and literature this research tests a domain knowledge approach and uses epa guidelines to discretize continuous variables including iron copper and sulfate hardness and ph are discretized using categories identified through expert knowledge this research also tests data driven discretization methods which use statistical and information based approaches statistical methods use statistical evaluation or tests to measure the correlation between the values of a feature and the target class kotsiantis and kanellopoulos 2006 statistical methods implemented in this study include approaches from the chi square χ 2 family including chi square huan liu and setiono 1997 chimerge american association for artificial intelligence and randy 1992 extended chi square chao ton su and jyh hwa hsu 2005 and modified chi square tay and lixiang shen 2002 other statistical methods including class attribute interdependence maximization caim kurgan and cios 2004 class attribute contingency coefficient cacc tsai et al 2008b and ameva gonzalez abril et al 2009 are also tested information based methods use entropy or other information theory measures such as the gini index in discretizing variables garcia et al 2013 the minimum description length principle mdlp is an information based method that is applied in this study fayyad and irani 1993 we used the discretization package in r kim 2012 to implement data driven discretization approaches 2 2 3 feature selection feature selection is the process of searching for the best subset of features feature selection can reduce model overfitting decrease model complexity and improve model performance by eliminating unnecessary redundant and mutually correlated features guyon and de 2003 two common methods for feature selection are forward selection and backward elimination which are robust computationally efficient and use a greedy search to find the best subset of features guyon and de 2003 algorithms for forward selection and backward elimination are depicted in fig s6 forward selection is initialized with an empty model that contains no features and features are added to the model one at a time until all features have been added fig s6 at each step the feature with the highest performance based on a predefined metric recall precision accuracy or f 1 as described in section 2 2 4 is added to the model backward elimination begins with a model containing all features and progressively removes the feature with the lowest performance for a predefined metric at each step guyon and de 2003 james et al 2000 2 2 4 performance metrics classifiers are evaluated using a set of commonly used metrics that are calculated using the confusion matrix which shows the performance of a model in predicting samples within four classes fig s7 true positives t p and true negatives t n denote the number of positive and negative samples that are correctly identified respectively in this research positive samples correspond to samples with wll above the action level 15 ppb and negative samples correspond to samples with wll below the action level false positives f p denotes the number of negative samples incorrectly identified as positive and false negatives f n indicates the number of positive samples incorrectly identified as negative using the confusion matrix performance metrics including recall precision and accuracy are calculated as follows 1 a c c u r a c y t p t n t p f n f p t n 2 r e c a l l t p t p f n 3 p r e c i s i o n t p t p f p accuracy represents the proportion of samples that are correctly classified and evaluates the overall performance of a classifier for a balanced dataset imbalanced datasets on the other hand include a disproportionate number of positive or negative samples using accuracy to evaluate classifiers for imbalanced datasets can give a false indication that the classifier performance is high when in fact the classifier simply predicts all samples as belonging to the majority class recall and precision can be used instead to evaluate classification performance for imbalanced datasets recall represents the ability of a model to correctly classify the relevant cases or positive samples within a dataset and it is calculated as the ratio of predicted true positive samples to all positive samples gains in recall lead to a loss of precision which measures the accuracy of a model when it classifies a sample as positive precision is calculated as the ratio of true positives to all samples that are predicted as positive to consider both recall and precision simultaneously the f score family is used which calculates the weighted harmonic mean of recall and precision to address challenges associated with imbalanced data sets wang et al 2015 in this study the f 1 score is used which uses equal weights for recall and precision as shown in eqn 4 the f 1 score varies between zero and one representing the worst and the best performances respectively 4 f 1 2 r e c a l l p r e c i s i o n r e c a l l p r e c i s i o n 2 2 5 cross validation cross validation estimates the generalized error associated with a model to evaluate its performance k fold cross validation is a common method to estimate model performance and select hyperparameters james et al 2000 kuhn and johnson 2013 which define the method that is used for each step of building the classification model shown in fig 1 to increase the precision of the estimate of model performance this research executes multiple runs of k fold cross validation kim 2009 molinaro et al 2005 for r runs of k fold cross validation at each run r the dataset is randomly split into k mutually exclusive folds one fold k is kept as the validation set and the remaining folds are grouped as the training set the training set is used to fit and build the predictive model and performance metrics are calculated and reported for the validation set m r k i in eqn 5 the overall performance for each metric and hyperparameter setting m i is the average of the performance of all models that have been constructed through the process of cross validation 5 m i 1 r r 1 r 1 k k 1 k m r k i in this study the dateset is split into training and testing data sets using the ratio 80 20 to evaluate the performance of models and tune model hyperparameters this research uses 10 runs of 10 fold cross validation applied for the training data set 3 results the data discovery framework shown in fig 1 was tested for 54 experiments using exhaustive combinations of nine discretization methods three classifiers and two feature selection methods for each experiment 10 runs of 10 fold cross validation were executed the spatial distribution of training data for all runs is shown in fig s2 and the spatial distribution of testing data that are used to evaluate all models is shown in fig s4 these figures demonstrate that the testing dataset uniformly covers the area covered by the samples that are used to create the training dataset fig s3 shows the training and validation samples of each fold for one run of the cross validation procedure this figure demonstrates that the training and validation data are uniformly distributed across the areas where samples are collected results are reported as the average recall precision accuracy and f 1 over 100 validation datasets shown in eqn 5 tables of performance metrics for the trials are provided in the supplementary information section tables s2 s7 the performance of classifiers and feature selection methods are presented in fig 2 for precision accuracy recall and f1 averaged over discretization methods the range of performance or the height of the box in fig 2 indicates the performance of the classifier across discretization methods performance for each combination of classifier discretization method and feature selection method is reported for accuracy and f1 in fig s8 and for precision and recall in fig s9 in general the accuracy of all models was similar at around 80 fig 2 this is because the dataset is imbalanced and approximately 80 of samples are negative wll 15 ppb recall is an important measure because it highlights the performance of accurately identifying positive samples while penalizing models for misclassifying positive samples as negative and the majority of the models report recall values less than 50 fig 2 precision also measures the ability of the model to classify positive samples but penalizes models for misclassifying negative samples as positive for this application positive samples need to be accurately identified to alert households to the risk of lead and the ability of the model to classify positive samples as positive or avoid misclassifying positive samples as negative is more important that classifying negative samples as negative models typically show a trade off between recall and precision and because f 1 is based on both recall and precision it provides a comprehensive representation of model performance for this study recall and f 1 are viewed as a critical performance metrics 3 1 bayes classifiers gb models red numbers in fig s8 have in general high values for accuracy and the highest performance based on precision figs 2 and s9 the highest performing gb models were constructed using cacc and ameva discretization approaches red 1 s and 2 s respectively with little difference between the two feature selection methods f 1 scores and recall associated with gb models however are lower than that of nb and tan classifiers tan classifiers using chimerge discretization report the highest values for recall though these models report a lower value for precision compared to other models blue 5 s in fig s9 while tan classifiers perform relatively well with respect to recall and f 1 fig 2 and gb models perform well for accuracy and precision nb models are able to best balance and maximize competing goals i e recall and f 1 the nb classifier provides models with the highest f 1 score reporting relatively high performance among other metrics as shown in figs s8 and s9 nb models are located in the upper right of the graphs in a compromise region of the two goals two nb models found using the mdlp discretization method green 8 s were selected as the best models overall and are described further below along with the best performing model for the tan and gb classifiers the range of performance for nb models is narrow fig 2 especially for backward elimination when compared with other classifiers indicating that the nb models perform robustly regardless of which discretization method is selected 3 2 feature selection two feature selection methods are tested in this framework and the effect of the feature selection method is marginal for most classifiers as shown in fig 2 the performance for each classifier across metrics is similar for forward selection and backward elimination in general the performance of models is driven by the discretization method and the bayes classifier however applying feature selection helps to improve the performance of the model as parameters are added to or removed from the model the improvement in performance measured as recall is demonstrated as part of the model construction process in figs s10 s11 for backward elimination and in fig s12 for forward selection these figures show how the feature selection helps to reduce noise as the band representing the 90 confidence interval around both training and validation datasets is reduced through the feature selection process the model interpretability is improved by limiting the number of variables that are required to classify the target variable lead and the model performance is improved by removing unnecessary variables that create an overly complex model structure for example in fig s12 the recall value is improved from 30 when all features were included in the tan model to 62 2 when only the best subset of features are extracted through forward selection 3 3 discretization in this study the majority of variables were discrete however there are a few continuous variables including ph hardness iron sulfate and copper that must be discretized for use in bbn models tables 1 and 2 show the results for each of the discretization approaches table 1 reports the boundaries found for continuous variables using the domain knowledge method while the number of bin boundaries that were identified through the data based discretization approaches are reported in table 2 while the information based criteria for the mdlp method focus on homogeneous intervals to discretize features the chi square family criteria focus on sufficient sample size in every interval to ensure generalization boulle 2004 kotsiantis and kanellopoulos 2006 the number of categories specified by chi square chimerge and cacc is high and these methods require very precise water quality data for continuous variables the performance of models that were built using the domain knowledge discretization method 6 s in figs s8 and s9 is near to the average over all data driven models for each of the performance metrics the highest performing discretization method varies for different classifiers in general however mdlp ameva and chimerge lead to high performing models 3 4 selected nb model for nb models mldp was the highest performing discretization method shown as green 8 s in figs s8 and s9 the best nb model small green 8 in figs s8 and s9 was found using mldp and backward elimination and is selected as the best performing model overall the best nb model performs well based on precision 45 5 and recall 47 59 and outperforms tan and gb models based on f 1 score 46 65 and accuracy 81 8 figs s8 and s9 other models typically show a trade off between precision and recall but the best nb model performs well for both metrics the best nb model classifies 169 samples as true positives and 1577 samples as true negatives the model classifies 202 samples as false positives and 186 samples as false negatives fig 3 shows the structure of the best nb model this model has 16 edges and 17 nodes three of the nodes represent discretized water quality parameters the difference in performance between the two methods of feature selection for training the nb model is small but backward elimination performs marginally better than forward selection the sequence of eliminating variables to form the best nb model as determined through backward elimination is shown in fig s10 the variable sulfate so 4 was removed in the first step and recall improves or increases as more variables are removed from the model when the variable iron fex was removed from the model the recall value decreased and continued to decrease as additional variables were removed the reduction in the value of recall remained small until the variables copper cux ph and other pipes pipe other were removed from the model these three variables alone can predict 44 of contaminated samples which is very similar to the recall value of the best nb model 47 6 the training curve of the nb model is shown in fig s10 the curve demonstrates how the 90 confidence interval is maintained for the training and validation data recall values as features are removed from the model when all variables are included in the model the training recall value is higher than the validation data recall indicating that the model is overfitted the best model is selected as described above black diamond in fig s10 and the difference between the validation and training data curves at that point is small indicating that the model is not overfitted the estimation of recall that is formed using the validation dataset is determined to be reasonable because the recall for the testing data falls within one standard deviation from the mean recall of the validation data the recall of the testing data is shown as a red triangle in fig s10 the nb model shown in fig 3 is selected as the best model over all models generated and the performance of nb classifiers is explored further in the following sub sections based on variations in the wll threshold and the size of partitions used to create training and testing data 3 4 1 wll thresholds the best nb modeling approach is used to explore model performance for different wll thresholds in the results reported above the wll threshold is set at 15 ppb based on epa guidelines no level of lead however is considered safe and we explore how an nb model could classify lead levels using alternative thresholds two new models were developed using mldp discretization backward elimination and the nb classifier the same 10 fold cross validation approach was applied for 10 runs and results are reported for the average training and testing data for 100 models where training performance is reported for validation data as shown in eqn 5 table 3 shows the performance of models for wll thresholds of 5 and 10 ppb compared with the performance of the nb model trained for a wll threshold of 15 ppb the models have similar performance although the model performance for training data increases for recall precision and f 1 for lower wll thresholds while accuracy decreases new data sets that are created using lower wll thresholds for positive samples have a higher number of positive samples and a slightly more balanced data set leading to improved performance for recall precision and f 1 model performance for the testing data has a similar trend although the performance for recall increases by a very small margin for lower wll thresholds though there are more positive samples available to train the models classification of wlls remains a difficult variable to predict 3 4 2 training and testing data partitions a learning curve was generated to explore how the partition of training vs testing data affects the performance of classifiers table 4 in this experiment the percentage of data that was used to train and validate the model varied from 50 to 90 and the remaining data was used to test the model again new models were developed using mldp discretization backward elimination and the nb classifier the 10 fold cross validation approach was applied for 10 runs and results are reported for the average training and testing data for 100 models as shown in table 4 the performance of models with respect to recall is similar across all partitions of training data for the testing data however the performance of models increases to approximately 53 when the training data set is allocated at 50 60 and 70 of the data at higher percentages including 80 and 90 there is some overfitting and though the recall for the training data set is relatively high the recall for the testing data set is lower for precision accuracy and f1 the loss of performance for testing data occurs at 90 instead of 80 indicating that for these metrics the model is not overfitted for partitions 50 60 70 and 80 3 5 selected gb model the highest performing discretization method for the gb model was the cacc approach red 2 s in figs s8 and s9 these gb models outperform nb and tan models based on precision fig s9 at an average of 49 5 and their accuracy is also relatively high at an average of 83 3 fig 2 the best gb model small red 2 in figs s8 and s9 was found using cacc and backward elimination fig 4 shows the structure of the selected gb model the gb model has a more complex structure than the best nb model with more edges and multiple connections between nodes the convergence of backward elimination in removing variables from the model and the corresponding model performance for cross validation are shown in fig s11 the first variable removed is iron measured in the first flush fex and recall improves in the next step after the variable copper pipe is eliminated the recall varies little for subsequent steps with marginal changes and there is only a slight difference in the performance of the best model which was found after removing sulfur odor and subsequent models constructed during backward elimination these results demonstrate that a simple gb model with two variables including ph and copper measured in the first flush cux can predict positive samples nearly as well as more complex models with a recall of 33 8 the learning curve for the gb model fig s11 shows that the difference between the training and validation recall values does not change substantially as features are removed recall values between these two data sets are similar indicating that the model is not overfitted the recall for the testing data set is within one standard deviation of the mean of the validation data which indicates that the validation recall is a reasonable estimate of the model recall 3 6 selected tan model the tan models that are constructed using the chimerge discretization method blue 5 s in figs s8 and s9 are the highest performing tan models these models have the highest recall value among all models at an average of 62 the high value of recall is associated with poor performance in precision that is there is a high number of false positives in the results and these models predict a higher number of contaminated water samples than is represented in the dataset while the best nb and gb models were found using backward elimination the best tan model large blue 5 in figs s8 and s9 was found using forward selection and chimerege discretization fig 5 shows the structure of the best tan model this model is constructed of only 10 nodes which is a smaller set of nodes than the best gb and nb models in terms of model complexity however the tan model has more edges than the best nb model in addition the chimerge discretization method split continuous parameters into very small intervals requiring high precision in water quality data table 2 the steps of feature selection and the corresponding model performance in cross validation are shown in fig s12 the tan requires at least three nodes including the target variable and the tan model was initialized with two variables ph and cux for forward selection hardness was added in the first step and recall improves further as more variables are added to the model after the variable treatment lead was added to the model the recall value decreased and continued to decrease as more variables were added the value of recall continued to decrease as more variables were added to the model four water quality variables ph cux hardness and fex can predict 60 9 of contaminated samples which is very similar to the recall value of the best tan model at 62 2 the learning curve that is generated for the tan model fig s12 is notably different than that for the nb and gb models the recall for the training data at nearly 1 0 is much higher than the recall reported for the validation data across all features indicating that the model is overfitted the tan model is developed using the chimerge discretization which fits a large number of bins to discretize features by using a high number of bins the model is overfitted to the training data 3 7 feature importance three bbn models are reported above as the selected model for each of the classifier methods the three models each includes copper measured in the first flush cux and ph as features in the predictor set and the nb and tan models also include hardness measured in the first flush hardnessx treatment decisions appear in each of the models though they are represented using different variables for example lead treatment appears in the gb model and chemical treatment appears in the tan and nb models perceptions of water quality such as odor appearance or taste appear in all three models and similarly pipe type appears in two of the three models in total 54 bbn models were created through this analysis the complete list of features included in each bbn model is shown in tables s8 and s9 these results demonstrate that copper cux is the most common feature appearing in 52 models ph appears in 38 of the models sulfate is present in 34 models hardness appears in 30 models and iron appears in 20 of 54 models feature importance is evaluated based on the average relative reduction in recall when a feature is removed from a model fig s13 copper county and ph are the top three most important features and result in a relative reduction in recall of 37 9 27 8 and 25 7 respectively the five water quality parameters are among the top seven features with county and metallic taste as features that can substantially affect model recall data used to calculate feature importance is reported in tables s8 and s9 our prior work has shown that lead in private wells in virginia can be primarily attributed to the corrosion of brass fittings and fixtures pieper et al 2015c brass is composed of copper zinc and lead so when brass corrodes these elements are released into water when there are high levels of copper in the water residents may notice a blue green staining due to the deposition of the copper due to lead s correlation with copper this perception can be an indicator of lead in water and high copper concentration is indicative of the presence of lead corrosion is an electrochemical process and low ph waters have increased levels of hydrogen ions resulting in accelerated corrosion rates in addition at higher ph levels passivation layers such as oxides will form and protect again corrosion as a result it is expected that ph is a significant predictor of lead the results of our analysis of feature importance validates our working knowledge of water quality parameters that indicate lead from modeling results we also gain new insight that predictive models cannot rely on homeowner reported observations alone but some observations such as county metallic taste copper pipes and treatment options as shown in fig s13 can contribute to better predictions through the bbn approach 4 discussion this research explores bbn models for classifying lead at private drinking water systems through a combination of procedures that are used in constructing a bbn model 54 distinct models are generated the combination of classifier discretization and feature selection affect the performance of models for competing objectives of precision recall and accuracy selection of a model for predicting lead in private drinking water systems should be based on an appropriate performance metric such as recall precision or accuracy in this research we focus on recall because accurate detection of positive samples or contaminated water is of highest concern when protecting households from high levels of lead in water in addition the dataset is imbalanced with a low number of positive samples nb and tan models have higher performance with respect to recall when compared with gb models and the best tan model reports a higher recall value than the best nb model the nb approach is selected as the best model in this research nb models perform well for competing goals of recall and f 1 and report the highest score for f 1 which captures both recall and precision further nb models have a robust performance regardless of the discretization method that is used in tandem with the classifier feature selection methods backward elimination and forward selection perform similarly well across the experiments the selection of the discretization methods affects the perform of models depending on the classifier that is used domain knowledge discretization may be expected to show low performance as it is the only method that is not based on characteristics of the data itself domain knowledge discretization performs better than some data driven discretization methods for example in fig s8 models that are developed using domain knowledge discretization have an f 1 value greater that 0 3 outperforming models that are developed using extended chi square and modified chi square other discretization methods however report higher values for f 1 than domain knowledge discretization analysis of the learning curve that explored the partition between training and testing data revealed that splits of 80 20 and 70 30 lead to models that are not overfitted while this research uses a 80 20 split a 70 30 split leads to higher recall values for validation data and a more conservative split is recommended for future research the time associated with developing models was evaluated for the modeling framework the framework was implemented for a personal computer of configuration intel core i7 4770 with cpu 3 4 ghz and 20 gb memory the training time is affected most by the choice of the bayes classifier the gb model requires approximately one day to train each model because the relationship between the classification node is not specified a priori nb models can be constructed more quickly requiring approximately 30 minutes for each model discretization and feature selection methods also contribute to the time of computation forward selection performs faster compared to the backward elimination and requires approximately 15 20 less time than backward elimination for each simulation data driven discretization methods require 15 25 minutes for each method the goals of this research are to explore relationships among features of a rich dataset and develop models for predicting lead in tap water at households the findings of this research indicate that copper and ph are two of the most important features for predicting lead in many of the models that were generated through this research chemical properties as tested by a laboratory were more important predictors than household observations of water or household characteristics the requirement for laboratory tested input to predict lead is a limitation for how the models developed in this research could be used at a household level each of the selected bbn models includes copper in the first flush as a predictor and accurately and precisely monitoring copper is difficult for households some water quality parameters however such as ph and hardness may be more easily measured at households through readily available at home water testing strips some discretization methods do not require high precision in differentiating water quality values and low resolution data from test strips may suffice on going research is exploring how bbn models can be used with low resolution water quality as collected through at home water quality tests to provide a ready tool for users of private drinking water systems some parameters including copper may be more accurately measured by at home strips compared with lead measurements and estimations of copper may be adequate to use as a feature to predict lead copper is typically in the dissolved form while lead can be particulate or dissolved making lead more challenging to detect pieper et al 2015a kriss et al other predictors that can be easily characterized by households such as observations about taste odor and discoloration and plumbing type are also demonstrated as important predictors in bbn models while the bbn models do not rely solely on these observations to predict lead household reported values contribute to the prediction of lead and help to improve the predictability of models for example observations of metallic taste and rusty staining can substantially affect the recall associated with model causing an average relative reduction in recall of 11 8 and 9 1 respectively when those features are removed from a model location data based on county is also an important predictor for many of the models that were identified here further work can explore how well models based on measurements of lead at neighboring private water systems can predict lead models that are developed through this research are based on data collected at private water systems across virginia based on the performance for testing data it is expected that the level of performance of these models may remain high for new private water systems that are tested in virginia or in systems with similar characteristics in source water and geophysical formations further testing is needed to explore the predictive capability of these models for wells in diverse locations the models developed in this research can be applied at the household level for private drinking water systems to classify lead approximately 14 of u s households rely on private drinking water systems maupin et al 2014 and these systems are not regulated by the usepa or subject to the requirements of the lcr united states environmental protection agency 1993 2012 residents using private systems are vulnerable to contaminated water because they lack the equipment pieper et al 2015b swistock et al 2013 and training morris et al 2016 to manage lead in tap water new models are needed that can be distributed to lay persons to predict the risk of lead at individual households bbn models generate a dag that can be viewed to understand the relationships among features and lead levels increasing awareness about the cause of lead in tap water within communities that use private drinking water systems further research that addresses the limitations described above will contribute to solutions for under served populations on private water systems that do not have access to lead mitigation and monitoring technologies 5 conclusions predicting lead at the point of use is complicated by confounding factors that contribute to high wlls this research develops a predictive model to classify household level risk of lead based on household plumbing and source water characteristics the bbn models developed in this research are used to develop an understanding about the occurrence of lead at private water systems and provide insight that can be used to mitigate lead in drinking water a data discovery framework was developed to apply methods to select features for building models discretize continuous water quality variables and train bayesian classifiers the nb model was identified as the best classifier for classifying lead based on metrics of recall and f 1 for training and validation data water chemistry parameters including copper and ph were the most important features for predicting lead and observations made by households contribute to the predictive capabilities of models while the requirement of precise and accurate water quality parameters for predicting lead limits the application of the models that are developed here this research yields new insight about the relationships among water quality parameters household characteristics and observations about water future work can explore how low resolution water quality data provided through at home water quality test kits can contribute to predictability of models for classifying lead future efforts can also focus on implementation of the bbn framework on broader samples of private wells from various geographical regions to develop a prediction model that can be applied in areas served by private water systems across the u s the bbn models that are developed in this research do not use geographic or location based features beyond county as predictors and it is expected that these models can be trained using additional data for application in new regions households with private drinking water systems are vulnerable to high water lead levels and need a set of tools for managing lead risk the research presented in this manuscript develops a framework that can be applied to develop models to classify risks for households and generate insight for managing and mitigating lead exposure declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

17365,the presence of lead in drinking water creates a public health crisis as lead causes neurological damage at low levels of exposure the objective of this research is to explore modeling approaches to predict the risk of lead at private drinking water systems this research uses bayesian network approaches to explore interactions among household characteristics geological parameters observations of tap water and laboratory tests of water quality parameters a knowledge discovery framework is developed by integrating methods for data discretization feature selection and bayes classifiers forward selection and backward selection are explored for feature selection discretization approaches including domain knowledge statistical and information based approaches are tested to discretize continuous features bayes classifiers that are tested include general bayesian network naive bayes and tree augmented naive bayes which are applied to identify directed acyclic graphs dags bayesian inference is used to fit conditional probability tables for each dag the bayesian framework is applied to fit models for a dataset collected by the virginia household water quality program vahwqp which collected water samples and conducted household surveys at 2 146 households that use private water systems including wells and springs in virginia during 2012 and 2013 relationships among laboratory tested water quality parameters observations of tap water and household characteristics including plumbing type source water household location and on site water treatment are explored to develop features for predicting water lead levels results demonstrate that naive bayes classifiers perform best based on recall and precision when compared with other classifiers copper is the most significant predictor of lead and other important predictors include county ph and on site water treatment feature selection methods have a marginal effect on performance and discretization methods can greatly affect model performance when paired with classifiers owners of private wells remain disadvantaged and may be at an elevated level of risk because utilities and governing agencies are not responsible for ensuring that lead levels meet the lead and copper rule for private wells insight gained from models can be used to identify water quality parameters plumbing characteristics and household variables that increase the likelihood of high water lead levels to inform decisions about lead testing and treatment keywords bayesian belief network lead in drinking water contamination classification water quality 1 introduction lead is a common contaminant in drinking water and can cause serious neurological problems even at low levels of exposure the world health organization identifies lead as one of the major chemical contaminants threatening public health world health organization 2016 the presence of lead in drinking water creates a public health crisis and the u s environmental protection agency usepa developed the lead and copper rule lcr to regulate lead in public drinking water systems although there is no known safe level of lead exposure vorvolakos et al 2016 world health organization 2016 the lcr specifies that public drinking water systems must control the corrosivity of drinking water and if more than 10 of tap water samples exceed the lead action level of 15 parts per billion ppb additional actions to mitigate lead are required united states environmental protection agency 1991 high levels of lead have been identified in drinking water at locations across the globe including australia harvey et al 2016 canada deshommes et al 2016 safruk et al 2017 germany fertmann et al 2004 zietz et al 2001 hong kong lee et al 2016 and the u k moore et al 1977 lead in water has significantly affected some u s cities including washington d c edwards et al 2009 greenville nc durham nc renner 2009 and flint mi hanna attisha et al 2016 pieper et al 2018 during these water contamination crises the concentration of lead in tap water exceeded regulatory thresholds and the percentage of children with elevated blood lead levels increased guidotti et al 2007 hanna attisha et al 2016 repercussions for children are more significant because childhood exposure to lead poisoning is known to have long term irreversible effects such as loss of academic performance decline in problem solving skills hyperactivity and increased risk of alzheimer s disease later in life reuben 2018 wani et al 2015 detecting and removing lead in water is a problem of global importance that should be addressed to protect future generations the attention of both the public and the research community has been drawn to issues around lead in water through recent and notable crises such as the flint water crisis of 2014 households that are exposed to high water lead levels wlls should be identified rapidly to mitigate exposure through preventative measures however widespread testing is expensive and preventative mitigation across households in a community through replacing service lines and premise plumbing is impractical predicting wlls in tap water through a modeling approach can generate insight to target households that are at high risk of lead the development of predictive models to accurately classify or quantify lead in water is limited however because the presence of lead in drinking water is attributed to a combination of complex characteristics including lead bearing plumbing corrosive water and corrosion control pieper et al 2019 other water quality parameters such as iron copper and ph and observations of tap water including odor taste and discoloration may also be correlated with the presence of lead pieper et al 2019 a comprehensive understanding of the relationships among household characteristics plumbing materials source water treatment options water quality parameters and observations about tap water can provide new mechanisms for developing predictive models to classify wlls in this research new data associated with household and tap water characteristics are explored to identify relationships among features for predicting wlls this research explores these relationships to develop data driven models that predict the risk of lead in household tap water many complex environmental systems have been modeled using data driven approaches which include machine learning and statistical approaches chau 2006 yetilmezsoy et al 2011 data driven models rely on large data sets that describe observations of system parameters rather than using insight about underlying mechanistic processes data driven models have a wide range of applicability and have been applied to diagnose predict control and describe complicated and non linear problems chen et al 2008 nishant et al 2020 data driven models have been developed to monitor and assess water quality gharibi et al 2012 sengorur et al 2015 predict water production sakizadeh and rahmatinia 2017 zhang et al 2019 and identify water contamination khalil et al 2005 owusu et al 2020 sakizadeh and rahmatinia 2017 ucun ozel et al 2020 wang et al 2019 these studies develop models using deep neural networks ensembles of decision trees and extreme gradient boosting nishant et al 2020 efforts in developing data driven models can be summarized into two broad categories descriptive and predictive studies in descriptive studies models are developed to derive meaningful insights about the system understand system processes and capture existing rules or patterns that emerge in data etaati 2018 friedenthal et al 2015 predictive approaches use data driven techniques to learn patterns from data and estimate future outcomes kuhn and johnson 2013 descriptive modeling has been applied to understand the spatial and temporal patterns of wlls in the flint michigan water distribution system during the 2014 crisis abokifa et al 2020 goovaerts 2017a 2017b time trend analysis was conducted for flint data to understand how temporal trends in wlls differed for state controlled and crowdsourced sampling programs and at locations across the city goovaerts 2017b goovaerts 2017a concluded that crowdsourced sampling efforts better represented the flint housing stock based on characteristics such as lead service lines lsls and construction year when compared to state controlled sampling efforts spatiotemporal trends of wlls collected through crowdsourced efforts were explored using spatial autocorrelation analysis abokifa et al 2020 the study identified spatial patterns including hotspot regions of high wlls and found that areas with a high density of lsls were significantly correlated with wll hotspots abokifa et al 2020 predictive models on the other hand have been developed using statistical and machine learning approaches to predict or classify wlls in public drinking water systems abernethy et al 2016 chojnacki et al 2017 goovaerts 2018 2019 hajiseyedjavadi et al 2020 a number of classifiers including random forest logistic regression linear discriminant analysis and extreme gradient boosting were explored to assess the risk of lead contamination in individual homes and neighborhoods in flint abernethy et al 2016 chojnacki et al 2017 these models were trained on a comprehensive database that includes residential water tests historical records city infrastructure data census data parcel data and household characteristics in their work abernethy et al 2016 and chojnacki et al 2017 identified that the most important features for the predictive models are geographical features i e location parcel id and property zip code water infrastructure properties i e lead service lines and hydrant types and household characteristics i e property age household value and land value multivariate geostatistical methods were applied to classify lead in drinking water using spatial information such as census data parcel data and lsls goovaerts 2018 2019 hajiseyedjavadi et al 2020 explored lead in the pittsburgh water and sewer authority system and applied random forest models gradient boosting and artificial neural networks to classify wlls above the action level 15 ppb gradient boosting was identified as the best predictive model among the three approaches in classifying lead contamination based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve the most important features for gradient boosting models include geographical location household characteristics and indicators of lateral materials hajiseyedjavadi et al 2020 machine learning approaches can accurately capture and predict complex systems but the models have complex structures are difficult to interpret and do not provide insight about the relationships among variables mittelstadt et al 2019 alternatively a bayesian belief network bbn is a statistical modeling method that uses a data driven approach to develop a compact and intuitive graphical model for representing probabilistic relationships among variables heckerman and wellman 1995 korb and nicholson 2004 bbns provide principled approaches to find explanations for observed evidence by modeling the quantitative strength of the relationship between variables and representing probabilistic beliefs about relationships these beliefs are updated based on observed data about the system pearl 2014 bbn models are commonly used in environmental assessment and management problems because they can handle diverse scales and uncertainty and they can effectively incorporate domain knowledge in the modeling process kelly et al 2013 bbn models have been used in water domains where data are scarce phan et al 2016 they have been implemented to model and assess a range of environmental and water quality systems carvajal et al 2017 kabir et al 2015 reckhow 1999 troldborg et al 2013 the ability of bbns to update beliefs or probabilities using new information about a subset of the variables which is known as partial evidence provides a robust tool to predict in uncertain conditions yuan et al 2011 further because bbns use a structured modeling approach the relationships among features can be readily inspected and understood from the dag that is generated through the modeling process the studies described above that utilize data from the flint water crisis and lead in the pittsburgh water and sewer authority system focus on public drinking water systems private drinking water systems on the other hand are not regulated by the usepa or subject to the requirements of the lcr united states environmental protection agency 1993 2012 though these systems serve approximately 14 of u s households maupin et al 2014 although owners of private drinking water systems are responsible for ensuring that their water is safe from contaminants they typically do not participate in testing to measure lead levels in tap water to gain information about their lead exposure consequently residents using private drinking water systems are more vulnerable to contaminated water because they lack the equipment pieper et al 2015b swistock et al 2013 and training morris et al 2016 to treat and manage lead in tap water to reduce the risk of exposure to lead in drinking water from private drinking water systems new tools are needed to measure and predict the risk of lead in individual households this research develops a bbn framework to classify wlls for private drinking water systems using household water quality and geological parameters the bbn framework is applied using data that were provided by the virginia cooperative extension s virginia household water quality program vahwqp this data set includes responses to surveys collected at households that use private water systems including observations by residents about their water the dataset includes features that were not available for developing predictive models in previous research abernethy et al 2016 chojnacki et al 2017 goovaerts 2018 2019 hajiseyedjavadi et al 2020 and observations about water discoloration odor and taste that are collected by residents may be subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to the subjective nature of these observations as described above the bbn approach is suited to handle uncertainty in input features and generate reliable predictions this research explores alternative bbn classifiers and methods for discretization and feature selection to construct a prediction tool for assessing the risk of lead for individual households that use private water systems the data discovery framework linking discretization feature selection and classifiers is applied to identify the dependent relationships among wlls plumbing type source of water household location treatment options and resident perceptions of water quality bbn models are trained to classify wlls above 15 ppb for private drinking water systems using the lcr regulation and results demonstrate the most effective combination of feature selection method discretization method and bayes classifier to classify lead features are explored for their importance in contributing to accurate lead classification 2 materials and methods 2 1 virginia private wells dataset drinking water samples were collected at 2 146 private drinking water systems including wells 96 of samples and springs 4 of samples by vahwqp during 2012 and 2013 the proportion of water samples collected in each county with wlls greater than 15 ppb is shown in fig s1 additional details about sample collection and analysis is documented elsewhere pieper et al 2015c in brief residents collected first draw samples that were analyzed for lead pb iron fe and copper cu and one minute flushed samples analyzed for sulfate so4 ph and hardness aesthetic properties and household characteristics were also collected through a questionnaire completed by residents residents described their source of water well type well depth type of treatment device if any water testing interval premise plumbing material and water characteristics such as taste color odor staining on the fixture and floating particles in the tap water samples were also analyzed for a number of other water quality constituents in total 42 features i e water quality and system characteristics were collected for each sample and the dataset was finalized through data integration and pre processing fig 1 the dataset was cleaned to remove samples with missing values which resulted when respondents did not answer survey questions or water quality parameters were not measured missing values were treated using the following rule if the total number of missing values for one feature exceeded a threshold i e 5 of the total number of samples then the feature was removed from the dataset otherwise the sample was removed from the dataset the dataset was reduced to 2 134 samples including 39 features and one predicted variable pbx which is the presence of lead at a concentration above the action level as measured in the first flush all variables are listed in table s1 2 2 bayesian belief network framework this research develops a data discovery framework fig 1 to identify models that classify water samples as contaminated or uncontaminated a model is constructed through the processes of discretization which is applied to five continuous variables ph hardness copper iron and sulfate feature selection and bayes classification each model is evaluated through cross validation based on a set of metrics that evaluate model performance framework components are described in the following sections 2 2 1 bayes classifiers bayes classifiers are built based on bayes theorem for developing inferences about relationships between variables through causal and probabilistic structures specified as a bbn heckerman and wellman 1995 a bbn is a probabilistic graphical model where nodes represent random variables that are connected via directed acyclic graphs dags schematics of three bbn dags are shown in fig s5 dags represent causal relationships between variables to facilitate predictive and diagnostic reasoning pearl 2014 the strength of the relationship between a pair of variables is quantified by a conditionally probability table cpt and each node is assigned a cpt to specify its relationship with a connected node han et al 2012 korb and nicholson 2004 bayes theorem updates probabilities in the cpt using new datapoints for the set of variables three classifiers described as follows are used in this research to explore the performance of alternative bbn structures naïve bayes nb is the simplest classifier fig s5a an nb model is constructed with one parent node or classification feature shown as c in fig s5a and all other feature nodes f i nodes in fig s5a are considered children of the parent node the parent node in this research is the variable pbx or the presence of lead at a concentration above the action level measured in the first flush the model is constructed with the assumption that the children nodes are independent and connections between children nodes are not allowed tree augmented naive bayes tan is similar to the nb model fig s5b for tan models however there is no assumption that children nodes are independent and network structures are formed that allow connections between pairs of children nodes general bayesian network gb is unlike the nb and tan models in that the classification attribute pbx is not treated distinctly from other attribute nodes fig s5c the classification attribute is not assumed to necessarily be the parent of other attribute nodes and may be a child or parent node in the network the bbn framework was coded in r and the bbn models were developed using the bnlearn package scutari 2010 2 2 2 discretization bayes classifiers are most often used with discrete or discretized variables discretizing variables that are continuous can improve the performance accuracy and interpretation of bbns madhu et al 2014 tsai et al 2008a yang and webb showed that discretization can effectively reduce the error of a nb classifier yang and webb 2002 2003 2009 both domain knowledge and data driven methods can be applied to transform continuous variables to discrete variables in domain knowledge approaches data are discretized based on expert knowledge previous studies and literature this research tests a domain knowledge approach and uses epa guidelines to discretize continuous variables including iron copper and sulfate hardness and ph are discretized using categories identified through expert knowledge this research also tests data driven discretization methods which use statistical and information based approaches statistical methods use statistical evaluation or tests to measure the correlation between the values of a feature and the target class kotsiantis and kanellopoulos 2006 statistical methods implemented in this study include approaches from the chi square χ 2 family including chi square huan liu and setiono 1997 chimerge american association for artificial intelligence and randy 1992 extended chi square chao ton su and jyh hwa hsu 2005 and modified chi square tay and lixiang shen 2002 other statistical methods including class attribute interdependence maximization caim kurgan and cios 2004 class attribute contingency coefficient cacc tsai et al 2008b and ameva gonzalez abril et al 2009 are also tested information based methods use entropy or other information theory measures such as the gini index in discretizing variables garcia et al 2013 the minimum description length principle mdlp is an information based method that is applied in this study fayyad and irani 1993 we used the discretization package in r kim 2012 to implement data driven discretization approaches 2 2 3 feature selection feature selection is the process of searching for the best subset of features feature selection can reduce model overfitting decrease model complexity and improve model performance by eliminating unnecessary redundant and mutually correlated features guyon and de 2003 two common methods for feature selection are forward selection and backward elimination which are robust computationally efficient and use a greedy search to find the best subset of features guyon and de 2003 algorithms for forward selection and backward elimination are depicted in fig s6 forward selection is initialized with an empty model that contains no features and features are added to the model one at a time until all features have been added fig s6 at each step the feature with the highest performance based on a predefined metric recall precision accuracy or f 1 as described in section 2 2 4 is added to the model backward elimination begins with a model containing all features and progressively removes the feature with the lowest performance for a predefined metric at each step guyon and de 2003 james et al 2000 2 2 4 performance metrics classifiers are evaluated using a set of commonly used metrics that are calculated using the confusion matrix which shows the performance of a model in predicting samples within four classes fig s7 true positives t p and true negatives t n denote the number of positive and negative samples that are correctly identified respectively in this research positive samples correspond to samples with wll above the action level 15 ppb and negative samples correspond to samples with wll below the action level false positives f p denotes the number of negative samples incorrectly identified as positive and false negatives f n indicates the number of positive samples incorrectly identified as negative using the confusion matrix performance metrics including recall precision and accuracy are calculated as follows 1 a c c u r a c y t p t n t p f n f p t n 2 r e c a l l t p t p f n 3 p r e c i s i o n t p t p f p accuracy represents the proportion of samples that are correctly classified and evaluates the overall performance of a classifier for a balanced dataset imbalanced datasets on the other hand include a disproportionate number of positive or negative samples using accuracy to evaluate classifiers for imbalanced datasets can give a false indication that the classifier performance is high when in fact the classifier simply predicts all samples as belonging to the majority class recall and precision can be used instead to evaluate classification performance for imbalanced datasets recall represents the ability of a model to correctly classify the relevant cases or positive samples within a dataset and it is calculated as the ratio of predicted true positive samples to all positive samples gains in recall lead to a loss of precision which measures the accuracy of a model when it classifies a sample as positive precision is calculated as the ratio of true positives to all samples that are predicted as positive to consider both recall and precision simultaneously the f score family is used which calculates the weighted harmonic mean of recall and precision to address challenges associated with imbalanced data sets wang et al 2015 in this study the f 1 score is used which uses equal weights for recall and precision as shown in eqn 4 the f 1 score varies

the generalized error associated with a model to evaluate its performance k fold cross validation is a common method to estimate model performance and select hyperparameters james et al 2000 kuhn and johnson 2013 which define the method that is used for each step of building the classification model shown in fig 1 to increase the precision of the estimate of model performance this research executes multiple runs of k fold cross validation kim 2009 molinaro et al 2005 for r runs of k fold cross validation at each run r the dataset is randomly split into k mutually exclusive folds one fold k is kept as the validation set and the remaining folds are grouped as the training set the training set is used to fit and build the predictive model and performance metrics are calculated and reported for the validation set m r k i in eqn 5 the overall performance for each metric and hyperparameter setting m i is the average of the performance of all models that have been constructed through the process of cross validation 5 m i 1 r r 1 r 1 k k 1 k m r k i in this study the dateset is split into training and testing data sets using the ratio 80 20 to evaluate the performance of models and tune model hyperparameters this research uses 10 runs of 10 fold cross validation applied for the training data set 3 results the data discovery framework shown in fig 1 was tested for 54 experiments using exhaustive combinations of nine discretization methods three classifiers and two feature selection methods for each experiment 10 runs of 10 fold cross validation were executed the spatial distribution of training data for all runs is shown in fig s2 and the spatial distribution of testing data that are used to evaluate all models is shown in fig s4 these figures demonstrate that the testing dataset uniformly covers the area covered by the samples that are used to create the training dataset fig s3 shows the training and validation samples of each fold for one run of the cross validation procedure this figure demonstrates that the training and validation data are uniformly distributed across the areas where samples are collected results are reported as the average recall precision accuracy and f 1 over 100 validation datasets shown in eqn 5 tables of performance metrics for the trials are provided in the supplementary information section tables s2 s7 the performance of classifiers and feature selection methods are presented in fig 2 for precision accuracy recall and f1 averaged over discretization methods the range of performance or the height of the box in fig 2 indicates the performance of the classifier across discretization methods performance for each combination of classifier discretization method and feature selection method is reported for accuracy and f1 in fig s8 and for precision and recall in fig s9 in general the accuracy of all models was similar at around 80 fig 2 this is because the dataset is imbalanced and approximately 80 of samples are negative wll 15 ppb recall is an important measure because it highlights the performance of accurately identifying positive samples while penalizing models for misclassifying positive samples as negative and the majority of the models report recall values less than 50 fig 2 precision also measures the ability of the model to classify positive samples but penalizes models for misclassifying negative samples as positive for this application positive samples need to be accurately identified to alert households to the risk of lead and the ability of the model to classify positive samples as positive or avoid misclassifying positive samples as negative is more important that classifying negative samples as negative models typically show a trade off between recall and precision and because f 1 is based on both recall and precision it provides a comprehensive representation of model performance for this study recall and f 1 are viewed as a critical performance metrics 3 1 bayes classifiers gb models red numbers in fig s8 have in general high values for accuracy and the highest performance based on precision figs 2 and s9 the highest performing gb models were constructed using cacc and ameva discretization approaches red 1 s and 2 s respectively with little difference between the two feature selection methods f 1 scores and recall associated with gb models however are lower than that of nb and tan classifiers tan classifiers using chimerge discretization report the highest values for recall though these models report a lower value for precision compared to other models blue 5 s in fig s9 while tan classifiers perform relatively well with respect to recall and f 1 fig 2 and gb models perform well for accuracy and precision nb models are able to best balance and maximize competing goals i e recall and f 1 the nb classifier provides models with the highest f 1 score reporting relatively high performance among other metrics as shown in figs s8 and s9 nb models are located in the upper right of the graphs in a compromise region of the two goals two nb models found using the mdlp discretization method green 8 s were selected as the best models overall and are described further below along with the best performing model for the tan and gb classifiers the range of performance for nb models is narrow fig 2 especially for backward elimination when compared with other classifiers indicating that the nb models perform robustly regardless of which discretization method is selected 3 2 feature selection two feature selection methods are tested in this framework and the effect of the feature selection method is marginal for most classifiers as shown in fig 2 the performance for each classifier across metrics is similar for forward selection and backward elimination in general the performance of models is driven by the discretization method and the bayes classifier however applying feature selection helps to improve the performance of the model as parameters are added to or removed from the model the improvement in performance measured as recall is demonstrated as part of the model construction process in figs s10 s11 for backward elimination and in fig s12 for forward selection these figures show how the feature selection helps to reduce noise as the band representing the 90 confidence interval around both training and validation datasets is reduced through the feature selection process the model interpretability is improved by limiting the number of variables that are required to classify the target variable lead and the model performance is improved by removing unnecessary variables that create an overly complex model structure for example in fig s12 the recall value is improved from 30 when all features were included in the tan model to 62 2 when only the best subset of features are extracted through forward selection 3 3 discretization in this study the majority of variables were discrete however there are a few continuous variables including ph hardness iron sulfate and copper that must be discretized for use in bbn models tables 1 and 2 show the results for each of the discretization approaches table 1 reports the boundaries found for continuous variables using the domain knowledge method while the number of bin boundaries that were identified through the data based discretization approaches are reported in table 2 while the information based criteria for the mdlp method focus on homogeneous intervals to discretize features the chi square family criteria focus on sufficient sample size in every interval to ensure generalization boulle 2004 kotsiantis and kanellopoulos 2006 the number of categories specified by chi square chimerge and cacc is high and these methods require very precise water quality data for continuous variables the performance of models that were built using the domain knowledge discretization method 6 s in figs s8 and s9 is near to the average over all data driven models for each of the performance metrics the highest performing discretization method varies for different classifiers in general however mdlp ameva and chimerge lead to high performing models 3 4 selected nb model for nb models mldp was the highest performing discretization method shown as green 8 s in figs s8 and s9 the best nb model small green 8 in figs s8 and s9 was found using mldp and backward elimination and is selected as the best performing model overall the best nb model performs well based on precision 45 5 and recall 47 59 and outperforms tan and gb models based on f 1 score 46 65 and accuracy 81 8 figs s8 and s9 other models typically show a trade off between precision and recall but the best nb model performs well for both metrics the best nb model classifies 169 samples as true positives and 1577 samples as true negatives the model classifies 202 samples as false positives and 186 samples as false negatives fig 3 shows the structure of the best nb model this model has 16 edges and 17 nodes three of the nodes represent discretized water quality parameters the difference in performance between the two methods of feature selection for training the nb model is small but backward elimination performs marginally better than forward selection the sequence of eliminating variables to form the best nb model as determined through backward elimination is shown in fig s10 the variable sulfate so 4 was removed in the first step and recall improves or increases as more variables are removed from the model when the variable iron fex was removed from the model the recall value decreased and continued to decrease as additional variables were removed the reduction in the value of recall remained small until the variables copper cux ph and other pipes pipe other were removed from the model these three variables alone can predict 44 of contaminated samples which is very similar to the recall value of the best nb model 47 6 the training curve of the nb model is shown in fig s10 the curve demonstrates how the 90 confidence interval is maintained for the training and validation data recall values as features are removed from the model when all variables are included in the model the training recall value is higher than the validation data recall indicating that the model is overfitted the best model is selected as described above black diamond in fig s10 and the difference between the validation and training data curves at that point is small indicating that the model is not overfitted the estimation of recall that is formed using the validation dataset is determined to be reasonable because the recall for the testing data falls within one standard deviation from the mean recall of the validation data the recall of the testing data is shown as a red triangle in fig s10 the nb model shown in fig 3 is selected as the best model over all models generated and the performance of nb classifiers is explored further in the following sub sections based on variations in the wll threshold and the size of partitions used to create training and testing data 3 4 1 wll thresholds the best nb modeling approach is used to explore model performance for different wll thresholds in the results reported above the wll threshold is set at 15 ppb based on epa guidelines no level of lead however is considered safe and we explore how an nb model could classify lead levels using alternative thresholds two new models were developed using mldp discretization backward elimination and the nb classifier the same 10 fold cross validation approach was applied for 10 runs and results are reported for the average training and testing data for 100 models where training performance is reported for validation data as shown in eqn 5 table 3 shows the performance of models for wll thresholds of 5 and 10 ppb compared with the performance of the nb model trained for a wll threshold of 15 ppb the models have similar performance although the model performance for training data increases for recall precision and f 1 for lower wll thresholds while accuracy decreases new data sets that are created using lower wll thresholds for positive samples have a higher number of positive samples and a slightly more balanced data set leading to improved performance for recall precision and f 1 model performance for the testing data has a similar trend although the performance for recall increases by a very small margin for lower wll thresholds though there are more positive samples available to train the models classification of wlls remains a difficult variable to predict 3 4 2 training and testing data partitions a learning curve was generated to explore how the partition of training vs testing data affects the performance of classifiers table 4 in this experiment the percentage of data that was used to train and validate the model varied from 50 to 90 and the remaining data was used to test the model again new models were developed using mldp discretization backward elimination and the nb classifier the 10 fold cross validation approach was applied for 10 runs and results are reported for the average training and testing data for 100 models as shown in table 4 the performance of models with respect to recall is similar across all partitions of training data for the testing data however the performance of models increases to approximately 53 when the training data set is allocated at 50 60 and 70 of the data at higher percentages including 80 and 90 there is some overfitting and though the recall for the training data set is relatively high the recall for the testing data set is lower for precision accuracy and f1 the loss of performance for testing data occurs at 90 instead of 80 indicating that for these metrics the model is not overfitted for partitions 50 60 70 and 80 3 5 selected gb model the highest performing discretization method for the gb model was the cacc approach red 2 s in figs s8 and s9 these gb models outperform nb and tan models based on precision fig s9 at an average of 49 5 and their accuracy is also relatively high at an average of 83 3 fig 2 the best gb model small red 2 in figs s8 and s9 was found using cacc and backward elimination fig 4 shows the structure of the selected gb model the gb model has a more complex structure than the best nb model with more edges and multiple connections between nodes the convergence of backward elimination in removing variables from the model and the corresponding model performance for cross validation are shown in fig s11 the first variable removed is iron measured in the first flush fex and recall improves in the next step after the variable copper pipe is eliminated the recall varies little for subsequent steps with marginal changes and there is only a slight difference in the performance of the best model which was found after removing sulfur odor and subsequent models constructed during backward elimination these results demonstrate that a simple gb model with two variables including ph and copper measured in the first flush cux can predict positive samples nearly as well as more complex models with a recall of 33 8 the learning curve for the gb model fig s11 shows that the difference between the training and validation recall values does not change substantially as features are removed recall values between these two data sets are similar indicating that the model is not overfitted the recall for the testing data set is within one standard deviation of the mean of the validation data which indicates that the validation recall is a reasonable estimate of the model recall 3 6 selected tan model the tan models that are constructed using the chimerge discretization method blue 5 s in figs s8 and s9 are the highest performing tan models these models have the highest recall value among all models at an average of 62 the high value of recall is associated with poor performance in precision that is there is a high number of false positives in the results and these models predict a higher number of contaminated water samples than is represented in the dataset while the best nb and gb models were found using backward elimination the best tan model large blue 5 in figs s8 and s9 was found using forward selection and chimerege discretization fig 5 shows the structure of the best tan model this model is constructed of only 10 nodes which is a smaller set of nodes than the best gb and nb models in terms of model complexity however the tan model has more edges than the best nb model in addition the chimerge discretization method split continuous parameters into very small intervals requiring high precision in water quality data table 2 the steps of feature selection and the corresponding model performance in cross validation are shown in fig s12 the tan requires at least three nodes including the target variable and the tan model was initialized with two variables ph and cux for forward selection hardness was added in the first step and recall improves further as more variables are added to the model after the variable treatment lead was added to the model the recall value decreased and continued to decrease as more variables were added the value of recall continued to decrease as more variables were added to the model four water quality variables ph cux hardness and fex can predict 60 9 of contaminated samples which is very similar to the recall value of the best tan model at 62 2 the learning curve that is generated for the tan model fig s12 is notably different than that for the nb and gb models the recall for the training data at nearly 1 0 is much higher than the recall reported for the validation data across all features indicating that the model is overfitted the tan model is developed using the chimerge discretization which fits a large number of bins to discretize features by using a high number of bins the model is overfitted to the training data 3 7 feature importance three bbn models are reported above as the selected model for each of the classifier methods the three models each includes copper measured in the first flush cux and ph as features in the predictor set and the nb and tan models also include hardness measured in the first flush hardnessx treatment decisions appear in each of the models though they are represented using different variables for example lead treatment appears in the gb model and chemical treatment appears in the tan and nb models perceptions of water quality such as odor appearance or taste appear in all three models and similarly pipe type appears in two of the three models in total 54 bbn models were created through this analysis the complete list of features included in each bbn model is shown in tables s8 and s9 these results demonstrate that copper cux is the most common feature appearing in 52 models ph appears in 38 of the models sulfate is present in 34 models hardness appears in 30 models and iron appears in 20 of 54 models feature importance is evaluated based on the average relative reduction in recall when a feature is removed from a model fig s13 copper county and ph are the top three most important features and result in a relative reduction in recall of 37 9 27 8 and 25 7 respectively the five water quality parameters are among the top seven features with county and metallic taste as features that can substantially affect model recall data used to calculate feature importance is reported in tables s8 and s9 our prior work has shown that lead in private wells in virginia can be primarily attributed to the corrosion of brass fittings and fixtures pieper et al 2015c brass is composed of copper zinc and lead so when brass corrodes these elements are released into water when there are high levels of copper in the water residents may notice a blue green staining due to the deposition of the copper due to lead s correlation with copper this perception can be an indicator of lead in water and high copper concentration is indicative of the presence of lead corrosion is an electrochemical process and low ph waters have increased levels of hydrogen ions resulting in accelerated corrosion rates in addition at higher ph levels passivation layers such as oxides will form and protect again corrosion as a result it is expected that ph is a significant predictor of lead the results of our analysis of feature importance validates our working knowledge of water quality parameters that indicate lead from modeling results we also gain new insight that predictive models cannot rely on homeowner reported observations alone but some observations such as county metallic taste copper pipes and treatment options as shown in fig s13 can contribute to better predictions through the bbn approach 4 discussion this research explores bbn models for classifying lead at private drinking water systems through a combination of procedures that are used in constructing a bbn model 54 distinct models are generated the combination of classifier discretization and feature selection affect the performance of models for competing objectives of precision recall and accuracy selection of a model for predicting lead in private drinking water systems should be based on an appropriate performance metric such as recall precision or accuracy in this research we focus on recall because accurate detection of positive samples or contaminated water is of highest concern when protecting households from high levels of lead in water in addition the dataset is imbalanced with a low number of positive samples nb and tan models have higher performance with respect to recall when compared with gb models and the best tan model reports a higher recall value than the best nb model the nb approach is selected as the best model in this research nb models perform well for competing goals of recall and f 1 and report the highest score for f 1 which captures both recall and precision further nb models have a robust performance regardless of the discretization method that is used in tandem with the classifier feature selection methods backward elimination and forward selection perform similarly well across the experiments the selection of the discretization methods affects the perform of models depending on the classifier that is used domain knowledge discretization may be expected to show low performance as it is the only method that is not based on characteristics of the data itself domain knowledge discretization performs better than some data driven discretization methods for example in fig s8 models that are developed using domain knowledge discretization have an f 1 value greater that 0 3 outperforming models that are developed using extended chi square and modified chi square other discretization methods however report higher values for f 1 than domain knowledge discretization analysis of the learning curve that explored the partition between training and testing data revealed that splits of 80 20 and 70 30 lead to models that are not overfitted while this research uses a 80 20 split a 70 30 split leads to higher recall values for validation data and a more conservative split is recommended for future research the time associated with developing models was evaluated for the modeling framework the framework was implemented for a personal computer of configuration intel core i7 4770 with cpu 3 4 ghz and 20 gb memory the training time is affected most by the choice of the bayes classifier the gb model requires approximately one day to train each model because the relationship between the classification node is not specified a priori nb models can be constructed more quickly requiring approximately 30 minutes for each model discretization and feature selection methods also contribute to the time of computation forward selection performs faster compared to the backward elimination and requires approximately 15 20 less time than backward elimination for each simulation data driven discretization methods require 15 25 minutes for each method the goals of this research are to explore relationships among features of a rich dataset and develop models for predicting lead in tap water at households the findings of this research indicate that copper and ph are two of the most important features for predicting lead in many of the models that were generated through this research chemical properties as tested by a laboratory were more important predictors than household observations of water or household characteristics the requirement for laboratory tested input to predict lead is a limitation for how the models developed in this research could be used at a household level each of the selected bbn models includes copper in the first flush as a predictor and accurately and precisely monitoring copper is difficult for households some water quality parameters however such as ph and hardness may be more easily measured at households through readily available at home water testing strips some discretization methods do not require high precision in differentiating water quality values and low resolution data from test strips may suffice on going research is exploring how bbn models can be used with low resolution water quality as collected through at home water quality tests to provide a ready tool for users of private drinking water systems some parameters including copper may be more accurately measured by at home strips compared with lead measurements and estimations of copper may be adequate to use as a feature to predict lead copper is typically in the dissolved form while lead can be particulate or dissolved making lead more challenging to detect pieper et al 2015a kriss et al other predictors that can be easily characterized by households such as observations about taste odor and discoloration and plumbing type are also demonstrated as important predictors in bbn models while the bbn models do not rely solely on these observations to predict lead household reported values contribute to the prediction of lead and help to improve the predictability of models for example observations of metallic taste and rusty staining can substantially affect the recall associated with model causing an average relative reduction in recall of 11 8 and 9 1 respectively when those features are removed from a model location data based on county is also an important predictor for many of the models that were identified here further work can explore how well models based on measurements of lead at neighboring private water systems can predict lead models that are developed through this research are based on data collected at private water systems across virginia based on the performance for testing data it is expected that the level of performance of these models may remain high for new private water systems that are tested in virginia or in systems with similar characteristics in source water and geophysical formations further testing is needed to explore the predictive capability of these models for wells in diverse locations the models developed in this research can be applied at the household level for private drinking water systems to classify lead approximately 14 of u s households rely on private drinking water systems maupin et al 2014 and these systems are not regulated by the usepa or subject to the requirements of the lcr united states environmental protection agency 1993 2012 residents using private systems are vulnerable to contaminated water because they lack the equipment pieper et al 2015b swistock et al 2013 and training morris et al 2016 to manage lead in tap water new models are needed that can be distributed to lay persons to predict the risk of lead at individual households bbn models generate a dag that can be viewed to understand the relationships among features and lead levels increasing awareness about the cause of lead in tap water within communities that use private drinking water systems further research that addresses the limitations described above will contribute to solutions for under served populations on private water systems that do not have access to lead mitigation and monitoring technologies 5 conclusions predicting lead at the point of use is complicated by confounding factors that contribute to high wlls this research develops a predictive model to classify household level risk of lead based on household plumbing and source water characteristics the bbn models developed in this research are used to develop an understanding about the occurrence of lead at private water systems and provide insight that can be used to mitigate lead in drinking water a data discovery framework was developed to apply methods to select features for building models discretize continuous water quality variables and train bayesian classifiers the nb model was identified as the best classifier for classifying lead based on metrics of recall and f 1 for training and validation data water chemistry parameters including copper and ph were the most important features for predicting lead and observations made by households contribute to the predictive capabilities of models while the requirement of precise and accurate water quality parameters for predicting lead limits the application of the models that are developed here this research yields new insight about the relationships among water quality parameters household characteristics and observations about water future work can explore how low resolution water quality data provided through at home water quality test kits can contribute to predictability of models for classifying lead future efforts can also focus on implementation of the bbn framework on broader samples of private wells from various geographical regions to develop a prediction model that can be applied in areas served by private water systems across the u s the bbn models that are developed in this research do not use geographic or location based features beyond county as predictors and it is expected that these models can be trained using additional data for application in new regions households with private drinking water systems are vulnerable to high water lead levels and need a set of tools for managing lead risk the research presented in this manuscript develops a framework that can be applied to develop models to classify risks for households and generate insight for managing and mitigating lead exposure declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

17366,although remediation of toxic vanadium v v v pollution can be achieved through either heterotrophic or sulfur based autotrophic microbial reduction these processes would require a large amount of organic carbons or generate excessive sulfate this study reported that by using mixotrophic v v bio reduction with acetate and elemental sulfur s 0 as joint electron donors v v removal performance was enhanced due to cooccurrence of heterotrophic and autotrophic activities deposited vanadium iv was identified as the main reduction product by scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray

groundwater 1 introduction vanadium is a widespread element in lithosphere zohar et al 2014 its indispensable role in steel iron industries as well as intensive applications in catalysts and batteries has caused the release of vanadium into the environment carpentier et al 2003 shi et al 2020 although trace amount of vanadium is essential for cell growth continuous exposure to inorganic vanadium compounds would result in serious health effects such as carcinogenic and neurotoxic insults zwolak 2014 cao et al 2017 due to its toxicity and ubiquitous detection in groundwater ortiz bernad et al 2004 vanadium has been regarded as a dangerous pollutant at the same class as lead arsenic and mercury according to united states environment protection agency usepa naeem et al 2007 taking wyoming river in usa as an example the concentration of vanadium in water reaches up to 30 220 mg l due to vanadium mining activities shiller and boyle 1987 which is far beyond the minimum reporting level of 0 20 µg l suggested by the usepa chen and liu 2017 vanadium of 9 66 mg l in groundwater is also reported in a vanadium tailing site in hubei china meng et al 2018 in aquatic environments vanadium

and ren 2014 v v has been widely used in industry and exhibits more serious toxicity jensenfontaine et al 2014 therefore an effective method to detoxify v v is expected to reduce it to v iv which could further form precipitates at natural ph eventually being removed from water patel et al 1989 to date various processes have been proposed to remove v v from contaminated waters for example v v could be removed by adsorption leiviskä et al 2017 ion exchange and chemical reduction reactions yeom et al 2009 li et al 2009 however these physic chemical approaches are not economically viable due to high operational costs thus limiting their applications in groundwater remediation in contrast microbial v v reduction seems to be a promising process for v v removal due to its low operational costs and high potential for in situ groundwater remediation zhang et al 2014 in the past few years v v bio reduction has been realized under either heterotrophic condition or autotrophic condition zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2018a jiang et al 2018 although heterotrophic v v reduction is highly efficient organic matters are not enough to support this process in most natural environments moser et al 2003 the addition of exactly right amount of organic donor is difficult to be achieved while the overfeeding of the organic substrates would cause a secondary contamination such as odor problem and microbial overgrowth lindroos et al 2002 oh et al 2001 yelton et al 2013 even cause bio clogging during in situ applications singh et al 2018 element sulfur s 0 based autotrophic microbial reduction process has several attractive advantages in groundwater remediation and has drawn more attention recently kong et al 2014 shi et al 2019 since no organic substances are needed and less sludge would be produced the secondary organic pollution can be avoided and operational costs can be reduced oh et al 2001 shi et al 2020 nevertheless s 0 based autotrophic v v reduction yields sulfate and acid which would cause another secondary pollution and increase treatment cost sahu et al 2009 s 0 based mixotrophic microbial system that combines the heterotrophic and autotrophic

matters required in heterotrophic activity can be compensated by autotrophy s metabolites claus and kutzner 1985 zhang et al 2020b this synergistic collaboration promotes removals of various pollutants such as nitrate and perchlorate with less organic consumption and sulfate accumulation sahu et al 2009 sahinkaya and dursun 2012 in spite of the increasingly worldwide attention for microbial v v reduction and the utilization of mixotrophic system for contaminated water treatment s 0 based mixotrophic v v reduction system has not been systematically studied so far this study aims to investigate the microbial v v reduction process by combining heterotrophic reduction and s 0 based autotrophic reduction the specific objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the mixotrophic

evaluation figure 1 a shows the concentration profiles of v v for three typical consecutive cycles in mb hb and ab respectively with the initial v v concentration of 50 mg l v v reduction was observed in all bioreactors mb showed the highest removal efficiency of 83 9 3 84 in a 48 h cycle compared to 47 2 2 59 in hb and 35 5 1 71 in ab p 0 05 the average v v reduction rate was 0 87 0 04 mg l h 0 49 0 03 mg l h and 0 37 0 02 mg l h in mb hb and ab respectively suggesting the highest v v removal rate under mixotrophic condition the profiles of dissolved total v in all bioreactors were also recorded and displayed in fig 1b at the end of a 48 h cycle the total v removal efficiency in mb hb and ab was 76 9 0 99 42 6 1 90 and 30 0 3 04 respectively the obtained results demonstrated that mb functioned more efficiently for v v reduction which might be associated with the concurrence of heterotrophic and autotrophic activities zhang et al 2020b compared to heterotrophic or autotrophic conditions stable v v removal performance with high efficiency was obtained under mixotrophic condition during long term operation fig s1 suggesting that sulfur based mixotrophic process was more promising for bioremediation of v v polluted environment the produced precipitates in mb were characterized by using multiple approaches sem image exhibited that these precipitates were associated with microbial biomass fig 2 a eds analysis implied that the precipitates were mainly composed of elements as v s and ca fig 2b the diffraction peaks of cavo3 cav2o5 vo2 vo oh 2 and mgvo3 appeared in the xrd patterns fig 2c suggesting that v v might have been reduced to v iv vo oh 2 is rather insoluble and strongly adsorbed on particles and then forms stable complexes under the natural ph wehrli and stumm 1989 xps analysis was also performed the v 2p 3 2 and v 2p 1 2 peaks with a binding energy of 517 7 ev and 524 4 ev appeared fig 2d corresponding to v iv qiu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018b this result further confirmed the tetravalent products from v v reduction similar insoluble v iv products from microbial v v reduction were also confirmed in hb and ab through physicochemical characterization results fig s2 toc concentrations gradually decreased in mb and hb during operation fig 3 a it was observed that 94 1 2 5 and 99 9 0 01 of added toc were consumed in 48 h duration in mb and hb respectively a slower toc consumption rate of 0 46 0 01 mg l h in mb was observed compared with that in hb 0 49 0 01 mg l h trace toc was also detected in ab probably due to the residue of organic metabolites from autotrophic s 0 metabolism shi et al 2019 sulfate was progressively accumulated in mb and ab fig 3b which was derived from s 0 oxidation sahu et al 2009 sulfate yield in mb 48 0 2 95 mg l was significantly less than that in ab 93 0 3 95 mg l during 48 h operation p 0 05 hardly any sulfate was detected in hb ph showed downward trends in all bioreactors fig 3c the quickest decline of ph was detected in ab due to protons produced during s 0 based autotrophic process kong et al 2014 followed by mb and then hb on the basis of recognized products s 0 based mixotrophic v v bio reduction can be expressed as eq 1 while v v reduction under heterotrophic and autotrophic conditions can be expressed as eq 2 and eq 3 1 h v o 4 2 0 125 c h 3 c o o 1 75 s 0 2 4 h c o 3 0 525 n h

heterotrophic v v reduction has been widely used in groundwater remediation with inherent and or supplementary organics as electron donors zhang et al 2015 singh et al 2018 in this study 60 mg l cod was chosen according to natural organic level in groundwater zhang et al 2020b the obtained v v reduction rate in hb 0 49 0 03 mg l h was comparable to 0 52 mg l h obtained with 64 mg l cod in a similar system liu et al 2017 although the added organics were sufficient theoretically according to eq 2 v v reduction might be suppressed due to a decreased substrate uptake at lower concentrations molina et al 2019 we also conducted additional trails with cod concentration at 150 mg l in mb and hb v v reduction rate rose to 0 95 0 06 mg l h with adequate organics while more significant increase in v v reduction rate was obtained in mb 2 95 0 05 mg l h these results further proved the cooperation of heterotrophic and autotrophic to realize a faster v v removal under mixotrophic condition in other words less organics 60 mg l cod in mb were required to gain similar v v reduction rate in hb with 150 mg l cod 0 87 0 04 mg l h vs 0 95 0 06 mg l h lower organics consumption in mixotrophic v v reduction highlighted its cost effectiveness s 0 based autotrophic v v reduction suffered lower efficiency due to solid electron donor and sulfate acid accumulations lu et al 2020 v v reduction rate was 0 37 0 02 mg l h in ab similar to a previously reported 0 41 mg l h during 72 h operation zhang et al 2018a nevertheless this value was doubled to 0 87 0 04 mg l h with trace organics addition in mb proving the efficacy of mixotrophic v v reduction less sulfate accumulation and ph decrease in mb compared to those in ab as sulfate could be reduced by heterotrophs and the released carbon dioxide could react with protons under mixotrophic condition oh et al 2001 implying the sustainability of mixotrophic v v reduction mass and electron balances were further evaluated for the involved bioprocess during 48 h operation in mb 200 ml aqueous solution v v reduction to v iv consumed 0 16 mmol electrons while 0 02 mmol acetate was theoretically adequate and 0 28 mmol sulfate would be produced based on eq 1 experimentally 0 22 mmol acetate was oxidized and 0 10 mmol sulfate was accumulated the excessively consumed acetate might support activities of heterotrophic sulfate reducing bacteria minimizing sulfate accumulation zhang et al 2009 the difference between theoretical and actual sulfate yield was 0 18 mmol which required approximate 0 36 mmol acetate theoretically required based on eq 4 acetate also might be used by microbial consortia to boost metabolisms energy produced by s 0 oxidation could drive the atp production which then boosts the mixotrophic metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid cycle in the meantime acetate could be oxidized via the acetate coa pathway and enhanced the purine pyrimidine and putrescine synthetic pathways for regulating bacterial growth feng et al 2010 theoretically more acetate was required to maintain higher v v reduction and lower sulfate accumulation text s1 supporting information which was presumably compensated by organic intermediates from s 0 autotrophic activity in mb 3 2 influences of operation factors four gradients of initial v v concentrations 25 50 75 and 100 mg l with the initial cod concentration of 60 mg l were examined in mb v v removal efficiency in 48 h experimental cycles were negatively related to initial v v concentration fig 4 a which was consistent with reported studies that microbial v v reduction efficiencies declined with the increasement of initial v v concentration zhang et al 2015 jiang et al 2018 according to kamika s report bacterial colony cell would decrease with the gradually increased concentration of v v kamika and momba 2011 in mb when the initial v v concentration was 25 mg l v v was completely removed within 30 h satisfying the requirement of the discharge standard for vanadium industry in china 1 mg l gb 26452 2011 in addition 83 9 3 8 of v v was removed at the initial v v concentration of 50 mg l whereas v v removal efficiencies were only 67 1 2 8 and 66 2 2 1 with the initial v v concentrations at 75 and 100 mg l respectively similar inhibitory effect induced by v v concentration of higher than 50 mg l was observed under heterotrophic liu et al 2016 or autotrophic condition in terms of v v removal rate zhang et al 2018a however v v reduction rate showed an increasing trend with increased initial v v concentration in mb from 0 83 to 1 40 0 05 mg l h when the initial v v concentration increased from 25 to 100 mg l these results indicated that the s 0 based mixotrophic v v bio reduction was more effective with initial v v concentration less than 50 mg l as the activities of dissimilatory metal reduction bacteria can be affected by the amount of electron donors and carbon sources different initial cod concentrations 30 60 90 and 120 mg l were studied with initial v v concentration of 50 mg l in mb as shown in fig 4b only 46 4 2 2 of v v was removed when the initial cod concentration was 30 mg l v v reduction efficiency was improved with the increasing cod concentration around 88 3 2 3 of v v was reduced when the initial cod concentration was 90 mg l complete v v reduction were obtained within 48 h with the initial cod concentration at 120 mg l likewise v v reduction rate also increased from 0 48 0 02 to 1 04 mg l h when initial cod concentration increased from 30 to 120 mg l similar phenomenon was also found in heterotrophic v v reductions hao et al 2016 3 3 identification of the involved bacteria rarefaction curves based on high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that the microbial richness in the three bioreactors decreased compared to the inoculum fig s3 due to the change of overall environmental conditions microbial diversity increased in hb but declined in ab according to simpson and shannon indexes table s3 as autotrophs were more sensitive to toxicants zhang et al 2020b venn diagrams displayed the sameness and difference of microbial communities among mb hb and ab fig s4a principal component analysis indicated that samples cultivated under different circumstances had different community compositions and were all distinct from inoculum fig s4b bacterial relative abundances at phylum level were presented in fig 5 a five most abundant phyla in the inoculum were bacteroidetes 26 0 chloroflexi 20 7 proteobacteria 18 6 thermotogae 6 7 and firmicutes 6 0 in comparison bacteroidetes was enriched in mb 35 6 and ab 36 7 but its abundance decreased in hb 17 0 proteobacteria was accumulated in all bioreactors 22 2 for mb 23 8 for hb and 30 4 for ab while the relative abundance of chloroflexi thermotogae and firmicutes decreased obviously microbial communities at genus level were showed in fig 5b functional genera involved in v v reduction and s 0 oxidation were detected in hb the relative abundances of spirochaeta and desulfuromonas increased from 1 03 and 0 00 in the inoculum to 6 15 and 4 95 it has been reported that spirochaeta can realize uranium vi reduction through an enzymatic catalysis martins et al 2010 hao et al 2015 desulfuromonas is a metal and electrode respiring bacterium badalamenti et al 2016 it was assumed that spirochaeta and desulfuromonas were the potential v v reducers by using v v as alternative electron acceptor in hb differently thiobacillus became the predominant microorganism with a relative abundance of 12 9 in ab as sulfur oxidizing bacteria thiobacillus have been reported to have versatile function briand et al 1996 for example they could use s 0 to reduce nitrate thus it is assumed that thiobacillus could contribute to s 0 oxidation and v v reduction in ab in addition the relative abundance of geobacter increased from 0 59 in the inoculum to 5 17 after 2 months cultivation which might grow with intermediate metabolites from autotrophic bacteria a previous study also reported geobacter are capable of reducing v v ortiz bernad et al 2004 compared to either hb or ab systems it seems that the mb system harbored more diverse players for reducing v v specifically syntrophobacter exhibited an increased abundance from 1 60 in the inoculum to 3 50 in mb which was able to use nitrite nitrate as the electron acceptor ramos et al 2016 it could also contribute to v v reduction heterotrophically with v v as alternative electron acceptor in metabolisms in addition spirochaeta and geobacter with a relative abundance of 2 85 and 0 90 was also detected in mb which could contribute to v v as well furthermore the chemoautotrophic thioclava and halothiobacillus also increased which could oxidize s 0 with v v as electron acceptor sievert et al 2000 chang et al 2018 it was noteworthy that desulfurella were significantly enriched to 11 3 in mb as a sulfur respiring genus desulfurella can perform sulfur metabolism florentino et al 2019 which might be responsible for lower level of sulfate accumulation in mb as a kind of syntrophic bacteria ramos padrón et al 2011 syntrophus also appeared abundantly 2 42 in mb probably due to the mixed substrate 3 4 variations of potential v v reducers functional genes enzymes and metabolites results from qpcr and rt qpcr analyses showed abundances and expression levels of possible v v reducers fig 6 a spirochaeta appeared both in mb and hb but its abundance and transcription in mb were significantly higher than those in hb p 0 05 as this genus could utilize multiple carbon sources liu et al 2016 mb and ab shared a possible v v reducer i e geobacter although the abundance of geobacter in mb was comparable to that in ab p 0 05 its expression level was much lower in mb p 0 05 as it might loss the competition with other v v reducers thiobacillus was detected in ab but it disappeared in mb probably due to its sensitivity to organic carbon zhang et al 2018c notably syntrophobacter only appeared in mb with the highest abundance and expression among possible v v reducers indicating that mixotrophic conditions are more favorable for the growth of such syntrophic bacterium and syntrophobacter to mediate v v detoxification mainly in mb overall there were more diverse and abundant potential v v reducers in mb due to diverse electron donors possible contributing to the fastest v v removal in contrast the transcriptions of most examined genera without v v addition were 1 2 order of magnitude lower than those with v v supplementation further confirming their involvements in v v reduction fig s5 functional genes relevant to v v reduction and s 0 oxidation were found fig s6 it had been previously reported that nitrate nitrite reductases could be involved in v v reduction zhang et al 2019a the nirs gene appeared abundantly in all bioreactors suggesting that v v was reduced with the aid of nitrite reduction pathway ab harbored the highest abundance of nirs gene 2 96 109 2 45 108 copies ng dna p 0 01 the supply of s 0 might have activated the growth of bacteria containing nirs considering most of sulfur oxidizing bacteria are also denitrifiers with denitrifying genes hang et al 2017 interestingly the napa gene was only detected in mb 7 56 104 5 77 103 copies ng dna implying that napa gene might have diverse functions to mediate v v reduction under mixotrophic condition this was a new observation in sulfur based mixotrophic v v reduction compared with the fact that the napa gene played a negligible role in v v reduction in heterotrophic case zhang et al 2019a it is assumed that multiple pathways occurring in mixotrophic case might promote v v reduction a large amount of napa gene was also found in mixotrophic denitrification biofilters peng et al 2020 there was also soxb gene in mb and ab which was responsible for s 0 oxidation zhang et al 2020b however soxb gene also appeared in hb probably due to the existence of thiobacillus genus it should be mentioned that the trend of functional gene abundances was not fully consistent with that of v v reduction efficiency suggesting there were other pathways involved in v v reduction the contents of enzymes possibly involved in catalytic v v reduction varied in different bioreactors fig 6b the highest level of cytochrome c content 0 91 0 03 mg g vss was found in mb p 0 01 while ab possessed the most abundant nadh 3 27 10 2 1 32 10 3 mg g vss p 0 01 microbial extracellular electron transfer could be accelerated with the aid of cytochrome c for pollutant removals such as v v reduction zhang et al 2019a fastest v v removal in mb could be partly attributed to its highest level of cytochrome c nadh is an intracellular reducing power that could reduce toxicants such as v v sarangi and krishnan 2008 zhang et al 2019a detection of nadh in mb implied that v v was also reduced intracellularly nadh was the most abundant in ab suggesting v v was tended to intracellularly be reduced under autotrophic condition microbial eps could affect fates of heavy metals in the environment and had been utilized to reduce heavy metals such as cr vi and ag i harish et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 pn accounted the largest percentage in eps for all the three bioreactors fig 6b it might catalyze v v reduction as its role of reducing u vi had been reported cao et al 2011 two distinct peaks appeared at 1108 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 in ftir spectra of eps from the three bioreactors fig 6c corresponding to functional groups of hydroxy oh and carboxyl coo lu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a which could chelate v v directly and detoxify v v to v iv to protect cells lai et al 2018 organic metabolites were detected in the bioreactors for v v reduction under different conditions fig 6d although there were residual vfas in all the three bioreactors they were derived from different pathways in hb heterotrophs as longilinea syntrophobacter and limnobacter converted metabolically synthesized complex organics such as eps into vfas after the exhaustion of initial added acetate ramos et al 2016 ma et al 2015 chen et al 2016 dhal et al 2010 while autotrophs as thiobacillus employed electrons from s 0 oxidation to reduce bicarbonate for vfas synthesis in ab shi et al 2019 both routes could take place simultaneously in mb and the produced vfas might be consumed by heterotrophs to reduce v v and sulfate 3 5 possible mechanisms and implications in view of reactant products microbial communities relevant genes and metabolites the potential mechanisms of s 0 based mixotrophic v v reduction were hypothesized heterotrophic v v reducers e g syntrophobacter spirochaeta and geobacter likely reduced v v to insoluble v iv by employing organics as carbon sources and electron donors the genes including nirs and napa might have mediated v v reduction due to their versatile functions in addition cytochrome c on out membrane e and intracellular nadh might also be involved in v v reduction apart from the added acetate organic metabolites from s 0 autotrophic bioprocess could compensate electrons for heterotrophic microbes to promote v v reduction rate the production of vfas was observed in both ab and mb which might be produced through assimilation of bicarbonate by autotrophs such as thioclava and halothiobacillus the lower level of sulfate accumulation was associated with activities of the enriched sulfur respiring genus e g desulfurella in mb future studies are required to validate the roles of these organisms and genes by employing more advanced methods e g meta omics and isotope experiments to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to report bio reduce v v mixotrophically v v reduction was accelerated through collaboration between heterotrophic and autotrophic activities with organics and s 0 as joint electron donors organic metabolites from autotrophs could act as alternative energy sources to heterotrophic v v reducers lowering organic requirement enrichment of sulfur respiring microorganisms declined sulfate accumulation these advantages implied that s 0 based mixotrophic v v reduction would be a promising alternative for v v contaminated groundwater remediation in situ biostimulation by acetate for v v biodetoxification has been proved in field test yelton et al 2013 biostimulant consisting of acetate and s 0 is expected to function well for remediation of v v contaminated aquifer which can be further verified by microcosm study results from this batch study can also be verified using a flow through system for ex situ treatment to assess the practicality and economic feasibility of the proposed technology during practical application hydrodynamic and hydrochemical characteristics of aquifers should be fully considered wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a wang et al 2020 the diffusion of solid s 0 in aquifer and its contact with v v may be the main challenge compared with soluble acetate instead of acetate cheaper agricultural and industrial organic wastes with sustainable releasing property such as straw and woodchip can also be employed to further reduce the cost ashoori et al 2019 they can be packed together with s 0 in biological permeable reactive barrier bio prb a remediation facility that is vertically set to groundwater flow direction when v v polluted groundwater flows through bio prb v v can fully contact with these solid electron donors and they could react via microbial catalysis in bio prb thereby solving the challenge related to solid s 0 diffusion in aquifer conclusions this study investigated v v bio reduction under mixotrophic condition with acetate and elemental sulfur s 0 as co donors of electron the following conclusions are drawn v v removal was accelerated under mixotrophic condition with v v reduction rate of 0 87 0 04 mg l h compared to heterotrophic and autotrophic v v reductions evidences

spirochaeta geobacter with regulations of nirs and napa genes cytochrome c intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and extracellular polymeric substances were also involved in v v reduction

groundwater 1 introduction vanadium is a widespread element in lithosphere zohar et al 2014 its indispensable role in steel iron industries as well as intensive applications in catalysts and batteries has caused the release of vanadium into the environment carpentier et al 2003 shi et al 2020 although trace amount of vanadium is essential for cell growth continuous exposure to inorganic vanadium compounds would result in serious health effects such as carcinogenic and neurotoxic insults zwolak 2014 cao et al 2017 due to its toxicity and ubiquitous detection in groundwater ortiz bernad et al 2004 vanadium has been regarded as a dangerous pollutant at the same class as lead arsenic and mercury according to united states environment protection agency usepa naeem et al 2007 taking wyoming river in usa as an example the concentration of vanadium in water reaches up to 30 220 mg l due to vanadium mining activities shiller and boyle 1987 which is far beyond the minimum reporting level of 0 20 µg l suggested by the usepa chen and liu 2017 vanadium of 9 66 mg l in groundwater is also reported in a vanadium tailing site in hubei china meng et al 2018 in aquatic environments vanadium usually exists in the oxidation states of 4 and 5 i e vanadium iv v iv and vanadium v v v ortiz bernad et al 2004 zhang et al 2012 compared to v iv with less toxicity and insoluble at natural ph wang and ren 2014 v v has been widely used in industry and exhibits more serious toxicity jensenfontaine et al 2014 therefore an effective method to detoxify v v is expected to reduce it to v iv which could further form precipitates at natural ph eventually being removed from water patel et al 1989 to date various processes have been proposed to remove v v from contaminated waters for example v v could be removed by adsorption leiviskä et al 2017 ion exchange and chemical reduction reactions yeom et al 2009 li et al 2009 however these physic chemical approaches are not economically viable due to high operational costs thus limiting their applications in groundwater remediation in contrast microbial v v reduction seems to be a promising process for v v removal due to its low operational costs and high potential for in situ groundwater remediation zhang et al 2014 in the past few years v v bio reduction has been realized under either heterotrophic condition or autotrophic condition zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2018a jiang et al 2018 although heterotrophic v v reduction is highly efficient organic matters are not enough to support this process in most natural environments moser et al 2003 the addition of exactly right amount of organic donor is difficult to be achieved while the overfeeding of the organic substrates would cause a secondary contamination such as odor problem and microbial overgrowth lindroos et al 2002 oh et al 2001 yelton et al 2013 even cause bio clogging during in situ applications singh et al 2018 element sulfur s 0 based autotrophic microbial reduction process has several attractive advantages in groundwater remediation and has drawn more attention recently kong et al 2014 shi et al 2019 since no organic substances are needed and less sludge would be produced the secondary organic pollution can be avoided and operational costs can be reduced oh et al 2001 shi et al 2020 nevertheless s 0 based autotrophic v v reduction yields sulfate and acid which would cause another secondary pollution and increase treatment cost sahu et al 2009 s 0 based mixotrophic microbial system that combines the heterotrophic and autotrophic processes is an effective strategy to overcome respective shortcomings sahu et al 2009 sahinkaya and dursun 2012 sahinkaya et al 2011 in such mixotrophic process both heterotrophic and autotrophic activities occur simultaneously with organics and s 0 as collaborative electron donors tong et al 2017 sulfate and acidity produced in autotrophic activity can be removed by heterotrophy and organic matters required in heterotrophic activity can be compensated by autotrophy s metabolites claus and kutzner 1985 zhang et al 2020b this synergistic collaboration promotes removals of various pollutants such as nitrate and perchlorate with less organic consumption and sulfate accumulation sahu et al 2009 sahinkaya and dursun 2012 in spite of the increasingly worldwide attention for microbial v v reduction and the utilization of mixotrophic system for contaminated water treatment s 0 based mixotrophic v v reduction system has not been systematically studied so far this study aims to investigate the microbial v v reduction process by combining heterotrophic reduction and s 0 based autotrophic reduction the specific objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the mixotrophic v v reduction efficiency 2 identify the product of v v reduction 3 reveal the variation of microbial community composition and identify the dominant species involved in microbial v v reduction and 4

evaluation figure 1 a shows the concentration profiles of v v for three typical consecutive cycles in mb hb and ab respectively with the initial v v concentration of 50 mg l v v reduction was observed in all bioreactors mb showed the highest removal efficiency of 83 9 3 84 in a 48 h cycle compared to 47 2 2 59 in hb and 35 5 1 71 in ab p 0 05 the average v v reduction rate was 0 87 0 04 mg l h 0 49 0 03 mg l h and 0 37 0 02 mg l h in mb hb and ab respectively suggesting the highest v v removal rate under mixotrophic condition the profiles of dissolved total v in all bioreactors were also recorded and displayed in fig 1b at the end of a 48 h cycle the total v removal efficiency in mb hb and ab was 76 9 0 99 42 6 1 90 and 30 0 3 04 respectively the obtained results demonstrated that mb functioned more efficiently for v v reduction which might be associated with the concurrence of heterotrophic and autotrophic activities zhang et al 2020b compared to heterotrophic or autotrophic conditions stable v v removal performance with high efficiency was obtained under mixotrophic condition during long term operation fig s1 suggesting that sulfur based mixotrophic process was more promising for bioremediation of v v polluted environment the produced precipitates in mb were characterized by using multiple approaches sem image exhibited that these precipitates were associated with microbial biomass fig 2 a eds analysis implied that the precipitates were mainly composed of elements as v s and ca fig 2b the diffraction peaks of cavo3 cav2o5 vo2 vo oh 2 and mgvo3 appeared in the xrd patterns fig 2c suggesting that v v might have been reduced to v iv vo oh 2 is rather insoluble and strongly adsorbed on particles and then forms stable complexes under the natural ph wehrli and stumm 1989 xps analysis was also performed the v 2p 3 2 and v 2p 1 2 peaks with a binding energy of 517 7 ev and 524 4 ev appeared fig 2d corresponding to v iv qiu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018b this result further confirmed the tetravalent products from v v reduction similar insoluble v iv products from microbial v v reduction were also confirmed in hb and ab through physicochemical characterization results fig s2 toc concentrations gradually decreased in mb and hb during operation fig 3 a it was observed that 94 1 2 5 and 99 9 0 01 of added toc were consumed in 48 h duration in mb and hb respectively a slower toc consumption rate of 0 46 0 01 mg l h in mb was observed compared with that in hb 0 49 0 01 mg l h trace toc was also detected in ab probably due to the residue of organic metabolites from autotrophic s 0 metabolism shi et al 2019 sulfate was progressively accumulated in mb and ab fig 3b which was derived from s 0 oxidation sahu et al 2009 sulfate yield in mb 48 0 2 95 mg l was significantly less than that in ab 93 0 3 95 mg l during 48 h operation p 0 05 hardly any sulfate was detected in hb ph showed downward trends in all bioreactors fig 3c the quickest decline of ph was detected in ab due to protons produced during s 0 based autotrophic process kong et al 2014 followed by mb and then hb on the basis of recognized products s 0 based mixotrophic v v bio reduction can be expressed as eq 1 while v v reduction under heterotrophic and autotrophic conditions can be expressed as eq 2 and eq 3 1 h v o 4 2 0 125 c h 3 c o o 1 75 s 0 2 4 h c o 3 0 525 n h

heterotrophic v v reduction has been widely used in groundwater remediation with inherent and or supplementary organics as electron donors zhang et al 2015 singh et al 2018 in this study 60 mg l cod was chosen according to natural organic level in groundwater zhang et al 2020b the obtained v v reduction rate in hb 0 49 0 03 mg l h was comparable to 0 52 mg l h obtained with 64 mg l cod in a similar system liu et al 2017 although the added organics were sufficient theoretically according to eq 2 v v reduction might be suppressed due to a decreased substrate uptake at lower concentrations molina et al 2019 we also conducted additional trails with cod concentration at 150 mg l in mb and hb v v reduction rate rose to 0 95 0 06 mg l h with adequate organics while more significant increase in v v reduction rate was obtained in mb 2 95 0 05 mg l h these results further proved the cooperation of heterotrophic and autotrophic to realize a faster v v removal under mixotrophic condition in other words less organics 60 mg l cod in mb were required to gain similar v v reduction rate in hb with 150 mg l cod 0 87 0 04 mg l h vs 0 95 0 06 mg l h lower organics consumption in mixotrophic v v reduction highlighted its cost effectiveness s 0 based autotrophic v v reduction suffered lower efficiency due to solid electron donor and sulfate acid accumulations lu et al 2020 v v reduction rate was 0 37 0 02 mg l h in ab similar to a previously reported 0 41 mg l h during 72 h operation zhang et al 2018a nevertheless this value was doubled to 0 87 0 04 mg l h with trace organics addition in mb proving the efficacy of mixotrophic v v reduction less sulfate accumulation and ph decrease in mb compared to those in ab as sulfate could be reduced by heterotrophs and the released carbon dioxide could react with protons under mixotrophic condition oh et al 2001 implying the sustainability of mixotrophic v v reduction mass and electron balances were further evaluated for the involved bioprocess during 48 h operation in mb 200 ml aqueous solution v v reduction to v iv consumed 0 16 mmol electrons while 0 02 mmol acetate was theoretically adequate and 0 28 mmol sulfate would be produced based on eq 1 experimentally 0 22 mmol acetate was oxidized and 0 10 mmol sulfate was accumulated the excessively consumed acetate might support activities of heterotrophic sulfate reducing bacteria minimizing sulfate accumulation zhang et al 2009 the difference between theoretical and actual sulfate yield was 0 18 mmol which required approximate 0 36 mmol acetate theoretically required based on eq 4 acetate also might be used by microbial consortia to boost metabolisms energy produced by s 0 oxidation could drive the atp production which then boosts the mixotrophic metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid cycle in the meantime acetate could be oxidized via the acetate coa pathway and enhanced the purine pyrimidine and putrescine synthetic pathways for regulating bacterial growth feng et al 2010 theoretically more acetate was required to maintain higher v v reduction and lower sulfate accumulation text s1 supporting information which was presumably compensated by organic intermediates from s 0 autotrophic activity in mb 3 2 influences of operation factors four gradients of initial v v concentrations 25 50 75 and 100 mg l with the initial cod concentration of 60 mg l were examined in mb v v removal efficiency in 48 h experimental cycles were negatively related to initial v v concentration fig 4 a which was consistent with reported studies that microbial v v reduction efficiencies declined with the increasement of initial v v concentration zhang et al 2015 jiang et al 2018 according to kamika s report bacterial colony cell would decrease with the gradually increased concentration of v v kamika and momba 2011 in mb when the initial v v concentration was 25 mg l v v was completely removed within 30 h satisfying the requirement of the discharge standard for vanadium industry in china 1 mg l gb 26452 2011 in addition 83 9 3 8 of v v was removed at the initial v v concentration of 50 mg l whereas v v removal efficiencies were only 67 1 2 8 and 66 2 2 1 with the initial v v concentrations at 75 and 100 mg l respectively similar inhibitory effect induced by v v concentration of higher than 50 mg l was observed under heterotrophic liu et al 2016 or autotrophic condition in terms of v v removal rate zhang et al 2018a however v v reduction rate showed an increasing trend with increased initial v v concentration in mb from 0 83 to 1 40 0 05 mg l h when the initial v v concentration increased from 25 to 100 mg l these results indicated that the s 0 based mixotrophic v v bio reduction was more effective with initial v v concentration less than 50 mg l as the activities of dissimilatory metal reduction bacteria can be affected by the amount of electron donors and carbon sources different initial cod concentrations 30 60 90 and 120 mg l were studied with initial v v concentration of 50 mg l in mb as shown in fig 4b only 46 4 2 2 of v v was removed when the initial cod concentration was 30 mg l v v reduction efficiency was improved with the increasing cod concentration around 88 3 2 3 of v v was reduced when the initial cod concentration was 90 mg l complete v v reduction were obtained within 48 h with the initial cod concentration at 120 mg l likewise v v reduction rate also increased from 0 48 0 02 to 1 04 mg l h when initial cod concentration increased from 30 to 120 mg l similar phenomenon was also found in heterotrophic v v reductions hao et al 2016 3 3 identification of the involved bacteria rarefaction curves based on high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that the microbial richness in the three bioreactors decreased compared to the inoculum fig s3 due to the change of overall environmental conditions microbial diversity increased in hb but declined in ab according to simpson and shannon indexes table s3 as autotrophs were more sensitive to toxicants zhang et al 2020b venn diagrams displayed the sameness and difference of microbial communities among mb hb and ab fig s4a principal component analysis indicated that samples cultivated under different circumstances had different community compositions and were all distinct from inoculum fig s4b bacterial relative abundances at phylum level were presented in fig 5 a five most abundant phyla in the inoculum were bacteroidetes 26 0 chloroflexi 20 7 proteobacteria 18 6 thermotogae 6 7 and firmicutes 6 0 in comparison bacteroidetes was enriched in mb 35 6 and ab 36 7 but its abundance decreased in hb 17 0 proteobacteria was accumulated in all bioreactors 22 2 for mb 23 8 for hb and 30 4 for ab while the relative abundance of chloroflexi thermotogae and firmicutes decreased obviously microbial communities at genus level were showed in fig 5b functional genera involved in v v reduction and s 0 oxidation were detected in hb the relative abundances of spirochaeta and desulfuromonas increased from 1 03 and 0 00 in the inoculum to 6 15 and 4 95 it has been reported that spirochaeta can realize uranium vi reduction through an enzymatic catalysis martins et al 2010 hao et al 2015 desulfuromonas is a metal and electrode respiring bacterium badalamenti et al 2016 it was assumed that spirochaeta and desulfuromonas were the potential v v reducers by using v v as alternative electron acceptor in hb differently thiobacillus became the predominant microorganism with a relative abundance of 12 9 in ab as sulfur oxidizing bacteria thiobacillus have been reported to have versatile function briand et al 1996 for example they could use s 0 to reduce nitrate thus it is assumed that thiobacillus could contribute to s 0 oxidation and v v reduction in ab in addition the relative abundance of geobacter increased from 0 59 in the inoculum to 5 17 after 2 months cultivation which might grow with intermediate metabolites from autotrophic bacteria a previous study also reported geobacter are capable of reducing v v ortiz bernad et al 2004 compared to either hb or ab systems it seems that the mb system harbored more diverse players for reducing v v specifically syntrophobacter exhibited an increased abundance from 1 60 in the inoculum to 3 50 in mb which was able to use nitrite nitrate as the electron acceptor ramos et al 2016 it could also contribute to v v reduction heterotrophically with v v as alternative electron acceptor in metabolisms in addition spirochaeta and geobacter with a relative abundance of 2 85 and 0 90 was also detected in mb which could contribute to v v as well furthermore the chemoautotrophic thioclava and halothiobacillus also increased which could oxidize s 0 with v v as electron acceptor sievert et al 2000 chang et al 2018 it was noteworthy that desulfurella were significantly enriched to 11 3 in mb as a sulfur respiring genus desulfurella can perform sulfur metabolism florentino et al 2019 which might be responsible for lower level of sulfate accumulation in mb as a kind of syntrophic bacteria ramos padrón et al 2011 syntrophus also appeared abundantly 2 42 in mb probably due to the mixed substrate 3 4 variations of potential v v reducers functional genes enzymes and metabolites results from qpcr and rt qpcr analyses showed abundances and expression levels of possible v v reducers fig 6 a spirochaeta appeared both in mb and hb but its abundance and transcription in mb were significantly higher than those in hb p 0 05 as this genus could utilize multiple carbon sources liu et al 2016 mb and ab shared a possible v v reducer i e geobacter although the abundance of geobacter in mb was comparable to that in ab p 0 05 its expression level was much lower in mb p 0 05 as it might loss the competition with other v v reducers thiobacillus was detected in ab but it disappeared in mb probably due to its sensitivity to organic carbon zhang et al 2018c notably syntrophobacter only appeared in mb with the highest abundance and expression among possible v v reducers indicating that mixotrophic conditions are more favorable for the growth of such syntrophic bacterium and syntrophobacter to mediate v v detoxification mainly in mb overall there were more diverse and abundant potential v v reducers in mb due to diverse electron donors possible contributing to the fastest v v removal in contrast the transcriptions of most examined genera without v v addition were 1 2 order of magnitude lower than those with v v supplementation further confirming their involvements in v v reduction fig s5 functional genes relevant to v v reduction and s 0 oxidation were found fig s6 it had been previously reported that nitrate nitrite reductases could be involved in v v reduction zhang et al 2019a the nirs gene appeared abundantly in all bioreactors suggesting that v v was reduced with the aid of nitrite reduction pathway ab harbored the highest abundance of nirs gene 2 96 109 2 45 108 copies ng dna p 0 01 the supply of s 0 might have activated the growth of bacteria containing nirs considering most of sulfur oxidizing bacteria are also denitrifiers with denitrifying genes hang et al 2017 interestingly the napa gene was only detected in mb 7 56 104 5 77 103 copies ng dna implying that napa gene might have diverse functions to mediate v v reduction under mixotrophic condition this was a new observation in sulfur based mixotrophic v v reduction compared with the fact that the napa gene played a negligible role in v v reduction in heterotrophic case zhang et al 2019a it is assumed that multiple pathways occurring in mixotrophic case might promote v v reduction a large amount of napa gene was also found in mixotrophic denitrification biofilters peng et al 2020 there was also soxb gene in mb and ab which was responsible for s 0 oxidation zhang et al 2020b however soxb gene also appeared in hb probably due to the existence of thiobacillus genus it should be mentioned that the trend of functional gene abundances was not fully consistent with that of v v reduction efficiency suggesting there were other pathways involved in v v reduction the contents of enzymes possibly involved in catalytic v v reduction varied in different bioreactors fig 6b the highest level of cytochrome c content 0 91 0 03 mg g vss was found in mb p 0 01 while ab possessed the most abundant nadh 3 27 10 2 1 32 10 3 mg g vss p 0 01 microbial extracellular electron transfer could be accelerated with the aid of cytochrome c for pollutant removals such as v v reduction zhang et al 2019a fastest v v removal in mb could be partly attributed to its highest level of cytochrome c nadh is an intracellular reducing power that could reduce toxicants such as v v sarangi and krishnan 2008 zhang et al 2019a detection of nadh in mb implied that v v was also reduced intracellularly nadh was the most abundant in ab suggesting v v was tended to intracellularly be reduced under autotrophic condition microbial eps could affect fates of heavy metals in the environment and had been utilized to reduce heavy metals such as cr vi and ag i harish et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 pn accounted the largest percentage in eps for all the three bioreactors fig 6b it might catalyze v v reduction as its role of reducing u vi had been reported cao et al 2011 two distinct peaks appeared at 1108 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 in ftir spectra of eps from the three bioreactors fig 6c corresponding to functional groups of hydroxy oh and carboxyl coo lu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a which could chelate v v directly and detoxify v v to v iv to protect cells lai et al 2018 organic metabolites were detected in the bioreactors for v v reduction under different conditions fig 6d although there were residual vfas in all the three bioreactors they were derived from different pathways in hb heterotrophs as longilinea syntrophobacter and limnobacter converted metabolically synthesized complex organics such as eps into vfas after the exhaustion of initial added acetate ramos et al 2016 ma et al 2015 chen et al 2016 dhal et al 2010 while autotrophs as thiobacillus employed electrons from s 0 oxidation to reduce bicarbonate for vfas synthesis in ab shi et al 2019 both routes could take place simultaneously in mb and the produced vfas might be consumed by heterotrophs to reduce v v and sulfate 3 5 possible mechanisms and implications in view of reactant products microbial communities relevant genes and metabolites the potential mechanisms of s 0 based mixotrophic v v reduction were hypothesized heterotrophic v v reducers e g syntrophobacter spirochaeta and geobacter likely reduced v v to insoluble v iv by employing organics as carbon sources and electron donors the genes including nirs and napa might have mediated v v reduction due to their versatile functions in addition cytochrome c on out membrane e and intracellular nadh might also be involved in v v reduction apart from the added acetate organic metabolites from s 0 autotrophic bioprocess could compensate electrons for heterotrophic microbes to promote v v reduction rate the production of vfas was observed in both ab and mb which might be produced through assimilation of bicarbonate by autotrophs such as thioclava and halothiobacillus the lower level of sulfate accumulation was associated with activities of the enriched sulfur respiring genus e g desulfurella in mb future studies are required to validate the roles of these organisms and genes by employing more advanced methods e g meta omics and isotope experiments to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to report bio reduce v v mixotrophically v v reduction was accelerated through collaboration between heterotrophic and autotrophic activities with organics and s 0 as joint electron donors organic metabolites from autotrophs could act as alternative energy sources to heterotrophic v v reducers lowering organic requirement enrichment of sulfur respiring microorganisms declined sulfate accumulation these advantages implied that s 0 based mixotrophic v v reduction would be a promising alternative for v v contaminated groundwater remediation in situ biostimulation by acetate for v v biodetoxification has been proved in field test yelton et al 2013 biostimulant consisting of acetate and s 0 is expected to function well for remediation of v v contaminated aquifer which can be further verified by microcosm study results from this batch study can also be verified using a flow through system for ex situ treatment to assess the practicality and economic feasibility of the proposed technology during practical application hydrodynamic and hydrochemical characteristics of aquifers should be fully considered wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a wang et al 2020 the diffusion of solid s 0 in aquifer and its contact with v v may be the main challenge compared with soluble acetate instead of acetate cheaper agricultural and industrial organic wastes with sustainable releasing property such as straw and woodchip can also be employed to further reduce the cost ashoori et al 2019 they can be packed together with s 0 in biological permeable reactive barrier bio prb a remediation facility that is vertically set to groundwater flow direction when v v polluted groundwater flows through bio prb v v can fully contact with these solid electron donors and they could react via microbial catalysis in bio prb thereby solving the challenge related to solid s 0 diffusion in aquifer conclusions this study investigated v v bio reduction under mixotrophic condition with acetate and elemental sulfur s 0 as co donors of electron the following conclusions are drawn v v removal was accelerated under mixotrophic condition with v v reduction rate of 0 87 0 04 mg l h compared to heterotrophic and autotrophic v v reductions evidences from a suite of characterization methods proved that deposited vanadium iv was as the main product from v v reduction v v was presumably detoxified by heterotrophic v v reducers e g syntrophobacter spirochaeta geobacter with regulations of nirs and napa genes cytochrome c intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and extracellular polymeric substances were also involved in v v reduction and binding organic metabolites synthesized by autotrophs e g thioclava halothiobacillus with energy from s 0 oxidation could compensate electron donors for heterotrophic v v reducers less sulfate was accumulated probably due to activities of sulfur respiring genera as desulfurella declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

17367,the evasions of methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 from inland waters represent substantial fluxes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere offsetting a large part of the continental carbon sink however the ch4 and co2 emissions from urban inland waters are less constrained in particular ebullitive ch4 emissions from these waters are poorly understood here we measured the concentrations and fluxes of ch4 and co2 in rivers and lakes in the megacity of beijing china between 2018 and 2019 the ch4 concentration ranged from 0 08 to 70 2 µmol l 1 with an average of 2 5 5 9 µmol l 1 the average ch4 ebullition was 11 3 30 4 mmol m 2 d 1 and was approximately 6 times higher than the global average the average total ch4 flux 14 2 35 1 mmol m 2 d 1 was 3 times higher than the global average with ebullition accounting for 80 of the flux the high surface water ch4 concentrations and ebullitive fluxes were caused by high sediment organic carbon dissolved organic carbon contents high aquatic primary productivity and shallow water depths in the urban inland waters the ch4 emissions accounted for 20 of co2 emissions in terms of the carbon release and were 1 7 times higher in terms of co2 equivalent emissions from beijing inland waters furthermore the ch4 ebullition and its contribution to the total carbon gas emissions increased exponentially with the water temperature suggesting a positive feedback probably occurs between the greenhouse gas emissions from urban inland waters and climate warming this study confirms the major role of ch4 ebullition from urban inland waters in the global carbon budget under the rapid progress of global urbanization graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methane ch4 ebullition carbon dioxide co2 urban inland waters urban heat island climate warming 1 introduction methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 emissions from inland waters including rivers reservoirs and lakes are considered important components of the global carbon cycle and major sources of atmospheric greenhouse gases ghgs bastviken et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 carbon dioxide is an end product of biological organic carbon respiration while ch4 is produced through the decomposition of organic carbon under anaerobic conditions via methanogenesis stanley et al 2016 a massive ch4 efflux from inland waters into the atmosphere could occur via diffusion ebullition and plant mediated fluxes bastviken et al 2004 although a large portion of the produced ch4 is oxidized in the water column by methanotrophs before being emitted into the atmosphere selvam et al 2014 although the ch4 efflux from inland waters is relatively low in terms of carbon emissions 4 of the co2 c efflux cole et al 2007 it is the second largest contributor to the atmospheric radiative forcing after co2 forster et al 2007 due to its 28 fold global warming potential gwp over that of co2 over 100 years global inland water co2 emissions have been estimated to reach 2 1 pg c yr 1 raymond et al 2013 which relied almost exclusively on co2 calculated from carbonate equilibria direct measurements of co2 emissions are scarce global ch4 emissions from inland waters have been reported to range 40 120 tg ch4 yr 1 in different studies bastviken et al 2011 kirschke et al 2013 saunois et al 2016 the emissions from rivers have been estimated to reach 1 5 tg ch4 yr 1 which is based on a limited number of measurements of riverine fluxes bastviken et al 2011 relying on a larger and more spatially representative data set stanley et al 2016 revised the ch4 emissions from rivers and streams upwards to 26 8 tg ch4 year 1 which is higher than 50 of the efflux from inland waters including rivers reservoirs and lakes estimated by kirschke et al 2013 although progress has been attained regarding the estimation of carbon gas emissions from inland waters these global estimates are still largely uncertain because of the severe disparity of data urban inland waters which are located in cities and influenced by heavy human modifications are underrepresented in global estimates of aquatic ch4 and co2 emissions urban inland waters however exhibit a specific aquatic biogeochemistry and hydrology making them unique in terms of functioning as ghg emitters first urbanization has heavily modified inland waters by elevating pollutant and nutrient loads and changing the hydromorphology of urban rivers walsh et al 2005 unlike pollutants in rivers stemming from agricultural land uses which are largely composed of nutrients including nitrogen and phosphorus urban rivers may also receive massive carbon inputs from urban sewage systems and wastewater treatment plants wwtps organic carbon is largely decomposed via microbial processes thereby consuming oxygen and producing co2 leading to hypoxia teurlincx et al 2019 which stimulates anaerobic processes such as methanogenesis denitrification and anammox second urban inland waters are characterized by a relatively shallow water depth and low hydrostatic pressure mcenroe et al 2013 and are likely to experience more ch4 evasion due to the short time bubbles require to travel to the water surface holgerson and raymond 2016 zhang et al 2020 thus limiting bubble dissolution and ch4 oxidation in the water column these imply that urban inland waters are potentially important sources of ch4 and co2 emissions and probably act as ch4 production and ebullition hotspots except for shallow lakes and ponds which have been identified as ch4 production hotspots 62 of the average total fluxes davidson et al 2018 methane emissions from urban inland waters have been studied in several cities martinez cruz et al 2017 ortega et al 2019 wang et al 2020 wang et al 2018 yu et al 2017 however most studies have only reported ch4 emissions estimated from the boundary layer theory and have ignored bubble fluxes and the role of ebullition and contribution of ch4 to carbon gas emissions have not been evaluated in addition the influencing factors for the ch4 emissions from urban inland waters are poorly understood in this work we selected the megacity of beijing as an example to study methane ebullition from urban inland waters and its contribution to ghg emissions the objectives of this study were 1 to determine the spatial and temporal variations in the concentrations and fluxes of ch4 and co2 2 to quantify the ebullition of ch4 and to identify the drivers of ch4 production and emission and 3 to estimate the ch4 and co2 emissions and further evaluate the contribution of ch4 to the carbon gas emissions from urban inland waters under climate warming 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the study was conducted in beijing china covering an area of 16800 km2 with 21 million inhabitants of which 62 consists of mountainous regions while plains comprise the remaining 38 six urban districts located in the plains account for approximately 8 of the city area and 60 of the population beijing is characterized by an anomalously warm temperature zone and has four distinct seasons and the average annual temperature and precipitation are approximately 10 12 c and 600 mm respectively liu et al 2009 beijing is located in the haihe river basin and the inland waters in beijing include more than 100 rivers 22 lakes and 18 reservoirs mainly located in the mountainous regions beijing water statistical yearbook 2018 with a total water surface area of 459 km2 please refer to the calculation see below the river network is dense with a total length 2500 km and the water flow in the study area is low due to the low terrain slope and presence of sluice gates and rubber dams beijing water statistical yearbook 2018 the water in the river network mainly comes from reservoirs and the wastewater cycling processes of wwtps this study was composed of 17 sampling campaigns spanning a total of 17 months from july 2018 to november 2019 and a total of 21 sites were sampled including 19 sites in rivers and 2 sites in lakes fig 1 and table s1 from fig 1 we can see that the land use in the river basin mainly includes construction land cultivated land forest and pasture these rivers and lakes distribute uniformly in beijing and cover different water environment conditions the sampled rivers can also be characterized as reclaimed water supply from wwtps or natural water replenishment from reservoirs table s1 all 21 sites were sampled in august 2019 and november 2019 and 10 sites were sampled biweekly from july 2018 to july 2019 except for the freezing period from december to february table s1 in addition to measure the diurnal variability in carbon gas concentrations and fluxes day long field measurements were conducted at two sites one site was sampled every 3 h over a 24 h period on april 14 and july 10 2019 and the other site was sampled on may 22 2019 table s1 there were no extreme weather events or abnormal hydrological variations during the sampling periods 2 2 carbon gas concentrations and evasion fluxes during each sampling campaign the partial pressure of co2 pco2 in water was measured using a qubit dissolved co2 system in situ equipped with an internal pump and a pco2 probe s157 p qubit biology inc canada the system was calibrated with standard co2 gas ranging from 0 to 10 000 µatm the pco2 value that exceeded the maximum range of the pco2 probe system and the dissolved ch4 concentrations in the water samples were determined using the headspace equilibrium technique johnson et al 1990 water samples were collected in 120 ml glass serum bottles with straight plug rubber stoppers to avoid contaminating samples with any surface pollutants the water samples were collected 5 cm below the surface using a 5 l niskin water sampler and then slowly drained into the bottom of bottles through a silicone tube after filling the bottles several water volumes were allowed to overflow to avoid contamination of the water samples by atmospheric carbon gases and gas tight rubber stoppers were then quickly fitted onto the bottles samples were re collected if any bubbles were observed ten millilitres of ultrahigh purity helium was injected into the 120 ml glass serum bottles to create a headspace and the bottles were then vigorously shaken for 1 min in situ which was confirmed to be long enough for the gas to reach an equilibrium between the water and headspace subsequently the headspace gas was transferred to 20 ml airbags and triplicate gas samples were collected in airbags at each site the samples for atmospheric carbon gas partial pressure measurements were collected in 200 ml airbags the gas samples in the airbags were quantified in the laboratory with an agilent 7890b gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector fid the carbon gas concentrations in the water samples were then calculated according to the carbon gas partial pressure in the headspace and the appropriate solubility coefficient mol l 1 atm 1 wanninkhof 1992 the fluxes of ch4 and co2 across the water air interface were measured using floating chambers which were deployed on the water surface with a headspace volume of 31 l the chambers were covered with aluminium foil to minimize the solar heating effect of the headspace gases a tube was attached to the top of the chamber to allow direct headspace gas sampling from the riverbank laboratory testing of the floating chambers revealed no ghg consumption or production over a 100 min period gas samples were collected every 10 min over 60 min from the floating chamber the ch4 and co2 fluxes were calculated according to the slope of the linear regression of the carbon gas concentration versus time with the following equation 1 f c t c 0 p v a t r t 10 6 60 24 10 3 mmol m 2 d 1 where f are ch4 and co2 fluxes mmol m 2 d 1 across the water air interface ct and c0 are the ch4 and co2 concentrations in the chamber headspace at time t and 0

r is the universal gas constant 8 314 m3 pa mol 1 k 1 and t is the air temperature k during the measurement the ebullitive and diffusive ch4 fluxes were separated using the method of campeau et al campeau and giorgio 2014 briefly the co2 exchange between the surface water and atmosphere occurs exclusively by diffusion while ch4 may also be emitted into the atmosphere through bubbles therefore fco2 was adopted to estimate the diffusive gas exchange velocity according to fick s law with the following equation 2 k c o 2 f c o 2 k h p c o 2 w a t e r p c o 2 a i r where kco2 is the gas exchange velocity of co2 m d 1 fco2 is the co2 flux calculated from the floating chamber kh is the henry constant adjusted for the water temperature and salinity p c o 2 w a t e r and p c o 2 a i r are the co2 partial pressures in the surface water and atmosphere respectively the k co2 values was then standardized to a schmidt number of 600 k 600 as follows 3 k 600 k c o 2 600 s c c o 2 n where s c c o 2 is the co2 schmidt number at the given water temperature and n is the schmidt coefficient which is either 2 3 at wind speeds 3 6 m s 1 or 1 2 otherwise the k 600 was then employed to estimate the ch4 diffusive flux with equation 4 and the ebullitive flux was calculated as the difference between the total and diffusive fluxes 4 f c h 4 d i f f u s i v e k 600 s c c h 4 600 n k h p c h 4 w a t e r p c h 4 a i r we also implemented bubble gas collectors to collect bubbles during five sampling campaigns for detailed information see table s1 and then used the ebullitive flux calculated from the bubble gas collectors to verify the reliability of the ebullitive fluxes calculation method based on equations 1 4 four bubble gas collectors which consist of a 30 cm diameter polypropylene funnel affixed on the lower end of a pvc tube and a polypropylene syringe equipped with a three way valve connected to the upper end of the pvc tube were employed to collect bubbles during sampling the funnel tube syringe unit was filled with water by removing any air through the valve the bubble gas could be collected with the syringe and then sampled through the three way valve with another syringe the volume of the trapped bubbles could be easily verified from the displacement water volume in the syringe the ebullitive flux can be calculated as follows 5 f c t p v a t r t

collected bubbles ml a is the area of funnel mouth m2 t is the deployment time min r is the universal gas constant 8 314 m3 pa mol 1 k 1 and t is the air temperature k to describe the temperature dependence of ebullition for the urban inland water system we applied a modified arrhenius equation aben et al 2017 to calculate the overall system temperature coefficient for ch4 ebullition θs 6 e t e 20 θ s t 20 where e t is the ebullition rate of ch4 mmol m 2 d 1 at temperature t c e 20 is the ebullition rate of ch4 mmol m 2 d 1 at 20 c and θs is the overall system temperature coefficient dimensionless the modified arrhenius equation was fitted to the measured data using nonlinear regression analysis in originpro 2020 relying on the levenberg marquardt algorithm an iterative procedure to determine model parameters by minimizing the residual sum of squares the modelled θs value obtained from the equation was adopted to determine the temperature dependency of ch4 ebullition in the different inland water ecosystems in addition q 10 which is defined as the ratio of the rate at one temperature to that at a temperature 10 c lower denoted as θ s 10 kadlec and reddy 2001 was also considered to study the effect of temperature on ch4 ebullition 2 3 water chemistry the water temperature dissolved oxygen do electrical conductivity ph oxidation reduction potential and atmospheric pressure were determined in situ by a portable multiparameter meter sl1000 hach usa the wind speed and air temperature were measured using an anemometer testo 480 germany the channel width was directly measured at the cross section of the sampling location the channel depth water velocity and sediment thickness were measured at several points across the channel surface water samples were collected for tp tn no3 nh4 and dissolved organic carbon doc analyses and sediment samples were collected for sediment organic carbon soc analysis the colorimetric method was applied to analyse the tp tn no3 and nh4 concentrations with an autoanalyser 3 bran luebbe germany the dissolved total carbon and doc concentrations were determined with a shimadzu toc l analyser the soc content was quantified with a costech ecs 4010 element analyser the chlorophyll a concentration was measured according to the national standard method hj 897 2017 2 4 estimation of the carbon gas emissions from beijing inland waters the inland waters in beijing include rivers lakes and reservoirs the estimation of the carbon gas emissions from rivers and lakes was based on the flux data obtained in our study each river surface area was calculated by multiplying its length and average width the length of each river was cited from the beijing water statistical yearbook 2018 and the average width was calculated based on the width measured in situ at the sampling sites and the width of several more sites obtained from google earth maps the rivers in the chaobaihe and yondinghe river systems fig 1 outside the six urban districts have been subjected to relatively few human interventions and the annual emission from each river system was estimated by multiplying the annual average flux of the sampled sites in each river system by the total water surface area and the ice free days 290 d the annual emission from the other river systems was estimated by multiplying the annual average flux of the remaining sampled sites of the beijing inland waters by the corresponding total surface area and ice free days the surface area of each lake was directly measured from google earth maps the total annual emissions from lakes were estimated by multiplying the annual average fluxes of the lake sites by the total lake surface area and ice free days we did not measure the carbon gas fluxes from reservoirs which account for 51 of the water surface area in beijing so we determined the carbon gas fluxes from two large and medium sized reservoirs in beijing table s2 the calculation method of the total annual emissions from the reservoirs was the same as that from lakes the total carbon gas emission from the beijing inland waters were then calculated as the sum of the annual emissions from the above three water bodies 2 5 statistical analysis the monthly and seasonal variabilities in the carbon gas concentrations and fluxes were calculated with the data obtained at the ten sites sampled during 17 sampling campaigns and the remaining analyses were performed with all the data across all sites and sampling times pearson correlation one way anova and stepwise regression analyses were performed using ibm spss 21 0 pearson correlation analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between the carbon gas concentration flux and water chemistry e g doc soc concentration water temperature do tp nh4 chlorophyll a one way anova was employed to examine the significant difference in the carbon gas concentration flux between daytime and nighttime periods between rivers and lakes and among seasons a multiple stepwise regression analysis for the correlation between the dissolved ch4 concentration and water chemistry parameters was conducted 3 results 3 1 patterns of the dissolved ch4 and pco2 the diel variation of ch4 concentration measured at the two sites ranged from 0 9 to 2 9 µmol l 1 with an average of 1 9 0 7 µmol l 1 although the daytime ch4 concentration 2 0 0 6 µmol l 1 was slightly higher than the nighttime ch4 concentration 1 9 0 7 µmol l 1 fig 2 a there was no significant difference between the daytime and nighttime ch4 concentration p 0 7 the nighttime pco2 875 500 µatm was slightly higher than the daytime pco2 748 261 µatm but there was no significant difference between the daytime and nighttime p 0 5 although photosynthesis occurs during daytime and consumes co2 the respiration producing co2 is also high under high temperature in addition although there is no photosynthesis during nighttime the respiration under lower temperature during the nighttime is lower than that of the daytime leading to the insignificant difference in pco2 between the daytime and nighttime therefore the measurements performed in the daytime could reflect the patterns of the dissolved carbon gases in beijing inland waters the pch4 value in the atmosphere ranged from 1 7 to 3 8 ppmv averaging 2 2 0 03 ppmv the dissolved ch4 concentration ranged from 0 08 to 70 2 µmol l 1 or 53 to 53303 µatm averaging 2 5 5 9 µmol l 1 or 1691 4223 µatm across all samples the ch4 concentrations were significantly supersaturated with regard to the atmosphere with saturation ratios of 1 9 103 to 1 9 106 averaging 7 5 104 1 6 105 suggesting that the urban inland waters function as major net sources of ch4 emissions into the atmosphere seasonally the ch4 concentration was the highest in summer 3 9 9 3 µmol l 1 followed by that in spring 2 9 5 8 µmol l 1 and fall 1 5 2 8 µmol l 1 fig 3 a coinciding with the highest water temperature in summer the mean ch4 concentration was higher in the urban rivers than in the urban lakes 2 7 6 4 µmol l 1 versus 1 1 0 9 µmol l 1 table 1 the rivers receiving reclaimed water had higher ch4 concentrations 3 6 8 3 µmol l 1 than the rivers receiving natural water replenishment 1 6 1 3 µmol l 1 p 0 05 the atmospheric pco2 value ranged from 348 to 532 ppmv an average of 426 29 ppmv the water pco2 value ranged from 5 to 20763 µatm averaging 2862 3768 µatm across all samples and the pco2 value was higher than the atmospheric equilibrium value in 84 of the observations the pco2 value averaged 4421 5093 µatm in summer 2797 3066 µatm in fall and 2685 3515 µatm in spring and there was a significant difference between summer and spring and between summer and fall p 0 05 fig 3b a significant positive correlation was observed between the dissolved ch4 and pco2 p 0 001 fig s1 3 2 spatiotemporal variability in fch4 and fco2 the bubble release rate measured with the inverted funnel deployments n 53 during five sampling campaigns averaged 77 62 ml m 2 h 1 and the ch4 concentrations in the bubbles ranged from 0 01 to approximately 44 by volume the average ch4 concentration in the bubbles was much higher than the average co2 concentration 13 versus 0 4 the average ch4 ebullition was 13 6 23 7 mmol m 2 d 1 0 132 7 mmol m 2 d 1 as measured by the inverted funnels which was almost the same as the value 13 0 19 6 mmol m 2 d 1 0 100 9 mmol m 2 d 1 obtained from the calculations based on equations 1 4 therefore the ch4 ebullition determined with the two methods was consistent and the calculations of the ebullitive ch4 flux based on equations 1 4 were reliable the daytime and nighttime ebullitions measured at the two sites averaged 11 3 10 8 and 10 1 11 9 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively and the diurnal variation was not significant p 0 8 furthermore there was no significant difference in the total ch4 flux fig 2b ebullitive ch4 flux or co2 flux between the daytime and nighttime therefore the measurements performed in the daytime could also reflect the patterns of fch4 and fco2 in beijing inland waters ch4 ebullition was detected in approximately 76 of the observations the ebullitive ch4 flux ranged from 0 to 195 5 mmol m 2 d 1 with an average of 11 3 30 4 mmol m 2 d 1 and the diffusive ch4 flux ranged from 0 02 to 150 9 mmol m 2 d 1 with an average of 3 3 11 9 mmol m 2 d 1 fig 4 b the total ch4 fluxes were highly variable and ranged from 0 07 to 251 8 mmol m 2 d 1 across all samples with a mean value of 14 2 35 1 mmol m 2 d 1 fig 4a the ebullitive ch4 flux accounted for 80 of the total flux on average suggesting that ch4 ebullition is a major pathway in urban inland waters seasonally the ch4 ebullition in summer 20 2 42 8 mmol m 2 d 1 was higher than that in spring 13 1 34 8 mmol m 2 d 1 and fall 1 8 4 3 mmol m 2 d 1 and there was a significant difference between the summer and fall ebullitions p 0 05 rivers attained a higher ebullition 13 5 32 9 mmol m 2 d 1 than lakes 0 5 1 4 mmol m 2 d 1 p 0 05 the rivers receiving reclaimed water exhibited a higher diffusive ch4 flux 5 6 16 9 mmol m 2 d 1 than that of rivers receiving natural water replenishment 1 4 1 6 mmol m 2 d 1 p 0 05 the co2 fluxes ranged from 25 3 to 834 7 mmol m 2 d 1 with a mean value of 88 5 144 9 mmol m 2 d 1 in approximately 20 of the observations the co2 flux was negative and averaged 9 3 6 6 mmol m 2 d 1 the average co2 flux at sites with a positive flux was 114 1 152 8 mmol m 2 d 1 in contrast to ch4 there was no significant difference in the co2 fluxes among the three seasons fig 4c for all the samples the ratios of the ch4 fluxes to the co2 fluxes ranged from 0 0007 to 22 averaging 0 7 2 4 n 168 the negative co2 fluxes n 44 were excluded from the ratio calculations 3 3 relationships to the water chemistry the soc content ranged from 0 9 to 6 9 averaging 3 1 and doc concentrations ranged from 2 7 to 20 2 mg l 1 averaging 7 3 mg l 1 we observed a significant relationship between soc and surface water ch4 concentration r2 0 27 p 0 05 fig 5 a in addition there was a significant positive correlation between doc and ch4 ebullition p 0 01 fig 5b furthermore a significant relationship was also observed between the sediment thickness 0 5 65 cm 15 cm on average and the surface water ch4 concentration r2 0 16 p 0 001 or ebullition r2 0 25 p 0 001 fig 5c the ch4 concentration pco2 and co2 and ch4 fluxes were all negatively correlated with the o2 concentration p 0 0001 fig 6 which ranged from 0 4 to 20 9 mg l 1 averaging 9 7 mg l 1 and were negatively correlated with the water temperature p 0 001 notable positive relationships were observed between ebullition and water temperature p 0 001 fig 7 a the temperature dependency of ebullition was equivalent to θs and q10 values of 1 11 and 2 8 respectively these results suggest that a one degree water temperature rise would lead to an 11 higher ebullition and ebullition would increase 2 8 times with a ten degree water temperature increase furthermore we found that ebullition sharply increased with the water temperature at a water temperature of 17 c whereas the diffusive ch4 flux remained almost stable with increasing temperature the pco2 value was also positively correlated with the water temperature p 0 001 fig s2 furthermore the contribution of fch4 to the total carbon gas tcg flux fch4 fco2 expressed in mg c m 2 d 1 was positively correlated with the water temperature p 0 001 fig 7b suggesting that the water temperature imposes a greater effect on the ch4 emissions than on the co2 emissions additionally the ratio of fch4 in co2eq to the sum of fch4 in co2eq and fco2 was also positively correlated with the water temperature r2 0 34 p 0 01 the dissolved ch4 fch4 pco2 and fco2 levels were all positively correlated with tp p 0 001 fig 8 which ranged from 0 002 to 2 19 mg l 1 averaging 0 16 mg l 1 the ch4 concentration was also positively correlated with nh4 0 03 9 6 mg n l 1 0 9 mg n l 1 on average r2 0 31 p 0 0001 fig 9 a and pco2 was positively correlated with nh4 and tn p 0 0001 furthermore there was a significant positive relationship between the ch4 and chlorophyll a concentrations 1 2 657 6 µg l 1 30 0 µg l 1 on average fig 9b r2 0 12 p 0 0001 while pco2 and fco2 were all negatively correlated with the ph p 0 0001 fig s3 in contrast the water depth was found to exert negative effects on the ch4 ebullition from urban inland waters p 0 05 fig 5d 3 4 regional estimates of the urban inland water ch4 and co2 emissions we estimated that the all urban inland waters in beijing emitted 9 2 gg ch4 and 155 0 gg co2 per year into the atmosphere over the ice free period table 2 the urban rivers accounted for a disproportionately large contribution to these emissions although the river surface area was only 47 of the total water surface area as much as 94 and 78 of the ch4 and co2 emissions respectively stemmed from rivers the ratio of co2 c to ch4 c was 28 for the diffusive emissions and 5 for the total emissions table s3 which implies that total ch4 emissions accounted for 17 of the total mass of c emitted as ch4 plus co2 when expressed in terms of co2 equivalent emissions the ch4 emissions were 1 7 times 9 2 28 155 1 7 greater than the co2 emissions in their contribution to radiative forcing gwp values of 28 kg co2 equivalent kg 1 ch4 over 100 years 4 discussion 4 1 intense ch4 ebullition from the urban inland waters the average ch4 concentration 2 5 5 9 µmol l 1 in the beijing inland waters was higher than that in boreal 0 8 µmol l 1 temperate 0 6 µmol l 1 subtropical 1 5 µmol l 1 or even certain tropical rivers and estuaries table s4 and the global mean value 1 35 µmol l 1 stanley et al 2016 suggesting that these urban inland waters are aquatic ch4 production hotspots the measured bubble release rates in this study 77 62 ml m 2 h 1 were higher than those measured for other streams an average of 18 ml m 2 h 1 baulch et al 2011 crawford et al 2014 furthermore the average bubble mediated ch4 flux in this study 11 3 30 4 mmol m 2 d 1 was approximately 6 times higher than the estimated mean value for global streams and rivers 2 0 2 7 mmol m 2 d 1 stanley et al 2016 these results suggest that the urban inland waters are major bubble methane sources in regard to the atmosphere which probably occurs because of the high organic carbon contents and shallow water depths of the urban inland waters see below in contrast although the ch4 concentration is relatively high the average diffusive flux 3 3 11 9 mmol m 2 d 1 was lower than the estimated global riverine mean value 8 2 25 5 mmol m 2 d 1 n 385 sites stanley et al 2016 such a low ch4 diffusion was possibly caused by the low water velocity and wind speed in the urban areas see below as a result of the high ebullition the average total ch4 flux 14 2 35 1 mmol m 2 d 1 in the urban inland waters was more than 3 times higher than the global average value 4 2 8 4 mmol m 2 d 1 n 26 sites stanley et al 2016 or even higher than most of the riverine ch4 fluxes in tropical areas table s4 the total ch4 emission expressed per unit water surface area in the beijing rivers and lakes 39 t km 2 y 1 was lower than that in mexico city 363 t km 2 y 1 martinez cruz et al 2017 and comparable to that in berlin city 49 t km 2 y 1 ortega et al 2019 overall the annual ch4 emissions per unit water surface area in the beijing inland waters were approximately two times higher than those in non urban rivers in temperate zones 17 9 t km 2 y 1 table s3 the co2 c ch4 c emission ratio and the contribution of ch4 to the total mass of c emitted ch4 co2 in the beijing inland waters 5 for total emissions 17 were contrary to other rivers where the emission ratios were much higher hence their ch4 contribution to the total mass of c emissions was much lower 17 1277 average of 287 0 07 5 6 table s3 4 2 drivers of the ch4 production and emission in the urban inland waters in this study the high surface water ch4 concentrations and ebullitive fluxes were related to the high soc doc high aquatic primary productivity and shallow water depths in the urban inland waters the positive correlations between the ch4 concentrations and soc p 0 05 fig 5a as well as between ch4 ebullition and doc p 0 05 fig 5b suggest that organic carbon is an essential factor in determining the magnitude of methanogenesis and ch4 emissions from urban inland waters similar correlations between soc doc and ch4 concentration have been reported for streams baulch et al 2011 campeau and giorgio 2014 crawford et al 2014 in contrast to other inland waters the soc content in the urban rivers was significantly higher table s5 and s6 and the doc concentration 7 3 mg l 1 was also significantly higher than the mean value for global rivers 6 1 mg l 1 n 737 sites p 0 05 fig s4 which provides sufficient substrates for methanogenesis in these waters however the dissolved ch4 concentration varied among some sites with a similar soc level fig 5a which may be due to the different sediment thicknesses because thick sediments are favourable for ch4 production fig 5b in addition the medians of tp and nh4 n levels in the urban inland waters 0 07 mg l 1 0 3 mg l 1 were also higher than those for global rivers 0 04 mg l 1 n 137 sites 0 05 mg l 1 n 595 sites fig s4 the higher nutrient levels tp nh4 could stimulate phytoplankton growth and autotrophic organic carbon production which was demonstrated by the higher chlorophyll a concentration averaging 30 0 µg l 1 in this study than that in other inland waters 10 3 µg l 1 table s6 autotrophic organic carbon is highly bioavailable shi et al 2017 and upon death becomes part of the bottom sediments and alters the sediment redox and texture characteristics thereby creating conditions that not only promote methanogenesis but also cause easier bubble release davidson et al 2018 anoxic or low oxygen conditions are necessary for methanogenesis and therefore extremely high methane concentrations and fluxes were only found in waters where do was very low e g 3 mg l 1 fig 6 the sinking and remineralization of the abundant phytoplankton in the urban inland waters would further contribute to do consumption wang et al 2016 which will promote ch4 production stepwise regression analysis of the correlation between the dissolved ch4 concentration and water chemistry parameters including doc soc do tp nh4 chlorophyll a water temperature and sediment thickness obtained during one sampling campaign showed that soc and sediment thickness collectively explained 72 of the variance in the dissolved ch4 concentration table s7 ebullition increased exponentially with increasing water temperature fig 7 at high temperatures sedimentary organic carbon decomposes faster and consumes more dissolved oxygen creating conditions which favor methanogenesis the water temperature exerted a larger impact on ebullition than on diffusion which is probably caused by the decreased ch4 solubility in the pore water and low atmospheric pressure at high air temperatures which promotes ebullitive rather than diffusive ch4 fluxes into the atmosphere in aquatic environments zhang et al 2020 the ebullitive ch4 flux was also affected by the geophysical conditions of the water bodies a shallower water depth has been linked to an increased ch4 flux bastviken et al 2010 due to the shorter travel path time which limits bubble dissolution and ch4 oxidation in the water column the significant negative relationships between the water depth and ebullition across two depth ranges 0 4 1 8 and 2 4 3 5 m respectively fig 5d confirm the role of the water depth as an important control on the ebullitive flux the higher ebullition at depths from 2 5 3 m probably occurred because these sites were located above dams with thick sediments 40 cm which have been shown to be ch4 ebullition and emission hotspots maeck et al 2013 furthermore a unique positive correlation was observed between the water depth and ebullition at the shallowest depths below 0 4 m such a correlation may be due to the increase in sediment organic matter oxidization with decreasing water depth under the resuspension caused by waves and winds which is not beneficial for ch4 production despite the inter site variability the water depth of the urban inland waters was consistently small 1 3 0 9 m which resulted in a higher ebullition in the urban inland waters than that in other inland waters diffusion is a function of the dissolved ch4 concentration and water air gas transfer velocity despite the high ch4 concentration the diffusion from the urban inland waters was relatively low which was probably due to the low k 600 value in the urban areas 1 4 1 5 m d 1 the average k 600 value in this study was lower than that reported not only for steep channel slope streams maurice et al 2017 and subalpine streams schelker et al 2016 but also for low channel slope streams raymond et al 2012 and comparable only to those for lentic waters including ponds and lakes holgerson and raymond 2016 as well as oceans wanninkhof et al 2009 the water velocity in the beijing inland waters 0 0 8 m s 1 0 1 m s 1 on average was relatively lower than that in other rivers alin et al 2011 liu et al 2017 the variation in k 600 from the urban areas was best explained by a relationship with the flow velocity v in m s 1 k 600 3 9v 0 8 r 2 0 38 p 0 0001 in addition the k 600 value in this study was also lower than that predicted by other studies at the same flow velocity alin et al 2011 liu et al 2017 this might be due to the lower wind speed 0 5 m s 1 1 2 m s 1 on average in this study than that in other studies 3 2 m s 1 table s8 therefore the low diffusive ch4 flux mainly occurred due to the low water velocity and wind speed in the urban areas of beijing the higher ch4 concentration in the rivers than that in the lakes observed in beijing was probably due to the higher doc concentrations significantly higher tp nh4 n and chlorophyll a concentrations p 0 01 and significantly lower do concentrations p 0 05 in the rivers table s5 these reasons could also explain the higher ch4 concentrations in the rivers receiving reclaimed water than those in the rivers receiving natural water replenishment the disproportionately high contribution of the ch4 emissions from the rivers to the total emissions from beijing inland waters in regard to the river surface area probably occurred due to the higher ch4 production and the shallower water depth promoting bubble release in these rivers the remarkably high ebullition in summer seemed to be the result of significantly higher water temperature and doc concentration p 0 01 and significantly lower do concentration p 0 01 in summer table s5 4 3 enhanced ebullition and ch4 contribution to the total ghgs under climate warming due to the intense ch4 ebullition the fch4 fco2 ratios 0 0007 to 22 derived from the beijing inland waters far exceeded those reported for other rivers and streams worldwide stanley et al 2016 high fch4 fco2 ratios were observed as an exception in streams and rivers on the east qinghai tibet plateau with highly permafrost carbon inputs shallow water depths and low air pressures zhang et al 2020 these observations generally suggest that high fch4 fco2 ratios are associated with rivers and streams receiving high organic loads and possessing shallow water depths which is beneficial for ch4 production and ebullition therefore high ch4 ebullition and fch4 fco2 ratios are expected to occur in other inland waters with biogeochemical and physical processes similar to those of the beijing inland waters the positive relationship between the fch4 ftcg ratio and temperature fig 7b suggests that the contribution of ch4 to the carbon greenhouse gases from the urban inland waters would greatly increase with increasing temperature the stronger temperature dependence of ebullition than that of diffusion and the dominance of ebullition above a water temperature of 17 c imply that the relative importance of the ebullitive ch4 emissions will increase under a warming climate significant ch4 emissions would finally be released from the urban inland waters into the atmosphere through ebullition under climate warming urban areas are affected by the urban heat island effect where the temperature is normally 2 4 c higher than that in surrounding areas liu et al 2015 a higher frequency and longer duration of heat waves are also expected to occur and increase under future climate projections stocker et al 2013 according to the results obtained in this study urban heat islands and heat waves are expected to substantially increase the urban inland water carbon ghg evasions through a disproportional increase in ch4 ebullition and the contribution of ch4 to the total carbon ghgs thus establishing a positive feedback loop between the urban inland water ghg emissions and climate warming to lower the greenhouse gas emissions from urban inland waters wwtps should improve the wastewater treatment efficiency to reduce the nutrient input to urban inland waters dredging of sediment especially the thick sediment above the sluice gates or rubber dams could reduce the soc content and sediment thickness and therefore lower the ch4 production in addition the removal of phytoplankton could be beneficial to lower ch4 emissions 5 conclusion ebullitive ch4 the related mechanisms of ch4 emissions and contribution of ch4 to carbon gas emissions from urban inland waters were explored in this study the average methane ebullition 11 3 30 4 mmol m 2 d 1 was approximately 6 times higher than global average due to high sediment dissolved organic carbon contents high aquatic primary productivity and shallow water depths in the urban inland waters methane ebullition increased exponentially with water temperature the average total ch4 flux 14 2 35 1 mmol m 2 d 1 was 3 times higher than the global average with ebullition accounting for 80 of the flux methane emissions were 20 of co2 emissions in terms of carbon release and 1 7 times greater in terms of co2 equivalent emissions suggesting the significant role of ch4 evasion in greenhouse gas emissions urban inland waters which are an essential component of global urbanization will play an important role in the global carbon gas efflux in particular their role as hotspots for ch4 evasion will further be amplified over the next decades under the effect of further global urbanization and the increasing

17367,the evasions of methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 from inland waters represent substantial fluxes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere offsetting a large part of the continental carbon sink however the ch4 and co2 emissions from urban inland waters are less constrained in particular ebullitive ch4 emissions from these waters are poorly understood here we measured the concentrations and fluxes of ch4 and co2 in rivers and lakes in the megacity of beijing china between 2018 and 2019 the ch4 concentration ranged from 0 08 to 70 2 µmol l 1 with an average of 2 5 5 9 µmol l 1 the average ch4 ebullition was 11 3 30 4 mmol m 2 d 1 and was approximately 6 times higher than the global average the average total ch4 flux 14 2 35 1 mmol m 2 d 1 was 3 times higher than the global average with ebullition accounting for 80 of the flux the high surface water ch4 concentrations and ebullitive fluxes were caused by high sediment organic carbon dissolved organic carbon contents high aquatic primary productivity and shallow water depths in the urban inland waters the ch4 emissions accounted for 20 of co2 emissions in terms of the carbon release and were 1 7 times higher in terms of co2 equivalent emissions from beijing inland waters furthermore the ch4 ebullition and its contribution to the total carbon gas emissions increased exponentially with the water temperature suggesting a positive feedback probably occurs between the greenhouse gas emissions from urban inland waters and climate warming this study confirms the major role of ch4 ebullition from urban inland waters in the global carbon budget under the rapid progress of global urbanization graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methane ch4 ebullition carbon dioxide co2 urban inland waters urban heat island climate warming 1 introduction methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 emissions from inland waters including rivers reservoirs and lakes are considered important components of the global carbon cycle and major sources of atmospheric greenhouse gases ghgs bastviken et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 carbon dioxide is an end product of biological organic carbon respiration while ch4 is produced through the decomposition of organic carbon under anaerobic conditions via methanogenesis stanley et al 2016 a massive ch4 efflux from inland waters into the atmosphere could occur via diffusion ebullition and plant mediated fluxes bastviken et al 2004 although a large portion of the produced ch4 is oxidized in the water column by methanotrophs before being emitted into the atmosphere selvam et al 2014 although the ch4 efflux from inland waters is relatively low in terms of carbon emissions 4 of the co2 c efflux cole et al 2007 it is the second largest contributor to the atmospheric radiative forcing after co2 forster et al 2007 due to its 28 fold global warming potential gwp over that of co2 over 100 years global inland water co2 emissions have been estimated to reach 2 1 pg c yr 1 raymond et al 2013 which relied almost exclusively on co2 calculated from carbonate equilibria direct measurements of co2 emissions are scarce global ch4 emissions from inland waters have been reported to range 40 120 tg ch4 yr 1 in different studies bastviken et al 2011 kirschke et al 2013 saunois et al 2016 the emissions from rivers have been estimated to reach 1 5 tg ch4 yr 1 which is based on a limited number of measurements of riverine fluxes bastviken et al 2011 relying on a larger and more spatially representative data set stanley et al 2016 revised the ch4 emissions from rivers and streams upwards to 26 8 tg ch4 year 1 which is higher than 50 of the efflux from inland waters including rivers reservoirs and lakes estimated by kirschke et al 2013 although progress has been attained regarding the estimation of carbon gas emissions from inland waters these global estimates are still largely uncertain because of the severe disparity of data urban inland waters which are located in cities and influenced by heavy human modifications are underrepresented in global estimates of aquatic ch4 and co2 emissions urban inland waters however exhibit a specific aquatic biogeochemistry and hydrology making them unique in terms of functioning as ghg emitters first urbanization has heavily modified inland waters by elevating pollutant and nutrient loads and changing the hydromorphology of urban rivers walsh et al 2005 unlike pollutants in rivers stemming from agricultural land uses which are largely composed of nutrients including nitrogen and phosphorus urban rivers may also receive massive carbon inputs from urban sewage systems and wastewater treatment plants wwtps organic carbon is largely decomposed via microbial processes thereby consuming oxygen and producing co2 leading to hypoxia teurlincx et al 2019 which stimulates anaerobic processes such as methanogenesis denitrification and anammox second urban inland waters are characterized by a relatively shallow water depth and low hydrostatic pressure mcenroe et al 2013 and are likely to experience more ch4 evasion due to the short time bubbles require to travel to the water surface holgerson and raymond 2016 zhang et al 2020 thus limiting bubble dissolution and ch4 oxidation in the water column these imply that urban inland waters are potentially important sources of ch4 and co2 emissions and probably act as ch4 production and ebullition hotspots except for shallow lakes and ponds which have been identified as ch4 production hotspots 62 of the average total fluxes davidson et al 2018 methane emissions from urban inland waters have been studied in several cities martinez cruz et al 2017 ortega et al 2019 wang et al 2020 wang et al 2018 yu et al 2017 however most studies have only reported ch4 emissions estimated from the boundary layer theory and have ignored bubble fluxes and the role of ebullition and contribution of ch4 to carbon gas emissions have not been evaluated in addition the influencing factors for the ch4 emissions from urban inland waters are poorly understood in this work we selected the megacity of beijing as an example to study methane ebullition from urban inland waters and its contribution to ghg emissions the objectives of this study were 1 to determine the spatial and temporal variations in the concentrations and fluxes of ch4 and co2 2 to quantify the ebullition of ch4 and to identify the drivers of ch4 production and emission and 3 to estimate the ch4 and co2 emissions and further evaluate the contribution of ch4 to the carbon gas emissions from urban inland waters under climate warming 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the study was conducted in beijing china covering an area of 16800 km2 with 21 million inhabitants of which 62 consists of mountainous regions while plains comprise the remaining 38 six urban districts located in the plains account for approximately 8 of the city area and 60 of the population beijing is characterized by an anomalously warm temperature zone and has four distinct seasons and the average annual temperature and precipitation are approximately 10 12 c and 600 mm respectively liu et al 2009 beijing is located in the haihe river basin and the inland waters in beijing include more than 100 rivers 22 lakes and 18 reservoirs mainly located in the mountainous regions beijing water statistical yearbook 2018 with a total water surface area of 459 km2 please refer to the calculation see below the river network is dense with a total length 2500 km and the water flow in the study area is low due to the low terrain slope and presence of sluice gates and rubber dams beijing water statistical yearbook 2018 the water in the river network mainly comes from reservoirs and the wastewater cycling processes of wwtps this study was composed of 17 sampling campaigns spanning a total of 17 months from july 2018 to november 2019 and a total of 21 sites were sampled including 19 sites in rivers and 2 sites in lakes fig 1 and table s1 from fig 1 we can see that the land use in the river basin mainly includes construction land cultivated land forest and pasture these rivers and lakes distribute uniformly in beijing and cover different water environment conditions the sampled rivers can also be characterized as reclaimed water supply from wwtps or natural water replenishment from reservoirs table s1 all 21 sites were sampled in august 2019 and november 2019 and 10 sites were sampled biweekly from july 2018 to july 2019 except for the freezing period from december to february table s1 in addition to measure the diurnal variability in carbon gas concentrations and fluxes day long field measurements were conducted at two sites one site was sampled every 3 h over a 24 h period on april 14 and july 10 2019 and the other site was sampled on may 22 2019 table s1 there were no extreme weather events or abnormal hydrological variations during the sampling periods 2 2 carbon gas concentrations and evasion fluxes during each sampling campaign the partial pressure of co2 pco2 in water was measured using a qubit dissolved co2 system in situ equipped with an internal pump and a pco2 probe s157 p qubit biology inc canada the system was calibrated with standard co2 gas ranging from 0 to 10 000 µatm the pco2 value that exceeded the maximum range of the pco2 probe system and the dissolved ch4 concentrations in the water samples were determined using the headspace equilibrium technique johnson et al 1990 water samples were collected in 120 ml glass serum bottles with straight plug rubber stoppers to avoid contaminating samples with any surface pollutants the water samples were collected 5 cm below the surface using a 5 l niskin water sampler and then slowly drained into the bottom of bottles through a silicone tube after filling the bottles several water volumes were allowed to overflow to avoid contamination of the water samples by atmospheric carbon gases and gas tight rubber stoppers were then quickly fitted onto the bottles samples were re collected if any bubbles were observed ten millilitres of ultrahigh purity helium was injected into the 120 ml glass serum bottles to create a headspace and the bottles were then vigorously shaken for 1 min in situ which was confirmed to be long enough for the gas to reach an equilibrium between the water and headspace subsequently the headspace gas was transferred to 20 ml airbags and triplicate gas samples were collected in airbags at each site the samples for atmospheric carbon gas partial pressure measurements were collected in 200 ml airbags the gas samples in the airbags were quantified in the laboratory with an agilent 7890b gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector fid the carbon gas concentrations in the water samples were then calculated according to the carbon gas partial pressure in the headspace and the appropriate solubility coefficient mol l 1 atm 1 wanninkhof 1992 the fluxes of ch4 and co2 across the water air interface were measured using floating chambers which were deployed on the water surface with a headspace volume of 31 l the chambers were covered with aluminium foil to minimize the solar heating effect of the headspace gases a tube was attached to the top of the chamber to allow direct headspace gas sampling from the riverbank laboratory testing of the floating chambers revealed no ghg consumption or production over a 100 min period gas samples were collected every 10 min over 60 min from the floating chamber the ch4 and co2 fluxes were calculated according to the slope of the linear regression of the carbon gas concentration versus time with the following equation 1 f c t c 0 p v a t r t 10 6 60 24 10 3 mmol m 2 d 1 where f are ch4 and co2 fluxes mmol m 2 d 1 across the water air interface ct and c0 are the ch4 and co2 concentrations in the chamber headspace at time t and 0

r is the universal gas constant 8 314 m3 pa mol 1 k 1 and t is the air temperature k during the measurement the ebullitive and diffusive ch4 fluxes were separated using the method of campeau et al campeau and giorgio 2014 briefly the co2 exchange between the surface water and atmosphere occurs exclusively by diffusion while ch4 may also be emitted into the atmosphere through bubbles therefore fco2 was adopted to estimate the diffusive gas exchange velocity according to fick s law with the following equation 2 k c o 2 f c o 2 k h p c o 2 w a t e r p c o 2 a i r where kco2 is the gas exchange velocity of co2 m d 1 fco2 is the co2 flux calculated from the floating chamber kh is the henry constant adjusted for the water temperature and salinity p c o 2 w a t e r and p c o 2 a i r are the co2 partial pressures in the surface water and atmosphere respectively the k co2 values was then standardized to a schmidt number of 600 k 600 as follows 3 k 600 k c o 2 600 s c c o 2 n where s c c o 2 is the co2 schmidt number at the given water temperature and n is the schmidt coefficient which is either 2 3 at wind speeds 3 6 m s 1 or 1 2 otherwise the k 600 was then employed to estimate the ch4 diffusive flux with equation 4 and the ebullitive flux was calculated as the difference between the total and diffusive fluxes 4 f c h 4 d i f f u s i v e k 600 s c c h 4 600 n k h p c h 4 w a t e r p c h 4 a i r we also implemented bubble gas collectors to collect bubbles during five sampling campaigns for detailed information see table s1 and then used the ebullitive flux calculated from the bubble gas collectors to verify the reliability of the ebullitive fluxes calculation method based on equations 1 4 four bubble gas collectors which consist of a 30 cm diameter polypropylene funnel affixed on the lower end of a pvc tube and a polypropylene syringe equipped with a three way valve connected to the upper end of the pvc tube were employed to collect bubbles during sampling the funnel tube syringe unit was filled with water by removing any air through the valve the bubble gas could be collected with the syringe and then sampled through the three way valve with another syringe the volume of the trapped bubbles could be easily verified from the displacement water volume in the syringe the ebullitive flux can be calculated as follows 5 f c t p v a t r t

collected bubbles ml a is the area of funnel mouth m2 t is the deployment time min r is the universal gas constant 8 314 m3 pa mol 1 k 1 and t is the air temperature k to describe the temperature dependence of ebullition for the urban inland water system we applied a modified arrhenius equation aben et al 2017 to calculate the overall system temperature coefficient for ch4 ebullition θs 6 e t e 20 θ s t 20 where e t is the ebullition rate of ch4 mmol m 2 d 1 at temperature t c e 20 is the ebullition rate of ch4 mmol m 2 d 1 at 20 c and θs is the overall system temperature coefficient dimensionless the modified arrhenius equation was fitted to the measured data using nonlinear regression analysis in originpro 2020 relying on the levenberg marquardt algorithm an iterative procedure to determine model parameters by minimizing the residual sum of squares the modelled θs value obtained from the equation was adopted to determine the temperature dependency of ch4 ebullition in the different inland water ecosystems in addition q 10 which is defined as the ratio of the rate at one temperature to that at a temperature 10 c lower denoted as θ s 10 kadlec and reddy 2001 was also considered to study the effect of temperature on ch4 ebullition 2 3 water chemistry the water temperature dissolved oxygen do electrical conductivity ph oxidation reduction potential and atmospheric pressure were determined in situ by a portable multiparameter meter sl1000 hach usa the wind speed and air temperature were measured using an anemometer testo 480 germany the channel width was directly measured at the cross section of the sampling location the channel depth water velocity and sediment thickness were measured at several points across the channel surface water samples were collected for tp tn no3 nh4 and dissolved organic carbon doc analyses and sediment samples were collected for sediment organic carbon soc analysis the colorimetric method was applied to analyse the tp tn no3 and nh4 concentrations with an autoanalyser 3 bran luebbe germany the dissolved total carbon and doc concentrations were determined with a shimadzu toc l analyser the soc content was quantified with a costech ecs 4010 element analyser the chlorophyll a concentration was measured according to the national standard method hj 897 2017 2 4 estimation of the carbon gas emissions from beijing inland waters the inland waters in beijing include rivers lakes and reservoirs the estimation of the carbon gas emissions from rivers and lakes was based on the flux data obtained in our study each river surface area was calculated by multiplying its length and average width the length of each river was cited from the beijing water statistical yearbook 2018 and the average width was calculated based on the width measured in situ at the sampling sites and the width of several more sites obtained from google earth maps the rivers in the chaobaihe and yondinghe river systems fig 1 outside the six urban districts have been subjected to relatively few human interventions and the annual emission from each river system was estimated by multiplying the annual average flux of the sampled sites in each river system by the total water surface area and the ice free days 290 d the annual emission from the other river systems was estimated by multiplying the annual average flux of the remaining sampled sites of the beijing inland waters by the corresponding total surface area and ice free days the surface area of each lake was directly measured from google earth maps the total annual emissions from lakes were estimated by multiplying the annual average fluxes of the lake sites by the total lake surface area and ice free days we did not measure the carbon gas fluxes from reservoirs which account for 51 of the water surface area in beijing so we determined the carbon gas fluxes from two large and medium sized reservoirs in beijing table s2 the calculation method of the total annual emissions from the reservoirs was the same as that from lakes the total carbon gas emission from the beijing inland waters were then calculated as the sum of the annual emissions from the above three water bodies 2 5 statistical analysis the monthly and seasonal variabilities in the carbon gas concentrations and fluxes were calculated with the data obtained at the ten sites sampled during 17 sampling campaigns and the remaining analyses were performed with all the data across all sites and sampling times pearson correlation one way anova and stepwise regression analyses were performed using ibm spss 21 0 pearson correlation analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between the carbon gas concentration flux and water chemistry e g doc soc concentration water temperature do tp nh4 chlorophyll a one way anova was employed to examine the significant difference in the carbon gas concentration flux between daytime and nighttime periods between rivers and lakes and among seasons a multiple stepwise regression analysis for the correlation between the dissolved ch4 concentration and water chemistry parameters was conducted 3 results 3 1 patterns of the dissolved ch4 and pco2 the diel variation of ch4 concentration measured at the two sites ranged from 0 9 to 2 9 µmol l 1 with an average of 1 9 0 7 µmol l 1 although the daytime ch4 concentration 2 0 0 6 µmol l 1 was slightly higher than the nighttime ch4 concentration 1 9 0 7 µmol l 1 fig 2 a there was no significant difference between the daytime and nighttime ch4 concentration p 0 7 the nighttime pco2 875 500 µatm was slightly higher than the daytime pco2 748 261 µatm but there was no significant difference between the daytime and nighttime p 0 5 although photosynthesis occurs during daytime and consumes co2 the respiration producing co2 is also high under high temperature in addition although there is no photosynthesis during nighttime the respiration under lower temperature during the nighttime is lower than that of the daytime leading to the insignificant difference in pco2 between the daytime and nighttime therefore the measurements performed in the daytime could reflect the patterns of the dissolved carbon gases in beijing inland waters the pch4 value in the atmosphere ranged from 1 7 to 3 8 ppmv averaging 2 2 0 03 ppmv the dissolved ch4 concentration ranged from 0 08 to 70 2 µmol l 1 or 53 to 53303 µatm averaging 2 5 5 9 µmol l 1 or 1691 4223 µatm across all samples the ch4 concentrations were significantly supersaturated with regard to the atmosphere with saturation ratios of 1 9 103 to 1 9 106 averaging 7 5 104 1 6 105 suggesting that the urban inland waters function as major net sources of ch4 emissions into the atmosphere seasonally the ch4 concentration was the highest in summer 3 9 9 3 µmol l 1 followed by that in spring 2 9 5 8 µmol l 1 and fall 1 5 2 8 µmol l 1 fig 3 a coinciding with the highest water temperature in summer the mean ch4 concentration was higher in the urban rivers than in the urban lakes 2 7 6 4 µmol l 1 versus 1 1 0 9 µmol l 1 table 1 the rivers receiving reclaimed water had higher ch4 concentrations 3 6 8 3 µmol l 1 than the rivers receiving natural water replenishment 1 6 1 3 µmol l 1 p 0 05 the atmospheric pco2 value ranged from 348 to 532 ppmv an average of 426 29 ppmv the water pco2 value ranged from 5 to 20763 µatm averaging 2862 3768 µatm across all samples and the pco2 value was higher than the atmospheric equilibrium value in 84 of the observations the pco2 value averaged 4421 5093 µatm in summer 2797 3066 µatm in fall and 2685 3515 µatm in spring and there was a significant difference between summer and spring and between summer and fall p 0 05 fig 3b a significant positive correlation was observed between the dissolved ch4 and pco2 p 0 001 fig s1 3 2 spatiotemporal variability in fch4 and fco2 the bubble release rate measured with the inverted funnel deployments n 53 during five sampling campaigns averaged 77 62 ml m 2 h 1 and the ch4 concentrations in the bubbles ranged from 0 01 to approximately 44 by volume the average ch4 concentration in the bubbles was much higher than the average co2 concentration 13 versus 0 4 the average ch4 ebullition was 13 6 23 7 mmol m 2 d 1 0 132 7 mmol m 2 d 1 as measured by the inverted funnels which was almost the same as the value 13 0 19 6 mmol m 2 d 1 0 100 9 mmol m 2 d 1 obtained from the calculations based on equations 1 4 therefore the ch4 ebullition determined with the two methods was consistent and the calculations of the ebullitive ch4 flux based on equations 1 4 were reliable the daytime and nighttime ebullitions measured at the two sites averaged 11 3 10 8 and 10 1 11 9 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively and the diurnal variation was not significant p 0 8 furthermore there was no significant difference in the total ch4 flux fig 2b ebullitive ch4 flux or co2 flux between the daytime and nighttime therefore the measurements performed in the daytime could also reflect the patterns of fch4 and fco2 in beijing inland waters ch4 ebullition was detected in approximately 76 of the observations the ebullitive ch4 flux ranged from 0 to 195 5 mmol m 2 d 1 with an average of 11 3 30 4 mmol m 2 d 1 and the diffusive ch4 flux ranged from 0 02 to 150 9 mmol m 2 d 1 with an average of 3 3 11 9 mmol m 2 d 1 fig 4 b the total ch4 fluxes were highly variable and ranged from 0 07 to 251 8 mmol m 2 d 1 across all samples with a mean value of 14 2 35 1 mmol m 2 d 1 fig 4a the ebullitive ch4 flux accounted for 80 of the total flux on average suggesting that ch4 ebullition is a major pathway in urban inland waters seasonally the ch4 ebullition in summer 20 2 42 8 mmol m 2 d 1 was higher than that in spring 13 1 34 8 mmol m 2 d 1 and fall 1 8 4 3 mmol m 2 d 1 and there was a significant difference between the summer and fall ebullitions p 0 05 rivers attained a higher ebullition 13 5 32 9 mmol m 2 d 1 than lakes 0 5 1 4 mmol m 2 d 1 p 0 05 the rivers receiving reclaimed water exhibited a higher diffusive ch4 flux 5 6 16 9 mmol m 2 d 1 than that of rivers receiving natural water replenishment 1 4 1 6 mmol m 2 d 1 p 0 05 the co2 fluxes ranged from 25 3 to 834 7 mmol m 2 d 1 with a mean value of 88 5 144 9 mmol m 2 d 1 in approximately 20 of the observations the co2 flux was negative and averaged 9 3 6 6 mmol m 2 d 1 the average co2 flux at sites with a positive flux was 114 1 152 8 mmol m 2 d 1 in contrast to ch4 there was no significant difference in the co2 fluxes among the three seasons fig 4c for all the samples the ratios of the ch4 fluxes to the co2 fluxes ranged from 0 0007 to 22 averaging 0 7 2 4 n 168 the negative co2 fluxes n 44 were excluded from the ratio calculations 3 3 relationships to the water chemistry the soc content ranged from 0 9 to 6 9 averaging 3 1 and doc concentrations ranged from 2 7 to 20 2 mg l 1 averaging 7 3 mg l 1 we observed a significant relationship between soc and surface water ch4 concentration r2 0 27 p 0 05 fig 5 a in addition there was a significant positive correlation between doc and ch4 ebullition p 0 01 fig 5b furthermore a significant relationship was also observed between the sediment thickness 0 5 65 cm 15 cm on average and the surface water ch4 concentration r2 0 16 p 0 001 or ebullition r2 0 25 p 0 001 fig 5c the ch4 concentration pco2 and co2 and ch4 fluxes were all negatively correlated with the o2 concentration p 0 0001 fig 6 which ranged from 0 4 to 20 9 mg l 1 averaging 9 7 mg l 1 and were negatively correlated with the water temperature p 0 001 notable positive relationships were observed between ebullition and water temperature p 0 001 fig 7 a the temperature dependency of ebullition was equivalent to θs and q10 values of 1 11 and 2 8 respectively these results suggest that a one degree water temperature rise would lead to an 11 higher ebullition and ebullition would increase 2 8 times with a ten degree water temperature increase furthermore we found that ebullition sharply increased with the water temperature at a water temperature of 17 c whereas the diffusive ch4 flux remained almost stable with increasing temperature the pco2 value was also positively correlated with the water temperature p 0 001 fig s2 furthermore the contribution of fch4 to the total carbon gas tcg flux fch4 fco2 expressed in mg c m 2 d 1 was positively correlated with the water temperature p 0 001 fig 7b suggesting that the water temperature imposes a greater effect on the ch4 emissions than on the co2 emissions additionally the ratio of fch4 in co2eq to the sum of fch4 in co2eq and fco2 was also positively correlated with the water temperature r2 0 34 p 0 01 the dissolved ch4 fch4 pco2 and fco2 levels were all positively correlated with tp p 0 001 fig 8 which ranged from 0 002 to 2 19 mg l 1 averaging 0 16 mg l 1 the ch4 concentration was also positively correlated with nh4 0 03 9 6 mg n l 1 0 9 mg n l 1 on average r2 0 31 p 0 0001 fig 9 a and pco2 was positively correlated with nh4 and tn p 0 0001 furthermore there was a significant positive relationship between the ch4 and chlorophyll a concentrations 1 2 657 6 µg l 1 30 0 µg l 1 on average fig 9b r2 0 12 p 0 0001 while pco2 and fco2 were all negatively correlated with the ph p 0 0001 fig s3 in contrast the water depth was found to exert negative effects on the ch4 ebullition from urban inland waters p 0 05 fig 5d 3 4 regional estimates of the urban inland water ch4 and co2 emissions we estimated that the all urban inland waters in beijing emitted 9 2 gg ch4 and 155 0 gg co2 per year into the atmosphere over the ice free period table 2 the urban rivers accounted for a disproportionately large contribution to these emissions although the river surface area was only 47 of the total water surface area as much as 94 and 78 of the ch4 and co2 emissions respectively stemmed from rivers the ratio of co2 c to ch4 c was 28 for the diffusive emissions and 5 for the total emissions table s3 which implies that total ch4 emissions accounted for 17 of the total mass of c emitted as ch4 plus co2 when expressed in terms of co2 equivalent emissions the ch4 emissions were 1 7 times 9 2 28 155 1 7 greater than the co2 emissions in their contribution to radiative forcing gwp values of 28 kg co2 equivalent kg 1 ch4 over 100 years 4 discussion 4 1 intense ch4 ebullition from the urban inland waters the average ch4 concentration 2 5 5 9 µmol l 1 in the beijing inland waters was higher than that in boreal 0 8 µmol l 1 temperate 0 6 µmol l 1 subtropical 1 5 µmol l 1 or even certain tropical rivers and estuaries table s4 and the global mean value 1 35 µmol l 1 stanley et al 2016 suggesting that these urban inland waters are aquatic ch4 production hotspots the measured bubble release rates in this study 77 62 ml m 2 h 1 were higher than those measured for other streams an average of 18 ml m 2 h 1 baulch et al 2011 crawford et al 2014 furthermore the average bubble mediated ch4 flux in this study 11 3 30 4 mmol m 2 d 1 was approximately 6 times higher than the estimated mean value for global streams and rivers 2 0 2 7 mmol m 2 d 1 stanley et al 2016 these results suggest that the urban inland waters are major bubble methane sources in regard to the atmosphere which probably occurs because of the high organic carbon contents and shallow water depths of the urban inland waters see below in contrast although the ch4 concentration is relatively high the average diffusive flux 3 3 11 9 mmol m 2 d 1 was lower than the estimated global riverine mean value 8 2 25 5 mmol m 2 d 1 n 385 sites stanley et al 2016 such a low ch4 diffusion was possibly caused by the low water velocity and wind speed in the urban areas see below as a result of the high ebullition the average total ch4 flux 14 2 35 1 mmol m 2 d 1 in the urban inland waters was more than 3 times higher than the global average value 4 2 8 4 mmol m 2 d 1 n 26 sites stanley et al 2016 or even higher than most of the riverine ch4 fluxes in tropical areas table s4 the total ch4 emission expressed per unit water surface area in the beijing rivers and lakes 39 t km 2 y 1 was lower than that in mexico city 363 t km 2 y 1 martinez cruz et al 2017 and comparable to that in berlin city 49 t km 2 y 1 ortega et al 2019 overall the annual ch4 emissions per unit water surface area in the beijing inland waters were approximately two times higher than those in non urban rivers in temperate zones 17 9 t km 2 y 1 table s3 the co2 c ch4 c emission ratio and the contribution of ch4 to the total mass of c emitted ch4 co2 in the beijing inland waters 5 for total emissions 17 were contrary to other rivers where the emission ratios were much higher hence their ch4 contribution to the total mass of c emissions was much lower 17 1277 average of 287 0 07 5 6 table s3 4 2 drivers of the ch4 production and emission in the urban inland waters in this study the high surface water ch4 concentrations and ebullitive fluxes were related to the high soc doc high aquatic primary productivity and shallow water depths in the urban inland waters the positive correlations between the ch4 concentrations and soc p 0 05 fig 5a as well as between ch4 ebullition and doc p 0 05 fig 5b suggest that organic carbon is an essential factor in determining the magnitude of methanogenesis and ch4 emissions from urban inland waters similar correlations between soc doc and ch4 concentration have been reported for streams baulch et al 2011 campeau and giorgio 2014 crawford et al 2014 in contrast to other inland waters the soc content in the urban rivers was significantly higher table s5 and s6 and the doc concentration 7 3 mg l 1 was also significantly higher than the mean value for global rivers 6 1 mg l 1 n 737 sites p 0 05 fig s4 which provides sufficient substrates for methanogenesis in these waters however the dissolved ch4 concentration varied among some sites with a similar soc level fig 5a which may be due to the different sediment thicknesses because thick sediments are favourable for ch4 production fig 5b in addition the medians of tp and nh4 n levels in the urban inland waters 0 07 mg l 1 0 3 mg l 1 were also higher than those for global rivers 0 04 mg l 1 n 137 sites 0 05 mg l 1 n 595 sites fig s4 the higher nutrient levels tp nh4 could stimulate phytoplankton growth and autotrophic organic carbon production which was demonstrated by the higher chlorophyll a concentration averaging 30 0 µg l 1 in this study than that in other inland waters 10 3 µg l 1 table s6 autotrophic organic carbon is highly bioavailable shi et al 2017 and upon death becomes part of the bottom sediments and alters the sediment redox and texture characteristics thereby creating conditions that not only promote methanogenesis but also cause easier bubble release davidson et al 2018 anoxic or low oxygen conditions are necessary for methanogenesis and therefore extremely high methane concentrations and fluxes were only found in waters where do was very low e g 3 mg l 1 fig 6 the sinking and remineralization of the abundant phytoplankton in the urban inland waters would further contribute to do consumption wang et al 2016 which will promote ch4 production stepwise regression analysis of the correlation between the dissolved ch4 concentration and water chemistry parameters including doc soc do tp nh4 chlorophyll a water temperature and sediment thickness obtained during one sampling campaign showed that soc and sediment thickness collectively explained 72 of the variance in the dissolved ch4 concentration table s7 ebullition increased exponentially with increasing water temperature fig 7 at high temperatures sedimentary organic carbon decomposes faster and consumes more dissolved oxygen creating conditions which favor methanogenesis the water temperature exerted a larger impact on ebullition than on diffusion which is probably caused by the decreased ch4 solubility in the pore water and low atmospheric pressure at high air temperatures which promotes ebullitive rather than diffusive ch4 fluxes into the atmosphere in aquatic environments zhang et al 2020 the ebullitive ch4 flux was also affected by the geophysical conditions of the water bodies a shallower water depth has been linked to an increased ch4 flux bastviken et al 2010 due to the shorter travel path time which limits bubble dissolution and ch4 oxidation in the water column the significant negative relationships between the water depth and ebullition across two depth ranges 0 4 1 8 and 2 4 3 5 m respectively fig 5d confirm the role of the water depth as an important control on the ebullitive flux the higher ebullition at depths from 2 5 3 m probably occurred because these sites were located above dams with thick sediments 40 cm which have been shown to be ch4 ebullition and emission hotspots maeck et al 2013 furthermore a unique positive correlation was observed between the water depth and ebullition at the shallowest depths below 0 4 m such a correlation may be due to the increase in sediment organic matter oxidization with decreasing water depth under the resuspension caused by waves and winds which is not beneficial for ch4 production despite the inter site variability the water depth of the urban inland waters was consistently small 1 3 0 9 m which resulted in a higher ebullition in the urban inland waters than that in other inland waters diffusion is a function of the dissolved ch4 concentration and water air gas transfer velocity despite the high ch4 concentration the diffusion from the urban inland waters was relatively low which was probably due to the low k 600 value in the urban areas 1 4 1 5 m d 1 the average k 600 value in this study was lower than that reported not only for steep channel slope streams maurice et al 2017 and subalpine streams schelker et al 2016 but also for low channel slope streams raymond et al 2012 and comparable only to those for lentic waters including ponds and lakes holgerson and raymond 2016 as well as oceans wanninkhof et al 2009 the water velocity in the beijing inland waters 0 0 8 m s 1 0 1 m s 1 on average was relatively lower than that in other rivers alin et al 2011 liu et al 2017 the variation in k 600 from the urban areas was best explained by a relationship with the flow velocity v in m s 1 k 600 3 9v 0 8 r 2 0 38 p 0 0001 in addition the k 600 value in this study was also lower than that predicted by other studies at the same flow velocity alin et al 2011 liu et al 2017 this might be due to the lower wind speed 0 5 m s 1 1 2 m s 1 on average in this study than that in other studies 3 2 m s 1 table s8 therefore the low diffusive ch4 flux mainly occurred due to the low water velocity and wind speed in the urban areas of beijing the higher ch4 concentration in the rivers than that in the lakes observed in beijing was probably due to the higher doc concentrations significantly higher tp nh4 n and chlorophyll a concentrations p 0 01 and significantly lower do concentrations p 0 05 in the rivers table s5 these reasons could also explain the higher ch4 concentrations in the rivers receiving reclaimed water than those in the rivers receiving natural water replenishment the disproportionately high contribution of the ch4 emissions from the rivers to the total emissions from beijing inland waters in regard to the river surface area probably occurred due to the higher ch4 production and the shallower water depth promoting bubble release in these rivers the remarkably high ebullition in summer seemed to be the result of significantly higher water temperature and doc concentration p 0 01 and significantly lower do concentration p 0 01 in summer table s5 4 3 enhanced ebullition and ch4 contribution to the total ghgs under climate warming due to the intense ch4 ebullition the fch4 fco2 ratios 0 0007 to 22 derived from the beijing inland waters far exceeded those reported for other rivers and streams worldwide stanley et al 2016 high fch4 fco2 ratios were observed as an exception in streams and rivers on the east qinghai tibet plateau with highly permafrost carbon inputs shallow water depths and low air pressures zhang et al 2020 these observations generally suggest that high fch4 fco2 ratios are associated with rivers and streams receiving high organic loads and possessing shallow water depths which is beneficial for ch4 production and ebullition therefore high ch4 ebullition and fch4 fco2 ratios are expected to occur in other inland waters with biogeochemical and physical processes similar to those of the beijing inland waters the positive relationship between the fch4 ftcg ratio and temperature fig 7b suggests that the contribution of ch4 to the carbon greenhouse gases from the urban inland waters would greatly increase with increasing temperature the stronger temperature dependence of ebullition than that of diffusion and the dominance of ebullition above a water temperature of 17 c imply that the relative importance of the ebullitive ch4 emissions will increase under a warming climate significant ch4 emissions would finally be released from the urban inland waters into the atmosphere through ebullition under climate warming urban areas are affected by the urban heat island effect where the temperature is normally 2 4 c higher than that in surrounding areas liu et al 2015 a higher frequency and longer duration of heat waves are also expected to occur and increase under future climate projections stocker et al 2013 according to the results obtained in this study urban heat islands and heat waves are expected to substantially increase the urban inland water carbon ghg evasions through a disproportional increase in ch4 ebullition and the contribution of ch4 to the total carbon ghgs thus establishing a positive feedback loop between the urban inland water ghg emissions and climate warming to lower the greenhouse gas emissions from urban inland waters wwtps should improve the wastewater treatment efficiency to reduce the nutrient input to urban inland waters dredging of sediment especially the thick sediment above the sluice gates or rubber dams could reduce the soc content and sediment thickness and therefore lower the ch4 production in addition the removal of phytoplankton could be beneficial to lower ch4 emissions 5 conclusion ebullitive ch4 the related mechanisms of ch4 emissions and contribution of ch4 to carbon gas emissions from urban inland waters were explored in this study the average methane ebullition 11 3 30 4 mmol m 2 d 1 was approximately 6 times higher than global average due to high sediment dissolved organic carbon contents high aquatic primary productivity and shallow water depths in the urban inland waters methane ebullition increased exponentially with water temperature the average total ch4 flux 14 2 35 1 mmol m 2 d 1 was 3 times higher than the global average with ebullition accounting for 80 of the flux methane emissions were 20 of co2 emissions in terms of carbon release and 1 7 times greater in terms of co2 equivalent emissions suggesting the significant role of ch4 evasion in greenhouse gas emissions urban inland waters which are an essential component of global urbanization will play an important role in the global carbon gas efflux in particular their role as hotspots for ch4 evasion will further be amplified over the next decades under the effect of further global urbanization and the increasing

17368,the current sphere guideline for water chlorination in humanitarian emergencies fails to reliably ensure household water safety in refugee camps we investigated post distribution chlorine decay and household water safety in refugee camps in south sudan jordan and rwanda between 2013 2015 with the goal of demonstrating an approach for generating site specific and evidence based chlorination targets that better ensure household water safety than the status quo sphere guideline in each of four field studies we conducted we observed how water quality changed between distribution and point of consumption we implemented a nonlinear optimization approach for the novel technical challenge of modelling post distribution chlorine decay in order to generate estimates on what free residual chlorine frc levels must be at water distribution points in order to provide adequate frc protection up to the point of consumption in households many hours later at each site the site specific frc targets developed through this modelling approach improved the proportion of households having sufficient chlorine residual i e 0 2 mg l frc at the point of consumption in three out of four field studies south sudan 2013 jordan 2014 and rwanda 2015 these sites tended to be hotter i e average mid afternoon air temperatures 30 c and or had poorer water sanitation and hygiene wash conditions contributing to considerable chlorine decay between distribution and consumption our modelling approach did not work as well where chlorine decay was small in absolute terms jordan 2015 in such settings which were cooler 20 to 30 c and had better wash conditions we found that the upper range of the current sphere chlorination guideline i e 0 5 mg l frc provided sufficient residual chlorine for ensuring household water safety up to 24 hours post distribution site specific and evidence based chlorination targets generated from post distribution chlorine decay modelling could help improve household water safety and public health outcomes in refugee camp settings where the current sphere chlorination guideline does not provide adequate residual protection water quality monitoring in

is essential for preventing waterborne diseases in refugee and internally displaced persons idp camps during humanitarian emergencies connolly et al 2004 salama et al 2004 chlorination is the most widely used method of water treatment in humanitarian operations because of its low cost ease of use and importantly the residual protection it provides against microbiological contamination humanitarian responders implement a range of interventions for delivering safe chlorinated water to people living through crises from manual bucket chlorination to centralized chlorination in piped water systems that are appropriate at different points along the acute transitional post protracted emergency continuum sikder et al 2020 for all chlorination interventions it is essential to ensure sufficient chlorine residual to protect water against microbiological contamination up to the point of consumption while keeping chlorination levels within acceptable limits so as to not engender taste and odour driven rejection of treated water the sphere handbook 2018 sets forth minimum standards for humanitarian response including standards for chlorinated water supplies sphere s water supply standard 2 2 water quality specifies that free residual chlorine frc levels in chlorinated water supplies should be 0 2 0 5 mg l at the point of distribution with turbidity less than 5 ntu this is a universal frc standard that is widely used in refugee idp camp water systems globally the sphere frc target however comes from the who guidelines for drinking water quality gdwq which are based on conventions from the routine operation of municipal piped water systems in cities who 2017 as the us cdc 2014 observe the gdwq frc target is appropriate only when users drink water directly from the flowing taps of a piped system it is unlikely to provide sufficient residual protection in situations where the point of consumption is spatially and temporally distant from the point of distribution something which is commonly the case in refugee idp camps in these settings people must collect water from public distribution points known as tapstands transport it in containers back to their shelters and then store and use that water for up to 24 hours or longer multiple studies in refugee idp camps have shown that pathogenic recontamination of water can occur during collection and transport from distribution points as well as during storage and use in camp households and that these are linked to the spread of waterborne diseases among camp populations mahamud et al 2012 roberts et al 2001 shultz et al 2009 steele et al 2008 swerdlow et al 1997 walden et al 2005 sikder et al 2020 found that maintaining 0 2 mg l frc in households was necessary for preventing e coli contamination of stored water in refugee camp households in bangladesh corroborating a long standing convention that at least 0 2 mg l frc is needed to ensure microbiological water safety lantagne 2008 in an earlier study the authors found that implementing the sphere frc target at water distribution points in refugee camps in south sudan failed to reliably ensure sufficient frc protection up to the point of consumption in refugees shelters ali et al 2015 these findings signify that the 0 2 0 5 mg l frc target range prescribed by sphere is indeed protective if it is implemented at the point of consumption rather than at the point of distribution this raises the question then what must frc be at water distribution points in order to ensure that at least 0 2 mg l remains at the point of consumption many hours later this question has public health implications wherever people do not drink water directly from the tap and must store and use water for many hours such as in refugee and idp camps during humanitarian emergencies or in intermittent water systems in low and middle income countries lmics elala et al 2011 in response to these water safety concerns we launched a multi site study to investigate post distribution chlorine decay and household water safety in refugee and idp camps in field studies conducted between 2013 2015 in refugee camps in south sudan jordan and rwanda we observed how water quality changed in chlorinated water supplies between distribution and consumption we implemented a nonlinear optimization approach for the novel technical challenge of modelling post distribution chlorine decay in order to generate estimates on what frc must be at water distribution points in order to provide adequate frc protection up to the point of consumption in households many hours later the objective of our research was to demonstrate this approach for generating site specific and evidence based chlorination targets for refugee idp camp water systems and evaluate whether these site specific frc targets could increase the proportion of households having safe water at the point of consumption compared to the status quo sphere frc target the approach developed here forms the basis of an operational support tool that assists refugee idp camp water system operators in generating site specific chlorination targets to keep water safe to drink for the entire duration of household storage and use 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites we carried out four field studies at refugee camps with different temperature and environmental conditions in south sudan jordan and rwanda table 1 our first site the maban county refugee camps in south sudan march 20 april 18 2013 was located in a hot semi arid setting and had poor water sanitation and hygiene wash conditions this site sheltered refugees from sudan and was composed of three sub camps jamam batil and gendrassa that were geographically close to one another and had similar conditions located in the nile basin floodplain the local terrain was characterized by thick strata of heavy clay rich soil that is prone to waterlogging and has low groundwater productivity during the 2012 rainy season the camps suffered widespread flooding resulting in multiple outbreaks of waterborne diseases including hepatitis e the severity and persistence of which was exacerbated by the poor wash conditions shelters at this site were predominantly standard issue united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr canvas tents our second site the azraq refugee camp in jordan sheltered syrian refugees and was located in an arid desert setting in contrast to the south sudan site the azraq refugee camp was a fully planned site with water and sanitation infrastructure exceeding humanitarian standards we carried out two phases of data collection at azraq in order to control for site related factors and observe how temperature may affect chlorine decay the first jordan study phase took place during the summer july 13 august 20 2014 and the second during late winter early spring march 17 april 13 2015 shelters at this site were semi permanent sheet metal structures with either plastic tarp or poured concrete floors our final site the kigeme refugee camp in rwanda june 23 july 15 2015 sheltered refugees from the democratic republic of the congo located in the forested highlands of western rwanda kigeme had a relatively cool climate wash conditions at kigeme were poor and similar to the south sudan camps sanitation at kigeme took the form of communal dischargeable latrine blocks that drained via surface channels which exposed sewage effluent to the ambient environment kigeme camp was built on two hills improved by terracing on which densely crowded shelters where constructed from mud wood and plastic sheeting by the refugee population all study sites had centrally chlorinated piped water supply infrastructure typical in refugee idp camps during the stabilized emergency phase in these water systems abstracted groundwater from boreholes south sudan jordan or clarified surface water rwanda was treated immediately after abstraction or clarification by automatic in line chlorine dosers which dispensed either chlorine solution prepared from calcium hypochlorite powder south sudan rwanda or chlorine gas jordan water was chlorinated to in principle satisfy the inherent chlorine demand of the water and achieve breakpoint chlorination in retention tanks with at least one hour of contact time before being delivered to public water distribution points with the specified target frc images of public water distribution points from each site are presented in fig 1 2 2 field data collection at each site we observed how water quality changed between distribution and consumption by measuring water quality in the same parcel of water at multiple points along the water supply chain 1 directly from the tap at the public water distribution point 2 from the container after it was filled at the distribution point 3 from the same container after being carried back to the water user s shelter and 4 from the same container after several hours of household storage and use i e the point of consumption each sample collected therefore consisted of a time series of four consecutive water quality observations taken from the same water we measured free residual chlorine frc total

meter hanna instruments woonsocket ri usa or a hach sension multi meter hach instruments loveland co usa analytical equipment was calibrated using non expired manufacturer standards every one to two days of consecutive field use we also collected data on water handling practices via spot observations or respondent self report including on container type container covering container cleanliness sun exposure and method of drawing water at each site members of the local refugee population were recruited and trained as field data collectors the primary investigator accompanied field teams over the course of data collection at each site in order to ensure procedural adherence 2 2 1 timing of household follow up visits during the south sudan 2013 study overall water supply was limited in the camps so water was commonly consumed the same day it was collected we therefore initiated samples in the morning and returned to households for follow up in the afternoon representing approximately a 6 to 9 hour interval between distribution and consumption in the jordan and rwanda studies water supply was more plentiful so people collected more water and stored and used it in their households for longer up to 24 hours at these sites we varied the timing of household follow up visits in order to collect data representing different durations of household storage and use we alternately initiated samples in the morning and returned to households for follow up either the same day afternoon approximately 6 to 9 hours interval or the next morning approximately 24 hours interval or we started samples in the afternoon and returned for follow up the next morning approximately 18 hours interval for the final phase in rwanda we followed up at households twice in order to gather an additional time series data point for a total of five with which to better constrain subsequent chlorine decay modelling 2 2 2 sample sizes and site representativeness to determine the number of samples for the initial study in south sudan we looked to previous work characterizing water quality changes between source and consumption in lmic settings e g levy et al 2008 trevett et al 2004 these studies typically had 50 to 150 samples where each sample consisted of two paired measurements at source and at point of consumption so we collected approximately 70 samples at each of the three sub camps for a total of 220 samples across the south sudan site as each sample consisted of a time series of four water quality measurements this represented approximately 880 frc time data points for the first phase in jordan we similarly collected 199 unique samples representing approximately 796 frc time data points for the second phase in jordan we used the first jordan dataset to determine the number of samples to collect by evaluating how variance in distribution point frc data decreased as the number of samples increased we found that variance stabilized at the same level as for 199 samples at just 120 samples so for the second phase in jordan we collected 120 unique samples representing approximately 480 frc time data points for the final study phase in rwanda we similarly collected 134 unique samples in rwanda as each sample consisted of a time series of five water quality measurements this represented approximately 670 frc time data points we sought to systematically sample all water distribution points in each camp however this was not always possible due to inconsistent service levels in some camps or the size of the water systems in others in south sudan because of persistent water supply shortages and inconsistent chlorination management water distribution points were often dry or unchlorinated we therefore adopted a convenience sampling approach wherein we sampled distribution points attached to boreholes that were flowing and chlorinated each day of data collection we sought spatial representativeness by i collecting an equal number of samples in each sub camp ii visiting different distribution points in different areas of each sub camp each day and iii sampling distribution points attached to different boreholes in each sub camp each day a majority of borehole sources in each sub camp in south sudan were ultimately sampled and there was no apparent bias toward specific distribution points or boreholes in jordan we systematically sampled every distribution point in the populated sectors of the camp during the 2014 and 2015 studies in rwanda there were more distribution points than the number of samples we sought to collect so we utilized a random number generator to randomly select an equal number of distribution points from the two hill sectors that constituted the camp through this approach we were able to collect a representative randomized distribution of samples across the rwanda site area 2 3 ethics the initial field work in south sudan received exemption from full ethics review by the medical director of médecins sans frontières msf operational centre amsterdam as we were collecting routine data in the midst of an on going water supply intervention for subsequent field studies in jordan and rwanda we received ethics approval from the committee for protection of human subjects cphs of the institutional review board at the university of california berkeley cphs protocol number 2014 05 6326 2 4 data analysis our analytical objective was to model post distribution chlorine decay as a function of time using only the water quality data that is routinely available in refugee idp camps developing site specific models of post distribution chlorine decay enables us to design distribution point frc targets that provide sufficient residual protection for the typical duration that water is stored and used in camp households at a given site our goal was to evaluate whether the site specific and evidence based frc targets generated through this modelling approach could improve household water safety outcomes compared to the status quo sphere frc target 2 4 1 post distribution chlorine decay modelling while chlorine decay in distribution systems is well understood post distribution chlorine decay has not to our knowledge been subject to modelling efforts c f the grayman 2018 review of the drinking water quality modelling sector we therefore devised a nonlinear optimization approach for the novel technical challenge of modelling post distribution chlorine decay in refugee idp camps by drawing on concepts from water quality modelling in distribution systems and modifying some of its assumptions chlorine residuals in municipal water distribution systems are typically modelled by coupling hydraulic mass transport and kinetic decay models in order to represent advective and diffusive mass transport in piped networks and the consumption of chlorine due to reactions in the bulk fluid phase and along the pipe wall characterized respectively by first or second order reaction kinetics and zero or first order kinetics biswas et al 1993 clark and sivaganesan 2002 rossman et al 1994 vasconcelos et al 1997 while mass transport is important in distribution systems it is less relevant and likely represents a minor component during the post distribution period where water is stored in containers moreover while water quality modelling in distribution systems is based on the premise of a closed system this does not hold once water exits the piped network the post distribution system can be better understood as an open system influenced by multiple known and unknown factors which could include biofilms on storage containers temperature exposure to ultraviolet light or discrete contamination events linked to unhygienic water handling in which new organic material is introduced to water given the complexity of the multiple reactions that could take place between chlorine and various organic and inorganic constituents as well as the influence of known and unknown external mediating factors analytical mechanistic models of post distribution chlorine decay may not be feasible therefore recourse to empirical reaction kinetic models is justified in a similar vein to early modelling efforts on trihalomethane formation kinetics c f vasconcelos et al 1996 an overall empirical kinetic model provides a way to represent the combined effects of all factors influencing post distribution chlorine decay at a given site such as source water quality environmental factors such as ambient air temperature or importantly the diverse range of water handling practices that will inevitably prevail among a large number of water users in a real world refugee idp camp setting the impact of these decay influencing factors is reflected in the change in frc going from distribution to consumption and the cumulative effect of all decay factors active at a site including how often they occur and their effect strength are therefore implicitly captured in the distribution to consumption frc data we collected discrete contamination events in which new organic material including potentially waterborne pathogens are introduced to water are likely highly important for waterborne disease transmission in these settings a discrete contamination event has the effect of pulling the frc down from where it would otherwise be based on prevailing decay conditions in a population where unhygienic water handling practices are more prevalent discrete contamination events and associated frc drops will happen more frequently and will result in a greater apparent chlorine decay and vice versa overall empirical kinetic modelling using distribution to consumption frc data provides a way to mathematically represent the apparent chlorine decay due to the aggregated effect of all decay influencing factors including discrete contamination events as a function of time since decay influencing factors are unique to each site model representations of post distribution chlorine decay are site specific this is consistent with chlorine decay modelling in distribution systems which similarly relies on site specific model representations of chlorine decay biswas et al 1993 vasconcelos et al 1997 in order to maximize the utility and replicability of our analytical procedure in refugee idp camp water systems we sought to model post distribution chlorine decay using just the water quality data that is commonly available in these settings routine water quality monitoring in refugee idp camps focuses on monitoring frc at water distribution points and since the 2018 revision of the sphere handbook at households as well turbidity and ph are also commonly measured at the point of treatment and or distribution but seldom thereafter humanitarian water quality guidelines c f médecins sans frontières 2010 sphere association 2018 specify that turbidity should be less than 5 ntu and ph less than 8 in order for chlorination to be most effective and these conditions also apply to the present analysis other physical chemical biological and or radiological water quality parameters are generally only measured when a new source is commissioned or during seasonal spot checks we therefore modelled chlorine decay using commonly available frc data from distribution points and households in the integrated rate law el seoud et al 2017 1 1 c n 1 1 c 0 n 1 n 1 k t 2 c c 0 1 n n 1 k t 1 1 n where c is the frc in mg l at time t in hours c 0 is the initial frc at time zero i e at the point of distribution n is the dimensionless rate order and k is the rate constant with units m g 1 n l n 1 h r 1 the integrated rate law at n 1 becomes eq 3 3 c c 0 e k t with the frc time data collected at each site we used the above relationships to estimate model parameters n and k in order to create an empirical kinetic representation of overall post distribution chlorine decay that encompasses all reactions in the bulk fluid phase and with the container wall driven by the decay influencing factors active at that site as discussed above rate order n in distribution system chlorine decay modelling is typically characterized as 0 1 or 2 non integer rate orders are also physically possible where overall reactions are composed of multiple elementary steps given the complex array of reactions and factors that may influence post distribution chlorine decay we sought to avoid assumptions as to what the overall empirical rate order should be and left it unconstrained during modelling since eq 2 cannot converge to n 1 eq 3 was evaluated separately and the performance of the first order model was compared to models in which n was unconstrained conversely eq 2 can converge to n 0 or 2 or any non integer value in this range or above should any of these be the best fit for the data we stratified our analysis by site as we sought to generate site specific chlorination targets for the two jordan datasets we applied an additional level of stratification in order to account for the practice of storing water in direct sunlight which was unique to this site c f appendix data cleaning and stratification only non sun exposed data are reported here as this is reflective of normative practice we used the numerical downhill simplex nelder mead method a widely used optimization technique in gnu octave 5 2 0 eaton 2020 an open source mathematical programming software to estimate model parameters n and k using pooled vectors of the frc time data from each site for model optimization we minimized the sum of square errors sse 4 s s e i 1 n c o b s c p r e d 2 where n is the number of samples in the dataset c p r e d was calculated using eq 2 and initial assumptions for n and k and sse was calculated using eq 4 the nelder mead algorithm is a gradient descent approach which improves on initial estimates of n and k by following downward trends in the error surface until the change with each iteration is below a specified tolerance these tolerances were selected as on error function value sse 10 4 on input values k and n 10 4 and maximum number of iterations 400 additional error functions e g relative error were also evaluated for use but did not yield meaningful improvements in modelling performance and were thus dropped from further consideration in order to evaluate modelling performance across sites overall model goodness of fit r2 eq 6 as well as sum of residuals s σ eq 7 an indicator of model skewness were also calculated in addition to r2 for the overall model r2 was also calculated for predictions at the point of consumption only r2 poc 5 s s t i 1 n c o b s m e a n c o b s 2 6 r 2 1 s s e s s t 7 s σ i 1 n c o b s c p r e d in order to evaluate whether the numerical algorithm was converging to a local or global minimum we implemented solution sets in which we randomized initial assumptions for n and k and evaluated whether the routine converged to the same or multiple solutions over five runs we varied n between 0 and 2 the range reported in the distribution systems chlorine decay literature and k between 0 and 0 60 0 11 was the highest value for k generated during exploratory modelling so six times this figure was used datasets for each site were split into 90 training and 10 testing subsets and modelling performance metrics were compared between these subsets this is good model calibration practice that prevents model over fitting and maintains model generalizability in situations where solution sets generated multiple solutions representing different local minima we preferentially used the solution that appeared more often and had superior modelling performance with respect to goodness of fit referred to in the following as the dominant solution in order to generate conservative estimates for decay model parameters n and k at each site we implemented a confidence region estimation in which we generated contour plots of n and k against error by solving the integrated rate law eq 2 over a range of n and k values to build a matrix of sse to cover the relevant solution space n was varied between 0 and 3 and k was varied between zero and three times the optimized k obtained from the solution set for each site i e that which minimized sse 300 steps were used for both parameters to build a 301 301 matrix of sse values at each combination of n and k with contour lines plotted every 5 above the minimum sse for each site two combinations of n and k were selected to compute initial frc required to achieve a desired downstream frc 1 the optimum solution representing the n and k combination which minimized sse i e the best performing n and k combination from the solution set and 2 the maximum decay prediction the n and k combination that represented the most rapid decay that could be anticipated within a 5 error envelope prior to analysis frc time data from each site were cleaned of erroneous entries following a uniform set of rules c f appendix data cleaning and stratification all site datasets and analytical code are included in the supplementary material 2 4 2 site specific distribution point frc targets using the optimum solution and maximum decay prediction n and k parameter combinations developed for each site with eq 2 we computed the distribution point frc targets c 0 that would result in an frc concentration at the point of consumption c of 0 2 mg l at variable lengths of time up to 24 hours post distribution we generated distribution point frc target design graphs for each site wherein distribution point frc to achieve a household frc of 0 2 mg l was plotted as a function of elapsed hours post distribution we also sought to account for chlorine taste and odour acceptability in the frc target design graphs while the who sets a maximum health based guideline value for free chlorine of 5 mg l who 2017 taste and odour driven rejection of chlorinated water can occur at much lower concentration levels in a study on chlorine dosing for household water treatment in lmic settings lantagne 2008 found 2 0 mg l to be the upper limit above which user acceptability became a concern based on focus group testing in ethiopia and zambia more recently crider et al 2018 found a median acceptability threshold of 1 25 mg l frc among adults in urban bangladesh as we did not collect primary data on chlorine taste and odour acceptability as part of this study we adopted the more conservative figure from the literature i e 1 25 mg l frc for our analysis chlorine taste and odour acceptability however is population specific and should ideally be evaluated at each site chlorine acceptability thresholds are also not fixed and can be modified through organoleptic habituation and or health promotion messaging on the public health importance of water chlorination piriou et al 2015 sikder et al 2020 in order to evaluate the household water safety effectiveness of the site specific frc targets developed from this modelling approach compared to the status quo sphere frc target we first selected a distribution point frc target from the design graph for each site that would maximize the level of protection up to 24 hours post distribution where possible without exceeding the chlorine taste odour acceptability limit we then assessed the proportion of sampled households at each site having safe water i e 0 2 mg l frc at follow up when distribution point frc was in line with the site specific frc target using a bin with a range of the frc target minus 0 2 mg l this was compared to the proportion of sampled households having safe water at follow up at the same time post distribution when distribution point frc was in line with the sphere frc target i e 0 2 0 5 mg l 3 results overall water quality at the point of distribution at each site is summarized in table 2 site frc data at the four measurement points five in the case of rwanda are summarized in fig 2 an overview of key household water handling practices at each site is provided in table 3 from table 2 we observe that distribution point water quality at all sites met the turbidity and ph requirements for effective chlorination stipulated in the humanitarian water quality guidelines i e 5 ntu and ph 8 the downward trend in the frc data presented in fig 2 going from tap to household follow up reflects the rate of chlorine decay at each site with more rapid decay evident in south sudan 2013 and jordan 2014 and less rapid decay evident in jordan 2015 and rwanda 2015 moreover the dispersion of the frc data in fig 2 shows that the more acute emergencies in south sudan 2013 and jordan 2014 had poorer operational control of chlorination than the more stabilized situations in jordan 2015 and rwanda 2015 temperature is also known to strongly influence chlorine decay rates powell et al 2000 south sudan 2013 and jordan 2014 had higher air and water temperatures than jordan 2015 and rwanda 2015 i e an approximate 10 c difference respectively can be seen in table 1 and table 2 which may have contributed to the more rapid chlorine decay evident at these sites while temperatures decreased going from the jordan 2014 study to the 2015 study so did turbidity levels at water distribution points mean turbidity 2 16 ntu and 0 77 ntu respectively which could have also played a role in reducing chlorine decay at this site key differences in water handling practices among study sites can be seen in table 3 which reflect the acuteness of the emergency situation at each site and may also contribute to the variable chlorine decay observed across sites of all the sites only south sudan 2013 had a large number of respondents 20 who drew water by dipping a cup into stored water an unhygienic practice that can introduce contaminating material from hands utensils and vessels directly into stored drinking water at all other sites the majority of respondents 90 reported pouring water out of storage containers into drinking vessels which is more hygienic incidentally south sudan 2013 was the only site at which respondents reported using a tap to draw water 20 reflecting the types of water storage containers available at that site namely the oxfam container 29 a specially designed bucket for transporting and storing water fitted with a tap for drawing water in general south sudan 2013 had a greater diversity of water storage containers including both narrow mouth options 40 such as rigid and collapsible jerrycans and wide mouth options 50 such as oxfam containers common plastic 20 litre buckets and unhcr buckets narrow mouth containers are preferable to wide mouth options as the smaller opening restricts the ease with which contaminating material can come into contact with stored water and effectively precludes dipping to draw water all of the other sites had majority narrow mouth storage containers 70 in rwanda 2015 and 90 in jordan 2014 and 2015 container covering is also important for limiting the opportunity for recontamination to occur in south sudan 2013 there was a nearly even split upon spot observation in households 42 uncovered vs 54 covered whereas jordan 2014 and 2015 had very high levels of container covering 80 rwanda 2015 had the lowest level of container covering 20 however the adverse impact could have possibly been mitigated by the narrow mouth containers that were prevalent in rwanda compared to south sudan where wide mouth containers were more common container cleanliness was also an issue in south sudan and rwanda where only a small proportion of household storage containers were clean during spot observations 16 and 10 respectively compared to 59 and 72 in jordan 2014 and 2015 respectively overall south sudan 2013 had the most unhygienic water handling practices followed by rwanda 2015 whereas water handling practices were generally good in jordan 2014 and 2015 the cumulative effect of these water handling practices across the population at each site is captured in the frc data we collected in the field and represented in the post distribution decay modelling as discussed in section 2 4 1 during the jordan 2014 field study we also observed about a quarter of surveyed households storing water in direct sunlight in order to drive off excess chlorine residual this practice emerged during the initial phase of the emergency when frc levels at water distribution points had been grossly excessive i e 3 mg l frc as seen in fig 2 unaccustomed to chlorinated water supplies back home the rural syrian refugee population adopted this practice in order to make the camp s chlorinated water more palatable during the initial settlement period but the practice remained prevalent even as distribution point frc levels stabilized to lower levels in 2015 c f fig 2 this practice was not observed in south sudan or rwanda as discussed in section 2 4 1 we have reported only non sun exposed data from jordan 2014 and 2015 as this is reflective of normative practice chlorine decay modelling outputs are presented in table 4 sse contour plots from the confidence region estimation are presented in fig 3 optimum and maximum decay prediction parameter combinations for each site are presented in table 5 these modeling outputs are discussed at length in the next section in order to generate site specific distribution point frc target design graphs as discussed in section 2 4 the first order model eq 3 was also evaluated in all cases models with n 1 performed worse than models where n was unconstrained results are not included here for brevity indicating that better post distribution decay modelling performance can be obtained by allowing n to remain unconstrained 4 discussion the modeling outputs presented above are discussed in the following sub sections in order to develop site specific distribution point frc target design graphs in addition household water safety evaluations of the design frc targets versus the status quo sphere frc target are also presented 4 1 south sudan 2013 in the decay modeling outputs for south sudan in table 4 all five training runs converged to n 0 75 and k 0 1098 suggesting this is a global minimum in the error function corroborated visually by the sse contour plot in fig 3a this solution had a high degree of goodness of fit r2 0 8706 as did the test runs r2 0 9441 suggesting good model generalizability for this site the model was also moderately good at making predictions at later time points r2 poc 0 6402 which was corroborated in the test runs r2 poc 0 8579 the sum of residuals sσ signifies model skewness wherein negative values indicate that the model tends to over predict downstream frc compared to observed data and thus under predicts decay rates all site models were negatively skewed indicating that we should use the maximum decay prediction in order to be most conservative based on the confidence region estimation the maximum decay prediction parameter combination for south sudan 2013 was n 0 66 and k 0 1463 table 5 the distribution point frc target design graph for south sudan 2013 based on the optimum and maximum decay models for the site is presented in fig 4 from fig 4 we see that the distribution point frc required to protect water up to 24 hours post distribution at this site would be excessive i e 5 38 mg l based on the maximum decay prediction model this suggests that ensuring 24 hours of protection may not be feasible at this site due to chlorine taste odour rejection concerns a shorter duration of protection may have to be accepted if for instance distribution point frc was set to the designated chlorine taste and odour acceptability limit of 1 25 mg l our maximum decay prediction model indicates that water would be protected up to 10 hours post distribution the household water safety evaluation for this distribution point frc target for south sudan 2013 compared to the current sphere frc target is presented in fig 5 we observe from fig 5 that in the south sudan 2013 dataset the current sphere frc target range resulted in sufficient frc i e 0 2 mg l at household follow up 6 to 12 hours post distribution in 14 4 out of 28 of sampled households in comparison the site specific frc target resulted in 71 15 out of 21 of sampled households having safe water during the same time period representing a considerable improvement in the degree of household water safety achieved 4 2 jordan 2014 from the decay modeling outputs for jordan 2014 in table 4 we observe that the five training runs consistently converged to n 1 65 and k 0 0710 suggesting this is a global minimum in the error function visually corroborated by the sse contour plot in fig 3b the model has good fit r2 0 7925 but the test runs performed slightly worse r2 0 5396 raising the possibility of model overfitting the model performs poorly at later time points r2 poc 0 2872 and is also negatively skewed reinforcing the need to use the maximum decay prediction in order to be conservative based on the confidence region estimation the maximum decay prediction parameter combination for jordan 2014 was n 1 25 and k 0 0889 table 5 the distribution point frc target design graph for jordan 2014 based on the optimum and maximum decay models for that site is presented in fig 6 from fig 6 we observe that 24 hours protection of household stored water can be achieved at this site by setting distribution point frc to 1 17 mg l based on the maximum decay model this is within the designated chlorine acceptability limit the household water safety evaluation of this site specific distribution point frc target for jordan 2014 compared to the current sphere frc target is presented in fig 7 we observe from fig 7 that in the jordan 2014 dataset the site specific frc target generated from our modelling resulted in 82 of sampled households having safe water at follow up at 16 to 28 hours post distribution average 20 9 hours there were no data representing the sphere frc target range at distribution points during this time period so no direct comparison can be made however we can infer the sphere range would have a smaller proportion of households having safe water based on the downward trend apparent in the distribution of the plotted data as distribution point frc decreases 4 3 jordan 2015 from the modelling outputs for jordan 2015 in table 4 we observe there was more modelling instability at this site compared to others across five training runs four converged to a physically unrealistic solution where n 12 55 and k 36 5226 r2 0 5415 and once to a solution where n 1 35 and k 0 0282 r2 0 2330 the test runs similarly had poor r2 values while the dominant solution n 12 55 k 36 5226 outperformed the non dominant solution n 1 35 k 0 0282 with respect to goodness of fit the tendency as n and k increase is for chlorine decay to become flatter in absolute terms we see that for the high n and k values of the dominant optimum solution and its associated maximum decay prediction n 8 56 k 2 8933 table 5 there is flat chlorine decay in the distribution point frc target design graph for jordan 2015 fig 8 it appears that for the low levels of absolute chlorine decay observed c f fig 2 in the relatively cool and clean conditions of the jordan 2015 site a wide range of very large n and k values could potentially fit the data and represent the slow decay observed this mutability is reflected in the relatively poor r2 and r2 poc values for this site compared to others it appears that in situations of small absolute chlorine decay our modelling approach may fail to converge to a meaningful solution given the flat decay represented by the dominant solution it may be interesting in this situation to look at the non dominant solution n 1 35 k 0 0282 and its associated maximum decay prediction n 0 44 k 0 0018 which despite their much poorer fit may represent a worse case scenario of faster chlorine decay and would therefore yield a more conservative distribution point frc target the parameter estimates are also in a range similar to those found at other sites the error space around the non dominant optimum solution and its associated maximum decay prediction is shown in fig 3c and the distribution point frc targets based on these non dominant models are also shown in fig 8 the non dominant maximum decay model appears to indicate that the upper limit of the current sphere frc target range of 0 5 mg l would provide sufficient frc protection up to 24 hours post distribution in this setting it appears that in relatively cool and clean conditions where there is little observed frc decay like jordan 2015 there is no evidence suggesting that the upper range of the current sphere frc target would not provide adequate protection this is also borne out in the household water safety evaluation for this site fig 9 the difference in the required distribution point frc to protect water for up to 24 hours post distribution in jordan 2014 and jordan 2015 suggests that seasonal temperature changes may affect post distribution chlorine decay although other explanations are also possible such as changes in turbidity at water distribution as discussed at the outset of this section further research is required to better resolve the effect of temperature on post distribution chlorine decay as site specific frc targets may need to be adjusted on a periodic or seasonal basis in order to account for temperature effects overall the vast difference in post distribution chlorine decay evident between the jordan 2014 and 2015 studies demonstrates that decay influencing factors will change over time even at the same site post distribution chlorine decay models and the frc targets that are generated from them must be specific to time and place 4 4 rwanda 2015 in the decay modeling outputs for rwanda in table 4 four out of five training runs converged to a minimum at n 0 79 and k 0 0303 and a single run converged to a local minimum at n 1 14 and k 0 0386 while only the dominant solution n 0 79 k 0 0303 is plotted in fig 3d the position of the non dominant solution n 1 14 k 0 0386 lays within the trough of minimum error depicted in the middle of the contour plot the goodness of fit of both solutions are good r2 0 80 and are corroborated by the test runs which resulted in similar r2 values the dominant and non dominant models are also moderately effective at later time points r2 poc 0 59 but remain negatively skewed albeit to a lesser degree than for south sudan or jordan 2014 the distribution point frc target design graph for rwanda 2015 based on the dominant and non dominant solutions and the maximum decay predication from the former is presented in fig 10 from fig 10 we observe that 24 hours protection can be achieved at this site by setting the distribution point frc target to 0 64 mg l based on the maximum decay prediction associated with the dominant optimum model this is well within the designated chlorine acceptability threshold the household water safety evaluation of this site specific distribution point frc target for rwanda 2015 compared to the current sphere frc target is presented in fig 11 from fig 11 we observe that the site specific frc target resulted in sufficient frc at household follow up in 68 23 out of 34 of sampled households in rwanda compared to 50 11 out of 22 for the current sphere frc target range representing a moderate improvement in household water safety 4 5 operational recommendations the post distribution chlorine decay modelling approach we have demonstrated above can be used to generate site specific and evidence based water chlorination targets that protect household water safety for variable durations of household storage and use in refugee idp camp settings the site specific frc targets were better able to achieve the desired public health objective of having sufficiently chlorinated water at the point of consumption than the sphere frc target in three out of the four refugee camps in which we carried out studies the one notable exception to this was jordan 2015 a site which had relatively cool temperatures and high levels of wash service provision at this site it appeared that the upper limit of the current sphere frc target range i e 0 5 mg l frc was able to provide adequate protection up to 24 hours post distribution at all other refugee idp camp sites particularly those in hot climates or where wash conditions are poor we recommend implementing post distribution chlorine decay modelling in order to generate a site specific chlorination target that suits local conditions to facilitate this for refugee idp camp water system operators we have made the post distribution chlorine decay analytics demonstrated above available online as a web based platform called the safe water optimization tool 2020 refugee idp camp water system operators can use water quality data from their sites to generate a site specific and evidence based frc target that protects water for a designated length of time they select based on local water usage patterns and then evaluate the proportion of households having safe water at this follow up time for the site specific frc target versus the sphere frc target before deciding whether to implement the site specific frc target in their water system the site specific frc targets produced through this modelling approach represent the minimum frc required to achieve the public health goal of keeping water safe to drink for the entire duration of household storage and use proper chlorination is not however on its own sufficient for ensuring water safety promoting and enabling safe and hygienic water storage and handling practices is also necessary increasing chlorination levels also presents some concerns of its own for one excessive chlorination can lead to taste and odour driven rejection of treated water water system operators should endeavour to deliver the minimum frc required for protecting public health while not exceeding the population specific chlorine acceptability threshold if at a particular site the acceptability threshold is found to be lower than the site specific frc target water system operators should not exceed the former in order to minimize the risk that water users turn to other untreated water sources in these situations better protecting the safe water chain via safe water storage practices i e covered narrow mouth and regularly cleaned and replaced storage containers with taps are an important alternative to increasing chlorination levels further research is needed to develop and validate rapid methods for evaluating chlorine taste and odour acceptability thresholds in humanitarian response settings secondly while the risk posed by waterborne diseases is the primary concern in humanitarian crises disinfection by products dbps may also be a concern for vulnerable sub groups such as pregnant women especially when raw unclarified surface waters are rapidly chlorinated during acute emergencies ali et al 2019 field appropriate methods to characterize and manage dbps in humanitarian water systems also warrant further development limitations of our study included 1 given the complexity and range of potential factors influencing post distribution chlorine decay in real world settings we did not attempt to define an analytical mechanistic model that can explicitly characterize the specific effects of decay influencing factors such as temperature or source water quality or which models discrete contamination events linked to unhygienic water handling practices 2 from the distribution systems modelling literature it is known that source water quality influences chlorine decay powell et al 2000 vasconcelos et al 1996 our analysis assumes that initial chlorine dosing during water treatment adequately satisfies the inherent chlorine demand of the water and that breakpoint chlorination is fully achieved resulting in a stable residual at water distribution points this then becomes the lever water system operators can act upon to optimize household water safety however breakpoint chlorination may not be reliably achieved in refugee idp camp water systems for several reasons including improper dosing inadequate retention time and slow decay reactions e g with manganese this means that the influence of source water quality could persist into the post distribution period this however would still be captured in the frc data going from distribution to consumption and would thereby be accounted for in post distribution chlorine decay modelling 3 the household water safety evaluations of the site specific frc targets versus the sphere frc target we conducted were indicative of improved performance but were not sufficiently powered to confirm this effect future evaluations should be sufficiently powered to properly assess household water safety effectiveness in comparison to the sphere frc target 5 conclusions the current sphere guideline for water chlorination in humanitarian emergencies is not designed to ensure water safety at the point of consumption in refugee idp camps multiple evaluations show that the sphere frc target range does not reliably ensure household water safety in camp settings especially where temperatures are hot 30 c and or wash conditions are poor chlorination levels at water distribution points in refugee idp camps need to be increased within taste odour acceptability limits by varying degrees in order to account for local post distribution chlorine decay and ensure water remains safe to drink for the entire duration of household storage and use the nonlinear optimization approach presented here can be used to generate site specific and evidence based distribution point frc targets that provide sufficient residual to protect water for up to 24 hours post distribution based on data from refugee camps in south sudan jordan and rwanda this modelling approach performed well at sites where there was appreciable chlorine decay between distribution and consumption but not as well where chlorine decay was small in absolute terms in these settings which tend to be cooler 20 30 c and have better wash conditions the upper limit of the current sphere frc target range 0 5 mg l appears to be sufficient for protecting household water safety and site specific frc targets may not be required to maximize the utility and replicability of our methodology in refugee idp camps we used only widely available frc data however other water quality parameters water handling practices and contextual factors also likely influence post distribution chlorine decay further research is required to investigate which factors matter most for post distribution chlorine decay in order to rationalize monitoring programs and better support water safety optimization efforts in refugee idp camps chlorine decay in distribution systems is known to be a highly site specific phenomenon and this also appears to be the case for post distribution chlorine decay this means that a unique site specific representation of post distribution chlorine decay and with it a site specific distribution point frc target is ideal to facilitate this we have made the post distribution chlorine decay modelling analytics demonstrated in this paper available online as an operational support tool for refugee idp camp water system operators the safe water optimization tool https safeh2o app can assist water system operators in analyzing distribution point and household frc monitoring data in order generate a site specific and evidence based frc target that provides residual chlorine protection for the entire duration of household storage and use current water quality monitoring practices in the humanitarian sector are focused primarily on water quality at the point of distribution however what really matters for public health is water quality where people actually consume it therefore a greater emphasis should be placed on water quality monitoring at the household point of consumption in humanitarian operations enhancing residual chlorine protection of household stored water is an essential component of an overall wash strategy for disrupting the transmission of waterborne pathogens and preventing water related diseases amongst displaced populations in refugee idp camp settings along with safe water storage access to sufficient quantities of water access to dignified sanitation and the means to maintain good personal domestic and environmental hygiene taken together these wash measures can help reduce disease

17368,the current sphere guideline for water chlorination in humanitarian emergencies fails to reliably ensure household water safety in refugee camps we investigated post distribution chlorine decay and household water safety in refugee camps in south sudan jordan and rwanda between 2013 2015 with the goal of demonstrating an approach for generating site specific and evidence based chlorination targets that better ensure household water safety than the status quo sphere guideline in each of four field studies we conducted we observed how water quality changed between distribution and point of consumption we implemented a nonlinear optimization approach for the novel technical challenge of modelling post distribution chlorine decay in order to generate estimates on what free residual chlorine frc levels must be at water distribution points in order to provide adequate frc protection up to the point of consumption in households many hours later at each site the site specific frc targets developed through this modelling approach improved the proportion of households having sufficient chlorine residual i e 0 2 mg l frc at the point of consumption in three out of four field studies south sudan 2013 jordan 2014 and rwanda 2015 these sites tended to be hotter i e average mid afternoon air temperatures 30 c and or had poorer water sanitation and hygiene wash conditions contributing to considerable chlorine decay between distribution and consumption our modelling approach did not work as well where chlorine decay was small in absolute terms jordan 2015 in such settings which were cooler 20 to 30 c and had better wash conditions we found that the upper range of the current sphere chlorination guideline i e 0 5 mg l frc provided sufficient residual chlorine for ensuring household water safety up to 24 hours post distribution site specific and evidence based chlorination targets generated from post distribution chlorine decay modelling could help improve household water safety and public health outcomes in refugee camp settings where the current sphere chlorination guideline does not provide adequate residual protection water quality monitoring in refugee idp camps should shift focus from distribution points to household points of consumption in order to monitor if the intended public health goal of safe water at the point of consumption is

is essential for preventing waterborne diseases in refugee and internally displaced persons idp camps during humanitarian emergencies connolly et al 2004 salama et al 2004 chlorination is the most widely used method of water treatment in humanitarian operations because of its low cost ease of use and importantly the residual protection it provides against microbiological contamination humanitarian responders implement a range of interventions for delivering safe chlorinated water to people living through crises from manual bucket chlorination to centralized chlorination in piped water systems that are appropriate at different points along the acute transitional post protracted emergency continuum sikder et al 2020 for all chlorination interventions it is essential to ensure sufficient chlorine residual to protect water against microbiological contamination up to the point of consumption while keeping chlorination levels within acceptable limits so as to not engender taste and odour driven rejection of treated water the sphere handbook 2018 sets forth minimum standards for humanitarian response including standards for chlorinated water supplies sphere s water supply standard 2 2 water quality specifies that free residual chlorine frc levels in chlorinated water supplies should be 0 2 0 5 mg l at the point of distribution with turbidity less than 5 ntu this is a universal frc standard that is widely used in refugee idp camp water systems globally the sphere frc target however comes from the who guidelines for drinking water quality gdwq which are based on conventions from the routine operation of municipal piped water systems in cities who 2017 as the us cdc 2014 observe the gdwq frc target is appropriate only when users drink water directly from the flowing taps of a piped system it is unlikely to provide sufficient residual protection in situations where the point of consumption is spatially and temporally distant from the point of distribution something which is commonly the case in refugee idp camps in these settings people must collect water from public distribution points known as tapstands transport it in containers back to their shelters and then store and use that water for up to 24 hours or longer multiple studies in refugee idp camps have shown that pathogenic recontamination of water can occur during collection and transport from distribution points as well as during storage and use in camp households and that these are linked to the spread of waterborne diseases among camp populations mahamud et al 2012 roberts et al 2001 shultz et al 2009 steele et al 2008 swerdlow et al 1997 walden et al 2005 sikder et al 2020 found that maintaining 0 2 mg l frc in households was necessary for preventing e coli contamination of stored water in refugee camp households in bangladesh corroborating a long standing convention that at least 0 2 mg l frc is needed to ensure microbiological water safety lantagne 2008 in an earlier study the authors found that implementing the sphere frc target at water distribution points in refugee camps in south sudan failed to reliably ensure sufficient frc protection up to the point of consumption in refugees shelters ali et al 2015 these findings signify that the 0 2 0 5 mg l frc target range prescribed by sphere is indeed protective if it is implemented at the point of consumption rather than at the point of distribution this raises the question then what must frc be at water distribution points in order to ensure that at least 0 2 mg l remains at the point of consumption many hours later this question has public health implications wherever people do not drink water directly from the tap and must store and use water for many hours such as in refugee and idp camps during humanitarian emergencies or in intermittent water systems in low and middle income countries lmics elala et al 2011 in response to these water safety concerns we launched a multi site study to investigate post distribution chlorine decay and household water safety in refugee and idp camps in field studies conducted between 2013 2015 in refugee camps in south sudan jordan and rwanda we observed how water quality changed in chlorinated water supplies between distribution and consumption we implemented a nonlinear optimization approach for the novel technical challenge of modelling post distribution chlorine decay in order to generate estimates on what frc must be at water distribution points in order to provide adequate frc protection up to the point of consumption in households many hours later the objective of our research was to demonstrate this approach for generating site specific and evidence based chlorination targets for refugee idp camp water systems and evaluate whether these site specific frc targets could increase the proportion of households having safe water at the point of consumption compared to the status quo sphere frc target the approach developed here forms the basis of an operational support tool that assists refugee idp camp water system operators in generating site specific chlorination targets to keep water safe to drink for the entire duration of household storage and use 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites we carried out four field studies at refugee camps with different temperature and environmental conditions in south sudan jordan and rwanda table 1 our first site the maban county refugee camps in south sudan march 20 april 18 2013 was located in a hot semi arid setting and had poor water sanitation and hygiene wash conditions this site sheltered refugees from sudan and was composed of three sub camps jamam batil and gendrassa that were geographically close to one another and had similar conditions located in the nile basin floodplain the local terrain was characterized by thick strata of heavy clay rich soil that is prone to waterlogging and has low groundwater productivity during the 2012 rainy season the camps suffered widespread flooding resulting in multiple outbreaks of waterborne diseases including hepatitis e the severity and persistence of which was exacerbated by the poor wash conditions shelters at this site were predominantly standard issue united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr canvas tents our second site the azraq refugee camp in jordan sheltered syrian refugees and was located in an arid desert setting in contrast to the south sudan site the azraq refugee camp was a fully planned site with water and sanitation infrastructure exceeding humanitarian standards we carried out two phases of data collection at azraq in order to control for site related factors and observe how temperature may affect chlorine decay the first jordan study phase took place during the summer july 13 august 20 2014 and the second during late winter early spring march 17 april 13 2015 shelters at this site were semi permanent sheet metal structures with either plastic tarp or poured concrete floors our final site the kigeme refugee camp in rwanda june 23 july 15 2015 sheltered refugees from the democratic republic of the congo located in the forested highlands of western rwanda kigeme had a relatively cool climate wash conditions at kigeme were poor and similar to the south sudan camps sanitation at kigeme took the form of communal dischargeable latrine blocks that drained via surface channels which exposed sewage effluent to the ambient environment kigeme camp was built on two hills improved by terracing on which densely crowded shelters where constructed from mud wood and plastic sheeting by the refugee population all study sites had centrally chlorinated piped water supply infrastructure typical in refugee idp camps during the stabilized emergency phase in these water systems abstracted groundwater from boreholes south sudan jordan or clarified surface water rwanda was treated immediately after abstraction or clarification by automatic in line chlorine dosers which dispensed either chlorine solution prepared from calcium hypochlorite powder south sudan rwanda or chlorine gas jordan water was chlorinated to in principle satisfy the inherent chlorine demand of the water and achieve breakpoint chlorination in retention tanks with at least one hour of contact time before being delivered to public water distribution points with the specified target frc images of public water distribution points from each site are presented in fig 1 2 2 field data collection at each site we observed how water quality changed between distribution and consumption by measuring water quality in the same parcel of water at multiple points along the water supply chain 1 directly from the tap at the public water distribution point 2 from the container after it was filled at the distribution point 3 from the same container after being carried back to the water user s shelter and 4 from the same container after several hours of household storage and use i e the point of consumption each sample collected therefore consisted of a time series of four consecutive water quality observations taken from the same water we measured free residual chlorine frc total residual chlorine trc turbidity ph electrical conductivity ec and water temperature frc and trc were analysed via the colorimetric method using a palintest pth 7091 compact chlorometer and wagtech 7100 photometer with palintest dpd1 dpd3 reagents palintest ltd tyne wear uk turbidity was measured using a palintest pth 090 compact turbimeter palintest ltd tyne wear uk ph ec air and water temperature were measured via the potentiometric method using an eijkelkamp 18 21 multimeter eijkelkamp agrisearch equipment giesbeek netherlands hanna instruments hi 98311 ec tds temperature multi meter hanna instruments woonsocket ri usa or a hach sension multi meter hach instruments loveland co usa analytical equipment was calibrated using non expired manufacturer standards every one to two days of consecutive field use we also collected data on water handling practices via spot observations or respondent self report including on container type container covering container cleanliness sun exposure and method of drawing water at each site members of the local refugee population were recruited and trained as field data collectors the primary investigator accompanied field teams over the course of data collection at each site in order to ensure procedural adherence 2 2 1 timing of household follow up visits during the south sudan 2013 study overall water supply was limited in the camps so water was commonly consumed the same day it was collected we therefore initiated samples in the morning and returned to households for follow up in the afternoon representing approximately a 6 to 9 hour interval between distribution and consumption in the jordan and rwanda studies water supply was more plentiful so people collected more water and stored and used it in their households for longer up to 24 hours at these sites we varied the timing of household follow up visits in order to collect data representing different durations of household storage and use we alternately initiated samples in the morning and returned to households for follow up either the same day afternoon approximately 6 to 9 hours interval or the next morning approximately 24 hours interval or we started samples in the afternoon and returned for follow up the next morning approximately 18 hours interval for the final phase in rwanda we followed up at households twice in order to gather an additional time series data point for a total of five with which to better constrain subsequent chlorine decay modelling 2 2 2 sample sizes and site representativeness to determine the number of samples for the initial study in south sudan we looked to previous work characterizing water quality changes between source and consumption in lmic settings e g levy et al 2008 trevett et al 2004 these studies typically had 50 to 150 samples where each sample consisted of two paired measurements at source and at point of consumption so we collected approximately 70 samples at each of the three sub camps for a total of 220 samples across the south sudan site as each sample consisted of a time series of four water quality measurements this represented approximately 880 frc time data points for the first phase in jordan we similarly collected 199 unique samples representing approximately 796 frc time data points for the second phase in jordan we used the first jordan dataset to determine the number of samples to collect by evaluating how variance in distribution point frc data decreased as the number of samples increased we found that variance stabilized at the same level as for 199 samples at just 120 samples so for the second phase in jordan we collected 120 unique samples representing approximately 480 frc time data points for the final study phase in rwanda we similarly collected 134 unique samples in rwanda as each sample consisted of a time series of five water quality measurements this represented approximately 670 frc time data points we sought to systematically sample all water distribution points in each camp however this was not always possible due to inconsistent service levels in some camps or the size of the water systems in others in south sudan because of persistent water supply shortages and inconsistent chlorination management water distribution points were often dry or unchlorinated we therefore adopted a convenience sampling approach wherein we sampled distribution points attached to boreholes that were flowing and chlorinated each day of data collection we sought spatial representativeness by i collecting an equal number of samples in each sub camp ii visiting different distribution points in different areas of each sub camp each day and iii sampling distribution points attached to different boreholes in each sub camp each day a majority of borehole sources in each sub camp in south sudan were ultimately sampled and there was no apparent bias toward specific distribution points or boreholes in jordan we systematically sampled every distribution point in the populated sectors of the camp during the 2014 and 2015 studies in rwanda there were more distribution points than the number of samples we sought to collect so we utilized a random number generator to randomly select an equal number of distribution points from the two hill sectors that constituted the camp through this approach we were able to collect a representative randomized distribution of samples across the rwanda site area 2 3 ethics the initial field work in south sudan received exemption from full ethics review by the medical director of médecins sans frontières msf operational centre amsterdam as we were collecting routine data in the midst of an on going water supply intervention for subsequent field studies in jordan and rwanda we received ethics approval from the committee for protection of human subjects cphs of the institutional review board at the university of california berkeley cphs protocol number 2014 05 6326 2 4 data analysis our analytical objective was to model post distribution chlorine decay as a function of time using only the water quality data that is routinely available in refugee idp camps developing site specific models of post distribution chlorine decay enables us to design distribution point frc targets that provide sufficient residual protection for the typical duration that water is stored and used in camp households at a given site our goal was to evaluate whether the site specific and evidence based frc targets generated through this modelling approach could improve household water safety outcomes compared to the status quo sphere frc target 2 4 1 post distribution chlorine decay modelling while chlorine decay in distribution systems is well understood post distribution chlorine decay has not to our knowledge been subject to modelling efforts c f the grayman 2018 review of the drinking water quality modelling sector we therefore devised a nonlinear optimization approach for the novel technical challenge of modelling post distribution chlorine decay in refugee idp camps by drawing on concepts from water quality modelling in distribution systems and modifying some of its assumptions chlorine residuals in municipal water distribution systems are typically modelled by coupling hydraulic mass transport and kinetic decay models in order to represent advective and diffusive mass transport in piped networks and the consumption of chlorine due to reactions in the bulk fluid phase and along the pipe wall characterized respectively by first or second order reaction kinetics and zero or first order kinetics biswas et al 1993 clark and sivaganesan 2002 rossman et al 1994 vasconcelos et al 1997 while mass transport is important in distribution systems it is less relevant and likely represents a minor component during the post distribution period where water is stored in containers moreover while water quality modelling in distribution systems is based on the premise of a closed system this does not hold once water exits the piped network the post distribution system can be better understood as an open system influenced by multiple known and unknown factors which could include biofilms on storage containers temperature exposure to ultraviolet light or discrete contamination events linked to unhygienic water handling in which new organic material is introduced to water given the complexity of the multiple reactions that could take place between chlorine and various organic and inorganic constituents as well as the influence of known and unknown external mediating factors analytical mechanistic models of post distribution chlorine decay may not be feasible therefore recourse to empirical reaction kinetic models is justified in a similar vein to early modelling efforts on trihalomethane formation kinetics c f vasconcelos et al 1996 an overall empirical kinetic model provides a way to represent the combined effects of all factors influencing post distribution chlorine decay at a given site such as source water quality environmental factors such as ambient air temperature or importantly the diverse range of water handling practices that will inevitably prevail among a large number of water users in a real world refugee idp camp setting the impact of these decay influencing factors is reflected in the change in frc going from distribution to consumption and the cumulative effect of all decay factors active at a site including how often they occur and their effect strength are therefore implicitly captured in the distribution to consumption frc data we collected discrete contamination events in which new organic material including potentially waterborne pathogens are introduced to water are likely highly important for waterborne disease transmission in these settings a discrete contamination event has the effect of pulling the frc down from where it would otherwise be based on prevailing decay conditions in a population where unhygienic water handling practices are more prevalent discrete contamination events and associated frc drops will happen more frequently and will result in a greater apparent chlorine decay and vice versa overall empirical kinetic modelling using distribution to consumption frc data provides a way to mathematically represent the apparent chlorine decay due to the aggregated effect of all decay influencing factors including discrete contamination events as a function of time since decay influencing factors are unique to each site model representations of post distribution chlorine decay are site specific this is consistent with chlorine decay modelling in distribution systems which similarly relies on site specific model representations of chlorine decay biswas et al 1993 vasconcelos et al 1997 in order to maximize the utility and replicability of our analytical procedure in refugee idp camp water systems we sought to model post distribution chlorine decay using just the water quality data that is commonly available in these settings routine water quality monitoring in refugee idp camps focuses on monitoring frc at water distribution points and since the 2018 revision of the sphere handbook at households as well turbidity and ph are also commonly measured at the point of treatment and or distribution but seldom thereafter humanitarian water quality guidelines c f médecins sans frontières 2010 sphere association 2018 specify that turbidity should be less than 5 ntu and ph less than 8 in order for chlorination to be most effective and these conditions also apply to the present analysis other physical chemical biological and or radiological water quality parameters are generally only measured when a new source is commissioned or during seasonal spot checks we therefore modelled chlorine decay using commonly available frc data from distribution points and households in the integrated rate law el seoud et al 2017 1 1 c n 1 1 c 0 n 1 n 1 k t 2 c c 0 1 n n 1 k t 1 1 n where c is the frc in mg l at time t in hours c 0 is the initial frc at time zero i e at the point of distribution n is the dimensionless rate order and k is the rate constant with units m g 1 n l n 1 h r 1 the integrated rate law at n 1 becomes eq 3 3 c c 0 e k t with the frc time data collected at each site we used the above relationships to estimate model parameters n and k in order to create an empirical kinetic representation of overall post distribution chlorine decay that encompasses all reactions in the bulk fluid phase and with the container wall driven by the decay influencing factors active at that site as discussed above rate order n in distribution system chlorine decay modelling is typically characterized as 0 1 or 2 non integer rate orders are also physically possible where overall reactions are composed of multiple elementary steps given the complex array of reactions and factors that may influence post distribution chlorine decay we sought to avoid assumptions as to what the overall empirical rate order should be and left it unconstrained during modelling since eq 2 cannot converge to n 1 eq 3 was evaluated separately and the performance of the first order model was compared to models in which n was unconstrained conversely eq 2 can converge to n 0 or 2 or any non integer value in this range or above should any of these be the best fit for the data we stratified our analysis by site as we sought to generate site specific chlorination targets for the two jordan datasets we applied an additional level of stratification in order to account for the practice of storing water in direct sunlight which was unique to this site c f appendix data cleaning and stratification only non sun exposed data are reported here as this is reflective of normative practice we used the numerical downhill simplex nelder mead method a widely used optimization technique in gnu octave 5 2 0 eaton 2020 an open source mathematical programming software to estimate model parameters n and k using pooled vectors of the frc time data from each site for model optimization we minimized the sum of square errors sse 4 s s e i 1 n c o b s c p r e d 2 where n is the number of samples in the dataset c p r e d was calculated using eq 2 and initial assumptions for n and k and sse was calculated using eq 4 the nelder mead algorithm is a gradient descent approach which improves on initial estimates of n and k by following downward trends in the error surface until the change with each iteration is below a specified tolerance these tolerances were selected as on error function value sse 10 4 on input values k and n 10 4 and maximum number of iterations 400 additional error functions e g relative error were also evaluated for use but did not yield meaningful improvements in modelling performance and were thus dropped from further consideration in order to evaluate modelling performance across sites overall model goodness of fit r2 eq 6 as well as sum of residuals s σ eq 7 an indicator of model skewness were also calculated in addition to r2 for the overall model r2 was also calculated for predictions at the point of consumption only r2 poc 5 s s t i 1 n c o b s m e a n c o b s 2 6 r 2 1 s s e s s t 7 s σ i 1 n c o b s c p r e d in order to evaluate whether the numerical algorithm was converging to a local or global minimum we implemented solution sets in which we randomized initial assumptions for n and k and evaluated whether the routine converged to the same or multiple solutions over five runs we varied n between 0 and 2 the range reported in the distribution systems chlorine decay literature and k between 0 and 0 60 0 11 was the highest value for k generated during exploratory modelling so six times this figure was used datasets for each site were split into 90 training and 10 testing subsets and modelling performance metrics were compared between these subsets this is good model calibration practice that prevents model over fitting and maintains model generalizability in situations where solution sets generated multiple solutions representing different local minima we preferentially used the solution that appeared more often and had superior modelling performance with respect to goodness of fit referred to in the following as the dominant solution in order to generate conservative estimates for decay model parameters n and k at each site we implemented a confidence region estimation in which we generated contour plots of n and k against error by solving the integrated rate law eq 2 over a range of n and k values to build a matrix of sse to cover the relevant solution space n was varied between 0 and 3 and k was varied between zero and three times the optimized k obtained from the solution set for each site i e that which minimized sse 300 steps were used for both parameters to build a 301 301 matrix of sse values at each combination of n and k with contour lines plotted every 5 above the minimum sse for each site two combinations of n and k were selected to compute initial frc required to achieve a desired downstream frc 1 the optimum solution representing the n and k combination which minimized sse i e the best performing n and k combination from the solution set and 2 the maximum decay prediction the n and k combination that represented the most rapid decay that could be anticipated within a 5 error envelope prior to analysis frc time data from each site were cleaned of erroneous entries following a uniform set of rules c f appendix data cleaning and stratification all site datasets and analytical code are included in the supplementary material 2 4 2 site specific distribution point frc targets using the optimum solution and maximum decay prediction n and k parameter combinations developed for each site with eq 2 we computed the distribution point frc targets c 0 that would result in an frc concentration at the point of consumption c of 0 2 mg l at variable lengths of time up to 24 hours post distribution we generated distribution point frc target design graphs for each site wherein distribution point frc to achieve a household frc of 0 2 mg l was plotted as a function of elapsed hours post distribution we also sought to account for chlorine taste and odour acceptability in the frc target design graphs while the who sets a maximum health based guideline value for free chlorine of 5 mg l who 2017 taste and odour driven rejection of chlorinated water can occur at much lower concentration levels in a study on chlorine dosing for household water treatment in lmic settings lantagne 2008 found 2 0 mg l to be the upper limit above which user acceptability became a concern based on focus group testing in ethiopia and zambia more recently crider et al 2018 found a median acceptability threshold of 1 25 mg l frc among adults in urban bangladesh as we did not collect primary data on chlorine taste and odour acceptability as part of this study we adopted the more conservative figure from the literature i e 1 25 mg l frc for our analysis chlorine taste and odour acceptability however is population specific and should ideally be evaluated at each site chlorine acceptability thresholds are also not fixed and can be modified through organoleptic habituation and or health promotion messaging on the public health importance of water chlorination piriou et al 2015 sikder et al 2020 in order to evaluate the household water safety effectiveness of the site specific frc targets developed from this modelling approach compared to the status quo sphere frc target we first selected a distribution point frc target from the design graph for each site that would maximize the level of protection up to 24 hours post distribution where possible without exceeding the chlorine taste odour acceptability limit we then assessed the proportion of sampled households at each site having safe water i e 0 2 mg l frc at follow up when distribution point frc was in line with the site specific frc target using a bin with a range of the frc target minus 0 2 mg l this was compared to the proportion of sampled households having safe water at follow up at the same time post distribution when distribution point frc was in line with the sphere frc target i e 0 2 0 5 mg l 3 results overall water quality at the point of distribution at each site is summarized in table 2 site frc data at the four measurement points five in the case of rwanda are summarized in fig 2 an overview of key household water handling practices at each site is provided in table 3 from table 2 we observe that distribution point water quality at all sites met the turbidity and ph requirements for effective chlorination stipulated in the humanitarian water quality guidelines i e 5 ntu and ph 8 the downward trend in the frc data presented in fig 2 going from tap to household follow up reflects the rate of chlorine decay at each site with more rapid decay evident in south sudan 2013 and jordan 2014 and less rapid decay evident in jordan 2015 and rwanda 2015 moreover the dispersion of the frc data in fig 2 shows that the more acute emergencies in south sudan 2013 and jordan 2014 had poorer operational control of chlorination than the more stabilized situations in jordan 2015 and rwanda 2015 temperature is also known to strongly influence chlorine decay rates powell et al 2000 south sudan 2013 and jordan 2014 had higher air and water temperatures than jordan 2015 and rwanda 2015 i e an approximate 10 c difference respectively can be seen in table 1 and table 2 which may have contributed to the more rapid chlorine decay evident at these sites while temperatures decreased going from the jordan 2014 study to the 2015 study so did turbidity levels at water distribution points mean turbidity 2 16 ntu and 0 77 ntu respectively which could have also played a role in reducing chlorine decay at this site key differences in water handling practices among study sites can be seen in table 3 which reflect the acuteness of the emergency situation at each site and may also contribute to the variable chlorine decay observed across sites of all the sites only south sudan 2013 had a large number of respondents 20 who drew water by dipping a cup into stored water an unhygienic practice that can introduce contaminating material from hands utensils and vessels directly into stored drinking water at all other sites the majority of respondents 90 reported pouring water out of storage containers into drinking vessels which is more hygienic incidentally south sudan 2013 was the only site at which respondents reported using a tap to draw water 20 reflecting the types of water storage containers available at that site namely the oxfam container 29 a specially designed bucket for transporting and storing water fitted with a tap for drawing water in general south sudan 2013 had a greater diversity of water storage containers including both narrow mouth options 40 such as rigid and collapsible jerrycans and wide mouth options 50 such as oxfam containers common plastic 20 litre buckets and unhcr buckets narrow mouth containers are preferable to wide mouth options as the smaller opening restricts the ease with which contaminating material can come into contact with stored water and effectively precludes dipping to draw water all of the other sites had majority narrow mouth storage containers 70 in rwanda 2015 and 90 in jordan 2014 and 2015 container covering is also important for limiting the opportunity for recontamination to occur in south sudan 2013 there was a nearly even split upon spot observation in households 42 uncovered vs 54 covered whereas jordan 2014 and 2015 had very high levels of container covering 80 rwanda 2015 had the lowest level of container covering 20 however the adverse impact could have possibly been mitigated by the narrow mouth containers that were prevalent in rwanda compared to south sudan where wide mouth containers were more common container cleanliness was also an issue in south sudan and rwanda where only a small proportion of household storage containers were clean during spot observations 16 and 10 respectively compared to 59 and 72 in jordan 2014 and 2015 respectively overall south sudan 2013 had the most unhygienic water handling practices followed by rwanda 2015 whereas water handling practices were generally good in jordan 2014 and 2015 the cumulative effect of these water handling practices across the population at each site is captured in the frc data we collected in the field and represented in the post distribution decay modelling as discussed in section 2 4 1 during the jordan 2014 field study we also observed about a quarter of surveyed households storing water in direct sunlight in order to drive off excess chlorine residual this practice emerged during the initial phase of the emergency when frc levels at water distribution points had been grossly excessive i e 3 mg l frc as seen in fig 2 unaccustomed to chlorinated water supplies back home the rural syrian refugee population adopted this practice in order to make the camp s chlorinated water more palatable during the initial settlement period but the practice remained prevalent even as distribution point frc levels stabilized to lower levels in 2015 c f fig 2 this practice was not observed in south sudan or rwanda as discussed in section 2 4 1 we have reported only non sun exposed data from jordan 2014 and 2015 as this is reflective of normative practice chlorine decay modelling outputs are presented in table 4 sse contour plots from the confidence region estimation are presented in fig 3 optimum and maximum decay prediction parameter combinations for each site are presented in table 5 these modeling outputs are discussed at length in the next section in order to generate site specific distribution point frc target design graphs as discussed in section 2 4 the first order model eq 3 was also evaluated in all cases models with n 1 performed worse than models where n was unconstrained results are not included here for brevity indicating that better post distribution decay modelling performance can be obtained by allowing n to remain unconstrained 4 discussion the modeling outputs presented above are discussed in the following sub sections in order to develop site specific distribution point frc target design graphs in addition household water safety evaluations of the design frc targets versus the status quo sphere frc target are also presented 4 1 south sudan 2013 in the decay modeling outputs for south sudan in table 4 all five training runs converged to n 0 75 and k 0 1098 suggesting this is a global minimum in the error function corroborated visually by the sse contour plot in fig 3a this solution had a high degree of goodness of fit r2 0 8706 as did the test runs r2 0 9441 suggesting good model generalizability for this site the model was also moderately good at making predictions at later time points r2 poc 0 6402 which was corroborated in the test runs r2 poc 0 8579 the sum of residuals sσ signifies model skewness wherein negative values indicate that the model tends to over predict downstream frc compared to observed data and thus under predicts decay rates all site models were negatively skewed indicating that we should use the maximum decay prediction in order to be most conservative based on the confidence region estimation the maximum decay prediction parameter combination for south sudan 2013 was n 0 66 and k 0 1463 table 5 the distribution point frc target design graph for south sudan 2013 based on the optimum and maximum decay models for the site is presented in fig 4 from fig 4 we see that the distribution point frc required to protect water up to 24 hours post distribution at this site would be excessive i e 5 38 mg l based on the maximum decay prediction model this suggests that ensuring 24 hours of protection may not be feasible at this site due to chlorine taste odour rejection concerns a shorter duration of protection may have to be accepted if for instance distribution point frc was set to the designated chlorine taste and odour acceptability limit of 1 25 mg l our maximum decay prediction model indicates that water would be protected up to 10 hours post distribution the household water safety evaluation for this distribution point frc target for south sudan 2013 compared to the current sphere frc target is presented in fig 5 we observe from fig 5 that in the south sudan 2013 dataset the current sphere frc target range resulted in sufficient frc i e 0 2 mg l at household follow up 6 to 12 hours post distribution in 14 4 out of 28 of sampled households in comparison the site specific frc target resulted in 71 15 out of 21 of sampled households having safe water during the same time period representing a considerable improvement in the degree of household water safety achieved 4 2 jordan 2014 from the decay modeling outputs for jordan 2014 in table 4 we observe that the five training runs consistently converged to n 1 65 and k 0 0710 suggesting this is a global minimum in the error function visually corroborated by the sse contour plot in fig 3b the model has good fit r2 0 7925 but the test runs performed slightly worse r2 0 5396 raising the possibility of model overfitting the model performs poorly at later time points r2 poc 0 2872 and is also negatively skewed reinforcing the need to use the maximum decay prediction in order to be conservative based on the confidence region estimation the maximum decay prediction parameter combination for jordan 2014 was n 1 25 and k 0 0889 table 5 the distribution point frc target design graph for jordan 2014 based on the optimum and maximum decay models for that site is presented in fig 6 from fig 6 we observe that 24 hours protection of household stored water can be achieved at this site by setting distribution point frc to 1 17 mg l based on the maximum decay model this is within the designated chlorine acceptability limit the household water safety evaluation of this site specific distribution point frc target for jordan 2014 compared to the current sphere frc target is presented in fig 7 we observe from fig 7 that in the jordan 2014 dataset the site specific frc target generated from our modelling resulted in 82 of sampled households having safe water at follow up at 16 to 28 hours post distribution average 20 9 hours there were no data representing the sphere frc target range at distribution points during this time period so no direct comparison can be made however we can infer the sphere range would have a smaller proportion of households having safe water based on the downward trend apparent in the distribution of the plotted data as distribution point frc decreases 4 3 jordan 2015 from the modelling outputs for jordan 2015 in table 4 we observe there was more modelling instability at this site compared to others across five training runs four converged to a physically unrealistic solution where n 12 55 and k 36 5226 r2 0 5415 and once to a solution where n 1 35 and k 0 0282 r2 0 2330 the test runs similarly had poor r2 values while the dominant solution n 12 55 k 36 5226 outperformed the non dominant solution n 1 35 k 0 0282 with respect to goodness of fit the tendency as n and k increase is for chlorine decay to become flatter in absolute terms we see that for the high n and k values of the dominant optimum solution and its associated maximum decay prediction n 8 56 k 2 8933 table 5 there is flat chlorine decay in the distribution point frc target design graph for jordan 2015 fig 8 it appears that for the low levels of absolute chlorine decay observed c f fig 2 in the relatively cool and clean conditions of the jordan 2015 site a wide range of very large n and k values could potentially fit the data and represent the slow decay observed this mutability is reflected in the relatively poor r2 and r2 poc values for this site compared to others it appears that in situations of small absolute chlorine decay our modelling approach may fail to converge to a meaningful solution given the flat decay represented by the dominant solution it may be interesting in this situation to look at the non dominant solution n 1 35 k 0 0282 and its associated maximum decay prediction n 0 44 k 0 0018 which despite their much poorer fit may represent a worse case scenario of faster chlorine decay and would therefore yield a more conservative distribution point frc target the parameter estimates are also in a range similar to those found at other sites the error space around the non dominant optimum solution and its associated maximum decay prediction is shown in fig 3c and the distribution point frc targets based on these non dominant models are also shown in fig 8 the non dominant maximum decay model appears to indicate that the upper limit of the current sphere frc target range of 0 5 mg l would provide sufficient frc protection up to 24 hours post distribution in this setting it appears that in relatively cool and clean conditions where there is little observed frc decay like jordan 2015 there is no evidence suggesting that the upper range of the current sphere frc target would not provide adequate protection this is also borne out in the household water safety evaluation for this site fig 9 the difference in the required distribution point frc to protect water for up to 24 hours post distribution in jordan 2014 and jordan 2015 suggests that seasonal temperature changes may affect post distribution chlorine decay although other explanations are also possible such as changes in turbidity at water distribution as discussed at the outset of this section further research is required to better resolve the effect of temperature on post distribution chlorine decay as site specific frc targets may need to be adjusted on a periodic or seasonal basis in order to account for temperature effects overall the vast difference in post distribution chlorine decay evident between the jordan 2014 and 2015 studies demonstrates that decay influencing factors will change over time even at the same site post distribution chlorine decay models and the frc targets that are generated from them must be specific to time and place 4 4 rwanda 2015 in the decay modeling outputs for rwanda in table 4 four out of five training runs converged to a minimum at n 0 79 and k 0 0303 and a single run converged to a local minimum at n 1 14 and k 0 0386 while only the dominant solution n 0 79 k 0 0303 is plotted in fig 3d the position of the non dominant solution n 1 14 k 0 0386 lays within the trough of minimum error depicted in the middle of the contour plot the goodness of fit of both solutions are good r2 0 80 and are corroborated by the test runs which resulted in similar r2 values the dominant and non dominant models are also moderately effective at later time points r2 poc 0 59 but remain negatively skewed albeit to a lesser degree than for south sudan or jordan 2014 the distribution point frc target design graph for rwanda 2015 based on the dominant and non dominant solutions and the maximum decay predication from the former is presented in fig 10 from fig 10 we observe that 24 hours protection can be achieved at this site by setting the distribution point frc target to 0 64 mg l based on the maximum decay prediction associated with the dominant optimum model this is well within the designated chlorine acceptability threshold the household water safety evaluation of this site specific distribution point frc target for rwanda 2015 compared to the current sphere frc target is presented in fig 11 from fig 11 we observe that the site specific frc target resulted in sufficient frc at household follow up in 68 23 out of 34 of sampled households in rwanda compared to 50 11 out of 22 for the current sphere frc target range representing a moderate improvement in household water safety 4 5 operational recommendations the post distribution chlorine decay modelling approach we have demonstrated above can be used to generate site specific and evidence based water chlorination targets that protect household water safety for variable durations of household storage and use in refugee idp camp settings the site specific frc targets were better able to achieve the desired public health objective of having sufficiently chlorinated water at the point of consumption than the sphere frc target in three out of the four refugee camps in which we carried out studies the one notable exception to this was jordan 2015 a site which had relatively cool temperatures and high levels of wash service provision at this site it appeared that the upper limit of the current sphere frc target range i e 0 5 mg l frc was able to provide adequate protection up to 24 hours post distribution at all other refugee idp camp sites particularly those in hot climates or where wash conditions are poor we recommend implementing post distribution chlorine decay modelling in order to generate a site specific chlorination target that suits local conditions to facilitate this for refugee idp camp water system operators we have made the post distribution chlorine decay analytics demonstrated above available online as a web based platform called the safe water optimization tool 2020 refugee idp camp water system operators can use water quality data from their sites to generate a site specific and evidence based frc target that protects water for a designated length of time they select based on local water usage patterns and then evaluate the proportion of households having safe water at this follow up time for the site specific frc target versus the sphere frc target before deciding whether to implement the site specific frc target in their water system the site specific frc targets produced through this modelling approach represent the minimum frc required to achieve the public health goal of keeping water safe to drink for the entire duration of household storage and use proper chlorination is not however on its own sufficient for ensuring water safety promoting and enabling safe and hygienic water storage and handling practices is also necessary increasing chlorination levels also presents some concerns of its own for one excessive chlorination can lead to taste and odour driven rejection of treated water water system operators should endeavour to deliver the minimum frc required for protecting public health while not exceeding the population specific chlorine acceptability threshold if at a particular site the acceptability threshold is found to be lower than the site specific frc target water system operators should not exceed the former in order to minimize the risk that water users turn to other untreated water sources in these situations better protecting the safe water chain via safe water storage practices i e covered narrow mouth and regularly cleaned and replaced storage containers with taps are an important alternative to increasing chlorination levels further research is needed to develop and validate rapid methods for evaluating chlorine taste and odour acceptability thresholds in humanitarian response settings secondly while the risk posed by waterborne diseases is the primary concern in humanitarian crises disinfection by products dbps may also be a concern for vulnerable sub groups such as pregnant women especially when raw unclarified surface waters are rapidly chlorinated during acute emergencies ali et al 2019 field appropriate methods to characterize and manage dbps in humanitarian water systems also warrant further development limitations of our study included 1 given the complexity and range of potential factors influencing post distribution chlorine decay in real world settings we did not attempt to define an analytical mechanistic model that can explicitly characterize the specific effects of decay influencing factors such as temperature or source water quality or which models discrete contamination events linked to unhygienic water handling practices 2 from the distribution systems modelling literature it is known that source water quality influences chlorine decay powell et al 2000 vasconcelos et al 1996 our analysis assumes that initial chlorine dosing during water treatment adequately satisfies the inherent chlorine demand of the water and that breakpoint chlorination is fully achieved resulting in a stable residual at water distribution points this then becomes the lever water system operators can act upon to optimize household water safety however breakpoint chlorination may not be reliably achieved in refugee idp camp water systems for several reasons including improper dosing inadequate retention time and slow decay reactions e g with manganese this means that the influence of source water quality could persist into the post distribution period this however would still be captured in the frc data going from distribution to consumption and would thereby be accounted for in post distribution chlorine decay modelling 3 the household water safety evaluations of the site specific frc targets versus the sphere frc target we conducted were indicative of improved performance but were not sufficiently powered to confirm this effect future evaluations should be sufficiently powered to properly assess household water safety effectiveness in comparison to the sphere frc target 5 conclusions the current sphere guideline for water chlorination in humanitarian emergencies is not designed to ensure water safety at the point of consumption in refugee idp camps multiple evaluations show that the sphere frc target range does not reliably ensure household water safety in camp settings especially where temperatures are hot 30 c and or wash conditions are poor chlorination levels at water distribution points in refugee idp camps need to be increased within taste odour acceptability limits by varying degrees in order to account for local post distribution chlorine decay and ensure water remains safe to drink for the entire duration of household storage and use the nonlinear optimization approach presented here can be used to generate site specific and evidence based distribution point frc targets that provide sufficient residual to protect water for up to 24 hours post distribution based on data from refugee camps in south sudan jordan and rwanda this modelling approach performed well at sites where there was appreciable chlorine decay between distribution and consumption but not as well where chlorine decay was small in absolute terms in these settings which tend to be cooler 20 30 c and have better wash conditions the upper limit of the current sphere frc target range 0 5 mg l appears to be sufficient for protecting household water safety and site specific frc targets may not be required to maximize the utility and replicability of our methodology in refugee idp camps we used only widely available frc data however other water quality parameters water handling practices and contextual factors also likely influence post distribution chlorine decay further research is required to investigate which factors matter most for post distribution chlorine decay in order to rationalize monitoring programs and better support water safety optimization efforts in refugee idp camps chlorine decay in distribution systems is known to be a highly site specific phenomenon and this also appears to be the case for post distribution chlorine decay this means that a unique site specific representation of post distribution chlorine decay and with it a site specific distribution point frc target is ideal to facilitate this we have made the post distribution chlorine decay modelling analytics demonstrated in this paper available online as an operational support tool for refugee idp camp water system operators the safe water optimization tool https safeh2o app can assist water system operators in analyzing distribution point and household frc monitoring data in order generate a site specific and evidence based frc target that provides residual chlorine protection for the entire duration of household storage and use current water quality monitoring practices in the humanitarian sector are focused primarily on water quality at the point of distribution however what really matters for public health is water quality where people actually consume it therefore a greater emphasis should be placed on water quality monitoring at the household point of consumption in humanitarian operations enhancing residual chlorine protection of household stored water is an essential component of an overall wash strategy for disrupting the transmission of waterborne pathogens and preventing water related diseases amongst displaced populations in refugee idp camp settings along with safe water storage access to sufficient quantities of water access to dignified sanitation and the means to maintain good personal domestic and environmental hygiene taken together these wash measures can help reduce disease burden and prevent unnecessary deaths associated with water related illnesses among displaced populations living through humanitarian crises declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

17369,swampy septic odor caused by various sulfides is one of the most frequently encountered odor problems in drinking water however even though it is much more offensive few studies have specifically focused on swampy septic odor compared to the extensively studied musty earthy problems in this work four sulfide odorants diamyl sulfide das dipropyl sulfide dps dimethyl disulfide dmds and diethyl disulfide deds were selected to evaluate the treatment performance of different oxidation processes in drinking water the results demonstrated that dmds deds dps and das could be oxidized effectively by kmno4 naclo and clo2 the oxidation processes could be well described by the second order kinetic model in which k values of selected sulfides followed the order dmds deds dps das as for the three oxidants the order of reactivity was kmno4 clo2 naclo which was also verified in raw water the results of oxidation treatability reaction kinetics and mechanisms confirmed that the characteristics of the central sulfur atom rather than the side chain is the decisive factor in controlling the oxidation rate and transformation pathway of sulfides the transformation products and pathways were significantly different for the three oxidants sulfones dpso daso were always formed by cycloaddition reactions during kmno4 oxidation yet recombination reactions proceeded during clo2 oxidation and formed more products such as mads dads and eads density functional theory dft calculations confirmed that the differences in transformation pathways were caused by the variations in the activity of the oxidants and sulfides finally naclo was certified as the most effective oxidant for controlling sulfide odorants in drinking water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sulfides oxidation treatability kinetics transformation pathways mechanisms 1 introduction as an important aesthetic water quality index the issue of taste and odor problems t o has caused growing concern worldwide in recent years suffet et al 1999 watson 2004 yang et al 2008 according to a national survey in china about eighty percent of source water showed odor problems to some extent with musty earthy and swampy septic odors being the dominant ones sun et al 2014 wang et al 2020a sulfide odorants which have been increasingly detected in many important water bodies recently make the major contribution to swampy septic odors wang et al 2019 for example some sulfide odorants including dimethyl trisulfide dmts dimethyl disulfide dmds etc were found to be responsible for the taihu t o issue in 2007 in china yang et al 2008 yu et al 2009 and were further extensively detected in some source waters guo et al 2016 wang et al 2019 strong swampy septic odor events occurred in source water abstracted from the river dee northwest england and groundwater in some areas of perth western australia mainly attributed to volatile organic sulfur compounds voscs like dmds and dmts campbell et al 1994 franzmann et al 2001 with the development of odor recognition and detection methods more and more sulfide odorants have been identified as potential swampy septic odor sources guo et al 2015 besides dmds and dmts some frequently encountered compounds in natural waters include diamyl sulfide das dipropyl sulfide dps and diethyl disulfide deds pang et al 2012 rong et al 2018 watson 2004 moreover abundant evidence shows that both biotic and abiotic processes provide a stable source for the release of sulfide odorants under both oxic and anoxic conditions findlay 2016 watson and jüttner 2017 including the biomethylation and polymerization of thiols chin and lindsay 1994 stets et al 2004 as t os caused by sulfide odorants are increasingly being reported sulfides are having a serious impact on the quality of drinking water around the world numerous complaints are received when unpleasant smells occur in drinking water malleret et al 2003 though much more offensive and intolerable than musty earthy odor due to its unpleasant sensory experiences for consumers mwh 2005 few studies have specifically focused on the source and control of swampy septic odor the conventional treatment processes in water treatment plants including coagulation sedimentation and sand filtration have shown limited efficiency for the control of odor problems hattori 1988 srinivasan and sorial 2011 pretreatment measures like adsorption and oxidation have usually been adopted to address this problem wang et al 2020b specifically activated carbon adsorption has been indicated to be effective for most odor compounds guo et al 2016 however some previous studies indicated that activated carbon had limited efficacy for thioether removal or that high dosages would be needed huang et al 2019 huang et al 2020a 2020b by comparison some oxidation processes proved effective for sulfides such as dmds and dmts adewuyi and carmichael 1986 antonopoulou et al 2014 feliers et al 2001 kastner et al 2003 for instance adewuyi and feliers first proposed the reaction kinetics of dimethyl sulfide dms and dmds in the h2o2 oxidation process adewuyi and carmichael 1986 feliers et al 2001 subsequently kastner developed an oxidation method for the removal of dmds using clo2 in a wet reactor kastner et al 2003 in recent years a few authors have focused on ozone and advanced oxidation processes evaluating the effectiveness of fe2 h2o2 and o3 bac processes in the removal of dmds and deds antonopoulou et al 2014 guo et al 2016 also methyl phenyl sulfide and benzyl 2 propenyl sulfide have been shown to be removed by photocatalytic oxidation processes cantau et al 2007 these results imply that there is potential for the removal of sulfide by way of oxidation and that the removal of sulfide by oxidation is feasible unfortunately the effects mechanisms and kinetics data of commonly used oxidants such as potassium permanganate sodium hypochlorite and chlorine dioxide used in the removal of sulfide in aqueous media are still lacking the water utilities suffer from a lack of credible theories to guide the removal of sulfide compounds in this challenging situation the oxidation treatability kinetics and mechanisms for different oxidants should be compared for different sulfides such as dmds deds dps and das etc in this work dmds deds dps and das as typical swampy septic odor sources were selected for study some frequently used oxidants kmno4 naclo and clo2 were chosen to compare the oxidation processes for dmds deds dps and das the oxidation treatability and kinetics of the processes were evaluated systematically meanwhile the oxidation transformation products of dmds deds dps and das were determined finally the oxidation pathways and mechanisms for three oxidants and sulfides were explored also density functional theory dft was employed to further support and evaluate the oxidation behavior of sulfide and different oxidants the results of the current work will provide theoretical and applicational guidance for the control of sulfide odorants in drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and standards details of the selected sulfides studied in the current work are listed in table 1 dmds deds dps and das standards 97 in methanol were obtained from sigma aldrich ar china kmno4 naclo kh2po4 na2hpo4 na2s2o3 naclo2 and h2so4 were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd ar china nacl was obtained from the beijing chemical works gr china clo2 was prepared by using naclo2 and h2so4 according to standard method 4500 clo2 b apha awwa wef 1995 na2s2o3 0 10 mol l 1 kh2po4 0 20 mol l 1 and na2hpo4 0 20 mol l 1 buffer solutions were prepared by using milli q water the concentration of kmno4 was measured by titration fischbacher et al 2017 the concentration of naclo was calculated as cl2 in this work zhu et al 2014 the concentration of naclo and clo2 was determined by a pocket colorimeter ii hach usa and dr2800 hach usa the milli q water was obtained from an integral 5 system millipore usa all standards and solutions were stored at 4 c in darkness 2 2 experimental procedures the procedures used for the oxidation treatability kinetics and transformation pathway experiments were the same and proceeded as follows the experiments were conducted in 250 ml conical flasks filled with 225 ml milli q water the experiments were further conducted in 225 ml of raw water for comparison taken from jinze reservoir shanghai china a magnetic stirrer was used to mix the reaction solution in the conical flask during the experiments 0 20 mol l 1 of kh2po4 and 0 20 mol l 1 of na2hpo4 were used to adjust the initial ph of the reaction solution to 7 0 0 2 then dmds deds dps and das were added into the reaction solutions to record the initial concentration of the selected sulfides 4 0 ml of the reaction solution was pipetted from the conical flask and marked as the initial sample before oxidation begins after that the oxidant was added into the reaction solution and a timer for recording oxidation time was started at this moment before sampling 1 0 ml of 0 2 mol l 1 na2s2o3 was added into the 20 ml vials to terminate the oxidation reaction in the sample solutions at designed time intervals duplicate samples were withdrawn from the reaction solution and placed in 20 ml vials these samples were capped by using 18 mm preassembled caps cnw uk for subsequent determination some details of the experiments on the treatability kinetics and transformation pathways are as follows oxidation treatability experiments the dosage of oxidant applied in most cases was no more than 1 0 mg l 1 and the oxidation time was no more than 2 h to adopt practically relevant parameters the dosage of the three oxidants was determined as 1 0 mg l 1 to evaluate their capacity to oxidize the selected sulfides within 2 h 2 and 20 μg l 1 each of dmds deds dps and das were selected to evaluate the performance of the three oxidants oxidation kinetics experiments the initial concentrations of dmds deds dps and das were respectively determined as 2 0 2 0 5 0 and 5 0 μg l 1 in kmno4 oxidation 20 20 50 and 50 μg l 1 in naclo and clo2 oxidation the dosage of kmno4 was determined as 0 2 0 5 1 0 mg l 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 mg l 1 for naclo and clo2 the oxidation times were 120 min 10 min 10 min in kmno4 naclo and clo2 oxidation respectively transformation pathway experiments the initial concentration used for the selected sulfides in the transformation pathway experiments was the same as in the kinetic experiments the three oxidants were dosed at 0 1 mg l 1 each time with an intermittent dosing pattern to avoid rapid oxidation and capture the formation trend of transformation products according to results of kinetics tests the maximum oxidation time in the kmno4 naclo and clo2 oxidation processes was 30 min 3 min and 7 min respectively to determine the precursors of disulfides and sulfone transformation products all possible combinations of systems were experimented with table s1 lists the mixtures used in the current study 2 3 determination of kinetics the second order kinetic model was employed to investigate the kinetic constants of the selected sulfides according to the literature chen et al 2019 huizhou et al 2016 ma et al 2012 and the competitive kinetic model was employed to obtain more reliable data the second order kinetic constant k value of dmds was calculated from eq 1 1 c dmds c dmd s 0 e k c t where c dmds and c dmds 0 are the dmds concentrations at different times and the initial concentration c and t are the oxidant concentrations and reaction time on the other hand due to the rapid nature of the reactions with kmno4 naclo and clo2 the oxidation kinetics of these sulfides were ambiguous using the limited data from the oxidation treatability experiments therefore the kinetics were further determined by using a competitive kinetic model in kinetic experiments thus dmds which showed lower activity compared with deds dps and das was chosen as the competitor to calculate k values using eq 2 2 ln s u l f i d e s s u l f i d e s 0 ln d m d s d m d s 0 k s u l f i d e s k d m d s where the k value of the selected sulfides could be determined from a plot of ln sulfides sulfides 0 versus ln dmds dmds0 with k dmds as the slope of the fitted line k sulfides are the k value of and deds dps das 2 4 detection methods dmds deds dps and das were determined by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms gc ms qp2010 plus shimadzu japan combined with solid phase micro extraction spme within 72 h the spme process was completed in the pretreatment device gerstel mülheim an der ruhr germany automatically the separation was performed by a db 5ms column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 mm agilent usa with helium gas at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 to each sample solution 2 g nacl was added in advance and the extraction fiber was 50 30 um dvb car on pdms the specific spme operation conditions were as follows firstly 5 ml samples were shocked at 65 c and extracted by the fiber in 20 ml vials for 30 min then the fiber with the sample was desorbed at the temperature of 250 c for 10 min and injected into the gas chromatograph automatically the temperature program for gc was set as follows initial temperature kept at 40 c for 10 min increased at 8 c min 1 to 120 c then increased at 5 c min 1 to 130 c and then ramped at 15 c min 1 to 250 c for 5 min mass spectrometry conditions were as follows ei source 70 ev ionization voltage electron multiplying voltage 824 v head pressure 50 kpa gc ms interface temperature 280 c ion source temperature 230 c samples were injected in splitless mode blank control experiments were also conducted to evaluate the loss of dmds deds dps and das during the pre concentration process and error bars were used to demonstrate errors in the measurement of the selected sulfides the details of retention time recovery etc of dmds deds dps and das are shown in table 2 the recoveries were all in the range of 93 7 102 9 the full scan mode was employed for determining oxidation transformation products other steps and conditions were same as described above in addition the final solution was diluted to 19 5 ml to extract more transformation products using the spme method in mps gerstel mülheim an der ruhr germany 2 5 computational methodology the orca quantum chemistry package version 4 2 0 neese 2018 was employed for density functional theory dft calculations the results including energies geometries and molecular properties were computed at the b3lyp d3bj ma def2 tzvp level weigend and ahlrichs 2005 zheng et al 2011 dft calculations of dmds deds dps das dpso daso sulfate and three oxidants were carried out before dft calculations the cartesian coordinates of all the species available for subsequent dft calculations were optimized by using the minimize energy function of the mm2 module to obtain the optimal conformation of all the species the opt algorithm was employed in geometry optimizations the solvation model based on density smd water was selected as solvent was employed in all the dft calculations for consideration of the solvent effect the average local ionization energy alie and condensed dft cdft analysis involving wavefunction analysis were obtained by the multiwfn program version 3 7 lu and chen 2012 to obtain the necessary data required for cdft analysis single point energies of all chemicals in n n 1 and n 1 state computed using optimized conformation were calculated at the b3lyp d3bj ma def2 tzvp level the relevant images of the result were mapped by the vmd program version 1 9 3 humphrey et al 1996 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxidation treatability of kmno4 clo2 and naclo the results of oxidation treatability experiments revealed the capacity of kmno4 clo2 and naclo to remove the selected sulfides the removal trends within 2 h are demonstrated in fig 1 a b and the corresponding removal of the selected sulfides after 2 h are shown in fig 1 c from the results in the oxidation process of kmno4 fig 1 the removal of dmds deds dps and das was approximately 55 36 100 and 100 respectively as for naclo and clo2 both achieved 100 removal for each sulfide after 2 h fig 1 this suggests that the selected sulfides could be effectively removed by the three oxidants especially by naclo and clo2 oxidation the removal of dps and das was significantly higher than that of dmds and deds 3 2 oxidation kinetics of the selected sulfides kinetic experiments were employed to determine the k values of the selected sulfides the results of the kinetic experiments are shown in fig 2 a c and the corresponding k values of dmds deds dps and das are summarized in table 3 the kinetics of oxidation processes could be well described by the second order competitive kinetic model r 2 0 96 0 99 the kinetics of the selected sulfides are determined at three different concentrations of oxidants to consider the applicability of the oxidants from the values of k table 3 the selected sulfides could be effectively removed by all three oxidants of which naclo and clo2 showed much higher efficiency than kmno4 the efficiency followed the order kmno4 clo2 naclo as for the selected sulfides the k values of dps and das were 3 2 11 7 times higher than those of dmds and deds in kmno4 clo2 naclo oxidation experiments table 3 respectively this phenomenon suggests that the single sulfur compounds dps and das were easier to oxidize than the s s containing dmds and deds interestingly the k value of deds was 1 3 1 6 times higher than that of dmds for oxidation by the three oxidants and the k value of das was similar 0 7 1 2 times to that of dps although the side chain length of deds das is longer than that of dmds dps respectively the k value was not significantly affected by the length of the side chain that is the side chain structure does not have much effect on the oxidation rate of small molecule sulfides antonopoulou et al 2014 however the properties of the central s atom clearly determine the removability of small molecular sulfides biard et al 2011 feliers et al 2001 therefore the activity of single sulfur sulfides and s s containing disulfides varied dramatically which leads to different transformation pathways for the selected sulfides these different pathways are worth further exploration 3 3 transformation pathways of the selected sulfides in oxidation processes 3 3 1 kmno4 and naclo oxidation pathways of the selected sulfides in order to explore the oxidation mechanisms of the selected sulfides transformation pathway experiments were conducted the organic transformation products and their pathways were targeted for exploration in this article due to the limited oxidant dosage they are illustrated as follows as a traditional oxidant kmno4 is efficient at oxidizing organic matter inorganic matter and bacteria winter and duckham 2000 it has been widely used in drinking water treatment processes mwh 2005 kainulainen reported that kmno4 might produce transformation products hrudey and charrois 2012 kainulainen et al 1994 as shown in table s1 and fig s1 s2 a series of sulfone transformation products was found during the kmno4 oxidation processes namely dipropyl sulfone c6h14o2s dpso and diamyl sulfone c10h22o2s daso which formed from dps and das respectively fig 3 a shows the area change trend of dps das dpso and daso during kmno4 oxidation with the decrease of dps and das dpso and daso appeared and increased gradually in the reaction systems it was reported that sulfone is difficult to further transform oxidatively in most cases amoozadeh and nemati 2009 and has been determined as a final product in previous literature sun et al 2008 the results of dft calculations confirm that dpso and daso were less nucleophilic than sulfate implying that they are largely inert in the subsequent oxidation process fig s7 therefore dpso and daso could be identified as the final transformation products in the experiments pathway 1 fig 3 c according to the past literature dpso and daso were formed via an initial 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition transforming to a cyclic intermediate jayaraman and east 2011 the s atom of dps and das served as both electron pair donor and electron pair acceptor due to the strong polarity of the s o bond part of the negative net charge was lost and accumulated on the o atom jayaraman and east 2011 then the transformation products dpso and daso were formed daso was also generated in naclo oxidation process fig 3 b exhibits the area changes of das and daso during naclo oxidation daso appeared at 0 25 min then increased with the oxidation of das importantly there were no other transformation products detected in the oxidation processes of dmds deds and dps by naclo table s1 clo hclo and cl2 are the primary oxidative components generated by naclo in the solutions byoun et al 2019 which provide a strong electrophilic attack to oxidize das to daso pathway 2 fig 3 c postigo and richardson 2014 shiozawa 2000 however the yield of daso formed in the naclo oxidation process was much less than that in kmno4 oxidation in the current study from the above results the s s containing dmds and deds were not involved in the formation of sulfone transformation products during oxidation as reported in the literature it is difficult to produce sulfone for sulfides containing a s s structure during oxidation processes bahrami and khodamorady 2018 zhang et al 2019 this meant that 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition could not occur during the oxidation of dmds or deds therefore the s s structure provided a different transformation pathway for dmds and deds compared with the single sulfur compounds dps and das 3 3 2 clo2 oxidation pathways of the selected sulfides in clo2 oxidation process a series of disulfide transformation products could be captured methyl amyl disulfide c6h14s2 mads fig s3 ethyl amyl disulfide c7h16s2 eads fig s4 and diamyl disulfide c10h22s2 dads fig s5 were confirmed as the transformation products table s1 in which the formation of mads and eads was contributed by dmds and deds respectively fig 4 a demonstrates the area changes of the selected sulfides and their transformation products during clo2 oxidation the area of mads eads dads increased with the decrease of dmds deds das respectively on the other hand daso was also formed from das during clo2 oxidation fig 4 b a previous study reported that molecular clo2 clo2 and hclo played important roles during clo2 oxidation gan et al 2019 generally clo2 oxidation starts with abstraction of a single electron from the organic group which then transfers to clo2 and other organic radicals as pathway 3 shows in fig 4 c clo2 transforms to clo2 molecule clo2 and hclo and other effective oxidation components in the reaction systems das was oxidized via electron abstraction and then transformed to daso the above results suggested that the s s structure led dmds and deds to form disulfide transformation products during clo2 oxidation importantly the pathways for the generation of mads eads and dads were different from that of daso formation the recombination reaction was dominant in the formation of disulfide transformation products which is an important pathway during clo2 oxidation sorlini et al 2016 in this process the s c and s s bonds of the sulfides might be broken by clo2 generating alkyl radicals and organic radicals with an s atom lezina et al 2015 then these radicals formed mads eads and dads by recombination reactions lynch et al 1997 overall the results above fully demonstrated that the transformation pathways of s s containing compounds were different compared with single sulfur dps and das dmds and deds easily generated radicals available for subsequent recombination reactions and single sulfur dps and das were prone to transform to sulfone this suggested that the characteristics of the central sulfur atom were a key factor in determining the transformation of selected sulfides on the other hand although the yield of transformation products in kmno4 oxidation was less than that in clo2 oxidation it was greater than that in naclo oxidation 3 4 oxidation mechanism of odorous sulfide compounds by different oxidants 3 4 1 activity analysis of sulfides and oxidants based on the above analysis it could be confirmed that characteristics of the central sulfur atom influenced the activity and transformation of the selected sulfides the previous literature reported that increases in the number of central sulfur atoms could significantly reduce the removal of sulfide in the oxidation process biard et al 2011 feliers et al 2001 the increase in the number of central sulfur atoms leads to s s structure production for dmds and deds alie analysis showed that the nucleophilic region was mainly concentrated around the sulfur atom and formation of the s s structure inhibited the central activity of dmds and deds fig s6 furthermore the cdft analysis demonstrated that the quantified nucleophilicity values of dmds deds dps and das were 0 33 0 31 0 53 and 0 53 position at central sulfur atom table s2 the nucleophilicity of the single sulfur structure was significantly higher than that of the s s structure thus dmds and deds are more difficult to remove owing to the higher energy needed for bond breaking jorgensen 2012 jursic 1997 besides the quantified nucleophilicity located at the ortho carbon varied over a small range 0 04 0 05 table s2 these results further confirmed that the central sulfur atom characteristics are the main contributor to the activity of the selected sulfides as for kmno4 clo2 and naclo cdft revealed that the main active positions of kmno4 clo2 and naclo were o cl and cl respectively table s3 and the electrophilicity of the main active position was quantified as 0 19 0 40 and 0 61 respectively therefore the oxidation capacity of kmno4 clo2 and naclo could be ordered as kmno4 clo2 naclo which supports the results of oxidation kinetics experiments as shown in fig 5 a 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition is difficult for s s structures due to the inhibited nucleophilicity therefore sulfone transformation products formed in the dps and das solutions rather than in the dmds and deds systems clennan et al 1994 lacombe et al 2002 on the other hand kmno4 and clo2 have tetrahedral and v shape conformations respectively providing sufficient oxygen sites for 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition jayaraman and east 2011 as for naclo the strong electrophilicity of the cl atom could provide electron affinity similar to that of the o site table s3 the disulfide transformation product was only formed by a radical recombination reaction in clo2 oxidation fig 5 b this phenomenon was explained by the electrophilicity of kmno4 being lower than that of clo2 and naclo leading kmno4 to form stable covalent bonds associated with the selected sulfides and then to produce sulfone rather than radicals as for naclo due to having the highest electrophilicity among the three oxidants the electrons in the selected sulfides could transfer rapidly to the naclo molecule so they tend to decompose into inorganic products therefore as an electron acceptor with moderate electron affinity clo2 might produce a series of radicals lezina et al 2015 the radicals could form disulfide transformation products via a recombination reaction 3 4 2 transformation products of the selected sulfides the oxidation of sulfides is a multi step process sulfate is the expected transformation product for sulfides during oxidation mora et al 2016 even in some cases where the oxidants are electron acceptors sulfate has been frequently observed as a product cardoso et al 2006 kelly et al 1997 rohwerder et al 2003 however the oxidant dosage is often limited during water treatment therefore the organic intermediate transformation products could still be the major products buisman et al 1990 this phenomenon could be further verified based on the sulfide mass balance analysis in previous studies as indicated sulfide could not be completely transformed to sulfate during reaction with kmno4 hypochlorous acid etc especially when applying the oxidants at dosages less than 1 0 mg l 1 and the yield of sulfate was only around 50 huang et al 2020a 2020b in this study a considerable yield of other forms of s such as sulfone disulfide etc was produced fig 6 exhibits the oxidative transformation of the selected sulfides as determined in this article sulfone could be produced in reactions with the three oxidants and past studies also reported that the single sulfur containing sulfides always transformed easily during the oxidation processes of kmno4 naclo and clo2 bahrami and khodamorady 2018 zhang et al 2019 this suggested that sulfone could be determined as a common transformation product in the oxidation of sulfide on the other hand the disulfide transformation products were mainly produced in the clo2 oxidation processes they were formed via a recombination reaction cantau et al 2007 lynch et al 1997 the alkyl chains in das dmds and deds were oxidized easily to form alkyl radicals and s containing radicals cantau et al 2007 lynch et al 1997 then the alkyl radicals recombined with s containing radicals randomly to form multiple disulfide transformation products in summary the production of sulfone is dependent on the occurrence of 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition it requires not only enough oxidant to provide sufficient o cl sites but also a strong nucleophilicity in the central region of the sulfide the nucleophilicity of the central regions of dmds and deds is weakened by the s s structure which prevents the occurrence of 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition the cl site of clo2 could form radicals via electron transfer generating a series of disulfide transformation products by subsequent recombination reactions 3 5 practical implications fig 7 demonstrates the removal of the selected sulfides in jz raw water it could be seen that the removal of dps and das was again higher than that of dmds and deds this result is consistent with the oxidation kinetics experiments conducted in pure water on the other hand clo2 and naclo achieved 100 removal for the selected sulfides this was also consistent with the results of oxidation treatability experiments kinetic experiments and cdft analysis therefore despite the fact that the oxidation process in jz raw water could be influenced by natural organic matter nom the characteristics of the central sulfur atom remained a major determinant in sulfide removal also the oxidation capacity of the three oxidants still followed the order kmno4 clo2 naclo this could provide an application guide for the removal of sulfide odorants the above discussion also confirmed that the properties of the central sulfur atom influence the oxidative transformation of the selected sulfides sulfate sulfone and disulfide transformation products have been frequently shown to be produced in various oxidation processes the possible major mechanisms of which include recombination addition reactions etc cantau et al 2007 clennan et al 1994 huang et al 2020a 2020b lacombe et al 2002 zhang et al 2019 in addition the type of transformation products of sulfides was shown to be the same in different raw waters huang et al 2020a 2020b the effect of the central sulfur atom properties on the selected sulfides might be intrinsic through comparison of the three oxidants the formation of transformation products was related to the oxidation capacity and the structure of the oxidants firstly the type of transformation products exhibits a different distribution with the increase in the oxidation activity of the three oxidants fig 8 the oxygen rich oxidants such as kmno4 and clo2 readily produce sulfone transformation products secondly kmno4 makes it easy to form covalent bonds with the sulfides and to generate sulfone naclo leads to strong electron affinity and converts sulfide odorants to sulfate while clo2 tends to oxidize the sulfides to radicals naclo oxidation processes produced the fewest sulfone and disulfide transformation products therefore with increasing oxidation capacity the yield of sulfone and disulfide transformation products was first increased and then decreased this suggests that the strong oxidant naclo is effective not only for rapid removal of sulfides but also for reducing the yields of sulfone and disulfide transformation products huang et al 2020a 2020b therefore these results could provide information to guide the oxidative removal of sulfides in which naclo is the most efficient at controlling sulfide odorants among the three studied oxidants 4 conclusions in this study the oxidation performance kinetics and mechanisms of dmds deds dps and das by kmno4 naclo and clo2 were investigated four selected sulfides could be oxidized effectively by the three oxidants the oxidation processes could be well described by the second order kinetic model and the k value of the oxidants followed the order kmno4 clo2 naclo the central sulfur atom characteristics determined the activity and transformation of the selected sulfides the s s structure inhibits the nucleophilicity of dmds and deds therefore the k value of sulfides followed the order dmds deds dps das the sulfone could be produced by 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition reaction in oxidation by kmno4 clo2 and naclo meanwhile recombination reactions proceeded during clo2 oxidation and formed more products including mads dads and eads naclo showed the high oxidation capacity not only due to the rapid removal of sulfide odorants but also because it produced the fewest transformation products these results were verified by dft calculations and tested with jz raw water finally naclo was certified as the most effective oxidant at controlling sulfide odorants in drinking water treatment declaration of competing interest the

17369,swampy septic odor caused by various sulfides is one of the most frequently encountered odor problems in drinking water however even though it is much more offensive few studies have specifically focused on swampy septic odor compared to the extensively studied musty earthy problems in this work four sulfide odorants diamyl sulfide das dipropyl sulfide dps dimethyl disulfide dmds and diethyl disulfide deds were selected to evaluate the treatment performance of different oxidation processes in drinking water the results demonstrated that dmds deds dps and das could be oxidized effectively by kmno4 naclo and clo2 the oxidation processes could be well described by the second order kinetic model in which k values of selected sulfides followed the order dmds deds dps das as for the three oxidants the order of reactivity was kmno4 clo2 naclo which was also verified in raw water the results of oxidation treatability reaction kinetics and mechanisms confirmed that the characteristics of the central sulfur atom rather than the side chain is the decisive factor in controlling the oxidation rate and transformation pathway of sulfides the transformation products and pathways were significantly different for the three oxidants sulfones dpso daso were always formed by cycloaddition reactions during kmno4 oxidation yet recombination reactions proceeded during clo2 oxidation and formed more products such as mads dads and eads density functional theory dft calculations confirmed that the differences in transformation pathways were caused by the variations in the activity of the oxidants and sulfides finally naclo was certified as the most effective oxidant for controlling sulfide odorants in drinking water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sulfides oxidation treatability kinetics transformation pathways mechanisms 1 introduction as an important aesthetic water quality index the issue of taste and odor problems t o has caused growing concern worldwide in recent years suffet et al 1999 watson 2004 yang et al 2008 according to a national survey in china about eighty percent of source water showed odor problems to some extent with musty earthy and swampy septic odors being the dominant ones sun et al 2014 wang et al 2020a sulfide odorants which have been increasingly detected in many important water bodies recently make the major contribution to swampy septic odors wang et al 2019 for example some sulfide odorants including dimethyl trisulfide dmts dimethyl disulfide dmds etc were found to be responsible for the taihu t o issue in 2007 in china yang et al 2008 yu et al 2009 and were further extensively detected in some source waters guo et al 2016 wang et al 2019 strong swampy septic odor events occurred in source water abstracted from the river dee northwest england and groundwater in some areas of perth western australia mainly attributed to volatile organic sulfur compounds voscs like dmds and dmts campbell et al 1994 franzmann et al 2001 with the development of odor recognition and detection methods more and more sulfide odorants have been identified as potential swampy septic odor sources guo et al 2015 besides dmds and dmts some frequently encountered compounds in natural waters include diamyl sulfide das dipropyl sulfide dps and diethyl disulfide deds pang et al 2012 rong et al 2018 watson 2004 moreover abundant evidence shows that both biotic and abiotic processes provide a stable source for the release of sulfide odorants under both oxic and anoxic conditions findlay 2016 watson and jüttner 2017 including the biomethylation and polymerization of thiols chin and lindsay 1994 stets et al 2004 as t os caused by sulfide odorants are increasingly being reported sulfides are having a serious impact on the quality of drinking water around the world numerous complaints are received when unpleasant smells occur in drinking water malleret et al 2003 though much more offensive and intolerable than musty earthy odor due to its unpleasant sensory experiences for consumers mwh 2005 few studies have specifically focused on the source and control of swampy septic odor the conventional treatment processes in water treatment plants including coagulation sedimentation and sand filtration have shown limited efficiency for the control of odor problems hattori 1988 srinivasan and sorial 2011 pretreatment measures like adsorption and oxidation have usually been adopted to address this problem wang et al 2020b specifically activated carbon adsorption has been indicated to be effective for most odor compounds guo et al 2016 however some previous studies indicated that activated carbon had limited efficacy for thioether removal or that high dosages would be needed huang et al 2019 huang et al 2020a 2020b by comparison some oxidation processes proved effective for sulfides such as dmds and dmts adewuyi and carmichael 1986 antonopoulou et al 2014 feliers et al 2001 kastner et al 2003 for instance adewuyi and feliers first proposed the reaction kinetics of dimethyl sulfide dms and dmds in the h2o2 oxidation process adewuyi and carmichael 1986 feliers et al 2001 subsequently kastner developed an oxidation method for the removal of dmds using clo2 in a wet reactor kastner et al 2003 in recent years a few authors have focused on ozone and advanced oxidation processes evaluating the effectiveness of fe2 h2o2 and o3 bac processes in the removal of dmds and deds antonopoulou et al 2014 guo et al 2016 also methyl phenyl sulfide and benzyl 2 propenyl sulfide have been shown to be removed by photocatalytic oxidation processes cantau et al 2007 these results imply that there is potential for the removal of sulfide by way of oxidation and that the removal of sulfide by oxidation is feasible unfortunately the effects mechanisms and kinetics data of commonly used oxidants such as potassium permanganate sodium hypochlorite and chlorine dioxide used in the removal of sulfide in aqueous media are still lacking the water utilities suffer from a lack of credible theories to guide the removal of sulfide compounds in this challenging situation the oxidation treatability kinetics and mechanisms for different oxidants should be compared for different sulfides such as dmds deds dps and das etc in this work dmds deds dps and das as typical swampy septic odor sources were selected for study some frequently used oxidants kmno4 naclo and clo2 were chosen to compare the oxidation processes for dmds deds dps and das the oxidation treatability and kinetics of the processes were evaluated systematically meanwhile the oxidation transformation products of dmds deds dps and das were determined finally the oxidation pathways and mechanisms for three oxidants and sulfides were explored also density functional theory dft was employed to further support and evaluate the oxidation behavior of sulfide and different oxidants the results of the current work will provide theoretical and applicational guidance for the control of sulfide odorants in drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and standards details of the selected sulfides studied in the current work are listed in table 1 dmds deds dps and das standards 97 in methanol were obtained from sigma aldrich ar china kmno4 naclo kh2po4 na2hpo4 na2s2o3 naclo2 and h2so4 were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd ar china nacl was obtained from the beijing chemical works gr china clo2 was prepared by using naclo2 and h2so4 according to standard method 4500 clo2 b apha awwa wef 1995 na2s2o3 0 10 mol l 1 kh2po4 0 20 mol l 1 and na2hpo4 0 20 mol l 1 buffer solutions were prepared by using milli q water the concentration of kmno4 was measured by titration fischbacher et al 2017 the concentration of naclo was calculated as cl2 in this work zhu et al 2014 the concentration of naclo and clo2 was determined by a pocket colorimeter ii hach usa and dr2800 hach usa the milli q water was obtained from an integral 5 system millipore usa all standards and solutions were stored at 4 c in darkness 2 2 experimental procedures the procedures used for the oxidation treatability kinetics and transformation pathway experiments were the same and proceeded as follows the experiments were conducted in 250 ml conical flasks filled with 225 ml milli q water the experiments were further conducted in 225 ml of raw water for comparison taken from jinze reservoir shanghai china a magnetic stirrer was used to mix the reaction solution in the conical flask during the experiments 0 20 mol l 1 of kh2po4 and 0 20 mol l 1 of na2hpo4 were used to adjust the initial ph of the reaction solution to 7 0 0 2 then dmds deds dps and das were added into the reaction solutions to record the initial concentration of the selected sulfides 4 0 ml of the reaction solution was pipetted from the conical flask and marked as the initial sample before oxidation begins after that the oxidant was added into the reaction solution and a timer for recording oxidation time was started at this moment before sampling 1 0 ml of 0 2 mol l 1 na2s2o3 was added into the 20 ml vials to terminate the oxidation reaction in the sample solutions at designed time intervals duplicate samples were withdrawn from the reaction solution and placed in 20 ml vials these samples were capped by using 18 mm preassembled caps cnw uk for subsequent determination some details of the experiments on the treatability kinetics and transformation pathways are as follows oxidation treatability experiments the dosage of oxidant applied in most cases was no more than 1 0 mg l 1 and the oxidation time was no more than 2 h to adopt practically relevant parameters the dosage of the three oxidants was determined as 1 0 mg l 1 to evaluate their capacity to oxidize the selected sulfides within 2 h 2 and 20 μg l 1 each of dmds deds dps and das were selected to evaluate the performance of the three oxidants oxidation kinetics experiments the initial concentrations of dmds deds dps and das were respectively determined as 2 0 2 0 5 0 and 5 0 μg l 1 in kmno4 oxidation 20 20 50 and 50 μg l 1 in naclo and clo2 oxidation the dosage of kmno4 was determined as 0 2 0 5 1 0 mg l 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 mg l 1 for naclo and clo2 the oxidation times were 120 min 10 min 10 min in kmno4 naclo and clo2 oxidation respectively transformation pathway experiments the initial concentration used for the selected sulfides in the transformation pathway experiments was the same as in the kinetic experiments the three oxidants were dosed at 0 1 mg l 1 each time with an intermittent dosing pattern to avoid rapid oxidation and capture the formation trend of transformation products according to results of kinetics tests the maximum oxidation time in the kmno4 naclo and clo2 oxidation processes was 30 min 3 min and 7 min respectively to determine the precursors of disulfides and sulfone transformation products all possible combinations of systems were experimented with table s1 lists the mixtures used in the current study 2 3 determination of kinetics the second order kinetic model was employed to investigate the kinetic constants of the selected sulfides according to the literature chen et al 2019 huizhou et al 2016 ma et al 2012 and the competitive kinetic model was employed to obtain more reliable data the second order kinetic constant k value of dmds was calculated from eq 1 1 c dmds c dmd s 0 e k c t where c dmds and c dmds 0 are the dmds concentrations at different times and the initial concentration c and t are the oxidant concentrations and reaction time on the other hand due to the rapid nature of the reactions with kmno4 naclo and clo2 the oxidation kinetics of these sulfides were ambiguous using the limited data from the oxidation treatability experiments therefore the kinetics were further determined by using a competitive kinetic model in kinetic experiments thus dmds which showed lower activity compared with deds dps and das was chosen as the competitor to calculate k values using eq 2 2 ln s u l f i d e s s u l f i d e s 0 ln d m d s d m d s 0 k s u l f i d e s k d m d s where the k value of the selected sulfides could be determined from a plot of ln sulfides sulfides 0 versus ln dmds dmds0 with k dmds as the slope of the fitted line k sulfides are the k value of and deds dps das 2 4 detection methods dmds deds dps and das were determined by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms gc ms qp2010 plus shimadzu japan combined with solid phase micro extraction spme within 72 h the spme process was completed in the pretreatment device gerstel mülheim an der ruhr germany automatically the separation was performed by a db 5ms column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 mm agilent usa with helium gas at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 to each sample solution 2 g nacl was added in advance and the extraction fiber was 50 30 um dvb car on pdms the specific spme operation conditions were as follows firstly 5 ml samples were shocked at 65 c and extracted by the fiber in 20 ml vials for 30 min then the fiber with the sample was desorbed at the temperature of 250 c for 10 min and injected into the gas chromatograph automatically the temperature program for gc was set as follows initial temperature kept at 40 c for 10 min increased at 8 c min 1 to 120 c then increased at 5 c min 1 to 130 c and then ramped at 15 c min 1 to 250 c for 5 min mass spectrometry conditions were as follows ei source 70 ev ionization voltage electron multiplying voltage 824 v head pressure 50 kpa gc ms interface temperature 280 c ion source temperature 230 c samples were injected in splitless mode blank control experiments were also conducted to evaluate the loss of dmds deds dps and das during the pre concentration process and error bars were used to demonstrate errors in the measurement of the selected sulfides the details of retention time recovery etc of dmds deds dps and das are shown in table 2 the recoveries were all in the range of 93 7 102 9 the full scan mode was employed for determining oxidation transformation products other steps and conditions were same as described above in addition the final solution was diluted to 19 5 ml to extract more transformation products using the spme method in mps gerstel mülheim an der ruhr germany 2 5 computational methodology the orca quantum chemistry package version 4 2 0 neese 2018 was employed for density functional theory dft calculations the results including energies geometries and molecular properties were computed at the b3lyp d3bj ma def2 tzvp level weigend and ahlrichs 2005 zheng et al 2011 dft calculations of dmds deds dps das dpso daso sulfate and three oxidants were carried out before dft calculations the cartesian coordinates of all the species available for subsequent dft calculations were optimized by using the minimize energy function of the mm2 module to obtain the optimal conformation of all the species the opt algorithm was employed in geometry optimizations the solvation model based on density smd water was selected as solvent was employed in all the dft calculations for consideration of the solvent effect the average local ionization energy alie and condensed dft cdft analysis involving wavefunction analysis were obtained by the multiwfn program version 3 7 lu and chen 2012 to obtain the necessary data required for cdft analysis single point energies of all chemicals in n n 1 and n 1 state computed using optimized conformation were calculated at the b3lyp d3bj ma def2 tzvp level the relevant images of the result were mapped by the vmd program version 1 9 3 humphrey et al 1996 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxidation treatability of kmno4 clo2 and naclo the results of oxidation treatability experiments revealed the capacity of kmno4 clo2 and naclo to remove the selected sulfides the removal trends within 2 h are demonstrated in fig 1 a b and the corresponding removal of the selected sulfides after 2 h are shown in fig 1 c from the results in the oxidation process of kmno4 fig 1 the removal of dmds deds dps and das was approximately 55 36 100 and 100 respectively as for naclo and clo2 both achieved 100 removal for each sulfide after 2 h fig 1 this suggests that the selected sulfides could be effectively removed by the three oxidants especially by naclo and clo2 oxidation the removal of dps and das was significantly higher than that of dmds and deds 3 2 oxidation kinetics of the selected sulfides kinetic experiments were employed to determine the k values of the selected sulfides the results of the kinetic experiments are shown in fig 2 a c and the corresponding k values of dmds deds dps and das are summarized in table 3 the kinetics of oxidation processes could be well described by the second order competitive kinetic model r 2 0 96 0 99 the kinetics of the selected sulfides are determined at three different concentrations of oxidants to consider the applicability of the oxidants from the values of k table 3 the selected sulfides could be effectively removed by all three oxidants of which naclo and clo2 showed much higher efficiency than kmno4 the efficiency followed the order kmno4 clo2 naclo as for the selected sulfides the k values of dps and das were 3 2 11 7 times higher than those of dmds and deds in kmno4 clo2 naclo oxidation experiments table 3 respectively this phenomenon suggests that the single sulfur compounds dps and das were easier to oxidize than the s s containing dmds and deds interestingly the k value of deds was 1 3 1 6 times higher than that of dmds for oxidation by the three oxidants and the k value of das was similar 0 7 1 2 times to that of dps although the side chain length of deds das is longer than that of dmds dps respectively the k value was not significantly affected by the length of the side chain that is the side chain structure does not have much effect on the oxidation rate of small molecule sulfides antonopoulou et al 2014 however the properties of the central s atom clearly determine the removability of small molecular sulfides biard et al 2011 feliers et al 2001 therefore the activity of single sulfur sulfides and s s containing disulfides varied dramatically which leads to different transformation pathways for the selected sulfides these different pathways are worth further exploration 3 3 transformation pathways of the selected sulfides in oxidation processes 3 3 1 kmno4 and naclo oxidation pathways of the selected sulfides in order to explore the oxidation mechanisms of the selected sulfides transformation pathway experiments were conducted the organic transformation products and their pathways were targeted for exploration in this article due to the limited oxidant dosage they are illustrated as follows as a traditional oxidant kmno4 is efficient at oxidizing organic matter inorganic matter and bacteria winter and duckham 2000 it has been widely used in drinking water treatment processes mwh 2005 kainulainen reported that kmno4 might produce transformation products hrudey and charrois 2012 kainulainen et al 1994 as shown in table s1 and fig s1 s2 a series of sulfone transformation products was found during the kmno4 oxidation processes namely dipropyl sulfone c6h14o2s dpso and diamyl sulfone c10h22o2s daso which formed from dps and das respectively fig 3 a shows the area change trend of dps das dpso and daso during kmno4 oxidation with the decrease of dps and das dpso and daso appeared and increased gradually in the reaction systems it was reported that sulfone is difficult to further transform oxidatively in most cases amoozadeh and nemati 2009 and has been determined as a final product in previous literature sun et al 2008 the results of dft calculations confirm that dpso and daso were less nucleophilic than sulfate implying that they are largely inert in the subsequent oxidation process fig s7 therefore dpso and daso could be identified as the final transformation products in the experiments pathway 1 fig 3 c according to the past literature dpso and daso were formed via an initial 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition transforming to a cyclic intermediate jayaraman and east 2011 the s atom of dps and das served as both electron pair donor and electron pair acceptor due to the strong polarity of the s o bond part of the negative net charge was lost and accumulated on the o atom jayaraman and east 2011 then the transformation products dpso and daso were formed daso was also generated in naclo oxidation process fig 3 b exhibits the area changes of das and daso during naclo oxidation daso appeared at 0 25 min then increased with the oxidation of das importantly there were no other transformation products detected in the oxidation processes of dmds deds and dps by naclo table s1 clo hclo and cl2 are the primary oxidative components generated by naclo in the solutions byoun et al 2019 which provide a strong electrophilic attack to oxidize das to daso pathway 2 fig 3 c postigo and richardson 2014 shiozawa 2000 however the yield of daso formed in the naclo oxidation process was much less than that in kmno4 oxidation in the current study from the above results the s s containing dmds and deds were not involved in the formation of sulfone transformation products during oxidation as reported in the literature it is difficult to produce sulfone for sulfides containing a s s structure during oxidation processes bahrami and khodamorady 2018 zhang et al 2019 this meant that 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition could not occur during the oxidation of dmds or deds therefore the s s structure provided a different transformation pathway for dmds and deds compared with the single sulfur compounds dps and das 3 3 2 clo2 oxidation pathways of the selected sulfides in clo2 oxidation process a series of disulfide transformation products could be captured methyl amyl disulfide c6h14s2 mads fig s3 ethyl amyl disulfide c7h16s2 eads fig s4 and diamyl disulfide c10h22s2 dads fig s5 were confirmed as the transformation products table s1 in which the formation of mads and eads was contributed by dmds and deds respectively fig 4 a demonstrates the area changes of the selected sulfides and their transformation products during clo2 oxidation the area of mads eads dads increased with the decrease of dmds deds das respectively on the other hand daso was also formed from das during clo2 oxidation fig 4 b a previous study reported that molecular clo2 clo2 and hclo played important roles during clo2 oxidation gan et al 2019 generally clo2 oxidation starts with abstraction of a single electron from the organic group which then transfers to clo2 and other organic radicals as pathway 3 shows in fig 4 c clo2 transforms to clo2 molecule clo2 and hclo and other effective oxidation components in the reaction systems das was oxidized via electron abstraction and then transformed to daso the above results suggested that the s s structure led dmds and deds to form disulfide transformation products during clo2 oxidation importantly the pathways for the generation of mads eads and dads were different from that of daso formation the recombination reaction was dominant in the formation of disulfide transformation products which is an important pathway during clo2 oxidation sorlini et al 2016 in this process the s c and s s bonds of the sulfides might be broken by clo2 generating alkyl radicals and organic radicals with an s atom lezina et al 2015 then these radicals formed mads eads and dads by recombination reactions lynch et al 1997 overall the results above fully demonstrated that the transformation pathways of s s containing compounds were different compared with single sulfur dps and das dmds and deds easily generated radicals available for subsequent recombination reactions and single sulfur dps and das were prone to transform to sulfone this suggested that the characteristics of the central sulfur atom were a key factor in determining the transformation of selected sulfides on the other hand although the yield of transformation products in kmno4 oxidation was less than that in clo2 oxidation it was greater than that in naclo oxidation 3 4 oxidation mechanism of odorous sulfide compounds by different oxidants 3 4 1 activity analysis of sulfides and oxidants based on the above analysis it could be confirmed that characteristics of the central sulfur atom influenced the activity and transformation of the selected sulfides the previous literature reported that increases in the number of central sulfur atoms could significantly reduce the removal of sulfide in the oxidation process biard et al 2011 feliers et al 2001 the increase in the number of central sulfur atoms leads to s s structure production for dmds and deds alie analysis showed that the nucleophilic region was mainly concentrated around the sulfur atom and formation of the s s structure inhibited the central activity of dmds and deds fig s6 furthermore the cdft analysis demonstrated that the quantified nucleophilicity values of dmds deds dps and das were 0 33 0 31 0 53 and 0 53 position at central sulfur atom table s2 the nucleophilicity of the single sulfur structure was significantly higher than that of the s s structure thus dmds and deds are more difficult to remove owing to the higher energy needed for bond breaking jorgensen 2012 jursic 1997 besides the quantified nucleophilicity located at the ortho carbon varied over a small range 0 04 0 05 table s2 these results further confirmed that the central sulfur atom characteristics are the main contributor to the activity of the selected sulfides as for kmno4 clo2 and naclo cdft revealed that the main active positions of kmno4 clo2 and naclo were o cl and cl respectively table s3 and the electrophilicity of the main active position was quantified as 0 19 0 40 and 0 61 respectively therefore the oxidation capacity of kmno4 clo2 and naclo could be ordered as kmno4 clo2 naclo which supports the results of oxidation kinetics experiments as shown in fig 5 a 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition is difficult for s s structures due to the inhibited nucleophilicity therefore sulfone transformation products formed in the dps and das solutions rather than in the dmds and deds systems clennan et al 1994 lacombe et al 2002 on the other hand kmno4 and clo2 have tetrahedral and v shape conformations respectively providing sufficient oxygen sites for 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition jayaraman and east 2011 as for naclo the strong electrophilicity of the cl atom could provide electron affinity similar to that of the o site table s3 the disulfide transformation product was only formed by a radical recombination reaction in clo2 oxidation fig 5 b this phenomenon was explained by the electrophilicity of kmno4 being lower than that of clo2 and naclo leading kmno4 to form stable covalent bonds associated with the selected sulfides and then to produce sulfone rather than radicals as for naclo due to having the highest electrophilicity among the three oxidants the electrons in the selected sulfides could transfer rapidly to the naclo molecule so they tend to decompose into inorganic products therefore as an electron acceptor with moderate electron affinity clo2 might produce a series of radicals lezina et al 2015 the radicals could form disulfide transformation products via a recombination reaction 3 4 2 transformation products of the selected sulfides the oxidation of sulfides is a multi step process sulfate is the expected transformation product for sulfides during oxidation mora et al 2016 even in some cases where the oxidants are electron acceptors sulfate has been frequently observed as a product cardoso et al 2006 kelly et al 1997 rohwerder et al 2003 however the oxidant dosage is often limited during water treatment therefore the organic intermediate transformation products could still be the major products buisman et al 1990 this phenomenon could be further verified based on the sulfide mass balance analysis in previous studies as indicated sulfide could not be completely transformed to sulfate during reaction with kmno4 hypochlorous acid etc especially when applying the oxidants at dosages less than 1 0 mg l 1 and the yield of sulfate was only around 50 huang et al 2020a 2020b in this study a considerable yield of other forms of s such as sulfone disulfide etc was produced fig 6 exhibits the oxidative transformation of the selected sulfides as determined in this article sulfone could be produced in reactions with the three oxidants and past studies also reported that the single sulfur containing sulfides always transformed easily during the oxidation processes of kmno4 naclo and clo2 bahrami and khodamorady 2018 zhang et al 2019 this suggested that sulfone could be determined as a common transformation product in the oxidation of sulfide on the other hand the disulfide transformation products were mainly produced in the clo2 oxidation processes they were formed via a recombination reaction cantau et al 2007 lynch et al 1997 the alkyl chains in das dmds and deds were oxidized easily to form alkyl radicals and s containing radicals cantau et al 2007 lynch et al 1997 then the alkyl radicals recombined with s containing radicals randomly to form multiple disulfide transformation products in summary the production of sulfone is dependent on the occurrence of 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition it requires not only enough oxidant to provide sufficient o cl sites but also a strong nucleophilicity in the central region of the sulfide the nucleophilicity of the central regions of dmds and deds is weakened by the s s structure which prevents the occurrence of 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition the cl site of clo2 could form radicals via electron transfer generating a series of disulfide transformation products by subsequent recombination reactions 3 5 practical implications fig 7 demonstrates the removal of the selected sulfides in jz raw water it could be seen that the removal of dps and das was again higher than that of dmds and deds this result is consistent with the oxidation kinetics experiments conducted in pure water on the other hand clo2 and naclo achieved 100 removal for the selected sulfides this was also consistent with the results of oxidation treatability experiments kinetic experiments and cdft analysis therefore despite the fact that the oxidation process in jz raw water could be influenced by natural organic matter nom the characteristics of the central sulfur atom remained a major determinant in sulfide removal also the oxidation capacity of the three oxidants still followed the order kmno4 clo2 naclo this could provide an application guide for the removal of sulfide odorants the above discussion also confirmed that the properties of the central sulfur atom influence the oxidative transformation of the selected sulfides sulfate sulfone and disulfide transformation products have been frequently shown to be produced in various oxidation processes the possible major mechanisms of which include recombination addition reactions etc cantau et al 2007 clennan et al 1994 huang et al 2020a 2020b lacombe et al 2002 zhang et al 2019 in addition the type of transformation products of sulfides was shown to be the same in different raw waters huang et al 2020a 2020b the effect of the central sulfur atom properties on the selected sulfides might be intrinsic through comparison of the three oxidants the formation of transformation products was related to the oxidation capacity and the structure of the oxidants firstly the type of transformation products exhibits a different distribution with the increase in the oxidation activity of the three oxidants fig 8 the oxygen rich oxidants such as kmno4 and clo2 readily produce sulfone transformation products secondly kmno4 makes it easy to form covalent bonds with the sulfides and to generate sulfone naclo leads to strong electron affinity and converts sulfide odorants to sulfate while clo2 tends to oxidize the sulfides to radicals naclo oxidation processes produced the fewest sulfone and disulfide transformation products therefore with increasing oxidation capacity the yield of sulfone and disulfide transformation products was first increased and then decreased this suggests that the strong oxidant naclo is effective not only for rapid removal of sulfides but also for reducing the yields of sulfone and disulfide transformation products huang et al 2020a 2020b therefore these results could provide information to guide the oxidative removal of sulfides in which naclo is the most efficient at controlling sulfide odorants among the three studied oxidants 4 conclusions in this study the oxidation performance kinetics and mechanisms of dmds deds dps and das by kmno4 naclo and clo2 were investigated four selected sulfides could be oxidized effectively by the three oxidants the oxidation processes could be well described by the second order kinetic model and the k value of the oxidants followed the order kmno4 clo2 naclo the central sulfur atom characteristics determined the activity and transformation of the selected sulfides the s s structure inhibits the nucleophilicity of dmds and deds therefore the k value of sulfides followed the order dmds deds dps das the sulfone could be produced by 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition reaction in oxidation by kmno4 clo2 and naclo meanwhile recombination reactions proceeded during clo2 oxidation and formed more products including mads dads and eads naclo showed the high oxidation capacity not only due to the rapid removal of sulfide odorants but also because it produced the fewest transformation products these results were verified by dft calculations and tested with jz raw water finally naclo was certified as the most effective oxidant at controlling sulfide odorants in drinking water treatment declaration of competing interest the
