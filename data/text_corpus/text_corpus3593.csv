17965,sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes sr aops show a good prospect for effective elimination of organic contaminants in water due to the powerful oxidation capability and good adaptability of sulfate radical so4 however great concerns have been raised on occurrence of the carcinogenic byproduct bromate bro3 in sr aops the present article aims to provide a critical review on bro3 formation during bromine br containing water oxidation by various sr aops potential reaction mechanisms are elaborated mainly involving the sequential oxidation of bromide br by so4 to br containing radicals e g bromine atom br and then to hypobromous acid hypobromite hobr obr which acts as the requisite intermediate for bro3 formation some key influencing factors on bro3 formation are discussed particularly dissolved organic matter dom as a component ubiquitously present in aquatic environments shows a significant suppression effect on bro3 formation primarily attributed to the reduction of br by dom to br the reaction of br with dom can hardly produce organic brominated byproducts while their formation is mainly due to the bromination of hobr obr generated through nonradical pathways such as the direct reaction of br with oxidants e g peroxymonosulfate pms or other reactive species derived from catalytic activators e g co iii in the co ii pms process the debromination of brominated pollutants during their oxidation by so4 results in the release of br which however is not further transformed to bro3 until coexisting organic matters are mineralized nearly completely furthermore possible strategies for control of bro3 formation in sr aops as well as the future research needs are proposed graphical abstract image 10091 keywords sulfate radical bromate dissolved organic matter brominated pollutants control strategies 1 introduction bromide ion br exists ubiquitously in natural waters with a level significantly varying with the water source the concentration of br is usually in a range of 10 to 1000 μg l in fresh waters and an elevated br level is occasionally found in particular ground and surface waters associated with local geological situations ocean water infiltration and anthropogenic activities e g potassium and coal mining heeb et al 2014 von gunten and hoigne 1994 in seawater br concentration is around 67 mg l the widespread existence of br as well as its high levels bring a potential risk of generating the undesired byproduct bromate bro3 in water and wastewater treatment bro3 is well known as a probable human carcinogen world health organization 1990 and its maximum contaminant level in drinking water is set to be 10 μg l in china the united states and europe delker et al 2006 beltrán et al 2002 the earliest concern for bro3 formation in water treatment originates from the ozonation and ozone o3 based advanced oxidation processes aops such as o3 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and uv o3 combined processes where hydroxyl radical ho is generated as a cooperative oxidative component von gunten 2003 collivignarelli and sorlini 2004 ratpukdi et al 2011 the formation mechanism of bro3 in these processes has been well investigated and recorded by von gunten and his coworkers mainly attributing to two pathways i the oxidation of br to the intermediate hypobromous acid hypobromite hobr obr and then to bro3 by o3 and or ho and ii the reaction of ho with br to form bromine atom br which is directly oxidized by o3 to form bromine oxide radical bro and finally to bro3 bypassing hobr obr von gunten and hoigne 1994 von gunten and oliveras 1998 pinkernell and von gunten 2001 further fischbacher et al 2015 demonstrated that o3 reacted with bromite bro2 not by the previously assumed mechanism via o transfer but via electron transfer to form bro3 meanwhile the electron transfer process also yielded the ozonide radical anion o3 which reacted with h2o molecule to generate ho and thus promoted bro3 formation in ozonation the comprehensive reaction scheme for bro3 formation in ozonation and o3 based aops is presented in fig 1 in recent decades sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes sr aops have gained increasing attention as an alternative to conventional water treatment technologies oh et al 2016 matzek and carter 2016 wang and wang 2018 so4 possesses one unpaired electron in the outermost open shell of electrons and thus is highly reactive toward various organic compounds e g pesticides pharmaceuticals dyes aromatics and perfluorocarboxylic acids matzek and carter 2016 wang and wang 2018 wacławek et al 2017 typically so4 is generated via activation of persulfates i e peroxodisulfate pds or peroxymonosulfate pms by various methods such as heat ji et al 2015 alkaline peng et al 2017 furman et al 2010 2011 ultrasound su et al 2012 uv liu et al 2013 luo et al 2016 microwave qi et al 2014 transition metal ions or oxides guo et al 2013 saputra et al 2013 and metal free carbocatalysts lee et al 2016 guan et al 2017a 2017b 2018 most of these methods are applicable in wastewater treatment fields to achieve fast degradation and mineralization of contaminants in addition to large amounts of laboratory experiments some field scale studies have been conducted to examine the feasibility of sr aops in practical wastewater plants matzek and carter 2016 ike et al 2018 for instance chou et al 2015 successfully applied microwave assisted heat activation of pds to treat landfill leachate where a 79 4 total organic carbon toc removal and 88 4 color removal were achieved within 30 min at microwave power of 550 w and 85 c also both bench and field scale studies have been carried out to reveal that persulfates activated by heat alkaline and iron are good in situ chemical oxidation isco technologies for remediation of contaminated groundwaters ike et al 2018 tsitonaki et al 2010 moreover studies have suggested the promising application potential of sr aops e g uv persulfates and persulfates combined with heterogeneous metal or nonmetal catalysts in the field of drinking water treatment owing to the unique advantages of persulfates over other oxidants including their great stability high solubility relatively low cost and the ease of storage handling and transportation wacławek et al 2017 ike et al 2018 however similar to o3 based oxidation processes bro3 formation during treatment of bromine br containing waters by sr aops is observed in recent studies since fang and shang 2012 first reported the formation of bro3 from br oxidation by uv pds process a great deal of work has been done to probe into the formation potential and mechanism of bro3 in various sr aops in the presence of br which is quite complex and varies with the specific catalytic oxidation processes in these studies various influencing factors e g solution ph dosages of oxidants or catalysts and coexisting water matrices on bro3 formation are evaluated particularly dissolved organic matter dom as a component ubiquitously present in aquatic environments is demonstrated to have a significant suppression effect on bro3 formation in sr aops fang and shang 2012 lutze et al 2014 liu et al 2018 li et al 2015 but the suppression mechanism has been a controversial issue in addition bro3 is possibly formed during oxidation of brominated organic compounds by so4 where the release of inorganic br i e debromination occurs concurrently which also receives much attention in recent studies ji et al 2016 luo et al 2019 2020 currently a few review articles of sr aops have been published most of which focus on the physicochemical properties of persulfates wacławek et al 2017 various activation methods ghanbari and moradi 2017 oh et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 generation mechanisms of so4 as well as application of sr aops for removal of organic contaminants in water matzek and carter 2016 wang and wang 2018 tsitonaki et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 however information involving bro3 formation by various sr aops is very limited in these reviews ike et al 2019 recently reviewed the formation of oxidation byproducts during dom degradation by different oxidation processes where bro3 formation in sr aops was partially summarized so it is necessary to provide a comprehensive assessment on bro3 formation by sr aops to fill the knowledge gap and also to provide useful guidelines for research and practical application of sr aops in this work an overview of the recently published studies on bro3 formation during oxidation of br in various sr aops such as uv pds heat pms co ii pms and o3 pms processes is given firstly section 2 then the effect of dom on bro3 formation by sr aops has been emphatically discussed in order to harmonize the contradictory influencing mechanisms section 3 the potential formation of bro3 during treatment of brominated pollutants by sr aops is also elaborated section 4 finally possible strategies for controlling the bro3 formation in sr aops as well as the further research needs are proposed sections 5 6 2 formation of bro3 by sr aops in the absence of dom 2 1 uv pds oxidation process uv radiation of pds has been widely used to generate so4 for destruction of recalcitrant organic contaminants in water luo et al 2016 yang et al 2018 because it is environment friendly and relatively easy to operate fang and shang 2012 investigated the transformation of inorganic bromine species in uv pds process under various experimental conditions it was found that the oxidation of br by uv pds led to a significant formation of bro3 which was not observed in the presence of uv or pds alone the level of bro3 formation was highly dependent on reaction conditions for instance under the uv intensity of 2 19 μe l 1 s 1 and ph 7 bro3 concentration derived from 20 μm initial br increased from 1 16 to 20 μm with pds dosage increasing from 20 to 500 μm in 20 min table 1 within a lower br concentration range 0 1 5 μm bro3 formation rate increased with the increase of initial br concentration and all of the dosed br was converted to bro3 in 20 min while within a high concentration range 10 50 μm raising the initial br concentration had a slight effect on bro3 formation moreover bro3 formation was more favorable in neutral and slightly acidic ph conditions e g ph 4 7 compared to alkaline ph conditions e g 8 and 9 the authors also examined the formation of bro3 in br 20 μm spiked real water and found that bro3 formation in real water was much lower compared to that in synthetic water under the identical condition after 20 min 65 and 100 conversion of br 20 μm to bro3 was achieved respectively in the real water and the synthetic water at the pds dosage of 500 μm results of verification experiments suggested that dom rather than chloride cl or alkalinity in real water was responsible for the reduction of bro3 formation which would be detailed in the following discussion section 3 3 by establishing an empirical model with respect to hobr obr and bro3 formation it was revealed that the formation of bro3 by uv pds was primarily driven by so4 while direct uv photolysis of hobr obr to form bro3 was negligible based on the fairly constant mass balance of inorganic bromine including br hobr obr and bro3 the authors proposed that hobr obr was the key intermediate during the formation of bro3 by so4 which was generated via the sequential oxidation of br to bromine atom br and then to dibromide radical br2 the comprehensive reactions for bro3 formation from br oxidation by so4 are summarized in table 2 and the simplified reaction scheme is presented in fig 2 the solid lines 2 2 co ii pms oxidation process li et al 2015 investigated the kinetics of br oxidation and bro3 formation in co ii pms process and suggested that bro3 formation was a two step process involving hobr obr as the requisite intermediate and bro3 as the final product similar to the result obtained in uv pds process in the first step in addition to the known oxidation of br to hobr obr by so4 co iii produced through the oxidation of co ii by pms and so4 also contributed to the transformation of br to hobr obr table 3 the second step in which bro3 was formed from hobr obr was mainly attributed to so4 while co iii was unable to further oxidize hobr obr the model simulation revealed that the co iii pathway outweighed the so4 pathway in the first step resulting in more accumulation of hobr obr in co ii pms process compared to that in uv pds process similar to the case of br hou et al 2018 demonstrated that co iii played a significant role in the oxidation of cl to hypochlorous acid hypochlorite hocl ocl while so4 was important for the subsequent oxidation of hocl ocl to chlorate clo3 in co ii pms process the simplified reaction scheme for bro3 formation from br oxidation by both so4 and co iii is presented in fig 2 the solid and dot lines respectively it was observed that bro3 formation gradually increased with the increase of pms dosage the bro3 yield was around 8 μm 40 transformation of initial br 20 μm at 30 min in the presence of 50 μm pms and 20 μm co ii at ph 4 2 while 100 of the dosed br was oxidized to bro3 in 20 min as the pms dosage increased to 500 μm table 1 besides increasing the co ii dosage and initial br concentration also enhanced bro3 formation and neutral ph e g 6 3 was the most favorable to bro3 formation notably the formation of hobr obr was also observed in the absence of the activator co ii suggesting that pms per se was able to convert br to hobr obr due to its higher redox potential hso4 hso5 1 82 v than that of hobr obr br hobr 1 338v rastogi et al 2009 nevertheless hobr obr formation by pms alone was significantly slower compared to that observed by co ii pms process the second order rate constant of br reaction with pms was determined to be 0 17 m 1 s 1 which was 10 orders of magnitude lower than that of its reaction with so4 3 5 109 m 1 s 1 liu et al 2015 no further transformation of hobr obr to bro3 occurred in the presence of pms alone furthermore li et al 2015 also reported that the formation of bro3 in ag i pds fe ii pms and fe ii pds processes was insignificant probably attributed to the precipitation of agbr the chemical reduction by ferrous ions as well as insufficient radical generation 2 3 heat pms oxidation process huang et al 2017 examined the formation of bro3 during treatment of br by heat pms process where both so4 and ho were generated and made a contribution they found that higher temperatures significantly promoted the formation of bro3 primarily due to the strengthened generation of so4 and ho by the breaking down of pms at the pms dosage of 200 μm and ph 7 0 28 1 31 and 1 57 μm bro3 was formed from br 20 μm in 120 min at 60 70 and 80 c respectively table 1 the increase of solution ph had a positive effect on bro3 formation contrary to the cases of uv pds and co ii pms oxidation for instance under the condition of 200 μm pms and 80 c the formed bro3 concentration was 0 11 1 55 and 2 45 μm at ph 5 7 and 9 respectively by monitoring the decomposition of pms at different ph values the author explained that base catalyzed hydrolysis of pms led to higher levels of radicals and thus facilitated the oxidation of br to bro3 2 4 o3 pms oxidation process a novel aop combining o3 with pms which simultaneously produces so4 and ho to enhance the removal of organic pollutants has been proposed in recent studies govindan et al 2014 yang et al 2015 thereafter wen et al 2018 investigated the bro3 formation during treatment of br containing water by the o3 pms process their results demonstrated that the o3 pms process produced significantly higher concentrations of bro3 compared to o3 alone treatment effects of several important parameters e g pms dosage br concentration and solution ph were evaluated in their study at the o3 dosage of 1 135 mg min the initial br concentration of 25 μm and ph 7 bro3 concentration formed in 25 min increased from 3 97 to 12 60 μm with pms dosage increasing from 0 to 300 μm table 1 moreover bro3 formation was strengthened with the initial br concentration increasing from 2 to 10 μm and nearly all of the initial br was oxidized in 25 min while no significant change of bro3 formation was observed as br was in a high concentration range of 10 50 μm the elevated ph resulted in a larger amount of bro3 formation irrespective of pms dosage which was mainly attributed to the accelerated o3 decomposition to generate more radicals by monitoring the evolution of inorganic bromine species i e br hobr obr and bro3 at various ph values the intermediate role of hobr obr was confirmed in agreement with the aforementioned sr aops further the effect of radical scavengers on bro3 formation was evaluated methanol ma was a frequently used quenching reagent for so4 and ho k so4 1 23 107 m 1 s 1 k ho 2 8 108 m 1 s 1 and tert butanol tba was a quenching reagent for ho k ho 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 k so4 2 0 106 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 it was observed that the formation of bro3 was greatly inhibited by addition of ma or tba and the inhibitory effect was more significant in the former case this result indicated that both so4 and ho were responsible for the strengthened bro3 formation in the o3 pms process in addition the oxidative conversion of br or hobr obr by o3 alone to produce bro3 was observed but at a much slower rate compared to the o3 pms process suggesting that o3 also contributed to the formation of bro3 these results clearly confirmed the importance role of so4 ho and molecular o3 in bro3 formation by the o3 pms process additional reactions involved in transformation of bromine species by ho and o3 are presented in table 4 and the reaction scheme is presented in fig 2 the dashed lines as well 3 formation of bro3 by sr aops in the presence of dom dom is a complex mixture of aliphatic and aromatic molecules containing a variety of functional groups richard et al 2007 chen et al 2003 which plays a complicated role in transformation of br as well as bro3 formation by sr aops for instance the presence of dom can cause the decrease of br oxidation rate due to its scavenging effect for radicals besides dom is closely associated with the formation of organic brominated oxidation byproducts br obps attributed to its reaction with reactive bromine species rbs generated from br oxidation by so4 the electron transfer reaction between so4 and some functional groups of dom e g aromatic ketone ester and aliphatic yields organic radicals which are further transformed to generate peroxy radical roo singlet oxygen 1o2 or superoxide o2 lutze et al 2014 rao and hayon 1974 bank and juckett 1976 these reactive species may also influence the transformation of bromine species by sr aops therefore understanding the reactivity of dom with so4 as well as rbs is of great importance for investigating the bro3 formation by sr aops in the presence of dom 3 1 reaction of dom with so4 lutze et al 2015 experimentally determined the rate constant of 6 8 103 l mgc 1 s 1 for so4 with one humic acid ha typically used as the model dom depur from carl roth by a competition kinetics method which was basically identical with the data reported by zhou et al 2017 1 86 103 l mgc 1 s 1 recently zhang et al 2019 investigated the reactivity of four chromophoric dom with so4 and a higher rate constant at the magnitude of 108 m 1 s 1 was obtained compared to the data previously reported i e 107 m 1 s 1 the difference could be attributed to the fact that zhang et al only measured the conceptually isolated fast reacting moieties of dom i e electron donating group substituted aromatic structures rather than the bulk dom i e a combination of both fast and slow reacting moieties of dom by recording the changes in ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uva254 electron donating capacity edc fluorescence intensity fi and toc zhang et al 2019 further demonstrated that so4 induced oxidation of dom primarily its electron donating group substituted aromatic structures was initiated by single electron transfer or addition the subsequent attack on hydroxylated c centered radical cations by so4 led to formation of ring opening products and the decarboxylation of carboxyl groups that were newly formed or originally incorporated within dom structures was responsible for the eventual removal of toc in other words dom was mineralized by so4 through multi step reactions during which the change of dom molecular structures occurred lu et al 2016 also observed the structural reconfiguration of dom during treatment by sr aops including the heat pds and co ii pms processes moreover they proposed that this change led to a great increase in the reactivity of dom toward rbs and thus its br obps formation potential in their study significant formation of br obps e g bromoform and brominated acetic acids was observed during oxidation of o phthalic acid pa that was used as a model compound by so4 in the presence of br while pa per se could not react with hobr obr directly to form these brominated byproducts due to the absence of reactive phenolic moieties further they demonstrated that the phenolic intermediate salicylic acid sa was generated through oxidation of pa by so4 which acted as the direct substrate for bromination and formation of br obps similar in situ generation of phenolic functionalities occurred when dom was exposed to so4 mainly through the conversion of carboxylic substituents on aromatics to hydroxyl groups thus the br obps formation potential of dom subjected to so4 treatment was increased significantly it was noted that the main brominating reagent involved in sr aops was the nonradical halogen oxidant hobr obr rather than br containing radicals e g br and br2 which would be further detailed in the following section section 3 2 3 2 reaction of rbs with dom interestingly an inorganic bromine balance during br oxidation by so4 in the presence of dom was observed in both studies of lutze et al 2014 and liu et al 2018 namely no organic br obps were detected in this process this observation implied that dom reacted with rbs primarily br containing radicals generated from reaction of br with so4 probably via an electron transfer pathway rather than an addition reaction the former resulted in the reduction of these br containing radicals back to br while the latter induced organic br obps formation this was contrary to the widely accepted opinion that the direct incorporation of br into dom made a significant contribution to the formation of organic br obps for instance wang et al 2014 reported that considerable amounts of organic br obps were produced during treatment of various dom isolates and model compounds by cufe2o4 activated pms process in the presence of br similar results were also obtained in the studies by lu et al 2015 and liu et al 2015 where heat pds and co ii pms processes were employed to generate so4 respectively this discrepancy might be attributed to the contribution of hobr obr which could be generated by further transformation of br containing radicals by so4 direct oxidation of br by pms as well as reactions of br with other reactive species derived from the catalytic activators e g cu iii for the cufe2o4 pms process and co iii for the co ii pms process previous studies have widely reported that hobr obr has a high reactivity with electron rich organic compounds e g phenols and amines and the reaction occurs mainly via the electrophilic substitution and or addition pathway heeb et al 2014 acero et al 2005 resulting in significant formation of br obps in fact the concept that direct incorporation of halide atoms x into dom results in the formation of organic x obps has been largely denied in recent studies for instance wang et al 2019 found that the level of adsorbable organohalides aox formed during treatment of the lake ontario water by uv cl2 process was very close to that by cl2 alone at ph 8 0 while at ph 6 5 the uv cl2 process resulted in more formation of aox than the chlorination it was demonstrated that the uv cl2 oxidation at ph 6 5 tended to be dominated by ho whereas oxidation at ph 8 was dominated by reactive chlorine species rcs this result meant that the rcs might not be the main contributor to aox formation and instead the impact of uv cl2 on aox formation was due to the generation of ho which presumably reacted with dom to improve their reactivity towards cl2 similarly another study by wang et al 2015 also reported that there was little increase in aox formation by uv cl2 process at ph 8 5 where rcs was presumed to predominate compared to the chlorination in the full scale experiments moreover the authors comparatively investigated the impact of uv cl2 and uv h2o2 pretreatment on x obps e g trihalomethane and haloacetic acids formation potential and they found that the uv cl2 pretreatment increased the formation potential of x obps to an extent approximate to that observed in the case of uv h2o2 pretreatment so they proposed that chlorine radical cl as a strong oxidant made the x obps precursors i e dom more readily react with cl2 to form x obps while its direct incorporation into dom was negligible moreover lei et al 2019 examined the rate constants and mechanisms for the reactions of cl and dichloride radical cl2 with trace organic contaminants by tracking the formation of transient intermediates it was demonstrated that the reaction of cl with organics involved multiple reaction mechanisms including addition h abstraction and single electron transfer among them the single electron transfer pathway made a predominant contribution to the overall transformation of organics by cl while cl addition played a less important role by contrast cl2 reacted with most organics mainly via a single electron transfer pathway recently ike et al 2019 have published a review to emphasize the opinion that direct incorporation of x into dom can hardly contribute to the formation of x obps while the major halogenating agent is hypohalous acid hypohalite hox ox 3 3 effect of dom on bro3 formation as mentioned above section 2 1 fang and shang 2012 demonstrated that bro3 formation during br oxidation by uv pds process was dramatically suppressed in the presence of dom and they attributed this to the scavenging of rbs by dom to produce organic br obps this would lead to a deficient inorganic bromine balance and organic br obps formation however the relevant data was not available in their study lutze et al 2014 also reported the dom induced suppression of bro3 formation in uv pds process but they observed an inorganic bromine balance this result clearly ruled out the possibility that the reaction of dom with rbs to generate br obps inhibited bro3 formation alternatively they proposed that o2 generated via a sequence of reactions between so4 and aromatic moieties of dom reduced rbs e g hobr obr and br2 to br eqs 1 4 in table 5 accounting for the suppressed bro3 formation wang et al 2020 investigated the transformation of br during the degradation of a model contaminant diethyl phthalate dep by heat pds process in their study the formation of bro3 exhibited a lag phase and a higher concentration of dep or the addition of dom led to the prolongation of bro3 formation lag phase and also decreased the bro3 yield in the secondary phase they attributed this to the reason that i the scavenging of so4 by organic matters resulted in less so4 accessible for the oxidation of br and hobr obr and ii the reaction between organic matters and so4 yielded o2 which reacted with bromine intermediates to decrease their levels this was generally consistent with the conclusion of lutze et al 2014 liu et al 2018 investigated the evolution of bro3 during br oxidation by uv pds process in the presence of oxalate a dom model compound where a biphasic kinetics of bro3 formation was observed for instance in the presence of 100 μm oxalate bro3 was not formed during reaction of br 17 5 μm with pds 200 μm under uv irradiation in the initial 20 min lag phase and then quickly increased to 12 μm from 20 to 60 min secondary phase moreover the formation rate of bro3 in the secondary phase was relatively slower than that in the control 12 μm vs 17 5 μm in 40 min based on the kinetic simulation they suggested that the scavenging of so4 by oxalate contributed little to the suppression of bro3 formation while the scavenging of br and br2 primarily the former by oxalate to regenerate br played an important role eqs 5 and 6 in table 5 in addition they demonstrated that o2 formed from the reaction of oxalate with br rather than the reaction of oxalate with so4 eqs 5 7 in table 5 partly accounted for bro3 suppression as well a similar inhibitory effect on bro3 formation was also observed in the presence of other dom model compounds e g l tyrosine phenol tert butanol critic acid and methanol it was noted that the inorganic bromine almost kept balance in the presence of these model compounds and the amounts of total organic bromine tobr formed were always 1 of total bromine which was in good agreement with the result of lutze et al 2014 in one word the electron transfer reaction of dom with br to generate br inhibits its further transformation to hobr obr and eventually to bro3 which can be the most reasonable explanation for the non formation of br obps as well as the suppressed formation of bro3 in sr aops in the presence of dom 4 formation of bro3 during brominated pollutants oxidation by sr aops besides the naturally existing br the debromination of brominated organic compounds during their oxidative treatment by so4 is an important source of br which also poses a potential risk of producing bro3 table 1 summarizes the reported bro3 formation during oxidation of brominated pollutants by various sr aops 4 1 co ii pms oxidation process ji et al 2016 investigated the degradation of tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa and the evolution of inorganic bromine species in the co ii pms process in their study a series of tbbpa oxidation intermediates by so4 were identified and especially the formation of 2 4 6 tribromophenol suggested that both debromination and bromination reactions occurred indeed the release of br along with the degradation of tbbpa was observed while no bro3 was detected during the reaction this result was seemingly in agreement with the aforementioned phenomenon that the presence of dom suppressed the formation of bro3 in sr aops in other words br generated from oxidation of the released br by so4 could react with the existing organic matters including parent tbbpa and its degradation intermediates via an electron transfer pathway leading to the reduction of br back to br so the further oxidation of br to form bro3 was unsupported until the coexisting organic matters were mineralized nearly completely moreover bromination reactions as evidenced by the formation of 2 4 6 tribromophenol were primarily attributed to hobr obr generated through reaction of br with pms and or co iii table 3 4 2 cufe2o4 pms oxidation process ding et al 2013 investigated the debromination of tbbpa and formation of bro3 in cufe2o4 magnetic nanoparticles activated pms system in the presence of 1 5 mm pms and 0 1 g l cufe2o4 tbbpa at an initial concentration of 10 mg l 18 4 μm was fast degraded by so4 after 180 min a high concentration of br 44 8 μm was observed while the concentration of bro3 was only 6 4 μm table 1 according to the linear relationship between the pseudo first order rate constant k obs of tbbpa oxidation vs pms concentration obtained in that study tbbpa oxidation rate was estimated to be 0 9005 min 1 so the k obs value for br oxidation by the cufe2o4 pms process was calculated to be approximately 0 06 min 1 based on the second order rate constants of so4 with tbbpa 5 27 1010 m 1 s 1 ji et al 2016 and with br 3 5 109 m 1 s 1 redpath and willson 1975 in this regard it could be speculated that br once released from tbbpa would be quickly oxidized by so4 with a short half life period of 11 min resulting in significant formation of bro3 the observed low yield of bro3 during reaction of tbbpa with the cufe2o4 pms process might be associated with the presence of a large number of tbbpa oxidation intermediate products as detected in that study these products inhibited the oxidation of br to br due to their competition for so4 and also reacted with the resulting br to induce its reduction to br 4 3 uv pds oxidation process our recent study examined the potential formation of bro3 during oxidation of 2 4 bromophenol 2 4 dbp by uv pds process luo et al 2019 in the presence of 500 μm pds and under uv irradiation br was released along with the degradation of 2 4 dbp 1 μm and its concentration increased quickly to the maximum 2 μm at 5 min and then decreased gradually bro3 formation was not observed in the first 10 min after which its concentration rapidly increased and the complete conversion of br to bro3 was achieved at 50 min the biphasic kinetics of bro3 formation were well consistent with that observed by liu et al 2018 the lag phase could be reasonably explained by the fact that 2 4 dbp and its degradation intermediates acting as the organic matters scavenged br that was generated through reaction of so4 with br released from 2 4 dbp and thus inhibited its transformation to bro3 sun et al 2019 investigated the oxidative debromination of 2 2 bis bromomethyl 1 3 propanediol bbmp and the corresponding formation of organic and inorganic brominated byproducts by uv pds process their results revealed that the debromination of bbmp by uv pds process occurred over a wide ph range of 4 0 12 0 and the rate increased with increasing ph from 4 0 to 9 0 and remained relatively constant at ph 9 0 and 12 0 meanwhile bro3 was formed during the oxidative debromination of bbmp which displayed a lag phase behind the br formation similar to the observation by luo et al 2019 although a higher br concentration was observed at alkaline ph values bro3 formation was remarkably decreased with increasing ph from 6 0 to 12 0 this was mainly due to the reason that i the alkaline condition induced the conversion of so4 to ho which reacted with br 1 1 109 m 1 s 1 at a lower rate than so4 3 5 109 m 1 s 1 and ii the scavenging of br by oh eq 9 in table 4 inhibited its further oxidation to hobr obr 4 4 uv pms oxidation process luo et al 2020 reported that br released from 2 4 dbp oxidation by uv pms process was converted stepwise to hobr obr and finally to bro3 which also exhibited the biphasic kinetics as observed in 2 4 dbp transformation by uv pds process in the presence of 100 μm pms no bro3 was formed in the first 40 min and only 0 7 μm bro3 was formed after 60 min increasing pms dosage from 100 to 500 μm led to the shortening of bro3 formation lag phase from 40 to 5 min and a higher bro3 yield 2 μm in the secondary phase the longer lag phase of bro3 formation was observed at higher initial 2 4 dbp concentrations but the formation rate and yield of bro3 were promoted the increase of ph value from 5 to 9 resulted in a significant decrease of bro3 yield for instance nearly 100 initial bromine in 2 4 dbp was transformed to bro3 at ph 5 after 40 min reaction while no bro3 was detected at ph 9 table 1 the authors suggested that at higher ph values oh scavenged br generated from br oxidation by radicals to form broh which led to less transformation of br to hobr obr and thus inhibited the bro3 formation in agreement with the result by sun et al 2019 the presence of cl significantly reduced the formation of bro3 after 60 min the bro3 concentration formed from 2 4 dbp 1 μm oxidation was 2 1 12 and 1 27 μm at cl concentration of 0 1 and 5 mm respectively table 1 this was attributed to the competition of cl vs the released br for reactive radicals as well as the enhanced conversion of so4 to ho and rcs by cl it was noted that fang and shang 2012 reported the little effect of cl on bro3 formation by uv pds process the discrepancy between these two studies could be explained by the difference in cl levels 1 5 mm in luo s study vs 0 286 mm in fang s study in addition the presence of dom reduced and retarded the bro3 formation during 2 4 dbp oxidation by uv pms process as expected 5 control strategies on bro3 formation over the past few years studies although limited have been conducted on development of effective strategies for controlling bro3 formation in sr aops a brief summary of these control strategies and their performances is presented in table 6 5 1 addition of chlorine and ammonia in conventional ozonation bro3 formation can be minimized by several control options involving ammonia nh3 addition and the chlorine ammonia cl2 nh3 combined pretreatment strategies von gunten 2003 pinkernell and von gunten 2001 buffle et al 2004 following a similar perspective ling et al 2018 evaluated the performance of nh3 addition cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies on controlling bro3 formation in a sr aop i e the co ii pms process at a low ph of 4 where the activation of pms by co ii to generate so4 was the most effective the addition of nh3 retarded bro3 formation but only at a lesser reduction level for instance 50 μm nh3 led to about 9 5 decrease of bro3 yield after 20 min reaction at the condition of br co ii and pms dosages of 5 20 and 200 μm respectively table 6 the influence of nh3 addition on bro3 formation was mainly due to its fast reaction with the intermediate hobr to form bromamine nh2br eq 1 in table 7 which did not participate in bro3 formation pinkernell and von gunten 2001 the low efficiency of this method in preventing bro3 formation by co ii pms process was mainly attributed to the protonation of nh3 at ph 4 99 99 as nh4 which did not react with hobr by contrast both the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment at cl2 and nh3 dosages of 15 and 50 μm reduced more than 95 bro3 formation in 20 min at the identical reaction condition to that of nh3 addition i e 5 μm br 20 μm co ii and 200 μm pms table 6 with the latter being more superior over the former in the cl2 nh3 pretreatment process hocl was firstly added to the br containing water to oxidize br to hobr obr and an excessive amount of nh3 was subsequently added to scavenge hobr and the remaining hocl to form nh2br and nh2cl respectively eqs 1 3 in table 7 in nh3 cl2 pretreatment nh3 was stably present in br containing water after addition because the two components did not react hocl was added to fast react with nh3 in excess and br to form nh2cl and hobr eqs 2 and 3 in table 7 subsequently nh2cl scavenged the remaining br and hobr to form nh2br and nhbrcl eqs 4 and 5 in table 7 the authors established a kinetic model to simulate the concentrations of various compounds involved in cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment processes e g hocl nh3 nh2cl nh2br nhbr2 and nhbrcl the simulation results revealed that at the same pair of hocl and nh3 concentrations the formed nh2cl concentration after the nh3 cl2 pretreatment was always higher compared to that after the cl2 nh3 pretreatment moreover similar inhibition performances of bro3 formation were observed when similar amounts of nh2cl were generated in the two pretreatment processes the association between the nh2cl concentration and the inhibition performance suggested that nh2cl was the key species contributing to the inhibited bro3 formation which effectively outcompeted so4 to react with hobr to form nhbrcl eq 5 in table 7 5 2 addition of h2o2 previous studies have reported that no bro3 is formed during br oxidation by uv h2o2 process where ho is generated as the only oxidant von gunten and oliveras 1998 symons and zheng 1997 this is attributed to the fact that ho oxidizes br to br and eventually to hobr which is again reduced by h2o2 predominantly as ho2 even in neutral conditions to br eq 6 in table 7 since h2o2 is present in a large excess the further oxidation of hobr by ho to bro3 is outcompeted by its reduction therefore the addition of h2o2 to mask hobr can be an alternative control option to minimize bro3 formation in many oxidation processes except for the ozonation where bro3 can be formed via direct reaction of br with o3 bypassing hobr obr fig 1 lutze et al 2014 have reported that the addition of h2o2 greatly delayed br turnover and bro3 formation in uv pds process due to the reduction of hobr by h2o2 table 6 nevertheless no systematic experiments to date have been done to evaluate the performance of this control method in sr aops which warrants further research 5 3 addition of carbon materials alternatively carbon materials assisted sr aops have recently been recognized as an effective strategy for controlling the formation of bro3 for instance huang et al 2017 demonstrated that the level of bro3 formed during br oxidation by heat pms process was significantly lowered by addition of reduced graphene oxide rgo which otherwise showed a negligible effect on pms decomposition as well as reactive radicals generation the presence of 25 mg l rgo led to 67 100 reduction of bro3 yield in a wide ph range of 5 9 and at the temperature range of 60 80 c table 6 further experiments suggested that rgo resulted in a quick reduction of hobr obr to br at room temperature while no abatement of bro3 or br by rgo adsorption was observed therefore masking hobr obr was proposed to be the major role of rgo in inhibiting bro3 formation in heat pms process the inhibited formation of bro3 by rgo was also observed in ozonation our recent study also demonstrated the good performance of carbon materials on controlling bro3 formation in sr aops i e co ii pms process by using one commercial carbon nanotube cnt guan et al 2018 therein a 47 5 81 7 reduction of bro3 yield was achieved by addition of 50 100 mg l cnt at the condition of br co ii and pms dosages of 20 20 and 200 μm respectively table 6 a similar mechanism of cnt induced hobr obr reduction to inhibit bro3 formation was verified 6 conclusions and research needs sr aops show a good application prospective in decontamination of wastewaters in situ remediation of contaminated groundwaters as well as drinking water production but the bro3 formation when coming into contact with br containing waters has been a concerned problem herein we presented a critical review focusing on bro3 formation during treatment of br containing waters by various sr aops the mechanism of bro3 formation mainly involves the sequential oxidation of br by so4 to br containing radicals e g br and br2 and then to hobr obr which is the requisite intermediate for bro3 formation in addition hobr obr can also be generated through direct reaction of br with the oxidants i e pms or other reactive species derived from the catalytic activators e g co iii in the co ii pms process in the presence of dom bro3 formation in sr aops is dramatically suppressed mainly due to the scavenging of br by dom to regenerate br the direct reaction of br with dom can hardly cause organic br obps formation while hobr obr generated through some nonradical pathways accounts for the bromination of organics moreover bro3 formation during oxidative debromination of brominated pollutants by so4 follows a similar trend to that observed in transformation of br by so4 in the presence of dom where brominated pollutants and their oxidation intermediates acting as the organic matrices account for reduction of br containing radicals even though there have already been many studies on the bro3 formation in various sr aops most experiments are conducted in synthetic waters with the spiked br which is beneficial for clarifying the reaction mechanism however actual water experiments that are important for assessing the formation potential of bro3 in practical application of sr aops are very limited so further studies with respect to the bro3 formation in actual waters are needed also the effects of some important environmental variables such as cl and other inorganic ions alkalinity on bro3 formation should be further detailed the cl2 and nh3 combined pretreatment strategies where nh2cl is generated to mask the intermediate hobr obr as nhbrcl exhibit good performance for minimizing bro3 formation by sr aops howbeit this approach has some disadvantages including the formation of undesired chlorinated byproducts through reactions of the added cl2 with organic matters in water as well as requiring high dosages of cl2 and nh3 to ensure sufficient nh2cl generation h2o2 addition to decrease bro3 formation in sr aops has been observed in a previous study but systematic researches on its efficiency and feasibility are lacking moreover addition of carbon materials such as rgo and cnt may be a promising alternative approach to mitigate bro3 formation owing to their excellent reduction capacities in earlier studies carbon materials e g powder and granular activated carbon have also been used as the efficient adsorbent for removal of bro3 from water hong et al 2016 wang et al 2010 huang and cheng 2008 therefore future research may focus on developing the novel low cost and eco friendly carbon materials with both superior reduction and adsorption capacities for application in controlling bro3 formation by sr aops since the bro3 formation is greatly dependent on the specific operational conditions the parameter optimization of sr aops e g optimization of oxidant or catalyst dosages and ph regulation may be an easy and feasible option for minimizing bro3 formation as well for another thing it seems likely that sr aops can be well applied in treatment of waters containing a high level of dom where bro3 formation is not a concerned problem declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

17965,sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes sr aops show a good prospect for effective elimination of organic contaminants in water due to the powerful oxidation capability and good adaptability of sulfate radical so4 however great concerns have been raised on occurrence of the carcinogenic byproduct bromate bro3 in sr aops the present article aims to provide a critical review on bro3 formation during bromine br containing water oxidation by various sr aops potential reaction mechanisms are elaborated mainly involving the sequential oxidation of bromide br by so4 to br containing radicals e g bromine atom br and then to hypobromous acid hypobromite hobr obr which acts as the requisite intermediate for bro3 formation some key influencing factors on bro3 formation are discussed particularly dissolved organic matter dom as a component ubiquitously present in aquatic environments shows a significant suppression effect on bro3 formation primarily attributed to the reduction of br by dom to br the reaction of br with dom can hardly produce organic brominated byproducts while their formation is mainly due to the bromination of hobr obr generated through nonradical pathways such as the direct reaction of br with oxidants e g peroxymonosulfate pms or other reactive species derived from catalytic activators e g co iii in the co ii pms process the debromination of brominated pollutants during their oxidation by so4 results in the release of br which however is not further transformed to bro3 until coexisting organic matters are mineralized nearly completely furthermore possible strategies for control of bro3 formation in sr aops as well as the future research needs are proposed graphical abstract image 10091 keywords sulfate radical bromate dissolved organic matter brominated pollutants control strategies 1 introduction bromide ion br exists ubiquitously in natural waters with a level significantly varying with the water source the concentration of br is usually in a range of 10 to 1000 μg l in fresh waters and an elevated br level is occasionally found in particular ground and surface waters associated with local geological situations ocean water infiltration and anthropogenic activities e g potassium and coal mining heeb et al 2014 von gunten and hoigne 1994 in seawater br concentration is around 67 mg l the widespread existence of br as well as its high levels bring a potential risk of generating the undesired byproduct bromate bro3 in water and wastewater treatment bro3 is well known as a probable human carcinogen world health organization 1990 and its maximum contaminant level in drinking water is set to be 10 μg l in china the united states and europe delker et al 2006 beltrán et al 2002 the earliest concern for bro3 formation in water treatment originates from the ozonation and ozone o3 based advanced oxidation processes aops such as o3 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and uv o3 combined processes where hydroxyl radical ho is generated as a cooperative oxidative component von gunten 2003 collivignarelli and sorlini 2004 ratpukdi et al 2011 the formation mechanism of bro3 in these processes has been well investigated and recorded by von gunten and his coworkers mainly attributing to two pathways i the oxidation of br to the intermediate hypobromous acid hypobromite hobr obr and then to bro3 by o3 and or ho and ii the reaction of ho with br to form bromine atom br which is directly oxidized by o3 to form bromine oxide radical bro and finally to bro3 bypassing hobr obr von gunten and hoigne 1994 von gunten and oliveras 1998 pinkernell and von gunten 2001 further fischbacher et al 2015 demonstrated that o3 reacted with bromite bro2 not by the previously assumed mechanism via o transfer but via electron transfer to form bro3 meanwhile the electron transfer process also yielded the ozonide radical anion o3 which reacted with h2o molecule to generate ho and thus promoted bro3 formation in ozonation the comprehensive reaction scheme for bro3 formation in ozonation and o3 based aops is presented in fig 1 in recent decades sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes sr aops have gained increasing attention as an alternative to conventional water treatment technologies oh et al 2016 matzek and carter 2016 wang and wang 2018 so4 possesses one unpaired electron in the outermost open shell of electrons and thus is highly reactive toward various organic compounds e g pesticides pharmaceuticals dyes aromatics and perfluorocarboxylic acids matzek and carter 2016 wang and wang 2018 wacławek et al 2017 typically so4 is generated via activation of persulfates i e peroxodisulfate pds or peroxymonosulfate pms by various methods such as heat ji et al 2015 alkaline peng et al 2017 furman et al 2010 2011 ultrasound su et al 2012 uv liu et al 2013 luo et al 2016 microwave qi et al 2014 transition metal ions or oxides guo et al 2013 saputra et al 2013 and metal free carbocatalysts lee et al 2016 guan et al 2017a 2017b 2018 most of these methods are applicable in wastewater treatment fields to achieve fast degradation and mineralization of contaminants in addition to large amounts of laboratory experiments some field scale studies have been conducted to examine the feasibility of sr aops in practical wastewater plants matzek and carter 2016 ike et al 2018 for instance chou et al 2015 successfully applied microwave assisted heat activation of pds to treat landfill leachate where a 79 4 total organic carbon toc removal and 88 4 color removal were achieved within 30 min at microwave power of 550 w and 85 c also both bench and field scale studies have been carried out to reveal that persulfates activated by heat alkaline and iron are good in situ chemical oxidation isco technologies for remediation of contaminated groundwaters ike et al 2018 tsitonaki et al 2010 moreover studies have suggested the promising application potential of sr aops e g uv persulfates and persulfates combined with heterogeneous metal or nonmetal catalysts in the field of drinking water treatment owing to the unique advantages of persulfates over other oxidants including their great stability high solubility relatively low cost and the ease of storage handling and transportation wacławek et al 2017 ike et al 2018 however similar to o3 based oxidation processes bro3 formation during treatment of bromine br containing waters by sr aops is observed in recent studies since fang and shang 2012 first reported the formation of bro3 from br oxidation by uv pds process a great deal of work has been done to probe into the formation potential and mechanism of bro3 in various sr aops in the presence of br which is quite complex and varies with the specific catalytic oxidation processes in these studies various influencing factors e g solution ph dosages of oxidants or catalysts and coexisting water matrices on bro3 formation are evaluated particularly dissolved organic matter dom as a component ubiquitously present in aquatic environments is demonstrated to have a significant suppression effect on bro3 formation in sr aops fang and shang 2012 lutze et al 2014 liu et al 2018 li et al 2015 but the suppression mechanism has been a controversial issue in addition bro3 is possibly formed during oxidation of brominated organic compounds by so4 where the release of inorganic br i e debromination occurs concurrently which also receives much attention in recent studies ji et al 2016 luo et al 2019 2020 currently a few review articles of sr aops have been published most of which focus on the physicochemical properties of persulfates wacławek et al 2017 various activation methods ghanbari and moradi 2017 oh et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 generation mechanisms of so4 as well as application of sr aops for removal of organic contaminants in water matzek and carter 2016 wang and wang 2018 tsitonaki et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 however information involving bro3 formation by various sr aops is very limited in these reviews ike et al 2019 recently reviewed the formation of oxidation byproducts during dom degradation by different oxidation processes where bro3 formation in sr aops was partially summarized so it is necessary to provide a comprehensive assessment on bro3 formation by sr aops to fill the knowledge gap and also to provide useful guidelines for research and practical application of sr aops in this work an overview of the recently published studies on bro3 formation during oxidation of br in various sr aops such as uv pds heat pms co ii pms and o3 pms processes is given firstly section 2 then the effect of dom on bro3 formation by sr aops has been emphatically discussed in order to harmonize the contradictory influencing mechanisms section 3 the potential formation of bro3 during treatment of brominated pollutants by sr aops is also elaborated section 4 finally possible strategies for controlling the bro3 formation in sr aops as well as the further research needs are proposed sections 5 6 2 formation of bro3 by sr aops in the absence of dom 2 1 uv pds oxidation process uv radiation of pds has been widely used to generate so4 for destruction of recalcitrant organic contaminants in water luo et al 2016 yang et al 2018 because it is environment friendly and relatively easy to operate fang and shang 2012 investigated the transformation of inorganic bromine species in uv pds process under various experimental conditions it was found that the oxidation of br by uv pds led to a significant formation of bro3 which was not observed in the presence of uv or pds alone the level of bro3 formation was highly dependent on reaction conditions for instance under the uv intensity of 2 19 μe l 1 s 1 and ph 7 bro3 concentration derived from 20 μm initial br increased from 1 16 to 20 μm with pds dosage increasing from 20 to 500 μm in 20 min table 1 within a lower br concentration range 0 1 5 μm bro3 formation rate increased with the increase of initial br concentration and all of the dosed br was converted to bro3 in 20 min while within a high concentration range 10 50 μm raising the initial br concentration had a slight effect on bro3 formation moreover bro3 formation was more favorable in neutral and slightly acidic ph conditions e g ph 4 7 compared to alkaline ph conditions e g 8 and 9 the authors also examined the formation of bro3 in br 20 μm spiked real water and found that bro3 formation in real water was much lower compared to that in synthetic water under the identical condition after 20 min 65 and 100 conversion of br 20 μm to bro3 was achieved respectively in the real water and the synthetic water at the pds dosage of 500 μm results of verification experiments suggested that dom rather than chloride cl or alkalinity in real water was responsible for the reduction of bro3 formation which would be detailed in the following discussion section 3 3 by establishing an empirical model with respect to hobr obr and bro3 formation it was revealed that the formation of bro3 by uv pds was primarily driven by so4 while direct uv photolysis of hobr obr to form bro3 was negligible based on the fairly constant mass balance of inorganic bromine including br hobr obr and bro3 the authors proposed that hobr obr was the key intermediate during the formation of bro3 by so4 which was generated via the sequential oxidation of br to bromine atom br and then to dibromide radical br2 the comprehensive reactions for bro3 formation from br oxidation by so4 are summarized in table 2 and the simplified reaction scheme is presented in fig 2 the solid lines 2 2 co ii pms oxidation process li et al 2015 investigated the kinetics of br oxidation and bro3 formation in co ii pms process and suggested that bro3 formation was a two step process involving hobr obr as the requisite intermediate and bro3 as the final product similar to the result obtained in uv pds process in the first step in addition to the known oxidation of br to hobr obr by so4 co iii produced through the oxidation of co ii by pms and so4 also contributed to the transformation of br to hobr obr table 3 the second step in which bro3 was formed from hobr obr was mainly attributed to so4 while co iii was unable to further oxidize hobr obr the model simulation revealed that the co iii pathway outweighed the so4 pathway in the first step resulting in more accumulation of hobr obr in co ii pms process compared to that in uv pds process similar to the case of br hou et al 2018 demonstrated that co iii played a significant role in the oxidation of cl to hypochlorous acid hypochlorite hocl ocl while so4 was important for the subsequent oxidation of hocl ocl to chlorate clo3 in co ii pms process the simplified reaction scheme for bro3 formation from br oxidation by both so4 and co iii is presented in fig 2 the solid and dot lines respectively it was observed that bro3 formation gradually increased with the increase of pms dosage the bro3 yield was around 8 μm 40 transformation of initial br 20 μm at 30 min in the presence of 50 μm pms and 20 μm co ii at ph 4 2 while 100 of the dosed br was oxidized to bro3 in 20 min as the pms dosage increased to 500 μm table 1 besides increasing the co ii dosage and initial br concentration also enhanced bro3 formation and neutral ph e g 6 3 was the most favorable to bro3 formation notably the formation of hobr obr was also observed in the absence of the activator co ii suggesting that pms per se was able to convert br to hobr obr due to its higher redox potential hso4 hso5 1 82 v than that of hobr obr br hobr 1 338v rastogi et al 2009 nevertheless hobr obr formation by pms alone was significantly slower compared to that observed by co ii pms process the second order rate constant of br reaction with pms was determined to be 0 17 m 1 s 1 which was 10 orders of magnitude lower than that of its reaction with so4 3 5 109 m 1 s 1 liu et al 2015 no further transformation of hobr obr to bro3 occurred in the presence of pms alone furthermore li et al 2015 also reported that the formation of bro3 in ag i pds fe ii pms and fe ii pds processes was insignificant probably attributed to the precipitation of agbr the chemical reduction by ferrous ions as well as insufficient radical generation 2 3 heat pms oxidation process huang et al 2017 examined the formation of bro3 during treatment of br by heat pms process where both so4 and ho were generated and made a contribution they found that higher temperatures significantly promoted the formation of bro3 primarily due to the strengthened generation of so4 and ho by the breaking down of pms at the pms dosage of 200 μm and ph 7 0 28 1 31 and 1 57 μm bro3 was formed from br 20 μm in 120 min at 60 70 and 80 c respectively table 1 the increase of solution ph had a positive effect on bro3 formation contrary to the cases of uv pds and co ii pms oxidation for instance under the condition of 200 μm pms and 80 c the formed bro3 concentration was 0 11 1 55 and 2 45 μm at ph 5 7 and 9 respectively by monitoring the decomposition of pms at different ph values the author explained that base catalyzed hydrolysis of pms led to higher levels of radicals and thus facilitated the oxidation of br to bro3 2 4 o3 pms oxidation process a novel aop combining o3 with pms which simultaneously produces so4 and ho to enhance the removal of organic pollutants has been proposed in recent studies govindan et al 2014 yang et al 2015 thereafter wen et al 2018 investigated the bro3 formation during treatment of br containing water by the o3 pms process their results demonstrated that the o3 pms process produced significantly higher concentrations of bro3 compared to o3 alone treatment effects of several important parameters e g pms dosage br concentration and solution ph were evaluated in their study at the o3 dosage of 1 135 mg min the initial br concentration of 25 μm and ph 7 bro3 concentration formed in 25 min increased from 3 97 to 12 60 μm with pms dosage increasing from 0 to 300 μm table 1 moreover bro3 formation was strengthened with the initial br concentration increasing from 2 to 10 μm and nearly all of the initial br was oxidized in 25 min while no significant change of bro3 formation was observed as br was in a high concentration range of 10 50 μm the elevated ph resulted in a larger amount of bro3 formation irrespective of pms dosage which was mainly attributed to the accelerated o3 decomposition to generate more radicals by monitoring the evolution of inorganic bromine species i e br hobr obr and bro3 at various ph values the intermediate role of hobr obr was confirmed in agreement with the aforementioned sr aops further the effect of radical scavengers on bro3 formation was evaluated methanol ma was a frequently used quenching reagent for so4 and ho k so4 1 23 107 m 1 s 1 k ho 2 8 108 m 1 s 1 and tert butanol tba was a quenching reagent for ho k ho 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 k so4 2 0 106 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 it was observed that the formation of bro3 was greatly inhibited by addition of ma or tba and the inhibitory effect was more significant in the former case this result indicated that both so4 and ho were responsible for the strengthened bro3 formation in the o3 pms process in addition the oxidative conversion of br or hobr obr by o3 alone to produce bro3 was observed but at a much slower rate compared to the o3 pms process suggesting that o3 also contributed to the formation of bro3 these results clearly confirmed the importance role of so4 ho and molecular o3 in bro3 formation by the o3 pms process additional reactions involved in transformation of bromine species by ho and o3 are presented in table 4 and the reaction scheme is presented in fig 2 the dashed lines as well 3 formation of bro3 by sr aops in the presence of dom dom is a complex mixture of aliphatic and aromatic molecules containing a variety of functional groups richard et al 2007 chen et al 2003 which plays a complicated role in transformation of br as well as bro3 formation by sr aops for instance the presence of dom can cause the decrease of br oxidation rate due to its scavenging effect for radicals besides dom is closely associated with the formation of organic brominated oxidation byproducts br obps attributed to its reaction with reactive bromine species rbs generated from br oxidation by so4 the electron transfer reaction between so4 and some functional groups of dom e g aromatic ketone ester and aliphatic yields organic radicals which are further transformed to generate peroxy radical roo singlet oxygen 1o2 or superoxide o2 lutze et al 2014 rao and hayon 1974 bank and juckett 1976 these reactive species may also influence the transformation of bromine species by sr aops therefore understanding the reactivity of dom with so4 as well as rbs is of great importance for investigating the bro3 formation by sr aops in the presence of dom 3 1 reaction of dom with so4 lutze et al 2015 experimentally determined the rate constant of 6 8 103 l mgc 1 s 1 for so4 with one humic acid ha typically used as the model dom depur from carl roth by a competition kinetics method which was basically identical with the data reported by zhou et al 2017 1 86 103 l mgc 1 s 1 recently zhang et al 2019 investigated the reactivity of four chromophoric dom with so4 and a higher rate constant at the magnitude of 108 m 1 s 1 was obtained compared to the data previously reported i e 107 m 1 s 1 the difference could be attributed to the fact that zhang et al only measured the conceptually isolated fast reacting moieties of dom i e electron donating group substituted aromatic structures rather than the bulk dom i e a combination of both fast and slow reacting moieties of dom by recording the changes in ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uva254 electron donating capacity edc fluorescence intensity fi and toc zhang et al 2019 further demonstrated that so4 induced oxidation of dom primarily its electron donating group substituted aromatic structures was initiated by single electron transfer or addition the subsequent attack on hydroxylated c centered radical cations by so4 led to formation of ring opening products and the decarboxylation of carboxyl groups that were newly formed or originally incorporated within dom structures was responsible for the eventual removal of toc in other words dom was mineralized by so4 through multi step reactions during which the change of dom molecular structures occurred lu et al 2016 also observed the structural reconfiguration of dom during treatment by sr aops including the heat pds and co ii pms processes moreover they proposed that this change led to a great increase in the reactivity of dom toward rbs and thus its br obps formation potential in their study significant formation of br obps e g bromoform and brominated acetic acids was observed during oxidation of o phthalic acid pa that was used as a model compound by so4 in the presence of br while pa per se could not react with hobr obr directly to form these brominated byproducts due to the absence of reactive phenolic moieties further they demonstrated that the phenolic intermediate salicylic acid sa was generated through oxidation of pa by so4 which acted as the direct substrate for bromination and formation of br obps similar in situ generation of phenolic functionalities occurred when dom was exposed to so4 mainly through the conversion of carboxylic substituents on aromatics to hydroxyl groups thus the br obps formation potential of dom subjected to so4 treatment was increased significantly it was noted that the main brominating reagent involved in sr aops was the nonradical halogen oxidant hobr obr rather than br containing radicals e g br and br2 which would be further detailed in the following section section 3 2 3 2 reaction of rbs with dom interestingly an inorganic bromine balance during br oxidation by so4 in the presence of dom was observed in both studies of lutze et al 2014 and liu et al 2018 namely no organic br obps were detected in this process this observation implied that dom reacted with rbs primarily br containing radicals generated from reaction of br with so4 probably via an electron transfer pathway rather than an addition reaction the former resulted in the reduction of these br containing radicals back to br while the latter induced organic br obps formation this was contrary to the widely accepted opinion that the direct incorporation of br into dom made a significant contribution to the formation of organic br obps for instance wang et al 2014 reported that considerable amounts of organic br obps were produced during treatment of various dom isolates and model compounds by cufe2o4 activated pms process in the presence of br similar results were also obtained in the studies by lu et al 2015 and liu et al 2015 where heat pds and co ii pms processes were employed to generate so4 respectively this discrepancy might be attributed to the contribution of hobr obr which could be generated by further transformation of br containing radicals by so4 direct oxidation of br by pms as well as reactions of br with other reactive species derived from the catalytic activators e g cu iii for the cufe2o4 pms process and co iii for the co ii pms process previous studies have widely reported that hobr obr has a high reactivity with electron rich organic compounds e g phenols and amines and the reaction occurs mainly via the electrophilic substitution and or addition pathway heeb et al 2014 acero et al 2005 resulting in significant formation of br obps in fact the concept that direct incorporation of halide atoms x into dom results in the formation of organic x obps has been largely denied in recent studies for instance wang et al 2019 found that the level of adsorbable organohalides aox formed during treatment of the lake ontario water by uv cl2 process was very close to that by cl2 alone at ph 8 0 while at ph 6 5 the uv cl2 process resulted in more formation of aox than the chlorination it was demonstrated that the uv cl2 oxidation at ph 6 5 tended to be dominated by ho whereas oxidation at ph 8 was dominated by reactive chlorine species rcs this result meant that the rcs might not be the main contributor to aox formation and instead the impact of uv cl2 on aox formation was due to the generation of ho which presumably reacted with dom to improve their reactivity towards cl2 similarly another study by wang et al 2015 also reported that there was little increase in aox formation by uv cl2 process at ph 8 5 where rcs was presumed to predominate compared to the chlorination in the full scale experiments moreover the authors comparatively investigated the impact of uv cl2 and uv h2o2 pretreatment on x obps e g trihalomethane and haloacetic acids formation potential and they found that the uv cl2 pretreatment increased the formation potential of x obps to an extent approximate to that observed in the case of uv h2o2 pretreatment so they proposed that chlorine radical cl as a strong oxidant made the x obps precursors i e dom more readily react with cl2 to form x obps while its direct incorporation into dom was negligible moreover lei et al 2019 examined the rate constants and mechanisms for the reactions of cl and dichloride radical cl2 with trace organic contaminants by tracking the formation of transient intermediates it was demonstrated that the reaction of cl with organics involved multiple reaction mechanisms including addition h abstraction and single electron transfer among them the single electron transfer pathway made a predominant contribution to the overall transformation of organics by cl while cl addition played a less important role by contrast cl2 reacted with most organics mainly via a single electron transfer pathway recently ike et al 2019 have published a review to emphasize the opinion that direct incorporation of x into dom can hardly contribute to the formation of x obps while the major halogenating agent is hypohalous acid hypohalite hox ox 3 3 effect of dom on bro3 formation as mentioned above section 2 1 fang and shang 2012 demonstrated that bro3 formation during br oxidation by uv pds process was dramatically suppressed in the presence of dom and they attributed this to the scavenging of rbs by dom to produce organic br obps this would lead to a deficient inorganic bromine balance and organic br obps formation however the relevant data was not available in their study lutze et al 2014 also reported the dom induced suppression of bro3 formation in uv pds process but they observed an inorganic bromine balance this result clearly ruled out the possibility that the reaction of dom with rbs to generate br obps inhibited bro3 formation alternatively they proposed that o2 generated via a sequence of reactions between so4 and aromatic moieties of dom reduced rbs e g hobr obr and br2 to br eqs 1 4 in table 5 accounting for the suppressed bro3 formation wang et al 2020 investigated the transformation of br during the degradation of a model contaminant diethyl phthalate dep by heat pds process in their study the formation of bro3 exhibited a lag phase and a higher concentration of dep or the addition of dom led to the prolongation of bro3 formation lag phase and also decreased the bro3 yield in the secondary phase they attributed this to the reason that i the scavenging of so4 by organic matters resulted in less so4 accessible for the oxidation of br and hobr obr and ii the reaction between organic matters and so4 yielded o2 which reacted with bromine intermediates to decrease their levels this was generally consistent with the conclusion of lutze et al 2014 liu et al 2018 investigated the evolution of bro3 during br oxidation by uv pds process in the presence of oxalate a dom model compound where a biphasic kinetics of bro3 formation was observed for instance in the presence of 100 μm oxalate bro3 was not formed during reaction of br 17 5 μm with pds 200 μm under uv irradiation in the initial 20 min lag phase and then quickly increased to 12 μm from 20 to 60 min secondary phase moreover the formation rate of bro3 in the secondary phase was relatively slower than that in the control 12 μm vs 17 5 μm in 40 min based on the kinetic simulation they suggested that the scavenging of so4 by oxalate contributed little to the suppression of bro3 formation while the scavenging of br and br2 primarily the former by oxalate to regenerate br played an important role eqs 5 and 6 in table 5 in addition they demonstrated that o2 formed from the reaction of oxalate with br rather than the reaction of oxalate with so4 eqs 5 7 in table 5 partly accounted for bro3 suppression as well a similar inhibitory effect on bro3 formation was also observed in the presence of other dom model compounds e g l tyrosine phenol tert butanol critic acid and methanol it was noted that the inorganic bromine almost kept balance in the presence of these model compounds and the amounts of total organic bromine tobr formed were always 1 of total bromine which was in good agreement with the result of lutze et al 2014 in one word the electron transfer reaction of dom with br to generate br inhibits its further transformation to hobr obr and eventually to bro3 which can be the most reasonable explanation for the non formation of br obps as well as the suppressed formation of bro3 in sr aops in the presence of dom 4 formation of bro3 during brominated pollutants oxidation by sr aops besides the naturally existing br the debromination of brominated organic compounds during their oxidative treatment by so4 is an important source of br which also poses a potential risk of producing bro3 table 1 summarizes the reported bro3 formation during oxidation of brominated pollutants by various sr aops 4 1 co ii pms oxidation process ji et al 2016 investigated the degradation of tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa and the evolution of inorganic bromine species in the co ii pms process in their study a series of tbbpa oxidation intermediates by so4 were identified and especially the formation of 2 4 6 tribromophenol suggested that both debromination and bromination reactions occurred indeed the release of br along with the degradation of tbbpa was observed while no bro3 was detected during the reaction this result was seemingly in agreement with the aforementioned phenomenon that the presence of dom suppressed the formation of bro3 in sr aops in other words br generated from oxidation of the released br by so4 could react with the existing organic matters including parent tbbpa and its degradation intermediates via an electron transfer pathway leading to the reduction of br back to br so the further oxidation of br to form bro3 was unsupported until the coexisting organic matters were mineralized nearly completely moreover bromination reactions as evidenced by the formation of 2 4 6 tribromophenol were primarily attributed to hobr obr generated through reaction of br with pms and or co iii table 3 4 2 cufe2o4 pms oxidation process ding et al 2013 investigated the debromination of tbbpa and formation of bro3 in cufe2o4 magnetic nanoparticles activated pms system in the presence of 1 5 mm pms and 0 1 g l cufe2o4 tbbpa at an initial concentration of 10 mg l 18 4 μm was fast degraded by so4 after 180 min a high concentration of br 44 8 μm was observed while the concentration of bro3 was only 6 4 μm table 1 according to the linear relationship between the pseudo first order rate constant k obs of tbbpa oxidation vs pms concentration obtained in that study tbbpa oxidation rate was estimated to be 0 9005 min 1 so the k obs value for br oxidation by the cufe2o4 pms process was calculated to be approximately 0 06 min 1 based on the second order rate constants of so4 with tbbpa 5 27 1010 m 1 s 1 ji et al 2016 and with br 3 5 109 m 1 s 1 redpath and willson 1975 in this regard it could be speculated that br once released from tbbpa would be quickly oxidized by so4 with a short half life period of 11 min resulting in significant formation of bro3 the observed low yield of bro3 during reaction of tbbpa with the cufe2o4 pms process might be associated with the presence of a large number of tbbpa oxidation intermediate products as detected in that study these products inhibited the oxidation of br to br due to their competition for so4 and also reacted with the resulting br to induce its reduction to br 4 3 uv pds oxidation process our recent study examined the potential formation of bro3 during oxidation of 2 4 bromophenol 2 4 dbp by uv pds process luo et al 2019 in the presence of 500 μm pds and under uv irradiation br was released along with the degradation of 2 4 dbp 1 μm and its concentration increased quickly to the maximum 2 μm at 5 min and then decreased gradually bro3 formation was not observed in the first 10 min after which its concentration rapidly increased and the complete conversion of br to bro3 was achieved at 50 min the biphasic kinetics of bro3 formation were well consistent with that observed by liu et al 2018 the lag phase could be reasonably explained by the fact that 2 4 dbp and its degradation intermediates acting as the organic matters scavenged br that was generated through reaction of so4 with br released from 2 4 dbp and thus inhibited its transformation to bro3 sun et al 2019 investigated the oxidative debromination of 2 2 bis bromomethyl 1 3 propanediol bbmp and the corresponding formation of organic and inorganic brominated byproducts by uv pds process their results revealed that the debromination of bbmp by uv pds process occurred over a wide ph range of 4 0 12 0 and the rate increased with increasing ph from 4 0 to 9 0 and remained relatively constant at ph 9 0 and 12 0 meanwhile bro3 was formed during the oxidative debromination of bbmp which displayed a lag phase behind the br formation similar to the observation by luo et al 2019 although a higher br concentration was observed at alkaline ph values bro3 formation was remarkably decreased with increasing ph from 6 0 to 12 0 this was mainly due to the reason that i the alkaline condition induced the conversion of so4 to ho which reacted with br 1 1 109 m 1 s 1 at a lower rate than so4 3 5 109 m 1 s 1 and ii the scavenging of br by oh eq 9 in table 4 inhibited its further oxidation to hobr obr 4 4 uv pms oxidation process luo et al 2020 reported that br released from 2 4 dbp oxidation by uv pms process was converted stepwise to hobr obr and finally to bro3 which also exhibited the biphasic kinetics as observed in 2 4 dbp transformation by uv pds process in the presence of 100 μm pms no bro3 was formed in the first 40 min and only 0 7 μm bro3 was formed after 60 min increasing pms dosage from 100 to 500 μm led to the shortening of bro3 formation lag phase from 40 to 5 min and a higher bro3 yield 2 μm in the secondary phase the longer lag phase of bro3 formation was observed at higher initial 2 4 dbp concentrations but the formation rate and yield of bro3 were promoted the increase of ph value from 5 to 9 resulted in a significant decrease of bro3 yield for instance nearly 100 initial bromine in 2 4 dbp was transformed to bro3 at ph 5 after 40 min reaction while no bro3 was detected at ph 9 table 1 the authors suggested that at higher ph values oh scavenged br generated from br oxidation by radicals to form broh which led to less transformation of br to hobr obr and thus inhibited the bro3 formation in agreement with the result by sun et al 2019 the presence of cl significantly reduced the formation of bro3 after 60 min the bro3 concentration formed from 2 4 dbp 1 μm oxidation was 2 1 12 and 1 27 μm at cl concentration of 0 1 and 5 mm respectively table 1 this was attributed to the competition of cl vs the released br for reactive radicals as well as the enhanced conversion of so4 to ho and rcs by cl it was noted that fang and shang 2012 reported the little effect of cl on bro3 formation by uv pds process the discrepancy between these two studies could be explained by the difference in cl levels 1 5 mm in luo s study vs 0 286 mm in fang s study in addition the presence of dom reduced and retarded the bro3 formation during 2 4 dbp oxidation by uv pms process as expected 5 control strategies on bro3 formation over the past few years studies although limited have been conducted on development of effective strategies for controlling bro3 formation in sr aops a brief summary of these control strategies and their performances is presented in table 6 5 1 addition of chlorine and ammonia in conventional ozonation bro3 formation can be minimized by several control options involving ammonia nh3 addition and the chlorine ammonia cl2 nh3 combined pretreatment strategies von gunten 2003 pinkernell and von gunten 2001 buffle et al 2004 following a similar perspective ling et al 2018 evaluated the performance of nh3 addition cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies on controlling bro3 formation in a sr aop i e the co ii pms process at a low ph of 4 where the activation of pms by co ii to generate so4 was the most effective the addition of nh3 retarded bro3 formation but only at a lesser reduction level for instance 50 μm nh3 led to about 9 5 decrease of bro3 yield after 20 min reaction at the condition of br co ii and pms dosages of 5 20 and 200 μm respectively table 6 the influence of nh3 addition on bro3 formation was mainly due to its fast reaction with the intermediate hobr to form bromamine nh2br eq 1 in table 7 which did not participate in bro3 formation pinkernell and von gunten 2001 the low efficiency of this method in preventing bro3 formation by co ii pms process was mainly attributed to the protonation of nh3 at ph 4 99 99 as nh4 which did not react with hobr by contrast both the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment at cl2 and nh3 dosages of 15 and 50 μm reduced more than 95 bro3 formation in 20 min at the identical reaction condition to that of nh3 addition i e 5 μm br 20 μm co ii and 200 μm pms table 6 with the latter being more superior over the former in the cl2 nh3 pretreatment process hocl was firstly added to the br containing water to oxidize br to hobr obr and an excessive amount of nh3 was subsequently added to scavenge hobr and the remaining hocl to form nh2br and nh2cl respectively eqs 1 3 in table 7 in nh3 cl2 pretreatment nh3 was stably present in br containing water after addition because the two components did not react hocl was added to fast react with nh3 in excess and br to form nh2cl and hobr eqs 2 and 3 in table 7 subsequently nh2cl scavenged the remaining br and hobr to form nh2br and nhbrcl eqs 4 and 5 in table 7 the authors established a kinetic model to simulate the concentrations of various compounds involved in cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment processes e g hocl nh3 nh2cl nh2br nhbr2 and nhbrcl the simulation results revealed that at the same pair of hocl and nh3 concentrations the formed nh2cl concentration after the nh3 cl2 pretreatment was always higher compared to that after the cl2 nh3 pretreatment moreover similar inhibition performances of bro3 formation were observed when similar amounts of nh2cl were generated in the two pretreatment processes the association between the nh2cl concentration and the inhibition performance suggested that nh2cl was the key species contributing to the inhibited bro3 formation which effectively outcompeted so4 to react with hobr to form nhbrcl eq 5 in table 7 5 2 addition of h2o2 previous studies have reported that no bro3 is formed during br oxidation by uv h2o2 process where ho is generated as the only oxidant von gunten and oliveras 1998 symons and zheng 1997 this is attributed to the fact that ho oxidizes br to br and eventually to hobr which is again reduced by h2o2 predominantly as ho2 even in neutral conditions to br eq 6 in table 7 since h2o2 is present in a large excess the further oxidation of hobr by ho to bro3 is outcompeted by its reduction therefore the addition of h2o2 to mask hobr can be an alternative control option to minimize bro3 formation in many oxidation processes except for the ozonation where bro3 can be formed via direct reaction of br with o3 bypassing hobr obr fig 1 lutze et al 2014 have reported that the addition of h2o2 greatly delayed br turnover and bro3 formation in uv pds process due to the reduction of hobr by h2o2 table 6 nevertheless no systematic experiments to date have been done to evaluate the performance of this control method in sr aops which warrants further research 5 3 addition of carbon materials alternatively carbon materials assisted sr aops have recently been recognized as an effective strategy for controlling the formation of bro3 for instance huang et al 2017 demonstrated that the level of bro3 formed during br oxidation by heat pms process was significantly lowered by addition of reduced graphene oxide rgo which otherwise showed a negligible effect on pms decomposition as well as reactive radicals generation the presence of 25 mg l rgo led to 67 100 reduction of bro3 yield in a wide ph range of 5 9 and at the temperature range of 60 80 c table 6 further experiments suggested that rgo resulted in a quick reduction of hobr obr to br at room temperature while no abatement of bro3 or br by rgo adsorption was observed therefore masking hobr obr was proposed to be the major role of rgo in inhibiting bro3 formation in heat pms process the inhibited formation of bro3 by rgo was also observed in ozonation our recent study also demonstrated the good performance of carbon materials on controlling bro3 formation in sr aops i e co ii pms process by using one commercial carbon nanotube cnt guan et al 2018 therein a 47 5 81 7 reduction of bro3 yield was achieved by addition of 50 100 mg l cnt at the condition of br co ii and pms dosages of 20 20 and 200 μm respectively table 6 a similar mechanism of cnt induced hobr obr reduction to inhibit bro3 formation was verified 6 conclusions and research needs sr aops show a good application prospective in decontamination of wastewaters in situ remediation of contaminated groundwaters as well as drinking water production but the bro3 formation when coming into contact with br containing waters has been a concerned problem herein we presented a critical review focusing on bro3 formation during treatment of br containing waters by various sr aops the mechanism of bro3 formation mainly involves the sequential oxidation of br by so4 to br containing radicals e g br and br2 and then to hobr obr which is the requisite intermediate for bro3 formation in addition hobr obr can also be generated through direct reaction of br with the oxidants i e pms or other reactive species derived from the catalytic activators e g co iii in the co ii pms process in the presence of dom bro3 formation in sr aops is dramatically suppressed mainly due to the scavenging of br by dom to regenerate br the direct reaction of br with dom can hardly cause organic br obps formation while hobr obr generated through some nonradical pathways accounts for the bromination of organics moreover bro3 formation during oxidative debromination of brominated pollutants by so4 follows a similar trend to that observed in transformation of br by so4 in the presence of dom where brominated pollutants and their oxidation intermediates acting as the organic matrices account for reduction of br containing radicals even though there have already been many studies on the bro3 formation in various sr aops most experiments are conducted in synthetic waters with the spiked br which is beneficial for clarifying the reaction mechanism however actual water experiments that are important for assessing the formation potential of bro3 in practical application of sr aops are very limited so further studies with respect to the bro3 formation in actual waters are needed also the effects of some important environmental variables such as cl and other inorganic ions alkalinity on bro3 formation should be further detailed the cl2 and nh3 combined pretreatment strategies where nh2cl is generated to mask the intermediate hobr obr as nhbrcl exhibit good performance for minimizing bro3 formation by sr aops howbeit this approach has some disadvantages including the formation of undesired chlorinated byproducts through reactions of the added cl2 with organic matters in water as well as requiring high dosages of cl2 and nh3 to ensure sufficient nh2cl generation h2o2 addition to decrease bro3 formation in sr aops has been observed in a previous study but systematic researches on its efficiency and feasibility are lacking moreover addition of carbon materials such as rgo and cnt may be a promising alternative approach to mitigate bro3 formation owing to their excellent reduction capacities in earlier studies carbon materials e g powder and granular activated carbon have also been used as the efficient adsorbent for removal of bro3 from water hong et al 2016 wang et al 2010 huang and cheng 2008 therefore future research may focus on developing the novel low cost and eco friendly carbon materials with both superior reduction and adsorption capacities for application in controlling bro3 formation by sr aops since the bro3 formation is greatly dependent on the specific operational conditions the parameter optimization of sr aops e g optimization of oxidant or catalyst dosages and ph regulation may be an easy and feasible option for minimizing bro3 formation as well for another thing it seems likely that sr aops can be well applied in treatment of waters containing a high level of dom where bro3 formation is not a concerned problem declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

17966,cryptosporidiosis is one of the leading causes of diarrhoeal illness and mortality induced by protozoan pathogens worldwide as a largely waterborne disease emphasis has been given to the study of cryptosporidium spp in surface waters readily susceptible to pathogenic contamination conversely the status of cryptosporidium in potable groundwater sources generally regarded as a pristine and safe drinking water supply owing to sub soil protection remains largely unknown as such this investigation presents the first literature review aimed to ascertain the global prevalence of cryptosporidium in groundwater supply sources intended for human consumption thirty seven peer reviewed studies were identified and included in the review groundwater sample and supply detection rates estimated 10 20 indicate cryptosporidium is frequently present in domestic groundwater sources representing a latent health concern for groundwater consumers specifically sample 10 4 and source 19 1 detection rates deriving from comprehensive temporal investigations are put forward as representative of a contamination baseline for cryptosporidium in domestic groundwater supplies proposed baseline prevalence figures are largely applicable in preventive risk based catchment and groundwater quality management including the formulation of quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra notwithstanding a large geographical disparity in available investigations and lack of standardized reporting restrict the transferability of research findings overall the mechanisms responsible for cryptosporidium transport and ingress into groundwater supplies remain ambiguous representing a critical knowledge gap and denoting a distinctive lack of integration between groundwater and public health sub

cryptosporidium spp oocysts are the readily infectious and environmentally robust free living life stage of the parasite present in large numbers in the faeces of infected individuals fayer 2004

and karanis 2011 efstratiou et al 2017a murphy et al 2017 globally groundwater accounts for approximately 95 of available freshwater and represents a key source of domestic drinking water with approximately 31 5 2 2 billion people of the worlds population relying on groundwater for daily consumption murphy et al 2017 in contrast to surface water which is susceptible to the influence of both point and diffuse contamination groundwater is generally considered to be of higher quality owing to the contaminant attenuation capacity provided by overlying sub soil cover however both field studies and outbreak investigations indicate groundwater systems can be significant sources of enteric pathogens including cryptosporidium spp jin and flury 2002 hynds et al 2013 ohaiseadha et al 2017

water networks have also been tentatively linked with oocyst retention and gradual pulse release in drinking water supplies howe et al 2002 wolyniak et al 2010 chaves simões and simões 2013 kelly et

to groundwater consumers through persistent cryptosporidium contamination and enteric disease ryan et al 2016 thompson et al 2016 a recent review by murphy et al 2017 estimates a global burden of 35 2 59 4 million cases of gastrointestinal disease annually linked to groundwater sources with cryptosporidium identified as the aetiological agent in 7 outbreaks between 1948 and 2016 however epidemiological studies only represent a portion of the burden of cryptosporidiosis with most cases remaining unreported and undiagnosed even in high income countries with established surveillance systems and particularly with respect to sporadic endemic infection and localised household clusters scallan et al 2011 checkley et al 2015 it is plausible that groundwater sourced drinking water is a more important contributor to the global burden of cryptosporidiosis than expected particularly if available figures are underestimated checkley et al 2015 khalil et al 2018 the relative prevalence of cryptosporidium spp in global groundwater supplies remains largely understudied thus representing a significant knowledge gap a sound understanding of pathogen occurrence is essential to guide future research and policy in environmental quality and public health bradford and harvey 2017 accordingly the current study employed a comprehensive scoping review approach to identify extract and homogenise data from relevant literature to gain insights into the global prevalence of cryptosporidium spp in domestic groundwater supplies this investigation is expected to provide valuable insights into the potential contribution of groundwater consumption to the global burden of cryptosporidiosis emphasis was given to the role of potential extra local environmental infrastructural geographical and socio economic risk factors on cryptosporidium incidence in addition to knowledge gaps resulting from inconsistent reporting cryptosporidium detection methods and reported contamination sources pathways were also closely examined due to their importance in generating occurrence baselines and informing watershed management intervention design and policy making 2 methods 2 1 primary research

months sampling season dry wet both was attributed by linking reported sampling months with rainfall seasons derived from established climate classifications peel et al 2007 numerous investigations implemented varying volumes of source water for cryptosporidium detection and were thus classified according to the minimum reported range several studies failed to report on the use of treatment systems and or if samples were taken pre or post treatment where treatment was reported investigations often focused on cryptosporidium detection in groundwater prior to treatment i e untreated just three investigations 8 1 were wholly based on treated groundwater with chlorination employed in each as indicated above cryptosporidium oocyst are highly resistant to chemical treatment including chlorination ryan et al 2016 in all instances reported cryptosporidium oocyst counts were not adapted to study specific oocyst recovery estimates ongerth 2013 2017 a limited number of investigations

contamination sources and ingress mechanisms were often tentative and ambiguously reported with several investigations failing to identify specific sources pathways where reported potential contamination sources were simplified into two main categories based on anthropogenic and animal provenance regardless of ingress mechanism the anthropogenic category incorporates contamination from

nationally the usa and uk accounted for highest study numbers 6 and 3 studies respectively fig 2 conversely africa was associated with just one study published during the reviewed time period 1 37 2 7

irrespective of study design incorporated both dry and wet periods 14 37 8 with average sampling campaigns lasting 4 months a substantial proportion of investigations may be categorized as limited in scope with several focusing on 10 sources 12 37 32 4 analysing 9 20 groundwater samples 15 37 40 5 and restricted to a 1 year sampling campaign 19 37 51 2 table 1 fig 3 there was considerable variation in the volume of water sampled with studies focusing on 11 100 l and 101 500 l both 11 37 29 7 most common investigations analysing large volumes of water 500 l were rare 3 37 8 1 table 1 microscopy and pcr based molecular procedures were the most commonly encountered detection methods immunofluorescent assay ifa was employed in 30 37 81 1 and 19 37 51 3 studies as an analytical component instead of a stand alone method respectively pcr was generally incorporated as a component of the methodology based on previous oocyst validation via microscopy a total of 10 37 27 investigations implemented pcr techniques with only one study hawash et al 2015 entirely grounded in pcr specifically nested pcr was the most common type employed 5 10 50 with most pcr based investigations targeting multiple cryptosporidium spp genotypes all included c parvum and c hominis hawash et al 2015 was the only investigation employing pcr restricted to genetic markers at the genus level additional detection methods focused on optical procedures including electrochemilumisescence ecl lee et al 2001 and fluorescence in situ hybridization fish khoury et al 2016 a single study employed flow cytometry in conjunction with ifa khaldi et al 2011 in the context of geographical income distribution application of ifa and pcr was concentrated in high income regions with light microscopy exclusive to africa and the greater middle east fig 4 fig 5 3 4 cryptosporidium incidence and contamination sources pathways cryptosporidium oocysts and or genetic markers were positively identified in 31 37 83 7 of reviewed studies table 1 overall pooled data indicate cryptosporidium detection rates of 352 1797 19 6 and 407 3070 13 3 of groundwater supply sources and samples analysed respectively pooled values among study characteristics tend to range between 10 and 20 with several categories characterised by relatively analogous values e g urban settings private supply type table 2 several investigations reported positive cryptosporidium detection but provided no data on the number of contaminated supply sources n 4 and environmental samples n 7 there was a higher cryptosporidium detection rate among studies conducted during 2003 2012 and 2013 2019 table 2 cryptosporidium was ubiquitous across income regional and climatic categories with higher sample supply contamination rates detected in upper middle income countries 20 8 and 31 3 geographically estimated sample detection rates were highest in the greater middle east 133 640 20 8 europe accounted for most contaminated supply sources 66 248 26 6 followed by the greater middle east 123 488 25 2 and north america 107 476 22 5 table 2 geographical patterns are partially reflected in climate trends with cold and temperate regions comprising most contaminated sources at 37 6 102 271 and 31 6 137 433 respectively in the context of local environments urban settings exhibited the highest sample and supply detection rates in contrast to rural and peri urban areas particularly in terms of samples 106 461 23 private supplies had a higher sample source contamination 15 9 16 than public supplies 9 2 11 8 assessing the potential interplay between sampling design detection and seasonality extracted data indicate higher contamination rates among studies with a sampling campaign lasting 25 months with 102 241 42 3 positive sources table 2 however a higher number of samples and supply sources analysed did not directly correlate with higher cryptosporidium detection rates as evidenced by high supply source detection rates 26 45 57 8 among studies analysing 10 sources similarly investigations analysing 9 20 groundwater samples reported the highest contamination rates as indicated by the number of positive samples 61 198 30 8 furthermore in terms of contaminated samples studies undertaken during wet periods slightly featured the highest detection rates 47 323 14 6 while those incorporating both wet dry seasons accounted for most contaminated supply sources 131 605 21 7 cryptosporidium groundwater sample contamination rates were more prevalent among temporally restricted one off 16 3 than repeat sampling 10 4 studies table 2 several cryptosporidium positive studies failed to report concentration values 13 30 43 3 at a national level where reported highest average oocyst counts were recorded in saudi arabia 210 oocyst l followed by the usa 25 oocyst l and haiti 12 7 oocyst l fig 2 lee et al 2001 report the highest counts in an individual study 160 oocyst l linked to a sewage lift station failure discharge of raw sewage to surface waters and eventual source contamination via subsurface pathways in total 13 31 41 9 investigations reported likely cryptosporidium ingress mechanisms with groundwater recharge the most commonly hypothesized pathway 12 13 92 3 table 3 specific contamination sources were reported in 21 31 67 7 studies among attributed pollution sources animal origin 15 21 71 4 and specifically cattle 8 15 53 3 were reported as the predominant local source of cryptosporidium three studies tentatively linked on site domestic wastewater treatment systems with cryptosporidium occurrence with one also highlighting the potential role of land applied septage o reilly et al 2006 further latrines were tentatively associated with cryptosporidium presence in two investigations balderrama carmona et al 2015 odagiri et al 2016 c parvum was the most frequently encountered species identified through molecular procedures 74 84 88 1 fig 6 a which in contrast to other species was widespread across geographical and income categories albeit the scope of molecular detection was limited and highly concentrated in high income regions figs 4 and 6b 4 discussion 4 1 global cryptosporidium prevalence and baseline contamination rates this scoping review provides insights into the global prevalence of cryptosporidium in domestic groundwater sources based on findings from international peer reviewed literature to the authors knowledge this is the first global comprehensive scoping review of the presence of cryptosporidium spp in groundwater sources intended for human consumption a pooled supply detection rate of 19 6 suggests cryptosporidium is frequently present in groundwater sources representing a latent transmission vector and major health concern it must be noted however that the effects of publication bias i e failure to publish negative results may influence calculated estimates if the figures presented are deemed valid the assumption that domestic groundwater supply systems are largely safe from cryptosporidium contamination can be challenged estimated supply contamination rates are higher than those reported in large scale albeit regionally restricted field investigations by hancock et al 1998 8 and moulton hancock et al 2000 7 6 comparable values 14 7 for protozoan supply contamination have been reported in a review of north american groundwater systems by hynds et al 2014a as such based upon the tendency of pooled values table 2 the authors propose a plausible baseline cryptosporidium spp prevalence estimate of 10 20 among global groundwater supplies which may be used to provide category specific e g protected rural urban and private sources insights with prospective applications in water quality management and human health risk assessment a higher mean sample detection rate was reported from one off sampling designs 16 4 than that calculated for repeated sampling studies 10 4 similarly investigations analysing a limited number of groundwater samples 9 20 30 8 or supply sources 10 57 8 exhibited higher detection rates presumably due to focused proof of concept region source and or sample selection i e studies designed to show incidence of cryptosporidium spp as opposed to prevalence these selection biases have been increasingly reported as an inherent feature in the scientific literature associated with microbiological contamination of groundwater systems hynds et al 2014a andrade et al 2018 hence sample and source detection rates deriving from more inclusive temporal investigations 10 4 and 19 1 are likely subject to less bias i e source study area selection and as such may provide a more accurate reflection of cryptosporidium prevalence baseline in concurrence with this proposed prevalence baseline the lack of effective treatment reported within included studies further highlights the overreliance of both users and authorities on the presumed integrity of groundwater supplies with overarching health implications for groundwater consumers hynds et al 2013 geographically extracted data indicate a clear regional inequity among included studies tables 1 and 2 figs 2 and 5 with the focus on high income regions representing a persistent issue and concern in the worldwide surveillance of cryptosporidiosis checkley et al 2015 murphy et al 2017 efstratiou et al 2017a globally cryptosporidiosis is significantly more prevalent in lower income countries bouzid et al 2018 king et al 2019 with concomitant levels of environmental incidence expected although the geographical relevance of groundwater as a transmission vector remains to be ascertained the collated data partially reflect expectations with low sample detection rates encountered in high income countries table 2 conversely lower rates of source and sample contamination were observed in low and lower middle income countries however the limited number of studies available in these categories reporting contamination data n 3 is highly restrictive additionally there are limitations associated with allocation of income categories accounting for potentially significant country specific variability for example khoury et al 2016 report data from a refugee camp in an upper middle income country with local conditions realistically closer to a low income region overall global contamination estimates presented are constrained and additional data is necessary to accurately discern a baseline for cryptosporidium incidence within groundwater systems at the regional or national level 4 2 detection methods cryptosporidium occurrence and contamination sources the predominance of visually aided ifa or light microscopy oocyst identification in concurrence with a paucity of oocyst recovery estimates table 1 represent a significant limitation in terms of risk factor identification and stakeholder communication efstratiou et al 2017b all extracted oocyst data are technically raw data in the absence of recovery efficiency measurements and thus more appropriately defined as occurrence rather than concentration while costly and labour intensive recovery estimates are recommended for accurate cryptosporidium quantification as detection methods typically recover a fraction of oocysts present with recovery efficiency shown to widely vary 10 90 both temporally and spatially among environmental waters ongerth 2013 2017 accordingly presented estimates may under represent the actual occurrence and concentration of oocysts in groundwater supplies the reported role of oocyst viability and infectivity as secondary objectives in cryptosporidium monitoring efstratiou et al 2017b is clearly observed in the dataset with few investigations assessing viability n 4 and none employing assessment of oocyst infectivity this represents a major knowledge gap considering the reported low infective dose of cryptosporidium and potential to remain infectious in soil environments dupont et al 1995 boyer et al 2008 findings suggest that detection methods have gradually diversified with increasingly frequent use of both pcr and light microscopy fig 5 while light microscopy provides quantitative oocyst data at a reduced cost it is limited by lower sensitivity and specificity compared to other methods checkley et al 2015 adeyemo et al 2018 pcr based tools are often characterised by relatively high sensitivity nichols 2008 efstratiou et al 2017b potentially explaining the increased cryptosporidium detection rates encountered following increasing application of these methods in domestic groundwater studies tables 1 and 2 fig 5 ideally concomitant identification of species analysed from catchment based stool samples and supply sources will provide a more robust framework for representative contamination source ascription in this context only 2 10 20 of molecular based studies employed a pcr based approach comprising both stool and supply sources thus highlighting the limited extent of conclusive evidence linking contaminant sources with contaminated groundwater supplies and the urgent need for environmental prevalence investigations to employ integrative detection methods and sampling designs just two studies employed pcr tools for cryptosporidium subtype genotyping 2 10 20 representing a concern as several clinically significant c parvum subtypes e g lla llc are considered largely anthroponotic king et al 2019 nader et al 2019 potentially resulting in incorrect source attribution both stokdyk et al 2019 and lobo et al 2009 report subtype iia as being prominent among identified c parvum genotypes as such the presence of subtype iia precludes identification of human or animal groundwater contamination sources due to their capacity to employ both livestock and humans as hosts accordingly attributed contamination sources table 3 even where supported by molecular characterization should be interpreted with caution 4 3 local environments and land use comparable source detection rates were encountered in rural 21 3 and urban 22 5 areas indicating similar cryptosporidium prevalence irrespective of land use table 2 however significantly higher sample detection rates were found in urban 23 than rural settings 12 5 suggesting higher levels of environmental persistence in the former notably the number of identified urban studies was greater in lower income countries where high population density poor sanitation and livestock frequently coexist all conditions typically associated with higher incidence rates of cryptosporidiosis bouzid et al 2018 delahoy et al 2018 lal et al 2019 similarly high sample detection rates were found within upper middle and low income countries table 2 previous studies albeit focusing on high income countries have explicitly linked c hominis and c parvum with urban and rural areas respectively learmonth et al 2004 lake et al 2007 both studies identified as part of the current review which employed molecular species identification in urban areas reported the presence of c parvum only damiani et al 2013 khoury et al 2016 emphasizing the likely importance of zoonotic transmission in urban areas again caution is advised considering the potential presence of c parvum subtypes in rural environments c parvum detection dominated lake et al 2007 have previously reported a link between gastrointestinal illness groundwater consumption and c parvum prevalence from animal waste sources in rural areas of high income countries accordingly concurrent high quality pastoral land and high stocking rates may partially explain elevated cryptosporidium detection rates within upper income categories largely derived from rural settings table 2 overall the prevalence of cryptosporidium in urban groundwater environments is particularly ambiguous representing an area of focus for further research particularly in the context of low income regions characterised by high urban groundwater reliance murphy et al 2017 4 4 hydrogeology and contamination pathways as shown table 3 groundwater recharge i e gradual gravitational percolation through pores in the soil matrix and or bedrock fractures was the most frequently reported ingress mechanism 12 13 92 3 while pathway reporting is tentative largely resulting from limitations associated with the methodological approaches employed e g lack of microbial source tracking dye tracing etc this finding is unexpected considering general patterns attributed to microbial transport in the subsurface environment for example previous work by the authors hynds et al 2012 2014b o dwyer et al 2018 has shown that source and locally specific infrastructure and short term i e 5 day 10 day and 15 day antecedent rainfall are significantly predictive of bacterial presence thus indicating localised bypass preferential subsurface transport and direct source ingress as predominant contamination mechanisms in contrast to other enteropathogens e g bacteria viruses cryptosporidium oocysts are characterised by a larger size 3 6 μm thus mobilization through the subsurface profile to aquifers i e recharge while remaining viable infectious is considered less likely to occur robertson and edberg 1997 notwithstanding experimental in situ and ex situ investigations have demonstrated the ability of oocysts to migrate through soil columns although a substantial degree of soil attenuation has been observed mawdsley et al 1996 darnault et al 2004 boyer et al 2008 mohanram et al 2010 zopp et al 2016 the potential importance of groundwater recharge is best echoed by stokdyk et al 2019 with equivalent rates of cryptosporidium contamination among wells classified to be under direct influence of surface water as those without it several studies stress the role of vulnerable karstified bedrocks in the transport of cryptosporidium spp to groundwater supplies e g willocks et al 1998 o reilly et al 2006 khaldi et al 2011 damiani et al 2013 the current review found that a majority of identified studies 6 7 sampling wells located in karstic landscapes reported detection of cryptosporidium spp however reporting of hydrogeological characteristics was largely absent from the literature 29 37 78 4 contrasting with the presumed importance of recharge as a contamination pathway denoting the likelihood of overly simplified assumptions and a critical lack of understanding of cryptosporidium fate and transport to groundwater supplies overall just two investigations sampling groundwater sources across multiple hydrogeological settings described corresponding bedrock aquifer properties pitkänen et al 2015 and stokdyk et al 2019 sampled wells in multiple geological settings with the former reporting no cryptosporidium contamination and the latter encountering widespread presence regardless of local soil geological vulnerability to a degree stokdyk et al 2019 consider their results to be unexpected and potentially attributed to variables e g precipitation faulty infrastructure beyond the scope of the study 4 5 groundwater supply infrastructure protected groundwater sources exhibited high levels of cryptosporidium spp prevalence 21 4 representing a significant public health concern several investigations have reported cryptosporidium contamination of groundwater sources characterised by adequate levels of protection stressing potential links between faulty infrastructure and bedrock percolation e g willocks et al 1998 kay et al 2007 gaut et al 2008 stokdyk et al 2019 specifically cctv surveillance was used to identify casing liner cracking and soil water ingress to structurally sound sources based on wellhead assessment in two studies willocks et al 1998 gaut et al 2008 additionally studies have potentially linked the presence of cryptosporidium spp in protected sources with general well deterioration khoury et al 2016 and insufficient or absent wellhead protection kay et al 2007 nsoh et al 2016 most investigations failed to report relevant structural information thus a key insight from the current review is the pressing need for cryptosporidium prevalence investigations to explicitly record and report relevant characteristics of source structure and setting pooled source and sample detection rates associated with private 15 9 16 and public 9 2 11 8 supplies table 2 likely result from differing levels of regulation and surveillance in contrast to private supplies which are largely unregulated public sources are more likely maintained by local or regional regulatory authorities hexemer et al 2008 hynds et al 2014a analogous sample and supply detection rates in private supplies may strengthen the efficacy of proposed baseline prevalence figures 4 6 influence of climate and seasonality cryptosporidiosis has been shown to exhibit distinct seasonal peaks across latitudes due to i agricultural life cycles ii human waste production cycles and spatial profiles and iii local climate patterns e g action of rainfall for oocyst release from faecal material sterk et al 2016 lal et al 2019 additional factors including human recreational patterns and host susceptibility to infection may represent concomitant infection drivers however precipitation and human agricultural waste production are considered the primary drivers of infection sorvillo et al 1998 mathieu et al 2004 lal et al 2012 2019 review findings indicate higher sample and particularly source detection rates emanated from studies that incorporated wet periods into sampling designs table 2 while it should be noted that the employed wet dry classifications do not account for inter annual precipitation variability the association with wet phases is significant considering the effects of increased overland flow subsurface infiltration and recharge and oocyst re mobilization as potential contamination pathways table 3 current climate change projections have forecast periods of heavier more persistent rainfall forzieri et al 2017 likely initiating higher rates of recharge and or overland flow depending on the season and previous sub soil conditions particularly within systems characterised by dynamic flows e g karst and shallow water tables macdonald et al 2009 green et al 2011 bradford and harvey 2017 for example experimental investigations have shown a significant increase in cryptosporidium oocyst release from soil applied manure following high intensity rainfall boyer et al 2008 forslund et al 2011 however climate change is a multi faceted phenomenon affecting multiple processes associated with oocyst release survival and transport e g runoff dispersion dilution potentially affecting cryptosporidium species differentially with marked regional variation robertson and gjerde 2007 sterk et al 2016 intrinsically linked to desiccation which is credited as a governing force influencing oocyst degradation both temperature and solar uv radiation are among the most critical variables affecting cryptosporidium survival in the environment king and monis 2007 the influence of the two environmental variables on oocyst survival may be reflected in the higher source detection rates associated with cold 37 6 and temperate 31 6 regions although data available from arid and tropical climates is limited tables 1 and 2 oocysts survival reportedly increases at temperatures below 15 c in water and soil fayer et al 1998 jenkins et al 2002 davies et al 2004 king et al 2008 conversely exposure to higher temperatures 25 c increased uv a b insolation and consequent desiccation is likely associated with oocyst degradation robertson et al 1992 olson et al 1999 king et al 2005 2008 which could be relevant in terms of deactivation prior to subsurface mobilization particularly in arid tropical climates a higher cryptosporidium prevalence within temperate and cold climates also highlights the potential interplay between increasing livestock numbers and shifting rainfall patterns lake et al 2007 lal et al 2019 table 2 4 7 study limitations the marked lack of standardized reporting and an uneven geographical distribution of relevant studies represent primary limitations of the current study providing an accurate synthesis of the global prevalence of cryptosporidium in groundwater sources is an extremely difficult task the relatively limited number of studies identified represents a critical research gap in the closely aligned areas of environmental quality and enteric disease epidemiology nevertheless considering the level of geographical bias encountered findings should be employed cautiously similarly several identified studies fail to establish conclusive links between cryptosporidium presence and extra local risk factors while incomplete reporting of contamination data including sample source rates and oocyst occurrence potentially restrict the transferability of research findings as such access to increasingly detailed and accurate contamination data is central to inform and improve watershed management surveillance systems and policymaking 5 conclusions to the authors knowledge this is the first global comprehensive scoping review of the presence of cryptosporidium spp in groundwater sources intended for human consumption prevalence figures 10 20 derived from reviewed investigations provide an unprecedented baseline for cryptosporidium contamination of domestic groundwater sources the probability of bias associated with proof of concept in several investigations indicate that sample 10 4 and source 19 1 detection rates from temporal investigations are likely most representative of cryptosporidium prevalence baselines frequent occurrence of cryptosporidium spp in domestic groundwater supply sources is a topical health concern of direct relevance to public health authorities and groundwater consumers alike analogous detection rates in urban and rural settings highlight the vulnerability of groundwater sources to cryptosporidium contamination regardless of expected land use and population density although this feature may be subject to a local income specific dimension overall findings may be used to elucidate the potential health risks associated with groundwater contamination and inform watershed and groundwater management strategies estimated baselines are highly applicable and fundamental in the formulation of preventive risk based approaches employed in groundwater quality management including quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra and hydrodynamic catchment modelling a key highlight from this investigation is the current ambiguity regarding cryptosporidium transport and ingress to domestic groundwater sources denoting a lack of cohesion and urgent need for integration between hydrogeological epidemiological and public health sub disciplines the following recommendations are made based on their potential to guide and integrate groundwater and public health research towards an interdisciplinary approach i explicit and homogeneous reporting in investigations ii implementation of temporal and unbiased large scale investigations incorporating different settings e g hydrogeological urban rural and iii studies employing high sensitivity and specificity molecular methods effectively linking land groundwater species subtype data contamination sources pathways and groundwater supplies these recommendations largely rely on improved methodology and sampling design with the elevated costs associated with cryptosporidium monitoring ultimately dictating the choice of surveillance approach implemented hence

17966,cryptosporidiosis is one of the leading causes of diarrhoeal illness and mortality induced by protozoan pathogens worldwide as a largely waterborne disease emphasis has been given to the study of cryptosporidium spp in surface waters readily susceptible to pathogenic contamination conversely the status of cryptosporidium in potable groundwater sources generally regarded as a pristine and safe drinking water supply owing to sub soil protection remains largely unknown as such this investigation presents the first literature review aimed to ascertain the global prevalence of cryptosporidium in groundwater supply sources intended for human consumption thirty seven peer reviewed studies were identified and included in the review groundwater sample and supply detection rates estimated 10 20 indicate cryptosporidium is frequently present in domestic groundwater sources representing a latent health concern for groundwater consumers specifically sample 10 4 and source 19 1 detection rates deriving from comprehensive temporal investigations are put forward as representative of a contamination baseline for cryptosporidium in domestic groundwater supplies proposed baseline prevalence figures are largely applicable in preventive risk based catchment and groundwater quality management including the formulation of quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra notwithstanding a large geographical disparity in available investigations and lack of standardized reporting restrict the transferability of research findings overall the mechanisms responsible for cryptosporidium transport and ingress into groundwater supplies remain ambiguous representing a critical knowledge gap and denoting a distinctive lack of integration between groundwater and public health sub disciplines among investigations key recommendations and guidelines are provided for prospective studies directed at more integrative and multi disciplinary research graphical abstract image 1

and karanis 2011 efstratiou et al 2017a murphy et al 2017 globally groundwater accounts for approximately 95 of available freshwater and represents a key source of domestic drinking water with approximately 31 5 2 2 billion people of the worlds population relying on groundwater for daily consumption murphy et al 2017 in contrast to surface water which is susceptible to the influence of both point and diffuse contamination groundwater is generally considered to be of higher quality owing to the contaminant attenuation capacity provided by overlying sub soil cover however both field studies and outbreak investigations indicate groundwater systems can be significant sources of enteric pathogens including cryptosporidium spp jin and flury 2002 hynds et al 2013 ohaiseadha et al 2017 stokdyk et al 2019 recent advances into cryptosporidium biology including new insights into phylogenetics and life stage cycles have led to its taxonomic reclassification from coccidian to gregarine subclass cryptogregaria karanis and aldeyarbi 2011 aldeyarbi and karanis 2016 thompson et al 2016 as such cryptosporidium spp are now acknowledged for their capability to reproduce outside a living host clode et al 2015 ryan et al 2016 and have been shown in vitro to benefit from the environments provided by biofilms koh et al 2013 2014 luo et al 2017 biofilms which can proliferate in domestic water networks have also been tentatively linked with oocyst retention and gradual pulse release in drinking water supplies howe et al 2002 wolyniak et al 2010 chaves simões and simões 2013 kelly et al 2014 accordingly under certain conditions cryptosporidium spp have the potential ability to aggregate and freely multiply in engineered water supplies and hypothetically pose a significant threat to groundwater consumers through persistent cryptosporidium contamination and enteric disease ryan et al 2016 thompson et al 2016 a recent review by murphy et al 2017 estimates a global burden of 35 2 59 4 million cases of gastrointestinal disease annually linked to groundwater sources with cryptosporidium identified as the aetiological agent in 7 outbreaks between 1948 and 2016 however epidemiological studies only represent a portion of the burden of cryptosporidiosis with most cases remaining unreported and undiagnosed even in high income countries with established surveillance systems and particularly with respect to sporadic endemic infection and localised household clusters scallan et al 2011 checkley et al 2015 it is plausible that groundwater sourced drinking water is a more important contributor to the global burden of cryptosporidiosis than expected particularly if available figures are underestimated checkley et al 2015 khalil et al 2018 the relative prevalence of cryptosporidium spp in global groundwater supplies remains largely understudied thus representing a significant knowledge gap a sound understanding of pathogen occurrence is essential to guide future research and policy in environmental quality and public health bradford and harvey 2017 accordingly the current study employed a comprehensive scoping review approach to identify extract and homogenise data from relevant literature to gain insights into the global prevalence of cryptosporidium spp in domestic groundwater supplies this investigation is expected to provide valuable insights into the potential contribution of groundwater consumption to the global burden of cryptosporidiosis emphasis was given to the role of potential extra local environmental infrastructural geographical and socio economic risk factors on cryptosporidium incidence in addition to knowledge gaps resulting from inconsistent reporting cryptosporidium detection methods and reported contamination sources pathways were also closely examined due to their importance in generating occurrence baselines and informing watershed management intervention design and policy making 2 methods 2 1 primary research question database sources and literature identification the overarching scoping review protocol fig 1 has been adapted from several previous studies sargeant et al 2006 graham and polizzotto 2013 hynds et al 2014a andrade et al 2018 the developed primary research question guiding the review was what is the global prevalence of cryptosporidium spp in groundwater supplies intended for human consumption what are the commonly reported contamination sources pathways and which detection methods are implemented for identification literature searches were conducted on june 1st 2019 and confined to scopus and web of science bibliographic databases key search terms were based on a modified version of the population outcome agent poa model hynds et al 2014a table s1 supplemental material comprising specific categories of search terms employed to direct structured literature searches with trial searches using a separate outcome search term category e g cryptosporidiosis contamination pollution outbreak presence incidence found to significantly restrict the number of identified articles n 80 accordingly a combination of search terms from agent and outcome categories were chosen to expand the search scope table s1 supplemental material database searches employed boolean positional operators and or with same adj to focus literature scans 2 1 1 literature screening and study selection phase 1 identification resulted in 539 identified records with de duplication reducing this number to 384 fig 1 phases 2 3 screening and eligibility comprised an iterative record selection process guided by pre established eligibility criteria table s2 supplemental material firstly screening of each article title and abstract was undertaken leading to exclusion of records deemed unsuitable per defined eligibility forward selected articles were then subject to full text analysis using the same eligibility approach conference proceedings short communications and surveillance academic reviews were excluded at this stage primary inclusion parameters included i original and full text research articles ii english language articles iii investigations based on groundwater sources intended for domestic consumption iv analysis of cryptosporidium oocyst or genetic marker detection in groundwater samples from relevant sources and v investigations analysing 9 individual water samples viz bain et al 2014 excluded records included i articles reviewing or analysing previously published data on cryptosporidium groundwater occurrence ii investigations focusing on non domestic groundwater water treatment facilities or in situ and ex situ experimental settings including cryptosporidium tracer removal investigations e g soil column transport river bank

literature identification n 3 additional articles were identified through a manual screening of article bibliographies during phase 3 n 13 all publications citing each record analysed in phase 3 were screened using the cite by tool in google scholar n 3 with potential articles identified outside the review protocol subsequently analysed for inclusion exclusion during phases 2 3 fig 1 2 2 data

e g hydrogeology supply age with variables thus categorized as not reported based on the encountered geographical distribution a modified version of the world health organization who world health organization who 2019 regional classification was used to categorize studies regions include south east asia africa europe greater middle east north america latin america caribbean and western pacific similarly each study was classified according to income levels high upper middle lower middle low united nations un 2017 main climate classifications followed the five main categories of the köppen geiger classification system peel et al 2007 and were based on specific geographic locations when described investigations with a large geographical scope and ambiguous sampling locations were assigned an unknown climate category settlement type rural urban mixed classification was based on study site descriptions investigations classified as not reported generally involved sampling of multiple unspecified locations in large scale i e national provincial monitoring groundwater supply sources were grouped into two main categories adapted from bain et al 2014 namely protected boreholes wells tubewells drilled wells driven wells and unimproved artesian wells dug wells supply sources thus reflecting their degree of design and construction in some instances classifications were tentative due to ambiguous structural descriptions excluding one investigation 1 month all repeated sampling designs i e individual sources sampled on 1 occasion involved a sampling duration 6 months sampling season dry wet both was attributed by linking reported sampling months with rainfall seasons derived from established climate classifications peel et al 2007 numerous investigations implemented varying volumes of source water for cryptosporidium detection and were thus classified according to the minimum reported range several studies failed to report on the use of treatment systems and or if samples were taken pre or post treatment where treatment was reported investigations often focused on cryptosporidium detection in groundwater prior to treatment i e untreated just three investigations 8 1 were wholly based on treated groundwater with chlorination employed in each as indicated above cryptosporidium oocyst are highly resistant to chemical treatment including chlorination ryan et al 2016 in all instances reported cryptosporidium oocyst counts were not adapted to study specific oocyst recovery estimates ongerth 2013 2017 a limited number of investigations reported recovery estimates but were directed towards evaluating the efficiency of concentration methods employed on an unspecified number of samples classification of contamination ingress mechanisms were based on four main definitions hynds et al 2012 andrade et al 2018 i direct surface water ingress ii direct underground migration iii inter aquifer exchange and iv groundwater recharge likely contamination sources and ingress mechanisms were often tentative and ambiguously reported with several investigations failing to identify specific sources pathways where reported potential contamination sources were simplified into two main categories based on anthropogenic and animal provenance regardless of ingress mechanism the anthropogenic category incorporates contamination from domestic industrial wastewater infrastructure e g septic tanks latrines municipal wastewater plants solid waste and land application of septage animal origin comprises all sources associated with agricultural activity including livestock faeces and manure spreading or storage waste sources from domestic household animals and wildlife are also included in this group 3 results 3 1 included studies and spatiotemporal distribution a total of 37 relevant studies were identified during the review process and subject to data extraction and synthesis fig 1 summary statistics extracted from included studies are provided in tables 1 3 with study details provided in excel table s1 supplemental material the geographical distribution of identified studies number per country and aggregated oocyst detection data are presented in fig 2 included literature spans a period of 27 years 1992 to july 2019 with most investigations conducted between 2013 and 2019 16 37 43 2 table 1 a majority of included studies derived from europe 13 37 35 1 and north america 8 37 21 6 with almost half the total number of pooled groundwater samples associated with north american studies 1753 4008 43 7 nationally the usa and uk accounted for highest study numbers 6 and 3 studies respectively fig 2 conversely africa was associated with just one study published during the reviewed time period 1 37 2 7 nsoh et al 2016 this geographical distribution is also reflected across income categories with most studies 22 37 59 5 and samples 2749 4008 68 6 deriving from categorically high income regions 3 2 study design regions and groundwater supplies the majority of investigations followed an environmental occurrence design 33 37 89 2 with just four studies prompted by outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness 10 8 all outbreak related investigations originated from high income countries usa 3 uk 1 most studies were based in distinctively rural settings 23 37 62 2 followed by urban 7 37 18 9 and mixed i e peri urban or following an urban rural sampling gradient 5 37 13 5 environments urban settings were concentrated in low n 3 lower middle n 1 and upper middle n 3 income countries with no urban investigations from high income categories overall 64 8 24 37 of included studies were based in temperate 17 37 45 9 or cold 7 37 18 9 climates equating to 58 9 2360 4008 of samples analysed information relating to local hydro geology was largely absent from reviewed literature 78 4 29 37 of investigations failed to report relevant data e g bedrock aquifer sub soil type public private and mixed supply types had an even study representation 24 3 9 37 most investigations focused on groundwater sources with a presumed level of infrastructural protection 29 37 78 3 with just 5 37 13 5 studies explicitly incorporating likely unimproved artesian wells dug wells supplies the latter primarily derived from low and lower middle income countries with a single study from a high income region pitkänen et al 2015 3 3 sampling design and detection methods the majority of investigations were based on one off i e prevalence source sampling design 23 37 62 2 table 1 however most studies irrespective of study design incorporated both dry and wet periods 14 37 8 with average sampling campaigns lasting 4 months a substantial proportion of investigations may be categorized as limited in scope with several focusing on 10 sources 12 37 32 4 analysing 9 20 groundwater samples 15 37 40 5 and restricted to a 1 year sampling campaign 19 37 51 2 table 1 fig 3 there was considerable variation in the volume of water sampled with studies focusing on 11 100 l and 101 500 l both 11 37 29 7 most common investigations analysing large volumes of water 500 l were rare 3 37 8 1 table 1 microscopy and pcr based molecular procedures were the most commonly encountered detection methods immunofluorescent assay ifa was employed in 30 37 81 1 and 19 37 51 3 studies as an analytical component instead of a stand alone method respectively pcr was generally incorporated as a component of the methodology based on previous oocyst validation via microscopy a total of 10 37 27 investigations implemented pcr techniques with only one study hawash et al 2015 entirely grounded in pcr specifically nested pcr was the most common type employed 5 10 50 with most pcr based investigations targeting multiple cryptosporidium spp genotypes all included c parvum and c hominis hawash et al 2015 was the only investigation employing pcr restricted to genetic markers at the genus level additional detection methods focused on optical procedures including electrochemilumisescence ecl lee et al 2001 and fluorescence in situ hybridization fish khoury et al 2016 a single study employed flow cytometry in conjunction with ifa khaldi et al 2011 in the context of geographical income distribution application of ifa and pcr was concentrated in high income regions with light microscopy exclusive to africa and the greater middle east fig 4 fig 5 3 4 cryptosporidium incidence and contamination sources pathways cryptosporidium oocysts and or genetic markers were positively identified in 31 37 83 7 of reviewed studies table 1 overall pooled data indicate cryptosporidium detection rates of 352 1797 19 6 and 407 3070 13 3 of groundwater supply sources and samples analysed respectively pooled values among study characteristics tend to range between 10 and 20 with several categories characterised by relatively analogous values e g urban settings private supply type table 2 several investigations reported positive cryptosporidium detection but provided no data on the number of contaminated supply sources n 4 and environmental samples n 7 there was a higher cryptosporidium detection rate among studies conducted during 2003 2012 and 2013 2019 table 2 cryptosporidium was ubiquitous across income regional and climatic categories with higher sample supply contamination rates detected in upper middle income countries 20 8 and 31 3 geographically estimated sample detection rates were highest in the greater middle east 133 640 20 8 europe accounted for most contaminated supply sources 66 248 26 6 followed by the greater middle east 123 488 25 2 and north america 107 476 22 5 table 2 geographical patterns are partially reflected in climate trends with cold and temperate regions comprising most contaminated sources at 37 6 102 271 and 31 6 137 433 respectively in the context of local environments urban settings exhibited the highest sample and supply detection rates in contrast to rural and peri urban areas particularly in terms of samples 106 461 23 private supplies had a higher sample source contamination 15 9 16 than public supplies 9 2 11 8 assessing the potential interplay between sampling design detection and seasonality extracted data indicate higher contamination rates among studies with a sampling campaign lasting 25 months with 102 241 42 3 positive sources table 2 however a higher number of samples and supply sources analysed did not directly correlate with higher cryptosporidium detection rates as evidenced by high supply source detection rates 26 45 57 8 among studies analysing 10 sources similarly investigations analysing 9 20 groundwater samples reported the highest contamination rates as indicated by the number of positive samples 61 198 30 8 furthermore in terms of contaminated samples studies undertaken during wet periods slightly featured the highest detection rates 47 323 14 6 while those incorporating both wet dry seasons accounted for most contaminated supply sources 131 605 21 7 cryptosporidium groundwater sample contamination rates were more prevalent among temporally restricted one off 16 3 than repeat sampling 10 4 studies table 2 several cryptosporidium positive studies failed to report concentration values 13 30 43 3 at a national level where reported highest average oocyst counts were recorded in saudi arabia 210 oocyst l followed by the usa 25 oocyst l and haiti 12 7 oocyst l fig 2 lee et al 2001 report the highest counts in an individual study 160 oocyst l linked to a sewage lift station failure discharge of raw sewage to surface waters and eventual source contamination via subsurface pathways in total 13 31 41 9 investigations reported likely cryptosporidium ingress mechanisms with groundwater recharge the most commonly hypothesized pathway 12 13 92 3 table 3 specific contamination sources were reported in 21 31 67 7 studies among attributed pollution sources animal origin 15 21 71 4 and specifically cattle 8 15 53 3 were reported as the predominant local source of cryptosporidium three studies tentatively linked on site domestic wastewater treatment systems with cryptosporidium occurrence with one also highlighting the potential role of land applied septage o reilly et al 2006 further latrines were tentatively associated with cryptosporidium presence in two investigations balderrama carmona et al 2015 odagiri et al 2016 c parvum was the most frequently encountered species identified through molecular procedures 74 84 88 1 fig 6 a which in contrast to other species was widespread across geographical and income categories albeit the scope of molecular detection was limited and highly concentrated in high income regions figs 4 and 6b 4 discussion 4 1 global cryptosporidium prevalence and baseline contamination rates this scoping review provides insights into the global prevalence of cryptosporidium in domestic groundwater sources based on findings from international peer reviewed literature to the authors knowledge this is the first global comprehensive scoping review of the presence of cryptosporidium spp in groundwater sources intended for human consumption a pooled supply detection rate of 19 6 suggests cryptosporidium is frequently present in groundwater sources representing a latent transmission vector and major health concern it must be noted however that the effects of publication bias i e failure to publish negative results may influence calculated estimates if the figures presented are deemed valid the assumption that domestic groundwater supply systems are largely safe from cryptosporidium contamination can be challenged estimated supply contamination rates are higher than those reported in large scale albeit regionally restricted field investigations by hancock et al 1998 8 and moulton hancock et al 2000 7 6 comparable values 14 7 for protozoan supply contamination have been reported in a review of north american groundwater systems by hynds et al 2014a as such based upon the tendency of pooled values table 2 the authors propose a plausible baseline cryptosporidium spp prevalence estimate of 10 20 among global groundwater supplies which may be used to provide category specific e g protected rural urban and private sources insights with prospective applications in water quality management and human health risk assessment a higher mean sample detection rate was reported from one off sampling designs 16 4 than that calculated for repeated sampling studies 10 4 similarly investigations analysing a limited number of groundwater samples 9 20 30 8 or supply sources 10 57 8 exhibited higher detection rates presumably due to focused proof of concept region source and or sample selection i e studies designed to show incidence of cryptosporidium spp as opposed to prevalence these selection biases have been increasingly reported as an inherent feature in the scientific literature associated with microbiological contamination of groundwater systems hynds et al 2014a andrade et al 2018 hence sample and source detection rates deriving from more inclusive temporal investigations 10 4 and 19 1 are likely subject to less bias i e source study area selection and as such may provide a more accurate reflection of cryptosporidium prevalence baseline in concurrence with this proposed prevalence baseline the lack of effective treatment reported within included studies further highlights the overreliance of both users and authorities on the presumed integrity of groundwater supplies with overarching health implications for groundwater consumers hynds et al 2013 geographically extracted data indicate a clear regional inequity among included studies tables 1 and 2 figs 2 and 5 with the focus on high income regions representing a persistent issue and concern in the worldwide surveillance of cryptosporidiosis checkley et al 2015 murphy et al 2017 efstratiou et al 2017a globally cryptosporidiosis is significantly more prevalent in lower income countries bouzid et al 2018 king et al 2019 with concomitant levels of environmental incidence expected although the geographical relevance of groundwater as a transmission vector remains to be ascertained the collated data partially reflect expectations with low sample detection rates encountered in high income countries table 2 conversely lower rates of source and sample contamination were observed in low and lower middle income countries however the limited number of studies available in these categories reporting contamination data n 3 is highly restrictive additionally there are limitations associated with allocation of income categories accounting for potentially significant country specific variability for example khoury et al 2016 report data from a refugee camp in an upper middle income country with local conditions realistically closer to a low income region overall global contamination estimates presented are constrained and additional data is necessary to accurately discern a baseline for cryptosporidium incidence within groundwater systems at the regional or national level 4 2 detection methods cryptosporidium occurrence and contamination sources the predominance of visually aided ifa or light microscopy oocyst identification in concurrence with a paucity of oocyst recovery estimates table 1 represent a significant limitation in terms of risk factor identification and stakeholder communication efstratiou et al 2017b all extracted oocyst data are technically raw data in the absence of recovery efficiency measurements and thus more appropriately defined as occurrence rather than concentration while costly and labour intensive recovery estimates are recommended for accurate cryptosporidium quantification as detection methods typically recover a fraction of oocysts present with recovery efficiency shown to widely vary 10 90 both temporally and spatially among environmental waters ongerth 2013 2017 accordingly presented estimates may under represent the actual occurrence and concentration of oocysts in groundwater supplies the reported role of oocyst viability and infectivity as secondary objectives in cryptosporidium monitoring efstratiou et al 2017b is clearly observed in the dataset with few investigations assessing viability n 4 and none employing assessment of oocyst infectivity this represents a major knowledge gap considering the reported low infective dose of cryptosporidium and potential to remain infectious in soil environments dupont et al 1995 boyer et al 2008 findings suggest that detection methods have gradually diversified with increasingly frequent use of both pcr and light microscopy fig 5 while light microscopy provides quantitative oocyst data at a reduced cost it is limited by lower sensitivity and specificity compared to other methods checkley et al 2015 adeyemo et al 2018 pcr based tools are often characterised by relatively high sensitivity nichols 2008 efstratiou et al 2017b potentially explaining the increased cryptosporidium detection rates encountered following increasing application of these methods in domestic groundwater studies tables 1 and 2 fig 5 ideally concomitant identification of species analysed from catchment based stool samples and supply sources will provide a more robust framework for representative contamination source ascription in this context only 2 10 20 of molecular based studies employed a pcr based approach comprising both stool and supply sources thus highlighting the limited extent of conclusive evidence linking contaminant sources with contaminated groundwater supplies and the urgent need for environmental prevalence investigations to employ integrative detection methods and sampling designs just two studies employed pcr tools for cryptosporidium subtype genotyping 2 10 20 representing a concern as several clinically significant c parvum subtypes e g lla llc are considered largely anthroponotic king et al 2019 nader et al 2019 potentially resulting in incorrect source attribution both stokdyk et al 2019 and lobo et al 2009 report subtype iia as being prominent among identified c parvum genotypes as such the presence of subtype iia precludes identification of human or animal groundwater contamination sources due to their capacity to employ both livestock and humans as hosts accordingly attributed contamination sources table 3 even where supported by molecular characterization should be interpreted with caution 4 3 local environments and land use comparable source detection rates were encountered in rural 21 3 and urban 22 5 areas indicating similar cryptosporidium prevalence irrespective of land use table 2 however significantly higher sample detection rates were found in urban 23 than rural settings 12 5 suggesting higher levels of environmental persistence in the former notably the number of identified urban studies was greater in lower income countries where high population density poor sanitation and livestock frequently coexist all conditions typically associated with higher incidence rates of cryptosporidiosis bouzid et al 2018 delahoy et al 2018 lal et al 2019 similarly high sample detection rates were found within upper middle and low income countries table 2 previous studies albeit focusing on high income countries have explicitly linked c hominis and c parvum with urban and rural areas respectively learmonth et al 2004 lake et al 2007 both studies identified as part of the current review which employed molecular species identification in urban areas reported the presence of c parvum only damiani et al 2013 khoury et al 2016 emphasizing the likely importance of zoonotic transmission in urban areas again caution is advised considering the potential presence of c parvum subtypes in rural environments c parvum detection dominated lake et al 2007 have previously reported a link between gastrointestinal illness groundwater consumption and c parvum prevalence from animal waste sources in rural areas of high income countries accordingly concurrent high quality pastoral land and high stocking rates may partially explain elevated cryptosporidium detection rates within upper income categories largely derived from rural settings table 2 overall the prevalence of cryptosporidium in urban groundwater environments is particularly ambiguous representing an area of focus for further research particularly in the context of low income regions characterised by high urban groundwater reliance murphy et al 2017 4 4 hydrogeology and contamination pathways as shown table 3 groundwater recharge i e gradual gravitational percolation through pores in the soil matrix and or bedrock fractures was the most frequently reported ingress mechanism 12 13 92 3 while pathway reporting is tentative largely resulting from limitations associated with the methodological approaches employed e g lack of microbial source tracking dye tracing etc this finding is unexpected considering general patterns attributed to microbial transport in the subsurface environment for example previous work by the authors hynds et al 2012 2014b o dwyer et al 2018 has shown that source and locally specific infrastructure and short term i e 5 day 10 day and 15 day antecedent rainfall are significantly predictive of bacterial presence thus indicating localised bypass preferential subsurface transport and direct source ingress as predominant contamination mechanisms in contrast to other enteropathogens e g bacteria viruses cryptosporidium oocysts are characterised by a larger size 3 6 μm thus mobilization through the subsurface profile to aquifers i e recharge while remaining viable infectious is considered less likely to occur robertson and edberg 1997 notwithstanding experimental in situ and ex situ investigations have demonstrated the ability of oocysts to migrate through soil columns although a substantial degree of soil attenuation has been observed mawdsley et al 1996 darnault et al 2004 boyer et al 2008 mohanram et al 2010 zopp et al 2016 the potential importance of groundwater recharge is best echoed by stokdyk et al 2019 with equivalent rates of cryptosporidium contamination among wells classified to be under direct influence of surface water as those without it several studies stress the role of vulnerable karstified bedrocks in the transport of cryptosporidium spp to groundwater supplies e g willocks et al 1998 o reilly et al 2006 khaldi et al 2011 damiani et al 2013 the current review found that a majority of identified studies 6 7 sampling wells located in karstic landscapes reported detection of cryptosporidium spp however reporting of hydrogeological characteristics was largely absent from the literature 29 37 78 4 contrasting with the presumed importance of recharge as a contamination pathway denoting the likelihood of overly simplified assumptions and a critical lack of understanding of cryptosporidium fate and transport to groundwater supplies overall just two investigations sampling groundwater sources across multiple hydrogeological settings described corresponding bedrock aquifer properties pitkänen et al 2015 and stokdyk et al 2019 sampled wells in multiple geological settings with the former reporting no cryptosporidium contamination and the latter encountering widespread presence regardless of local soil geological vulnerability to a degree stokdyk et al 2019 consider their results to be unexpected and potentially attributed to variables e g precipitation faulty infrastructure beyond the scope of the study 4 5 groundwater supply infrastructure protected groundwater sources exhibited high levels of cryptosporidium spp prevalence 21 4 representing a significant public health concern several investigations have reported cryptosporidium contamination of groundwater sources characterised by adequate levels of protection stressing potential links between faulty infrastructure and bedrock percolation e g willocks et al 1998 kay et al 2007 gaut et al 2008 stokdyk et al 2019 specifically cctv surveillance was used to identify casing liner cracking and soil water ingress to structurally sound sources based on wellhead assessment in two studies willocks et al 1998 gaut et al 2008 additionally studies have potentially linked the presence of cryptosporidium spp in protected sources with general well deterioration khoury et al 2016 and insufficient or absent wellhead protection kay et al 2007 nsoh et al 2016 most investigations failed to report relevant structural information thus a key insight from the current review is the pressing need for cryptosporidium prevalence investigations to explicitly record and report relevant characteristics of source structure and setting pooled source and sample detection rates associated with private 15 9 16 and public 9 2 11 8 supplies table 2 likely result from differing levels of regulation and surveillance in contrast to private supplies which are largely unregulated public sources are more likely maintained by local or regional regulatory authorities hexemer et al 2008 hynds et al 2014a analogous sample and supply detection rates in private supplies may strengthen the efficacy of proposed baseline prevalence figures 4 6 influence of climate and seasonality cryptosporidiosis has been shown to exhibit distinct seasonal peaks across latitudes due to i agricultural life cycles ii human waste production cycles and spatial profiles and iii local climate patterns e g action of rainfall for oocyst release from faecal material sterk et al 2016 lal et al 2019 additional factors including human recreational patterns and host susceptibility to infection may represent concomitant infection drivers however precipitation and human agricultural waste production are considered the primary drivers of infection sorvillo et al 1998 mathieu et al 2004 lal et al 2012 2019 review findings indicate higher sample and particularly source detection rates emanated from studies that incorporated wet periods into sampling designs table 2 while it should be noted that the employed wet dry classifications do not account for inter annual precipitation variability the association with wet phases is significant considering the effects of increased overland flow subsurface infiltration and recharge and oocyst re mobilization as potential contamination pathways table 3 current climate change projections have forecast periods of heavier more persistent rainfall forzieri et al 2017 likely initiating higher rates of recharge and or overland flow depending on the season and previous sub soil conditions particularly within systems characterised by dynamic flows e g karst and shallow water tables macdonald et al 2009 green et al 2011 bradford and harvey 2017 for example experimental investigations have shown a significant increase in cryptosporidium oocyst release from soil applied manure following high intensity rainfall boyer et al 2008 forslund et al 2011 however climate change is a multi faceted phenomenon affecting multiple processes associated with oocyst release survival and transport e g runoff dispersion dilution potentially affecting cryptosporidium species differentially with marked regional variation robertson and gjerde 2007 sterk et al 2016 intrinsically linked to desiccation which is credited as a governing force influencing oocyst degradation both temperature and solar uv radiation are among the most critical variables affecting cryptosporidium survival in the environment king and monis 2007 the influence of the two environmental variables on oocyst survival may be reflected in the higher source detection rates associated with cold 37 6 and temperate 31 6 regions although data available from arid and tropical climates is limited tables 1 and 2 oocysts survival reportedly increases at temperatures below 15 c in water and soil fayer et al 1998 jenkins et

et al 1992 olson et al 1999 king et al 2005 2008 which could be relevant in terms of deactivation prior to subsurface mobilization particularly in arid tropical climates a higher cryptosporidium prevalence within temperate and cold climates also highlights the potential interplay between increasing livestock numbers and shifting rainfall patterns lake et al 2007 lal et al 2019 table 2 4 7 study limitations the marked lack of standardized reporting and an uneven geographical distribution of relevant studies represent primary limitations of the current study providing an accurate synthesis of the global prevalence of cryptosporidium in groundwater sources is an extremely difficult task the relatively limited number of studies identified represents a critical research gap in the closely aligned areas of environmental quality and enteric disease epidemiology nevertheless considering the level of geographical bias encountered findings should be employed cautiously similarly several identified studies fail to establish conclusive links between cryptosporidium presence and extra local risk factors while incomplete reporting of contamination data including sample source rates and oocyst occurrence potentially restrict the transferability of research findings as such access to increasingly detailed and accurate contamination data is central to inform and improve watershed management surveillance systems and policymaking 5 conclusions to the authors knowledge this is the first global comprehensive scoping review of the presence of cryptosporidium spp in groundwater sources intended for human consumption prevalence figures 10 20 derived from reviewed investigations provide an unprecedented baseline for cryptosporidium contamination of domestic groundwater sources the probability of bias associated with proof of concept in several investigations indicate that sample 10 4 and source 19 1 detection rates from temporal investigations are likely most representative of cryptosporidium prevalence baselines frequent occurrence of cryptosporidium spp in domestic groundwater supply sources is a topical health concern of direct relevance to public health authorities and groundwater consumers alike analogous detection rates in urban and rural settings highlight the vulnerability of groundwater sources to cryptosporidium contamination regardless of expected land use and population density although this feature may be subject to a local income specific dimension overall findings may be used to elucidate the potential health risks associated with groundwater contamination and inform watershed and groundwater management strategies estimated baselines are highly applicable and fundamental in the formulation of preventive risk based approaches employed in groundwater quality management including quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra and hydrodynamic catchment modelling a key highlight from this investigation is the current ambiguity regarding cryptosporidium transport and ingress to domestic groundwater sources denoting a lack of cohesion and urgent need for integration between hydrogeological epidemiological and public health sub disciplines the following recommendations are made based on their potential to guide and integrate groundwater and public health research towards an interdisciplinary approach i explicit and homogeneous reporting in investigations ii implementation of temporal and unbiased large scale investigations incorporating different settings e g hydrogeological urban rural and iii studies employing high sensitivity and specificity molecular methods effectively linking land groundwater species subtype data contamination sources pathways and groundwater supplies these recommendations largely rely on improved methodology and sampling design with the elevated costs associated with cryptosporidium monitoring ultimately dictating the choice of surveillance approach implemented hence overall efforts need to be directed towards providing access to affordable efficient integrative and sensitive cryptosporidium detection methods applicable in groundwater monitoring declaration of

17967,for comprehensive insights into the effects of multiple disinfection regimes on antibiotic resistome in drinking water this study utilized metagenomic approaches to reveal the changing patterns of antibiotic resistance genes args and bacterial community as well as their associations a total of 297 args within 17 types were detected in the drinking water and their total relative abundance ranged from 195 49 24 85 to 626 31 38 61 copies of args per cell the total arg abundance was significantly increased after the antimicrobial resin and ultraviolet ar uv disinfection while significantly decreased after the ozone and chlorine o3 cl2 disinfection and remained stable after ar cl2 disinfection overall 18 args including baca mext and bla oxa 12 mainly affiliated to bacitracin multidrug and beta lactam were persistent and discriminative during all the disinfection strategies in drinking water and they were considered as key args that represent the antibiotic resistome during drinking water disinfection additionally possible hosts of 50 key args were revealed based on co occurrence network during multiple disinfection processes the change of fusobacteriales and aeromonadaceae in abundance mainly contributed to the abundance shift of baca and pseudomonas mainly increased the abundance of mext these findings indicated that bacterial community shift may be the key factor driving the change of antibiotic resistome during disinfection the strong association between antibiotic resistome alteration and bacterial community shift proposed in this study may enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanism of the disinfection effects on antibiotic resistance and benefit effective measures to improve safety of drinking water graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotic resistance genes bacterial community shift disinfection strategy drinking water high throughput sequencing 1 introduction emergence and proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args in the environment have become a global public health issue pruden et al 2006 notably a growing number of studies have demonstrated that arb and args are prevalent in drinking water hao et al 2019 ma et al 2017 indicating that drinking water may serve as an important and unavoidable pathway for human exposure via digestion or inhalation args often co occur with mobile genetic elements mges which facilitate their transmission to recipient hosts and thus generate new resistant strains yu et al 2016 more seriously it will undermine the therapeutic effect of antibiotics on human infectious diseases once these args are acquired by clinical pathogens chen et al 2015 in waterworks disinfection is the last and most solid barrier that prevents potential pathogens from spreading to the tap water and has been proven effective in reducing waterborne diseases moreover disinfection is also regarded as the crucial process in controlling arg dissemination in drinking water treatment plants dwtps mckinney and pruden 2012 it has been basically confirmed that disinfection can effectively reduce the absolute abundance copies per ml water of args in drinking water guo et al 2014 xu et al 2016 but inconsistence still exists in previous reports regarding disinfection effects on their relative abundance for instance it was reported that chlorination could evidently enrich total relative abundance of args among bacterial population in drinking water jia et al 2015 which is not consistent with a previous study that insignificant effects of chlorination on args can be observed lin et al 2016 ozonation contributed remarkably to the reduction of relative abundances of some investigated tetracycline resistance genes in a dwtp while their relative abundances increased after ozonation in another dwtp guo et al 2014 moreover it is noteworthy that the uv disinfection could enrich the total relative abundance of args while reduce the relative abundance of tetracycline resistance genes in wastewater hu et al 2016 thus far recent researches on uv disinfection inducing variation of args are mainly focused on wastewater rather than drinking water however these existing studies on args from laboratory experiments to full scale drinking water treatments applied different detection methods for arg quantification thus resulted in highly variable detection throughputs ranges and limits moreover source water quality in different studies is diverse and the effects of source water quality are unconsidered leading to insufficient and unconvincing explanation for the controversial results thus it is urgent and necessary to perform systematic research that simultaneously unravels the comprehensive profile of args and the underlying shift mechanisms after single or combined disinfection regimes in full scale dwtps without the effect of source water bacterial sensitivity to disinfectants varies greatly and thus induces remarkable shift of microbial community structure in drinking water for instance some studies have highlighted the effects of ozonation on the dynamic changes of bacterial community in drinking water su et al 2018 bai et al 2015 moreover marked shifts in the bacterial community structure were observed after disinfection with chlorine chloramine and hypochlorite in drinking water potgieter et al 2018 furthermore bacterial community shift was identified as a key factor driving changes of arg profiles in drinking water during biological activated carbon treatment zheng et al 2018 meanwhile similar observations were reported by jia et al 2015 where chlorine resistant bacteria pseudomonas and acidovorax increased during chlorination resulting in the increase of arg relative abundance a previous study also found that pseudomonas might be involved in the propagation of args in drinking water su et al 2018 however the roles of bacterial community shift in the resistome alteration during drinking water disinfection remain incomprehensive and unclear in this study we selected a steady operation dwtp simultaneously operating disinfection units of chlorine uv ozone and antimicrobial resin ar to comprehensively investigate the fate of args and variance of bacterial community based on illumina high throughput sequencing hts based metagenomic approaches simultaneously we tried to reveal the potential bacterial hosts of representative args in the drinking water based on their associations finally we endeavored to give a comprehensive review of the underlying mechanism of arg shift influenced by different disinfection units to our knowledge this is the first study investigating the response of args and bacterial community as well as their associations under different disinfection units in a full scale dwtp based on the same source water the results of this study provide valuable insights into the effective measures to control the dissemination of args and minimize health risks in drinking water 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection and dna extraction water samples in this study were collected from a full scale dwtp with supply quantity of 150 000 t d and feeding population of 300 000 yancheng city jiangsu province china which is equipped with a series of treatment units including coagulation sedimentation sand filtration and disinfection more detailed operational parameters of this dwtp are shown in table s1 especially three different disinfection strategies including ar chlorine ar cl2 ar uv and ozone chlorine o3 cl2 are parallelly equipped in this dwtp with treatment capacity of 10 000 t d for each pipeline respectively the detailed sampling sites of each unit in this dwtp are shown in fig s1 for metagenomic dna extraction approximately 800 100 l of sand filtered water sf w ar disinfected water ar w ar chlorine disinfected water ar c w ar uv disinfected water ar uv w ozone disinfected water o w and ozone chlorine disinfected water o c w were filtered by potable water purifier according to our previously established method shi et al 2013 the filtration was aseptically conducted in triplicate from each site and each filtration lasted for about 24 h to minimize the temporal variation for water quality analyses 1 l of water was also collected using a sterile brown glass bottle the filters and water samples were simultaneously transported to the laboratory under 4 c within 4 h details of the water quality of each sample are shown in table s2 bacterial suspensions were isolated from water filters according to our previous method shi et al 2013 and then subjected to the total dna extraction using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals ca according to the manufacturer s instructions the dna concentration and purity were evaluated following our previous study shi et al 2013 the dna samples were stored at 80 c until further analysis 2 2 illumina hts and args analysis approximately 6 μg of extracted dna for each sample was selected for sequencing library construction with an insert size of 350 bp illumina hts with paired end sequencing strategy 2 150 bp was then performed on an illumina hiseq 4000 platform illuminna inc san diego ca finally the size of the raw dataset for each sample was approximately 10 0 14 8 gb with an average length of 150 bp table s3 the low quality sequences and illumina adapters were filtered by using trimmomatic version 0 36 following a previous study pehrsson et al 2016 after trimming a total of 8 7 12 5 gb of high quality paired end reads were reserved for each sample table s3 the generated clean sequences were searched for args by an arg analysis pipeline args oap v2 0 to comprehensively determine the antibiotic resistome in drinking water yin et al 2018 the prescreened potential arg sequences via ublast were aligned against a database termed structured antibiotic resistance genes sarg v2 0 using blastx with the recommended parameters e value 10 5 sequence identify 90 and alignment length 25 amino acids for arg annotation and classification ma et al 2017 arg types subtypes were automatically identified by a package of customized scripts provided by args oap v2 0 and their relative abundances were expressed as copies of args per cell capc and calculated according to the following equation yin et al 2018 yang et al 2016 abundance i 1 n n arg like reads l read l arg reference sequence cell number where narg like reads is the number of the arg like sequences annotated to one specific arg reference sequence lread is the read length 150 bp larg reference sequence is the nucleotide sequence length of the corresponding target arg reference sequence bp cell number is the estimated number of bacterial cells in each metagenomic dataset calculated by args oap v2 0 based on the searching results of 30 sets of essential single copy marker genes yin et al 2018 n is the number of mapped arg reference sequences belonging to the target arg types subtypes moreover the percentage of individual arg type subtype was calculated as the ratio of the relative abundance of target arg type subtype v s the relative abundance of all args in each sample 2 3 miseq sequencing of 16s rrna genes and bacterial community analysis to reveal the shift of bacterial community composition during different drinking water disinfection processes the hypervariable v4 region of bacterial 16s rrna genes for each sample was amplified using the following universal primer sets with a barcode unique to each sample forward 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and reverse 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 jiang et al 2018 the details of pcr system and amplification condition have been described in a previous study jiang et al 2018 after purification and quantification of pcr products appropriate amounts of purified amplicon products of each sample were mixed and sequenced on the illumina miseq platform illuminna inc san diego ca following the 2 250 bp paired end strategy all the raw metagenomic datasets and raw 16s rrna amplicon sequences have been uploaded to sequence read archive sra database of national center for biotechnology information ncbi under the accession number srp150892 the raw paired end reads were assigned to each sample based on their unique barcodes and truncated by removing barcodes and primer sequences the remaining paired end reads were processed and analyzed using quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime version 1 9 1 caporaso et al 2010 briefly pairs of reads were merged into single and longer sequences and quality trimming removals of chimera and non bacterial sequences were serially conducted frank et al 2016 nie et al 2017 afterwards the sequence number of each sample was normalized by randomly extracting the minimum bacterial sequence number among all the samples to fairly compare the 18 samples at the same sequencing depth ju et al 2014 additionally the normalized sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus for open reference otu picking at the 97 sequence identity level edgar 2010 and otus with sequence number less than 0 005 of the total number of sequences were removed for more accurate bacterial community composition and diversity distribution buelow et al 2017 to identify taxonomic composition the representative sequences from each otu were phylogenetically assigned against the greengenes database v13 8 to a taxonomic level using the rdp classifier with a bootstrap cutoff of 80 diversity indices otus chao1 shannon index and simpson index were calculated at a 97 similarity level at the same library size of each sample 2 4 statistical analyses the venn diagram reflecting the number of shared arg subtypes among all the samples was generated using the venn tool termed jvenn bardou et al 2014 to explore statistically significant features of the antibiotic resistome and bacterial community between different samples linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse was performed with the parameters recommended by feng et al 2018 arg profiles based on the relative abundance of arg subtypes and bacterial community based on the percentage of otus of each sample were differentiated by the principal coordinate analysis pcoa based on the bray curtis distance using r software with the vegan package adonis test was performed to verify the statistical difference based on the pcoa results of arg profiles and bacterial community mantel test was conducted to determine the potential links between arg profiles and bacterial community in addition for the args and bacterial community co occurrence a correlation matrix was constructed by calculating all possible pairwise spearman s coefficient ρ among profiles of arg subtypes and otus and visualized through the network graphs using gephi following li et al 2015 the relative abundance of args and percentage of bacterial community were expressed as the mean standard deviation and the significance of the differences was determined using one way analysis of variance anova test with tukey post hoc tests which was calculated with spss 22 0 ibm usa variations were considered statistically significant at p 0 05 for all analyses 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and fate of args during drinking water disinfection this study provided a comprehensive insight into the arg occurrence and abundance in drinking water presenting an opportunity to investigate the antibiotic resistome during different disinfection strategies in a full scale dwtp hts based metagenomic analysis revealed that a total of 297 arg subtypes belonging to 17 arg types were identified in at least one of the 18 water samples ranging from 61 to 159 arg subtypes for each sample fig 1 and supplementary excel 1 multidrug beta lactam and tetracycline args seemed to have relatively more subtypes than other arg types fig s2 totally the ar uv disinfection strategy led to a significant increase of total number of arg subtypes p 0 05 while the ar cl2 and o3 cl2 disinfection strategies conversely reduced the total number of arg subtypes fig s2 and table s4 previous studies have reported the similar results indicating that arg diversity slightly increased after uv disinfection hu et al 2016 and chlorination effectively lowered the subtype number of args lin et al 2016 moreover bacitracin multidrug and beta lactam resistance genes were the dominant types of args in the drinking water which averagely accounted for 61 77 89 47 of the total arg abundance fig s3 while the ar uv treated sample tended to be dominated by genes conferring resistance to bacitracin 26 89 0 60 of total args multidrug 20 89 0 46 and beta lactam 20 30 1 06 fig s3 similarly multidrug 31 83 2 01 and bacitracin 31 32 2 37 resistance genes were the two most dominant types in the ar cl2 treated sample and the multidrug resistance genes accounted for the majority of the total args 75 08 1 94 in the o3 cl2 treated sample fig s3 notably these three types of args have been reported to dominate in drinking water ma et al 2017 2019 and are also relatively highly abundant in different environments li et al 2015 bacitracin resistance genes may be intrinsic in bacteria as its homologues can be widespread in 153 genera hu et al 2013 and multidrug resistance might be the natural state for most microorganisms to overcome environmental stresses wright 2007 the total relative abundance of the detectable args in all the samples fluctuated greatly in a range from 195 49 24 85 capc o c w to 626 31 38 61 capc ar uv w fig 2 notably the total arg abundance significantly increased in drinking water after the ar uv disinfection p 0 05 while significantly decreased after the o3 cl2 disinfection p 0 05 and remained stable after the ar cl2 disinfection fig 2 and table s5 the changing tendency of arg abundance after the o3 cl2 disinfection was opposite with our previous study zhang et al 2019 which may be resulted from the different arg database bioinformatic pipeline and classification standard by contrast the arg oap pipeline is more suitable for quantification of args in environmental metagenomes than the previously used resfam pipeline due to the comprehensive sarg database and direct alignment gibson et al 2014 yin et al 2018 as for the individual disinfection units the arg relative abundance was significantly decreased by ar or ozone disinfection fig 2 and table s5 p 0 05 this finding is also supported by previous studies revealing that relative abundance of args was elevated by uv disinfection hu et al 2016 and slightly reduced by pre ozonation treatment of drinking water xu et al 2016 moreover chlorine disinfection was found to enrich specific types of args in drinking water jia et al 2015 this study also indicated that the ar or ozone coupled with chlorine disinfection strategies may overcome the disadvantage of individual chlorine disinfection effects on args moreover disinfectants may also result in the release of extracellular dna edna from microbial cells in drinking water sakcham et al 2019 for instance hao et al 2019 found that a total of 14 arg subtypes were detected in the form of edna in tap water it may be speculated that edna loss may cause the reduced diversity and abundance of args during disinfection in this study which needs to be further validated in addition the abundance significantly increased for multidrug resistance genes while significantly decreased for beta lactam and bacitracin resistance genes after two combined disinfections of o3 cl2 and ar cl2 fig 2 and table s5 p 0 05 this finding is also supported by the report that ar cl2 disinfection has significant effect on the reduction of relative abundance of beta lactam resistance genes in drinking water zhang et al 2019 however chang et al 2019 revealed that ar coupled with a low dose of chlorine significantly reduced the relative abundances of all the detected args in drinking water all the individual disinfection units except for the ar significantly promoted the abundance of multidrug resistance genes in drinking water fig 2 and table s5 p 0 05 which highlighting the potential risk to human health due to their ubiquitous occurrence in drinking water we also found that the ar disinfection significantly lowered the relative abundance of multidrug resistance genes mainly through its unique bactericidal mechanism zhang et al 2019 it has been reported that chlorination and uv disinfection significantly increased the relative abundance of multidrug resistance genes jia et al 2015 hu et al 2016 and a low dose of ozone disinfection enriched multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria zheng et al 2017 highlighting the high probability to directly exert selective pressure to multidrug resistance genes furthermore pcoa differentiating resistome patterns revealed that the disinfection strategies greatly reshaped the arg profiles in drinking water adonis test r2 0 96 p 0 01 fig s4 in brief the drinking water samples of sf w ar w and ar c w clustered closely in contrast the ar uv o3 cl2 and ozone disinfection evidently altered the components of antibiotic resistome so their samples were separated from each other fig s4 the result was consistent with our current knowledge that antibiotic resistome is deeply influenced by disinfection jia et al 2015 and the shared and discriminative arg subtypes that may lead to the above similarities or differences among samples will be further discussed in the following subsections 3 2 persistent args in drinking water after multiple disinfection strategies in this study 53 arg subtypes within 11 arg types in sf w were concurrently shared by all the samples fig 3 a and table s6 and they were defined as the persistent args since they cannot be eliminated by all the disinfection strategies in general the total abundance of the persistent args accounted for 84 21 0 98 of the total relative abundance of the detectable args in sf w and also occupied 85 90 1 77 69 19 1 02 and 77 96 0 90 of the total abundance in the effluent of the ar cl2 ar uv and o3 cl2 disinfection respectively fig s5a the relative abundance of the persistent args shared similar changing tendency with the total abundance of args in the drinking water fig s5b in addition the relative abundance of all the persistent args obviously increased after the ar cl2 and ar uv disinfection especially for ar uv which significantly elevated the abundance from 0 26 0 01 capc in sf w to 0 43 0 02 capc in ar uv w fig s5b and table s6 p 0 05 among these persistent args bacitracin resistance gene baca had the highest relative abundance in sf w followed by sulfonamide resistance gene suli aminoglycoside resistance gene aada and sulfonamide resistance gene sulⅱ fig 1 these args have been frequently detected as persistent ones in many environmental niches including airborne particulate matters hu et al 2018a drinking water system jia et al 2015 hu et al 2018b lake water and seawater yang et al 2019 suli and sulⅱ have also been found to be persistent in both conventional and advanced drinking water treatment systems su et al 2018 furthermore the abundances of baca and suli significantly declined after the ar cl2 and o3 cl2 disinfection p 0 05 while they were effectively enriched after the ar uv disinfection fig 1 and table s6 in addition all the three disinfection strategies significantly increased the abundances of the multidrug resistance genes mext mexw mexf and the gene encoding multidrug transporters fig 1 and table s6 p 0 05 among these four genes mext was the maximally enriched after the disinfection strategies by 14 86 times 9 48 times and 33 71 times after the ar cl2 ar uv and o3 cl2 disinfection respectively fig 1 it is known that mext is the regulator of the mexef oprn efflux pump expression in pseudomonas aeruginosa köhler et al 1999 which may exhibit an extremely high level of disinfectant resistance d arezzo et al 2012 so the enrichment of this arg may indicate the higher abundance of pseudomonas during the disinfection compared with other disinfectant sensitive bacteria it is worth noting that the sum of the persistent arg relative abundance was significantly correlated with the total relative abundance of all the detectable args table s7 pearson s coefficient r2 0 96 p 0 05 most of the persistent args had significant correlations with the total relative abundance of args among which multidrug resistance genes acrb tolc mdtc mexe and mdtb beta lactam resistance genes bla oxa 12 and metallo beta lactamase encoding gene polymyxin resistance gene arna macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls resistance gene macb and bacitracin resistance gene baca showed much higher correlations table s7 p 0 05 the persistent args in high abundance have become a potential threat to public health which is raising considerable concern meanwhile assessment of these persistent args is critical for mitigating arg propagation and could provide a guideline for the removal of args by drinking water disinfection 3 3 discriminative args between different samples a total of 21 arg subtypes with an lda significance threshold higher than 4 0 were most likely to explain statistically significant differential abundance and biologically relevant features among treatment pipelines manifesting the disinfection effect fig 3b based on the lefse analysis the multidrug resistance genes mexf and mexw and beta lactam resistance gene bla oxa 247 were the discriminative args after the ar cl2 disinfection fig 3b moreover a total of 4 arg subtypes including bla oxa 12 genes encoding class b and c beta lactamase and unclassified cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp regulatory protein encoding gene were significantly specific and more abundant after the ar uv disinfection figs 1 and 3b a series of multidrug resistance genes mext ompr emrb adej mdtk mdfa and multidrug transporter encoding gene were the discriminative args in the o3 cl2 treated sample fig 3b collectively the relative abundances of these discriminative args were remarkable higher than other args in each sample fig 1 previous studies have also revealed that the discriminative args can be useful markers for differentiating resistome in human or swine gut feng et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 and wastewater jiao et al 2018 additionally a key finding of this study is that 18 out of 21 discriminative arg subtypes were found both persistent and high abundant fig 3b and they could be proposed as potential representative args to provide a clue to indicate the effect of different disinfection units on args in the drinking water which might be potentially promising to provide a theoretical strategy for controlling antibiotic resistance 3 4 bacterial community shift and its linkage to args to examine the effects of the different disinfection strategies on bacterial community composition the target bacterial 16s rrna gene amplicons were sequenced which yielded a total of 4 753 932 high quality bacterial sequences with sequence number ranging from 143 937 to 387 456 per sample and these sequences were normalized and clustered into 1117 otus at 97 similarity level among all the samples table s8 notably chao1 simpson and shannon indices suggested that the ar cl2 disinfection evidently increased the bacterial richness and diversity while the ar uv disinfection reduced these parameters and the o3 cl2 disinfection unchanged the evenness and diversity table s8 notably the pcoa result showed the bacterial community composition was significantly distinct after the different disinfection units adonis r2 0 85 p 0 01 fig s6 indicating that disinfection exerted profound selection effects on specializing bacterial taxa in addition lefse analysis revealed that the dominant otus in different samples varied greatly in detail the ar cl2 disinfection enriched otu 4 genus shewanella otu 9 family pseudomonadaceae otu 13 genus rheinheimera otu 17 genus pseudomonas otu 19 genus janthinobacterium otu 23 species janthinobacterium lividum and otu 31 species flavobacterium succinicans while otu 1 order fusobacteriales otu 3 family aeromonadaceae and otu 10 species clostridium bowmanii only dominated in the ar uv treated sample and o3 cl2 also contributed to enrichment of several otus fig 4 a and b which indicated the notable effect of disinfection on the bacterial community of drinking water in general the bacterial otus were assigned into 22 phyla and 95 genera abundance 0 1 in any sample and showed that the drinking water treated by different disinfection strategies had different bacterial community structure at both phylum and genus levels fig 5 a and b proteobacteria had the highest percentage across all the drinking water samples accounting for 56 14 of the total sequences that retrieved on average fig 5a furthermore bacterial community was dominated by other abundant phyla including actinobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes in ar c w firmicutes actinobacteria and fusobacteria in ar uv w planctomycetes actinobacteria and firmicutes in o c w respectively fig 5a this is in agreement with previous studies bai et al 2015 xu et al 2018 indicating that dominant phyla in drinking water included proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes planctomycetes and firmicutes among the top 50 abundant genera in drinking water janthinobacterium shewanella pseudomonas rheinheimera and mycobacterium had dramatically increased abundance after the ar cl2 disinfection while clostridium shewanella pseudomonas and janthinobacterium exhibited remarkably increasing trend after the ar uv disinfection fig 5b moreover mycobacterium methylosinus acinetobacter planctomyces and pseudomonas were dramatically enriched after the o3 cl2 disinfection averagely accounting for 42 91 of the total which represented major fractions of the corresponding genera fig 5b most of these genera are known as predominant genera in drinking water ma et al 2017 su et al 2018 potgieter et al 2018 mathieu et al 2019 taylor et al 2000 it has been reported that strains of pseudomonas mycobacterium and clostridium exhibit a certain degree of resistance to chlorine disinfection taylor et al 2000 and ozonation can increase the proportion of pseudomonas and mycobacterium su et al 2018 alexander et al 2016 a mantel test showed that the entire target args had strong and significant associations with the overall bacterial community composition based on the bray curtis distance r2 0 78 p 0 01 which indicated that the bacterial phylogeny might shape the antibiotic resistome of drinking water it has been well documented that bacterial community shift is the major factor driving antibiotic resistome alteration in drinking water su et al 2018 swine wastewater jia et al 2017 and soil forsberg et al 2014 recent studies have speculated that the co existing patterns between args and bacterial communities could indicate potential hosts of args if the args and the co occurred bacteria possessed the significantly similar abundance trends among the complex environments feng et al 2018 li et al 2015 a reasonable speculation of the corresponding similar abundance trends that some specific args were carried by specific microbial taxa has been verified forsberg et al 2014 in this study co occurrence network analysis was applied to illustrate the positive and significant correlations spearman s coefficient ρ 0 8 p 0 01 between the antibiotic resistome and bacterial community of drinking water which was hypothesized to be an appropriate scenario to investigate the potential hosts of args in drinking water as shown in fig 6 a the co occurrence network included 113 nodes 53 otus and 60 arg subtypes and 430 edges with clustering coefficient of 0 69 showing that 27 otus had strong and significant correlations with 34 args belonging to 9 types table s9 which indicated that these otus were speculated to be the potential hosts of the target args in addition 9 of the 18 representative args including baca suli su lⅱ aada mext bla veb 1 bla oxa 12 bla oxa 247 and class a beta lactamase encoding gene were found to be associated with multiple otus notably otu 37 family aeromonadaceae with the largest number of co existing args was speculated to be a potential host of 11 arg subtypes including one bacitracin resistance gene baca two sulfonamide resistance genes suli and sulⅱ two aminoglycoside resistance genes aac 6 i and aada three tetracycline resistance genes tetc tete and tetx and three beta lactam resistance genes ampc bla oxa 12 and class b beta lactamase encoding gene fig 6a aeromonadaceae co occurring with 18 subtypes of args of suli aac 6 tetc teta bla oxa 2 and bla oxa 10 is a ubiquitous family in aquatic environments stalder et al 2019 7 arg subtypes including one bacitracin resistance gene baca one sulfonamide resistance gene sulⅱ two aminoglycoside resistance genes aada and aac 6 i and three tetracycline resistance genes tetc tete and tetx co existed with the otu 1 order fusobacteriales fig 6a moreover some otus were found to co occur with only one subtype of args including otu 9 family pseudomonadaceae with mexi and otu 17 genus pseudomonas with mext fig 6a it has been reported that pseudomonas often carries multiple args and may be one of the most important genera contributing to the proliferation and dissemination of args ma et al 2017 su et al 2018 for instance pseudomonas is the main host for multidrug resistance genes mexf and mexw liu et al 2018 and wild type strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa often carry mext gene maseda et al 2000 in particular the correlations between core otus and args as well as the similar changing trend of abundance of persistent args and total args together indicated that the representative args after disinfection may relate to the corresponding potential bacterial hosts and revealed the crucial role of bacterial community shift in changing the abundance of args this result was confirmed by previous studies suggesting the abundances of args carried by diverse potential hosts could vary drastically along with the potential host abundances jia et al 2015 li et al 2015 but such co occurrence patterns showed by network analysis need to be further validated using other approaches in the future study furthermore topological properties and modularity of the network 12 major modules were also shown in fig 6b revealing population prosperity or demise of highly interconnected clusters within each module and the underlying distinct characteristics of interactions among bacterial taxa in the drinking water for instance after the ar cl2 disinfection the abundances of otu 4 genus shewanella otu 9 family pseudomonadaceae otu 13 genus rheinheimera otu 19 genus janthinobacterium and otu 23 species janthinobacterium lividum in module ⅱ were increased while the abundances of otu 2 family comamonadaceae otu 7 family ack m1 otu 11 family ack m1 otu 12 genus rhodoferax otu 15 family ack m1 and otu 20 family comamonadaceae in module ⅰ were reduced fig 4a the result was consistent with our current knowledge that the co occurrence of bacterial taxa may be related ecologically indicating their similar or complementary functions to each other or the common niche preference ju et al 2014 in addition no links were found between most modules except for modules ⅰ ⅱ ⅳ and ⅴ indicating the highly clustered and modularized structure of the network fig 6b it was consistent with a previous study showing each otu was closely linked to all other otus in highly interconnected cliques chow et al 2013 which may support a previous argument for small world properties that is highly interconnected nodes in microbial ecological networks steele et al 2011 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that the profound effects of multiple disinfection strategies on the antibiotic resistome shift in drinking water by changing the relative abundance and diversity of args where the total arg relative abundance significantly increased after the ar uv disinfection while remained stable and even significantly decreased after the ar cl2 and o3 cl2 disinfection respectively notably 18 args were persistent and discriminative during all the disinfection strategies in drinking water which may act as representative args to evaluate antibiotic resistome during drinking water disinfection additionally 27 otus were identified as the possible hosts of 34 args including 9 representative args among these args the elevated abundances of fusobacteriales and aeromonadaceae mainly contributed to the increased abundance of baca during the ar uv disinfection while their decreased abundances result in the reduced abundance of baca after the ar cl2 and o3 cl2 disinfection moreover the enrichment of bacterial host pseudomonas mainly increased the abundance of mext during multiple disinfection processes indicating that the change of the bacterial community may be a major driver in shaping arg profiles propagation and distribution in drinking water however this study did not consider the variation of source water thus more comprehensive research is further needed to effectively and economically optimize treatment units for the removal of args and assess the potential risks of potential pathogens that considered as carriers of args declaration of competing interest the

17967,for comprehensive insights into the effects of multiple disinfection regimes on antibiotic resistome in drinking water this study utilized metagenomic approaches to reveal the changing patterns of antibiotic resistance genes args and bacterial community as well as their associations a total of 297 args within 17 types were detected in the drinking water and their total relative abundance ranged from 195 49 24 85 to 626 31 38 61 copies of args per cell the total arg abundance was significantly increased after the antimicrobial resin and ultraviolet ar uv disinfection while significantly decreased after the ozone and chlorine o3 cl2 disinfection and remained stable after ar cl2 disinfection overall 18 args including baca mext and bla oxa 12 mainly affiliated to bacitracin multidrug and beta lactam were persistent and discriminative during all the disinfection strategies in drinking water and they were considered as key args that represent the antibiotic resistome during drinking water disinfection additionally possible hosts of 50 key args were revealed based on co occurrence network during multiple disinfection processes the change of fusobacteriales and aeromonadaceae in abundance mainly contributed to the abundance shift of baca and pseudomonas mainly increased the abundance of mext these findings indicated that bacterial community shift may be the key factor driving the change of antibiotic resistome during disinfection the strong association between antibiotic resistome alteration and bacterial community shift proposed in this study may enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanism of the disinfection effects on antibiotic resistance and benefit effective measures to improve safety of drinking water graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotic resistance genes bacterial community shift disinfection strategy drinking water high throughput sequencing 1 introduction emergence and proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args in the environment have become a global public health issue pruden et al 2006 notably a growing number of studies have demonstrated that arb and args are prevalent in drinking water hao et al 2019 ma et al 2017 indicating that drinking water may serve as an important and unavoidable pathway for human exposure via digestion or inhalation args often co occur with mobile genetic elements mges which facilitate their transmission to recipient hosts and thus generate new resistant strains yu et al 2016 more seriously it will undermine the therapeutic effect of antibiotics on human infectious diseases once these args are acquired by clinical pathogens chen et al 2015 in waterworks disinfection is the last and most solid barrier that prevents potential pathogens from spreading to the tap water and has been proven effective in reducing waterborne diseases moreover disinfection is also regarded as the crucial process in controlling arg dissemination in drinking water treatment plants dwtps mckinney and pruden 2012 it has been basically confirmed that disinfection can effectively reduce the absolute abundance copies per ml water of args in drinking water guo et al 2014 xu et al 2016 but inconsistence still exists in previous reports regarding disinfection effects on their relative abundance for instance it was reported that chlorination could evidently enrich total relative abundance of args among bacterial population in drinking water jia et al 2015 which is not consistent with a previous study that insignificant effects of chlorination on args can be observed lin et al 2016 ozonation contributed remarkably to the reduction of relative abundances of some investigated tetracycline resistance genes in a dwtp while their relative abundances increased after ozonation in another dwtp guo et al 2014 moreover it is noteworthy that the uv disinfection could enrich the total relative abundance of args while reduce the relative abundance of tetracycline resistance genes in wastewater hu et al 2016 thus far recent researches on uv disinfection inducing variation of args are mainly focused on wastewater rather than drinking water however these existing studies on args from laboratory experiments to full scale drinking water treatments applied different detection methods for arg quantification thus resulted in highly variable detection throughputs ranges and limits moreover source water quality in different studies is diverse and the effects of source water quality are unconsidered leading to insufficient and unconvincing explanation for the controversial results thus it is urgent and necessary to perform systematic research that simultaneously unravels the comprehensive profile of args and the underlying shift mechanisms after single or combined disinfection regimes in full scale dwtps without the effect of source water bacterial sensitivity to disinfectants varies greatly and thus induces remarkable shift of microbial community structure in drinking water for instance some studies have highlighted the effects of ozonation on the dynamic changes of bacterial community in drinking water su et al 2018 bai et al 2015 moreover marked shifts in the bacterial community structure were observed after disinfection with chlorine chloramine and hypochlorite in drinking water potgieter et al 2018 furthermore bacterial community shift was identified as a key factor driving changes of arg profiles in drinking water during biological activated carbon treatment zheng et al 2018 meanwhile similar observations were reported by jia et al 2015 where chlorine resistant bacteria pseudomonas and acidovorax increased during chlorination resulting in the increase of arg relative abundance a previous study also found that pseudomonas might be involved in the propagation of args in drinking water su et al 2018 however the roles of bacterial community shift in the resistome alteration during drinking water disinfection remain incomprehensive and unclear in this study we selected a steady operation dwtp simultaneously operating disinfection units of chlorine uv ozone and antimicrobial resin ar to comprehensively investigate the fate of args and variance of bacterial community based on illumina high throughput sequencing hts based metagenomic approaches simultaneously we tried to reveal the potential bacterial hosts of representative args in the drinking water based on their associations finally we endeavored to give a comprehensive review of the underlying mechanism of arg shift influenced by different disinfection units to our knowledge this is the first study investigating the response of args and bacterial community as well as their associations under different disinfection units in a full scale dwtp based on the same source water the results of this study provide valuable insights into the effective measures to control the dissemination of args and minimize health risks in drinking water 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection and dna extraction water samples in this study were collected from a full scale dwtp with supply quantity of 150 000 t d and feeding population of 300 000 yancheng city jiangsu province china which is equipped with a series of treatment units including coagulation sedimentation sand filtration and disinfection more detailed operational parameters of this dwtp are shown in table s1 especially three different disinfection strategies including ar chlorine ar cl2 ar uv and ozone chlorine o3 cl2 are parallelly equipped in this dwtp with treatment capacity of 10 000 t d for each pipeline respectively the detailed sampling sites of each unit in this dwtp are shown in fig s1 for metagenomic dna extraction approximately 800 100 l of sand filtered water sf w ar disinfected water ar w ar chlorine disinfected water ar c w ar uv disinfected water ar uv w ozone disinfected water o w and ozone chlorine disinfected water o c w were filtered by potable water purifier according to our previously established method shi et al 2013 the filtration was aseptically conducted in triplicate from each site and each filtration lasted for about 24 h to minimize the temporal variation for water quality analyses 1 l of water was also collected using a sterile brown glass bottle the filters and water samples were simultaneously transported to the laboratory under 4 c within 4 h details of the water quality of each sample are shown in table s2 bacterial suspensions were isolated from water filters according to our previous method shi et al 2013 and then subjected to the total dna extraction using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals ca according to the manufacturer s instructions the dna concentration and purity were evaluated following our previous study shi et al 2013 the dna samples were stored at 80 c until further analysis 2 2 illumina hts and args analysis approximately 6 μg of extracted dna for each sample was selected for sequencing library construction with an insert size of 350 bp illumina hts with paired end sequencing strategy 2 150 bp was then performed on an illumina hiseq 4000 platform illuminna inc san diego ca finally the size of the raw dataset for each sample was approximately 10 0 14 8 gb with an average length of 150 bp table s3 the low quality sequences and illumina adapters were filtered by using trimmomatic version 0 36 following a previous study pehrsson et al 2016 after trimming a total of 8 7 12 5 gb of high quality paired end reads were reserved for each sample table s3 the generated clean sequences were searched for args by an arg analysis pipeline args oap v2 0 to comprehensively determine the antibiotic resistome in drinking water yin et al 2018 the prescreened potential arg sequences via ublast were aligned against a database termed structured antibiotic resistance genes sarg v2 0 using blastx with the recommended parameters e value 10 5 sequence identify 90 and alignment length 25 amino acids for arg annotation and classification ma et al 2017 arg types subtypes were automatically identified by a package of customized scripts provided by args oap v2 0 and their relative abundances were expressed as copies of args per cell capc and calculated according to the following equation yin et al 2018 yang et al 2016 abundance i 1 n n arg like reads l read l arg reference sequence cell number where narg like reads is the number of the arg like sequences annotated to one specific arg reference sequence lread is the read length 150 bp larg reference sequence is the nucleotide sequence length of the corresponding target arg reference sequence bp cell number is the estimated number of bacterial cells in each metagenomic dataset calculated by args oap v2 0 based on the searching results of 30 sets of essential single copy marker genes yin et al 2018 n is the number of mapped arg reference sequences belonging to the target arg types subtypes moreover the percentage of individual arg type subtype was calculated as the ratio of the relative abundance of target arg type subtype v s the relative abundance of all args in each sample 2 3 miseq sequencing of 16s rrna genes and bacterial community analysis to reveal the shift of bacterial community composition during different drinking water disinfection processes the hypervariable v4 region of bacterial 16s rrna genes for each sample was amplified using the following universal primer sets with a barcode unique to each sample forward 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and reverse 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 jiang et al 2018 the details of pcr system and amplification condition have been described in a previous study jiang et al 2018 after purification and quantification of pcr products appropriate amounts of purified amplicon products of each sample were mixed and sequenced on the illumina miseq platform illuminna inc san diego ca following the 2 250 bp paired end strategy all the raw metagenomic datasets and raw 16s rrna amplicon sequences have been uploaded to sequence read archive sra database of national center for biotechnology information ncbi under the accession number srp150892 the raw paired end reads were assigned to each sample based on their unique barcodes and truncated by removing barcodes and primer sequences the remaining paired end reads were processed and analyzed using quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime version 1 9 1 caporaso et al 2010 briefly pairs of reads were merged into single and longer sequences and quality trimming removals of chimera and non bacterial sequences were serially conducted frank et al 2016 nie et al 2017 afterwards the sequence number of each sample was normalized by randomly extracting the minimum bacterial sequence number among all the samples to fairly compare the 18 samples at the same sequencing depth ju et al 2014 additionally the normalized sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus for open reference otu picking at the 97 sequence identity level edgar 2010 and otus with sequence number less than 0 005 of the total number of sequences were removed for more accurate bacterial community composition and diversity distribution buelow et al 2017 to identify taxonomic composition the representative sequences from each otu were phylogenetically assigned against the greengenes database v13 8 to a taxonomic level using the rdp classifier with a bootstrap cutoff of 80 diversity indices otus chao1 shannon index and simpson index were calculated at a 97 similarity level at the same library size of each sample 2 4 statistical analyses the venn diagram reflecting the number of shared arg subtypes among all the samples was generated using the venn tool termed jvenn bardou et al 2014 to explore statistically significant features of the antibiotic resistome and bacterial community between different samples linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse was performed with the parameters recommended by feng et al 2018 arg profiles based on the relative abundance of arg subtypes and bacterial community based on the percentage of otus of each sample were differentiated by the principal coordinate analysis pcoa based on the bray curtis distance using r software with the vegan package adonis test was performed to verify the statistical difference based on the pcoa results of arg profiles and bacterial community mantel test was conducted to determine the potential links between arg profiles and bacterial community in addition for the args and bacterial community co occurrence a correlation matrix was constructed by calculating all possible pairwise spearman s coefficient ρ among profiles of arg subtypes and otus and visualized through the network graphs using gephi following li et al 2015 the relative abundance of args and percentage of bacterial community were expressed as the mean standard deviation and the significance of the differences was determined using one way analysis of variance anova test with tukey post hoc tests which was calculated with spss 22 0 ibm usa variations were considered statistically significant at p 0 05 for all analyses 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and fate of args during drinking water disinfection this study provided a comprehensive insight into the arg occurrence and abundance in drinking water presenting an opportunity to investigate the antibiotic resistome during different disinfection strategies in a full scale dwtp hts based metagenomic analysis revealed that a total of 297 arg subtypes belonging to 17 arg types were identified in at least one of the 18 water samples ranging from 61 to 159 arg subtypes for each sample fig 1 and supplementary excel 1 multidrug beta lactam and tetracycline args seemed to have relatively more subtypes than other arg types fig s2 totally the ar uv disinfection strategy led to a significant increase of total number of arg subtypes p 0 05 while the ar cl2 and o3 cl2 disinfection strategies conversely reduced the total number of arg subtypes fig s2 and table s4 previous studies have reported the similar results indicating that arg diversity slightly increased after uv disinfection hu et al 2016 and chlorination effectively lowered the subtype number of args lin et al 2016 moreover bacitracin multidrug and beta lactam resistance genes were the dominant types of args in the drinking water which averagely accounted for 61 77 89 47 of the total arg abundance fig s3 while the ar uv treated sample tended to be dominated by genes conferring resistance to bacitracin 26 89 0 60 of total args multidrug 20 89 0 46 and beta lactam 20 30 1 06 fig s3 similarly multidrug 31 83 2 01 and bacitracin 31 32 2 37 resistance genes were the two most dominant types in the ar cl2 treated sample and the multidrug resistance genes accounted for the majority of the total args 75 08 1 94 in the o3 cl2 treated sample fig s3 notably these three types of args have been reported to dominate in drinking water ma et al 2017 2019 and are also relatively highly abundant in different environments li et al 2015 bacitracin resistance genes may be intrinsic in bacteria as its homologues can be widespread in 153 genera hu et al 2013 and multidrug resistance might be the natural state for most microorganisms to overcome environmental stresses wright 2007 the total relative abundance of the detectable args in all the samples fluctuated greatly in a range from 195 49 24 85 capc o c w to 626 31 38 61 capc ar uv w fig 2 notably the total arg abundance significantly increased in drinking water after the ar uv disinfection p 0 05 while significantly decreased after the o3 cl2 disinfection p 0 05 and remained stable after the ar cl2 disinfection fig 2 and table s5 the changing tendency of arg abundance after the o3 cl2 disinfection was opposite with our previous study zhang et al 2019 which may be resulted from the different arg database bioinformatic pipeline and classification standard by contrast the arg oap pipeline is more suitable for quantification of args in environmental metagenomes than the previously used resfam pipeline due to the comprehensive sarg database and direct alignment gibson et al 2014 yin et al 2018 as for the individual disinfection units the arg relative abundance was significantly decreased by ar or ozone disinfection fig 2 and table s5 p 0 05 this finding is also supported by previous studies revealing that relative abundance of args was elevated by uv disinfection hu et al 2016 and slightly reduced by pre ozonation treatment of drinking water xu et al 2016 moreover chlorine disinfection was found to enrich specific types of args in drinking water jia et al 2015 this study also indicated that the ar or ozone coupled with chlorine disinfection strategies may overcome the disadvantage of individual chlorine disinfection effects on args moreover disinfectants may also result in the release of extracellular dna edna from microbial cells in drinking water sakcham et al 2019 for instance hao et al 2019 found that a total of 14 arg subtypes were detected in the form of edna in tap water it may be speculated that edna loss may cause the reduced diversity and abundance of args during disinfection in this study which needs to be further validated in addition the abundance significantly increased for multidrug resistance genes while significantly decreased for beta lactam and bacitracin resistance genes after two combined disinfections of o3 cl2 and ar cl2 fig 2 and table s5 p 0 05 this finding is also supported by the report that ar cl2 disinfection has significant effect on the reduction of relative abundance of beta lactam resistance genes in drinking water zhang et al 2019 however chang et al 2019 revealed that ar coupled with a low dose of chlorine significantly reduced the relative abundances of all the detected args in drinking water all the individual disinfection units except for the ar significantly promoted the abundance of multidrug resistance genes in drinking water fig 2 and table s5 p 0 05 which highlighting the potential risk to human health due to their ubiquitous occurrence in drinking water we also found that the ar disinfection significantly lowered the relative abundance of multidrug resistance genes mainly through its unique bactericidal mechanism zhang et al 2019 it has been reported that chlorination and uv disinfection significantly increased the relative abundance of multidrug resistance genes jia et al 2015 hu et al 2016 and a low dose of ozone disinfection enriched multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria zheng et al 2017 highlighting the high probability to directly exert selective pressure to multidrug resistance genes furthermore pcoa differentiating resistome patterns revealed that the disinfection strategies greatly reshaped the arg profiles in drinking water adonis test r2 0 96 p 0 01 fig s4 in brief the drinking water samples of sf w ar w and ar c w clustered closely in contrast the ar uv o3 cl2 and ozone disinfection evidently altered the components of antibiotic resistome so their samples were separated from each other fig s4 the result was consistent with our current knowledge that antibiotic resistome is deeply influenced by disinfection jia et al 2015 and the shared and discriminative arg subtypes that may lead to the above similarities or differences among samples will be further discussed in the following subsections 3 2 persistent args in drinking water after multiple disinfection strategies in this study 53 arg subtypes within 11 arg types in sf w were concurrently shared by all the samples fig 3 a and table s6 and they were defined as the persistent args since they cannot be eliminated by all the disinfection strategies in general the total abundance of the persistent args accounted for 84 21 0 98 of the total relative abundance of the detectable args in sf w and also occupied 85 90 1 77 69 19 1 02 and 77 96 0 90 of the total abundance in the effluent of the ar cl2 ar uv and o3 cl2 disinfection respectively fig s5a the relative abundance of the persistent args shared similar changing tendency with the total abundance of args in the drinking water fig s5b in addition the relative abundance of all the persistent args obviously increased after the ar cl2 and ar uv disinfection especially for ar uv which significantly elevated the abundance from 0 26 0 01 capc in sf w to 0 43 0 02 capc in ar uv w fig s5b and table s6 p 0 05 among these persistent args bacitracin resistance gene baca had the highest relative abundance in sf w followed by sulfonamide resistance gene suli aminoglycoside resistance gene aada and sulfonamide resistance gene sulⅱ fig 1 these args have been frequently detected as persistent ones in many environmental niches including airborne particulate matters hu et al 2018a drinking water system jia et al 2015 hu et al 2018b lake water and seawater yang et al 2019 suli and sulⅱ have also been found to be persistent in both conventional and advanced drinking water treatment systems su et al 2018 furthermore the abundances of baca and suli significantly declined after the ar cl2 and o3 cl2 disinfection p 0 05 while they were effectively enriched after the ar uv disinfection fig 1 and table s6 in addition all the three disinfection strategies significantly increased the abundances of the multidrug resistance genes mext mexw mexf and the gene encoding multidrug transporters fig 1 and table s6 p 0 05 among these four genes mext was the maximally enriched after the disinfection strategies by 14 86 times 9 48 times and 33 71 times after the ar cl2 ar uv and o3 cl2 disinfection respectively fig 1 it is known that mext is the regulator of the mexef oprn efflux pump expression in pseudomonas aeruginosa köhler et al 1999 which may exhibit an extremely high level of disinfectant resistance d arezzo et al 2012 so the enrichment of this arg may indicate the higher abundance of pseudomonas during the disinfection compared with other disinfectant sensitive bacteria it is worth noting that the sum of the persistent arg relative abundance was significantly correlated with the total relative abundance of all the detectable args table s7 pearson s coefficient r2 0 96 p 0 05 most of the persistent args had significant correlations with the total relative abundance of args among which multidrug resistance genes acrb tolc mdtc mexe and mdtb beta lactam resistance genes bla oxa 12 and metallo beta lactamase encoding gene polymyxin resistance gene arna macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls resistance gene macb and bacitracin resistance gene baca showed much higher correlations table s7 p 0 05 the persistent args in high abundance have become a potential threat to public health which is raising considerable concern meanwhile assessment of these persistent args is critical for mitigating arg propagation and could provide a guideline for the removal of args by drinking water disinfection 3 3 discriminative args between different samples a total of 21 arg subtypes with an lda significance threshold higher than 4 0 were most likely to explain statistically significant differential abundance and biologically relevant features among treatment pipelines manifesting the disinfection effect fig 3b based on the lefse analysis the multidrug resistance genes mexf and mexw and beta lactam resistance gene bla oxa 247 were the discriminative args after the ar cl2 disinfection fig 3b moreover a total of 4 arg subtypes including bla oxa 12 genes encoding class b and c beta lactamase and unclassified cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp regulatory protein encoding gene were significantly specific and more abundant after the ar uv disinfection figs 1 and 3b a series of multidrug resistance genes mext ompr emrb adej mdtk mdfa and multidrug transporter encoding gene were the discriminative args in the o3 cl2 treated sample fig 3b collectively the relative abundances of these discriminative args were remarkable higher than other args in each sample fig 1 previous studies have also revealed that the discriminative args can be useful markers for differentiating resistome in human or swine gut feng et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 and wastewater jiao et al 2018 additionally a key finding of this study is that 18 out of 21 discriminative arg subtypes were found both persistent and high abundant fig 3b and they could be proposed as potential representative args to provide a clue to indicate the effect of different disinfection units on args in the drinking water which might be potentially promising to provide a theoretical strategy for controlling antibiotic resistance 3 4 bacterial community shift and its linkage to args to examine the effects of the different disinfection strategies on bacterial community composition the target bacterial 16s rrna gene amplicons were sequenced which yielded a total of 4 753 932 high quality bacterial sequences with sequence number ranging from 143 937 to 387 456 per sample and these sequences were normalized and clustered into 1117 otus at 97 similarity level among all the samples table s8 notably chao1 simpson and shannon indices suggested that the ar cl2 disinfection evidently increased the bacterial richness and diversity while the ar uv disinfection reduced these parameters and the o3 cl2 disinfection unchanged the evenness and diversity table s8 notably the pcoa result showed the bacterial community composition was significantly distinct after the different disinfection units adonis r2 0 85 p 0 01 fig s6 indicating that disinfection exerted profound selection effects on specializing bacterial taxa in addition lefse analysis revealed that the dominant otus in different samples varied greatly in detail the ar cl2 disinfection enriched otu 4 genus shewanella otu 9 family pseudomonadaceae otu 13 genus rheinheimera otu 17 genus pseudomonas otu 19 genus janthinobacterium otu 23 species janthinobacterium lividum and otu 31 species flavobacterium succinicans while otu 1 order fusobacteriales otu 3 family aeromonadaceae and otu 10 species clostridium bowmanii only dominated in the ar uv treated sample and o3 cl2 also contributed to enrichment of several otus fig 4 a and b which indicated the notable effect of disinfection on the bacterial community of drinking water in general the bacterial otus were assigned into 22 phyla and 95 genera abundance 0 1 in any sample and showed that the drinking water treated by different disinfection strategies had different bacterial community structure at both phylum and genus levels fig 5 a and b proteobacteria had the highest percentage across all the drinking water samples accounting for 56 14 of the total sequences that retrieved on average fig 5a furthermore bacterial community was dominated by other abundant phyla including actinobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes in ar c w firmicutes actinobacteria and fusobacteria in ar uv w planctomycetes actinobacteria and firmicutes in o c w respectively fig 5a this is in agreement with previous studies bai et al 2015 xu et al 2018 indicating that dominant phyla in drinking water included proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes planctomycetes and firmicutes among the top 50 abundant genera in drinking water janthinobacterium shewanella pseudomonas rheinheimera and mycobacterium had dramatically increased abundance after the ar cl2 disinfection while clostridium shewanella pseudomonas and janthinobacterium exhibited remarkably increasing trend after the ar uv disinfection fig 5b moreover mycobacterium methylosinus acinetobacter planctomyces and pseudomonas were dramatically enriched after the o3 cl2 disinfection averagely accounting for 42 91 of the total which represented major fractions of the corresponding genera fig 5b most of these genera are known as predominant genera in drinking water ma et al 2017 su et al 2018 potgieter et al 2018 mathieu et al 2019 taylor et al 2000 it has been reported that strains of pseudomonas mycobacterium and clostridium exhibit a certain degree of resistance to chlorine disinfection taylor et al 2000 and ozonation can increase the proportion of pseudomonas and mycobacterium su et al 2018 alexander et al 2016 a mantel test showed that the entire target args had strong and significant associations with the overall bacterial community composition based on the bray curtis distance r2 0 78 p 0 01 which indicated that the bacterial phylogeny might shape the antibiotic resistome of drinking water it has been well documented that bacterial community shift is the major factor driving antibiotic resistome alteration in drinking water su et al 2018 swine wastewater jia et al 2017 and soil forsberg et al 2014 recent studies have speculated that the co existing patterns between args and bacterial communities could indicate potential hosts of args if the args and the co occurred bacteria possessed the significantly similar abundance trends among the complex environments feng et al 2018 li et al 2015 a reasonable speculation of the corresponding similar abundance trends that some specific args were carried by specific microbial taxa has been verified forsberg et al 2014 in this study co occurrence network analysis was applied to illustrate the positive and significant correlations spearman s coefficient ρ 0 8 p 0 01 between the antibiotic resistome and bacterial community of drinking water which was hypothesized to be an appropriate scenario to investigate the potential hosts of args in drinking water as shown in fig 6 a the co occurrence network included 113 nodes 53 otus and 60 arg subtypes and 430 edges with clustering coefficient of 0 69 showing that 27 otus had strong and significant correlations with 34 args belonging to 9 types table s9 which indicated that these otus were speculated to be the potential hosts of the target args in addition 9 of the 18 representative args including baca suli su lⅱ aada mext bla veb 1 bla oxa 12 bla oxa 247 and class a beta lactamase encoding gene were found to be associated with multiple otus notably otu 37 family aeromonadaceae with the largest number of co existing args was speculated to be a potential host of 11 arg subtypes including one bacitracin resistance gene baca two sulfonamide resistance genes suli and sulⅱ two aminoglycoside resistance genes aac 6 i and aada three tetracycline resistance genes tetc tete and tetx and three beta lactam resistance genes ampc bla oxa 12 and class b beta lactamase encoding gene fig 6a aeromonadaceae co occurring with 18 subtypes of args of suli aac 6 tetc teta bla oxa 2 and bla oxa 10 is a ubiquitous family in aquatic environments stalder et al 2019 7 arg subtypes including one bacitracin resistance gene baca one sulfonamide resistance gene sulⅱ two aminoglycoside resistance genes aada and aac 6 i and three tetracycline resistance genes tetc tete and tetx co existed with the otu 1 order fusobacteriales fig 6a moreover some otus were found to co occur with only one subtype of args including otu 9 family pseudomonadaceae with mexi and otu 17 genus pseudomonas with mext fig 6a it has been reported that pseudomonas often carries multiple args and may be one of the most important genera contributing to the proliferation and dissemination of args ma et al 2017 su et al 2018 for instance pseudomonas is the main host for multidrug resistance genes mexf and mexw liu et al 2018 and wild type strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa often carry mext gene maseda et al 2000 in particular the correlations between core otus and args as well as the similar changing trend of abundance of persistent args and total args together indicated that the representative args after disinfection may relate to the corresponding potential bacterial hosts and revealed the crucial role of bacterial community shift in changing the abundance of args this result was confirmed by previous studies suggesting the abundances of args carried by diverse potential hosts could vary drastically along with the potential host abundances jia et al 2015 li et al 2015 but such co occurrence patterns showed by network analysis need to be further validated using other approaches in the future study furthermore topological properties and modularity of the network 12 major modules were also shown in fig 6b revealing population prosperity or demise of highly interconnected clusters within each module and the underlying distinct characteristics of interactions among bacterial taxa in the drinking water for instance after the ar cl2 disinfection the abundances of otu 4 genus shewanella otu 9 family pseudomonadaceae otu 13 genus rheinheimera otu 19 genus janthinobacterium and otu 23 species janthinobacterium lividum in module ⅱ were increased while the abundances of otu 2 family comamonadaceae otu 7 family ack m1 otu 11 family ack m1 otu 12 genus rhodoferax otu 15 family ack m1 and otu 20 family comamonadaceae in module ⅰ were reduced fig 4a the result was consistent with our current knowledge that the co occurrence of bacterial taxa may be related ecologically indicating their similar or complementary functions to each other or the common niche preference ju et al 2014 in addition no links were found between most modules except for modules ⅰ ⅱ ⅳ and ⅴ indicating the highly clustered and modularized structure of the network fig 6b it was consistent with a previous study showing each otu was closely linked to all other otus in highly interconnected cliques chow et al 2013 which may support a previous argument for small world properties that is highly interconnected nodes in microbial ecological networks steele et al 2011 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that the profound effects of multiple disinfection strategies on the antibiotic resistome shift in drinking water by changing the relative abundance and diversity of args where the total arg relative abundance significantly increased after the ar uv disinfection while remained stable and even significantly decreased after the ar cl2 and o3 cl2 disinfection respectively notably 18 args were persistent and discriminative during all the disinfection strategies in drinking water which may act as representative args to evaluate antibiotic resistome during drinking water disinfection additionally 27 otus were identified as the possible hosts of 34 args including 9 representative args among these args the elevated abundances of fusobacteriales and aeromonadaceae mainly contributed to the increased abundance of baca during the ar uv disinfection while their decreased abundances result in the reduced abundance of baca after the ar cl2 and o3 cl2 disinfection moreover the enrichment of bacterial host pseudomonas mainly increased the abundance of mext during multiple disinfection processes indicating that the change of the bacterial community may be a major driver in shaping arg profiles propagation and distribution in drinking water however this study did not consider the variation of source water thus more comprehensive research is further needed to effectively and economically optimize treatment units for the removal of args and assess the potential risks of potential pathogens that considered as carriers of args declaration of competing interest the

17968,assessment methods on data quality and environmental variability are lacking for microplastics mp here we assess occurrence and variability of mp number concentrations in two dutch rivers strict qa qc procedures were applied to identify mp using fourier transform infrared ftir microscopy followed by state of the art automated image analysis for a series of randomly selected yet ever smaller subareas of filters we assessed how accurately mp numbers and polymer types are represented during partial filter analysis levels of uncertainty were acceptable when analysing 50 of a filter during chemical mapping and when identifying at least a subset of 50 individual particles with attenuated total reflection atr ftir applying these guidelines mp number concentrations between 67 and 11532 mp m 3 were detected in dutch riverine surface waters spatial differences caused mp number concentrations to vary by two orders of magnitude temporal differences were lower and induced a maximum variation of one order of magnitude in total 26 polymer types were identified the most common were polyethylene 23 polypropylene 19 7 and ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber 18 3 the highest diversity of polymer types was found for small mps whereas mp larger than 1 mm was scarce and almost exclusively made of polyethylene or polypropylene virtually all sampling locations revealed mp number concentrations that are considerably below known effect thresholds for anticipated adverse ecological effects graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics spatial and temporal variability freshwater water quality ftir microscopy automated image analysis 1 introduction microplastics mp have been detected globally across all major environmental compartments it is expected that most of the plastic litter originates from land based sources and is relocated by e g urban runoff or riverine transport towards the marine environment hurley and nizzetto 2018 rochman 2018 the latter has been confirmed recently by lorenz et al 2019 who examined the mp distribution in the southern north sea and found highest concentrations in surface waters where riverine input of the thames and rhine occurs although awareness of the relevance of this transport route is rising knowledge on mp in rivers is still scattered mp have been reported in various river systems in sediment hurley et al 2018 mani et al 2019 water cheung et al 2018 kataoka et al 2019 koelmans et al 2019 or biota samples roch et al 2019 with reported concentrations varying by several orders of magnitude adam et al 2019 koelmans et al 2019 various large and small scale processes affect mp concentrations and its distribution within a river system higher mp concentrations in surface waters have been linked to the vicinity to urbanized areas kataoka et al 2019 mani et al 2015 or higher flow velocities during rain events cheung et al 2018 that cause settled mp to be released from sediments flow conditions can thus substantially change the spatial distribution of mp in a river eo et al 2019 hurley et al 2018 kooi et al 2018 and can strongly vary over the seasons yet only a few studies considered this and determined mp over a longer time period watkins et al 2019 identified higher mp concentrations in surface waters during low flow conditions in summer and eo et al 2019 found highest mp abundances during the dry and wet season while concentrations were significantly lower during a moderate season further insights on seasonal variations are needed discharges of waste water treatment plants wwtps are expected to be an important point source for mp thereby affecting the distribution of mp in a river boucher et al 2019 the presence of mp in wwtp effluents has been confirmed by multiple studies mintenig et al 2017 simon et al 2018 talvitie et al 2017 though reported concentrations vary considerably koelmans et al 2019 these variations in observed mp concentrations may exist due to when and where samples were taken and thus reflect the variability on a wwtp or system s level these variations however can also depend on how the samples were taken or how mp were extracted and analysed connors et al 2017 filella 2015 to be able to distinguish between system level variability and procedural uncertainty it is required to follow strict quality assurance quality control qa qc procedures recently hermsen et al 2018 and koelmans et al 2019 assessed the reliability of studies by evaluating a set of defined qa qc criteria only four out of 50 reviewed studies that examined mp in aqueous samples were confirmed to fulfil all proposed quality criteria koelmans et al 2019 which indicates limitations with respect to the reliability of studies and increases the uncertainty around generated data one of the proposed criteria describes the need to identify the particles chemical nature for a sufficient amount of particles numerous studies did not include any polymer identification step but purely relied on a visual selection of particles confirming the presence of specific polymer types is essential to be able to see patterns to point out potential sources and to properly link results of exposure and effect studies kooi and koelmans 2019 potthoff et al 2017 the more recent studies do identify the particles chemical nature lorenz et al 2019 mani et al 2019 due to long analysis times this is frequently done for a part of a sample only lorenz et al 2019 mintenig et al 2017 simon et al 2018 peeken et al 2018 applied chemical imaging on three subareas of a filter by which they found that mp were distributed unevenly on a filter analysing small subareas of filters with fourier transform infrared ftir or raman spectroscopy might thus considerably under or overestimate actual mp abundances still the uncertainty introduced by partial filter analysis or by identifying a subset of particles using attenuated total reflectance atr ftir has not yet been quantified we argue that it is needed to systematically assess the trade off between shortening the analysis time and the loss of information and accuracy on mp numbers and polymer types as sample handling and mp analysis are laborious finding the balance between a doable analysis time and an acceptable level of analytically introduced uncertainty constitutes a major step forward this study aimed to assess the occurrence of mp and to explore its variability in surface waters of two dutch river systems strict qa qc procedures hermsen et al 2018 koelmans et al 2019 were followed to identify mp down to 20 μm using ftir microscopy followed by an automated image analysis primpke et al 2019 sampling locations were chosen 1 with a high spatial resolution and at different flow velocities in the river dommel to assess the spatial variability of mp within one river 2 with two locations where the sampling was repeated to assess the seasonal and daily variation of mp occurrences and 3 included wwtp effluents as well as an up and downstream sampling location of their discharging points to assess the relative contribution of wwtps to the total riverine mp load a secondary aim was to assess the introduced uncertainty through partial filter analysis and the analysis of a subset of particles by comparing generated mp data for a series of randomly selected yet ever smaller fractions on their accurate representation of mp numbers and polymer types finally generated mp data are discussed in the context of previously reported concentrations and of anticipated risks for aquatic biota 2 material and methods 2 1 study area mp were identified and quantified in surface waters of the dutch part of the meuse river basin one of its tributaries is the dommel that originates in belgium and flows over a length of 80 km through the netherlands flow velocities of the dommel vary over the river length and over the seasons 0 001 0 98 m s 1 mean 0 28 m s 1 with a mean discharge of 3 1 m3 s 1 the dommel is fed by the discharges of three wwtps as well as by several smaller tributaries and combined sewer overflows de klein et al 2016 the dommel is well studied and described in a temporal and spatial explicit model nanoduflow which is based on hydrological data of the dommel and has been applied to study transport of metal based nanoparticles de klein et al 2016 and nano and microplastics besseling et al 2017 the meuse has an average width of about 100 m and an average discharge of 350 m³ s 1 the meuse is mostly rain fed resulting in strong differences between summer and winter flow regimes the dutch part of the river basin is characterized by a high number of inhabitants intensive agriculture and industry at the same time the meuse is used as a source for drinking water production three subsequent basins built in the 1970s in the national park de biesbosch enable water storage and sedimentation processes to improve water quality surface water samples were taken in the dutch part and over the lengths of both rivers the meuse n 12 and the dommel n 20 fig 2 locations included the sedimentation basins and the effluents of five wwtps discharging directly or indirectly into the two rivers were sampled the majority of samples was taken in autumn 2017 the sampling was repeated at two sites during different seasons in 2018 table s 1 2 2 sampling a centrifugal water pump leo 4xcm 120c china was used to filter surface water over stacked stainless steel sieves with mesh sizes of 300 μm 100 μm and 20 μm ø 20 cm thermofisher scientific usa the inlet tube polyvinyl chloride pvc was equipped with a metal cap opening 2 cm and mounted on a wooden pallet this enabled sampling the upper 5 cm of the water column and an upstream orientation of the tube before sampling tubes and pump were primed for 5 min and the sieves rinsed with filtered surface water the sample volume was determined by a connected water meter between 1 3 and 8 m3 were filtered with a flow rate of approximately 2 m³ h 1 over the two bigger sieves the sample volume depended on the amount of suspended matter regularly the flow was lowered and the 20 μm sieve placed underneath the other sieves by doing so 0 03 2 25 m³ water were filtered over the 20 μm sieve which on average represented 15 of the total sample volume table s 1 the residues were rinsed into individual glass bottles that were closed with aluminium foil and stored at 4 c until further processing in the laboratory materials retained on the sieves or mp enclosed in aggregates resulted in capturing also mp smaller than the respective mesh sizes during sampling care was taken that the outlet tube discharged the filtered water downstream of the sampling location airborne contamination was abated by covering the upper sieve with a metal lid in which the inlet tube was hung 2 3 sample preparation sample preparation to extract mp retained on the 20 and 100 μm sampling sieves was done at kwr watercycle research institute the netherlands the sorting of mp 300 μm and all ftir analyses were conducted in the laboratories of wageningen university and research the netherlands during sample preparation quality criteria as presented by koelmans et al 2019 were followed before starting to handle environmental samples the susceptibility to contamination and the achievability of a good mp recovery were tested for three working places used in literature namely a normal lab bench dris et al 2015 mintenig et al 2017 a glove box torre et al 2016 and a laminar flow hood lorenz et al 2019 peeken et al 2018 to do so samples of 1 l of milli q water underwent the same steps as environmental samples for further details on these pre tests contamination mitigation and quality assurance we refer to the supplementary information paragraph s1 mp 300 μm the residues of the 300 μm sampling sieve were visually inspected using a stereomicroscope nikon stereo smz2t japan the sorting of potential mp particles was facilitated using a bogorov chamber polymethyl methacrylate pmma 70 ml hydrobios germany all particles with a bright or transparent colour no cellular structures and certain bending properties were isolated photographed euromex cmex 5 mp the netherlands and measured at their longest and shortest dimension at the same time their shape and colour were noted mp 300 μm multiple steps were taken to reduce natural organic and inorganic sample components when extracting mp retained on the 20 and 100 μm sampling sieves figure s 1 purification started with the addition of sodium dodecylsulphate sds 5 serva electrophoresis gmbh germany after which potassium hydroxide koh 10 carl roth gmbh germany and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 32 carl roth gmbh germany were added before adding the subsequent chemical samples were filtered over a stainless steel 20 μm mesh placed in a stainless steel filter capsule further required were a vacuum pump me1c dijkstra vereenigde the netherlands and a teflon tube attached to the filter capsule the sample residues on the 20 μm meshes were transferred into beakers and the subsequent chemical was added during all steps an incubation temperature of 35 c was kept for which samples were placed in an oven inorganic particles were removed by performing a density separation using a zinc chloride zncl2 carl roth gmbh germany solution with a density of 1 6 g cm 3 from the 20 μm mesh residues were rinsed with the zncl2 solution into separation funnels and were left to settle for 24 h materials with a density above 1 6 g cm 3 settled to the bottom and were removed by regularly and slowly turning the outlet valve all lighter materials were filtered one more time over the 20 μm mesh then onto 0 2 μm aluminium oxide filters anodisc 25 mm whatman u k for which a filtration funnel with an inner diameter of 15 mm was used these filters were placed into slightly opened glass petri dishes and dried at 35 c for five days during sample preparation cross contamination was minimized by always using the same 20 μm steel mesh and glass beaker for individual samples in parallel to actual samples procedural blanks were treated and analysed and their results were considered when analysing mp in environmental samples paragraph s1 2 4 mp identification and quantification mp 300 μm atr ftir sorted potentially synthetic particles larger than 300 μm were identified using atr ftir varian 1000 ft ir agilent usa particles were placed individually onto the atr crystal polymer types were identified based on the recorded spectra 600 4000 cm 1 with the aid of the hummel polymer and ftir spectral library thermofisher scientific usa if the number of sorted particles was 50 all particles were analysed a subset of 50 randomly chosen particles 32 76 was identified for eight samples with numbers of sorted particles 50 koelmans et al 2019 to assess the loss of accuracy when analysing only a subset of pre sorted particles all particles 73 123 were analysed for further three samples section 2 6 mp 300 μm micro ftir to identify mp 300 μm an ftir microscope equipped with an ultrafast motorized stage and a single mercury cadmium telluride mct detector nicolet in10 thermofisher scientific usa was used the anodisc filters with sample residues were placed on a calcium fluoride caf2 crystal edmundoptics germany to avoid the filter from bending chemical mapping of these samples was conducted in transmission mode for pre defined filter areas löder et al 2015 mintenig et al 2017 2018 mp from the 100 μm sampling sieve was analysed on a filter area of approximately 12 16 mm 66 of the total filter area ir spectra were recorded with a spatial pixel resolution of 30 μm and in a wavenumber range of 1250 3200 cm 1 the aperature size was set as 50 50 μm controlling the energy amount presented to the sample the spectral resolution was set as 16 cm 1 and 1 scan per pixel was conducted for mp analysis retained on the 20 μm sampling sieve two areas both approximately 88 mm2 and together 62 of the filter area were mapped with a spatial pixel resolution of 20 μm with remaining settings kept unchanged the loss of accuracy by partial analysis of the filter area was quantified separately section 2 6 the generated ftir data were automatically analysed using two software tools mphunter liu et al 2019 and mpapp primpke et al 2019 in combination with the reference database presented by primpke et al 2018 these software tools were later transferred into simple a freeware which can be downloaded via https simple plastics eu within the software all recorded spectra are compared against the spectra of a reference library this is done for the raw spectrum and for its first derivative the resulting hits are afterwards evaluated as described by primpke et al 2017b followed by an image analysis using mpapp this analysis uses first a pixel hole closing mechanism prior to a particle fibre recognition with set parameters primpke et al 2019 and yields in numbers and polymer types for mp particles and fibres including the longest and shortest dimension for individual mp based on criteria presented by primpke et al 2018 polymer specific threshold values were determined by evaluating the spectra of five samples manually table s 2 based on the mp two dimensional shapes the mass per mp and subsequently per sample was estimated to do so we followed the approach by simon et al 2018 and calculated the ratio of the shortest and longest dimension of all identified particles which on average was 0 56 with a standard deviation sd of 0 19 for particles it was assumed that this ratio would be the same for a particle s height and its shorter dimension for fibres the individual lengths were given while a fixed diameter of 15 μm was assumed napper and thompson 2016 pirc et al 2016 the mass was calculated from the mp volume and the density of its material as exact particle densities cannot be determined during analysis the mean polymer densities indicated in literature were used table s 2 2 5 statistical analysis the shapiro wilk normality test was used to test if mp number concentrations were normally distributed amongst wwtps and river systems a non parametric kruskal wallis rank sum test was used to compare mp in grouped locations the dunn test resulted in an adjusted p value based on the benjamini hochberg method which was used to compare differences between individual groups all tests were performed using the software rstudio v 1 1 463 2 6 assessment of data reliability based on generated mp data we assessed how randomly selected yet ever smaller sample fractions being analysed can impact final results and when levels of introduced uncertainties become unacceptable this was done for the partial analysis of a filter during chemical mapping and for the identification of only a subset of pre sorted particles 300 μm using atr ftir for both analyses five samples with varying mp abundances were selected these were assessed in regard to an accurate representation of i mp number concentrations and polymer types during chemical mapping and ii polymer types for atr ftir analysis mp abundances varied for the environmental samples from 157 to 2928 per filter during chemical mapping fig 1 that were detected when analysing 66 of the filter for atr ftir analysis the mp abundances varied between 18 and 123 per sample figure s 3 using microsoft excel randomly 10 filter areas subsets of particles respectively were generated representing 75 50 25 10 5 1 and 0 5 of the total sample within these sample fractions the representation of polymer types and mp number concentrations was assessed and their coefficient of variation calculated a coefficient of variation 1 indicates an acceptable variance and was set as threshold to provide sufficiently robust data on mp numbers and respective polymer types 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessment of data reliability this study was conducted by following the qa qc recommendations by koelmans et al 2019 which have also been adopted in recent reports ukwir 2019 who 2019 based on the provided quality criteria this study would score 17 out of 18 points and data would thus be assessed as reliable one point was subtracted as sample preparation was not done under clean air conditions the overall score is higher than the average scores from studies on surface waters 4 15 mean 7 9 and on wwtp effluents 3 13 mean 7 3 koelmans et al 2019 generated data will still inhere a certain degree of uncertainty introduced during sampling sample handling and analysis of parts of a sample only the latter was assessed for an accurate representation of mp number concentrations fig 1a and polymer types after micro ftir analysis fig 1b figure s 2 as well as polymer types after atr ftir analysis figure s 3 independently of varying mp abundances mp number concentrations were represented with an acceptable coefficient of variance 1 when mapping 50 and 75 of the filter area the same applied for 25 if several thousand mp were concentrated on a filter lower mp abundances and especially a partial analysis of 10 or less of a filter considerably increased uncertainties fig 1a the five samples contained 9 to 15 polymer types all were presented with an acceptable level of uncertainty coefficient of variance 0 02 0 53 when analysing 75 of a filter fig 1b fig s2 the same applied for the most common polymer types e g polyethylene pe polypropylene pp or rubber type 3 when analysing at least 5 of the filter the correct representation of more rare polymer types by analysing ever smaller filter areas depends on original mp abundances fig 1b figure s 2 however these rare polymer types are likely overlooked when analysing 5 of a filter and represented inaccurately for a partial filter analysis of 10 50 depending on mp abundances combining these two aspects it is thus recommended to map at least 50 of a filter using micro ftir if a filter contains several thousand mp it might also be sufficient to analyse 10 25 of a filter analysing 5 or less of a filter should certainly be avoided otherwise data on mp numbers and polymer types will entail high uncertainty levels this becomes even more important considering that mp are not distributed evenly on a filter peeken et al 2018 however there are further restrictions during chemical mapping as the correct identification of mp can be hampered by a thick filter cake löder et al 2015 lorenz et al 2019 to generate accurate results high sample volumes and a good sample preparation with a high mp extraction efficiency should be strived for lorenz et al 2019 we also assessed the accurate representation of polymer types when analysing ever smaller subsets of pre sorted particles with atr ftir independently of the samples total number of sorted particles the presence of polymer types was depicted accurately when analysing 75 of all particles figure s 3 rare polymers were overlooked and uncertainties around presented polymer distributions became unacceptably high when analysing 10 25 of the particles which corresponds to approximately 10 20 particles in agreement with the recommendations by koelmans et al 2019 analysing all or at least 50 of the pre sorted potential synthetic particles will depict abundances of different polymer types with an acceptable level of uncertainty 3 2 mp in riverine surface waters mp number concentrations mp particles and fibres down to a detection limit of 20 μm were detected in all samples number concentrations varied between 67 and 11532 median 862 mp m 3 figs 2 and 4 mp in surface waters of the meuse have been assessed by one earlier study the results however are not comparable due to different methodologies and reportage of results leslie et al 2017 globally between 0 and 1 3 104 mp m 3 median 2 75 mp m 3 were reported in riverine surface waters koelmans et al 2019 the here presented numbers are at the higher ends of this range this could be explained by studies targeting different mp sizes the current size limit is lower compared to studies that sampled with a 333 μm neuston net and reported lower number concentrations baldwin et al 2016 hoellein et al 2017 further the majority of studies reported on a few polymer types only koelmans et al 2019 while in the present study 26 different polymer types were identified figure s 4 the here applied automated image analysis of ftir data is a major step forward as it circumvents human bias and automatically compares spectra against a standardized database of common polymer types primpke et al 2018 in this way rare polymer types or very small mp are not overseen but identified correctly mani et al 2019 remarkably several types of rubbers were highly abundant which has not yet been reported for riverine surface waters in earlier studies data on mp in environmental samples constitute merely a snapshot of the environmental situation and the processes taking place until now only a few studies examined individual rivers over their length in detail ding et al 2019 hurley et al 2018 mani et al 2015 to better understand the mp distribution on a systems level the sampling was restricted to two river systems reducing the number of variables that need to be taken into account when comparing generated data the snapshot character of data was reduced by choosing sampling locations at a high spatial resolution and by assessing temporal variations slight differences in regard to mp number concentrations were found for the two river systems in the meuse the concentrations ranged from 177 to 1381 median 867 mp m 3 fig 2a while concentrations in the dommel and its tributaries were in the range of 160 to 11 532 median 654 mp m 3 fig 2b although the discharges of dommel and meuse differ by a factor of 100 mp concentrations are rather similar in both rivers mp abundances did not increase continuously over the river length highest concentrations were detected in the downstream part of the dommel close to the cities eindhoven 8450 mp m 3 and stoedenrode 11532 mp m 3 this is in line with the findings of kataoka et al 2019 and mani et al 2015 who could link higher mp abundances to the vicinity to urban areas in contrast the more rural part of the dommel including all locations that lie upstream of eindhoven revealed much lower mp concentrations median 309 mp m 3 fig 2b the shapiro wilk normality tests indicated that mp number concentrations were non normally distributed amongst wwtp effluents and river systems thus a non parametric kruskal wallis rank sum test was conducted revealing significant differences between the upstream and downstream locations of the dommel p value 0 0032 which was also confirmed by the dunn test adjusted p value of 0 0024 no significant differences were found between these locations and the samples from the meuse or the wwtp effluents to reduce levels of suspended matter the dommel passes the klotputten a wide basin with low flow velocities 0 002 m s 1 on average that facilitates sedimentation processes surface water was sampled at the upstream and downstream end of this basin contrary to expectations mp concentrations did not decrease and were even slightly higher at the downstream location 587 compared to 460 mp m 3 fig 2b in contrast the sampled sedimentation basins of de biesbosch revealed a considerable decrease of mp from surface waters due to low flow velocities this might be explained by the much longer residence times at drimmelen water from the meuse is pumped into the basins to facilitate the settling of natural suspended matter mp also settled resulting in decreasing mp concentrations from 789 mp m 3 drimmelen to 607 mp m 3 biesbosch1 and 67 mp m 3 biesbosch2 fig 2a similar polymer types were present in the three samples however their numbers and proportions changed compared to the inlet water surface water in the first sedimentation pond contained less particles made from pp and the acrylates polyurethanes varnish cluster the lower mp numbers in the second pond can be explained by the strong decline of pe and rubber type 3 particles in comparison to the first pond fig 2a the discharges of wwtps are expected to influence the distribution of mp in a river mp concentrations in the effluents ranged from 941 to 1741 median 1024 mp m 3 fig 2a b they were thus higher than mp detected in the upstream regions of the dommel but comparable to the ones reported for the downstream locations riverine surface water was sampled up and downstream of these effluents discharging points the upstream locations in stoedenrode and roermond revealed a higher contamination than the effluents or the downstream locations the mp concentration in the effluent of the wwtp eindhoven was lower than the one identified in the upstream location and can thus not explain the concentration increase in the dommel from 2678 to 8450 mp m 3 fig 2b although wwtps continuously add mp to the river systems we could not see a general increase in mp abundances at the sampled downstream locations higher mp concentrations might rather be linked to diffuse sources hurley and nizzetto 2018 or other riverine dynamics and processes one of these processes could also be weather induced variations these were assessed at wwtp effluents when examining the effluents of two smaller wwtps maasbommel and oijen for mp 300 μm for which concentrations of 46 and 1494 mp m 3 were observed fig s5 the latter was recorded at the wwtp oijen when sampling the effluent during a strong rain event with an effluent discharge of 10560 m3 h 1 which was considerably higher than the monthly average of 1 550 m3 h 1 two weeks later the same effluent was sampled again three subsequent times under normal weather conditions table s1 lower concentrations of 211 279 and 711 mp m 3 were detected still mp abundances were much higher than determined in the effluents of the other four wwtps where a mean concentration of 77 sd 44 mp m 3 was retained on the 300 μm sieve these data confirm findings that mp number concentrations can vary between wwtp effluents mintenig et al 2017 simon et al 2018 and that this strongly depends on weather and rain conditions primpke et al 2017a wolff et al 2019 this not just holds true for wwtp samples but environmental samples in general where an increase of mp in surface water has been linked to higher flow regimes cheung et al 2018 hurley et al 2018 watkins et al 2019 mp concentrations in the dommel were linked to respective flow velocities table s1 fig s6 the critical shear stress equation waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2019 indicates a critical flow velocity of 0 275 m s 1 that led to an increase of mp in surface waters at flow velocities higher than that concentrations above 6800 mp m 3 were detected for mp 20 μm around eindhoven and stoedenrode these concentrations are considerably higher than at lower flow velocities where we found a mean concentration of 924 sd 722 mp m 3 one of the study aims was to interpret data in respect to the system scale behaviour thus we assessed if the variability of detected mp concentrations would be influenced more by spatial than by temporal aspects within three weeks in autumn 2017 13 locations in the dommel were sampled under very similar weather conditions the sampling was repeated at stoedenrode for another five times in 2018 table s 1 fig 3 the kruskal wallis rank sum test revealed no significant differences p value 0 1346 between spatial seasonal or daily variability fig 3 differences within the dommel only become significant if differentiating again between the rural and urban areas p value 0 0157 while spatial differences caused mp number concentrations to vary by two orders of magnitude temporal variations were lower and induced a maximum variation of one order of magnitude this confirms that spatial differences like geographical and demographic differences or the inputs of wwtps induce larger variations in a system compared to the temporal variations at one location due to e g differences in flow or wind conditions also within a day the determined mp concentrations varied however differences were comparably low and varied by a factor of 1 4 in stoedenrode fig 3 table s 3 and 3 4 in the effluents of the wwtp oijen where mp 300 μm was identified figure s 5 table s 3 mp sizes and shapes in all samples more particles than fibres were detected fibres accounted for 1 4 34 median 12 9 of the total mp numbers in surface water and for 12 5 22 9 median 12 4 in wwtp effluent samples on average fibres were 300 μm long their width was approximately 15 μm which is in accordance to other studies napper and thompson 2016 pirc et al 2016 at all locations increasing abundances with decreasing mp sizes were detected in total 67 1 of all mp was smaller than 100 μm fig 4a with 26 3 being smaller than 25 μm and 18 5 of the mp having their longest dimension between 25 and 50 μm only 6 7 were longer than 300 μm and 1 1 longer than 1 mm respectively the fitted power law resulted in an exponent α 2 79 with an r2 of 0 93 figure s 7 which is comparable to the ones found in literature kooi and koelmans 2019 the mesh size during sampling and sample handling was 20 μm smaller mp could have been retained when filters started clogging however small mp particles or fibres might also have passed sieves vertically or might not have been detected during micro ftir analysis as such number concentrations of mp of approximately 20 μm are likely to even be higher polymer types in total 26 different polymer types were identified figure s 4 the samples from the meuse contained on average 13 sd 2 different polymer types while 12 sd 3 were detected in the dommel and 15 sd 2 in the wwtp effluents respectively most abundant polymer types were pe pp rubber type 3 nitrile rubber and acrylates polyurethanes varnish which together represented 81 of all identified mp particles and fibres fig 2 figure s 4 pe 23 and pp 19 7 were detected most frequently both polymer types have been reported in high concentrations earlier rubber type 3 18 3 which is ethylene propylene diene monomer epdm rubber was the third most abundant polymer type identified epdm is commonly used as sealing material for tubes car doors but also in building and roof constructions until now it was rarely detected in the environment this might be explained by the identification methods used as recent studies that also applied micro ftir with automated image analysis were able to identify epdm and other types of rubber in considerable concentrations haave et al 2019 mani et al 2019 as knowledge on rubber particles in the environment is very limited these data are of particular interest this especially holds true for the abrasion of car tyres which are considered a major source of mp to the environment boucher et al 2019 hurley and nizzetto 2018 however no data are yet available to verify emission statistics kole et al 2017 as already indicated by haave et al 2019 it is difficult to assess car tyre abrasives high contents of carbon black hampers the identification by micro ftir of one of its main components styrene butadiene rubber sbr further its density is higher than the commonly used zncl2 solution 1 6 g cm 3 therefore other sample preparation and identification methods than used in the current study are required to estimate abrasions of car tyres in the environment also remaining rubber types such as nitrile rubber cannot solely be linked to traffic activities as their fields of application are so diverse the different mp sizes also reflect differences in relative abundances of polymer types mp larger than 1 mm were almost exclusively made from pe or pp smaller mp had a much higher polymer diversity fig 4a the same conclusions were drawn by recent studies which also applied micro ftir with automated image analysis haave et al 2019 lorenz et al 2019 mani et al 2019 this emphasizes the importance of examining these small mp to correctly depict occurrences and distributions of polymer types in the environment mp mass concentrations for all samples taken in the dommel and in the meuse the total mp mass concentration was estimated as described in section 2 4 the mass based concentration varied between 51 and 7270 median 670 μg m 3 in general samples with low mp number concentrations also revealed low mass concentrations samples taken in the haringvliet and stoedenrode first replicate taken on 21 8 2018 revealed comparably low mass concentrations which however could not be explained by particularly high numbers of small particles table s 3 mp smaller than 100 μm were most frequent by numbers however their individual weight was so low that they contributed only for approximately 2 to the total mp mass concentration fig 4b total mass was largely determined by the presence of mp 2 mm as these mp are almost exclusively made of pe and pp it is not surprising that the two polymer types constitute the largest share in terms of mp mass concentration fig 4b table s 3 3 3 general discussion until now only a few studies have focused on examining the spatial distribution of mp in individual rivers in detail ding et al 2019 mani et al 2015 only five studies identified mp with a detection limit of approximately 50 μm but all selected particles for further identification and did not include chemical mapping koelmans et al 2019 this is the first study assessing the spatial and temporal variability of mp down to a size of 20 μm using ftir microscopy followed by an automated image analysis primpke et al 2019 as such the results provide a valuable insight into the presence and distribution of various polymer types in riverine surface waters and wwtp effluents several studies have discussed the need to implement standardized qa qc criteria to generate reliable and comparable data filella 2015 hermsen et al 2018 koelmans et al 2019 provided guidelines for nine criteria for the analysis of mp in aqueous samples one of them recommends that at least 25 of a filter should be analysed during chemical mapping based on here presented data we favour that at least 50 of a filter should be mapped to accurately assess mp number concentrations and polymer types this also reduces the risk of data misinterpretation due to the uneven distribution of mp on a filter peeken et al 2018 further aspects that should be considered are high original sample volumes and efficient mp extraction steps to increase actual numbers of identified particles further the analysis of at least 50 pre sorted particles with atr ftir showed that different polymer types were presented with an acceptable level of uncertainty in this study care was taken that the complete sample after mp extraction was concentrated on one or more anodisc filter and that of each filter at least 60 were chemically mapped for mp 300 μm a visual pre selection of potentially synthetic particles was unavoidable from which a minimum of 50 particles 32 76 of the sorted particles was analysed with atr ftir as such we consider our data to reflect actual mp numbers and polymer types relatively accurate however we might have underestimated concentrations of mp of around 20 μm which would imply that levels of mp pollution are higher than concluded here the cumulative frequency distribution of detected mp number concentrations covers a range from 67 to 11532 mp m 3 fig 4c samples were taken from different representative water system types that are typical for the netherlands including small ditches the rural and urban parts of an intermediate river and a big international waterway therefore we argue that this distribution of mp concentrations represents that of all dutch riverine surface waters reasonably well enabling a generic assessment of risks for aquatic biota to do so one needs to combine exposure and effect concentrations koelmans et al 2017 until now four studies presented an environmental risk assessment of mp with estimates for the predicted no effect concentration pnec which is the threshold concentration at which no adverse effects are expected to occur adam et al 2019 besseling et al 2019 burns and boxall 2018 everaert et al 2018 the pnec estimates do not differentiate between mp sizes or polymer types therefore neither does the frequency distribution of mp number concentrations from dommel and meuse the majority of locations revealed mp concentrations that are below or even considerably below the determined pnec concentrations fig 4c only in three surface water samples all taken in the region of eindhoven and stoedenrode mp concentrations were higher than the pnec as derived by everaert 6 7 103 mp m 3 in comparison the pnecs of the other three studies are two to four orders of magnitude higher than the pnec defined by everaert et al 2018 adam et al 2019 found no significant differences of expected effects for different polymer types or shapes it is however assumed that effects vary for the various mp sizes and that smaller sizes will be more hazardous koelmans et al 2017 redondo hasselerharm et al 2018 it should also be mentioned that mp used in toxicity studies underlying the pnec calculations might not represent the various forms sizes and polymer types of environmental mp well enough kooi and koelmans 2019 further it is assumed that concentrations of today are not what can be expected in the future because of increasing plastic production and use the plastics persistance and continous fragmentation in the environment which imply that future mp concentrations will be higher than the ones currently measured everaert et al 2018 koelmans et al 2017 4 conclusions in this study we assessed the distribution of mp in riverine surface waters of two dutch river systems samples were taken at a high spatial resolution and repeated over time at selected locations we further attached particular value to the implementation of high qa qc criteria koelmans et al 2019 to identify mp with a detection limit of 20 μm using ftir microscopy followed by an automated image analysis primpke et al 2019 the latter circumvents any human bias during data analysis by which it is more likely that rare polymer types and very small mp are not overseen but identified correctly this way 26 different polymer types including partly highly abundant rubbers were identified of which several have not yet been reported in riverine surface waters frequently only parts of a sample are analysed for mp by partial filter analysis or subsampling it is however unclear how much analytical uncertainty can be introduced by doing so we estimated that during chemical mapping at least 50 of a filter should be analysed to guarantee an accurate representation of mp number concentrations and polymer types in two dutch river systems between 67 and 11532 mp m 3 were identified virtually all of these concentrations are considerably below known effect thresholds thus based on the current knowledge mp associated risks for aquatic biota are not likely to be anticipated in dutch riverine surface waters the three locations with mp number concentrations above one of the pnecs were in the vicinity to big cities if risks are to be expected they will most likely be highest in highly urbanized and polluted areas authors agreement smm and mk designed the study together with scd aak and apvw smm mk and mwe performed the field work smm and mwe prepared the samples and performed μftir measurements

17968,assessment methods on data quality and environmental variability are lacking for microplastics mp here we assess occurrence and variability of mp number concentrations in two dutch rivers strict qa qc procedures were applied to identify mp using fourier transform infrared ftir microscopy followed by state of the art automated image analysis for a series of randomly selected yet ever smaller subareas of filters we assessed how accurately mp numbers and polymer types are represented during partial filter analysis levels of uncertainty were acceptable when analysing 50 of a filter during chemical mapping and when identifying at least a subset of 50 individual particles with attenuated total reflection atr ftir applying these guidelines mp number concentrations between 67 and 11532 mp m 3 were detected in dutch riverine surface waters spatial differences caused mp number concentrations to vary by two orders of magnitude temporal differences were lower and induced a maximum variation of one order of magnitude in total 26 polymer types were identified the most common were polyethylene 23 polypropylene 19 7 and ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber 18 3 the highest diversity of polymer types was found for small mps whereas mp larger than 1 mm was scarce and almost exclusively made of polyethylene or polypropylene virtually all sampling locations revealed mp number concentrations that are considerably below known effect thresholds for anticipated adverse ecological effects graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics spatial and temporal variability freshwater water quality ftir microscopy automated image analysis 1 introduction microplastics mp have been detected globally across all major environmental compartments it is expected that most of the plastic litter originates from land based sources and is relocated by e g urban runoff or riverine transport towards the marine environment hurley and nizzetto 2018 rochman 2018 the latter has been confirmed recently by lorenz et al 2019 who examined the mp distribution in the southern north sea and found highest concentrations in surface waters where riverine input of the thames and rhine occurs although awareness of the relevance of this transport route is rising knowledge on mp in rivers is still scattered mp have been reported in various river systems in sediment hurley et al 2018 mani et al 2019 water cheung et al 2018 kataoka et al 2019 koelmans et al 2019 or biota samples roch et al 2019 with reported concentrations varying by several orders of magnitude adam et al 2019 koelmans et al 2019 various large and small scale processes affect mp concentrations and its distribution within a river system higher mp concentrations in surface waters have been linked to the vicinity to urbanized areas kataoka et al 2019 mani et al 2015 or higher flow velocities during rain events cheung et al 2018 that cause settled mp to be released from sediments flow conditions can thus substantially change the spatial distribution of mp in a river eo et al 2019 hurley et al 2018 kooi et al 2018 and can strongly vary over the seasons yet only a few studies considered this and determined mp over a longer time period watkins et al 2019 identified higher mp concentrations in surface waters during low flow conditions in summer and eo et al 2019 found highest mp abundances during the dry and wet season while concentrations were significantly lower during a moderate season further insights on seasonal variations are needed discharges of waste water treatment plants wwtps are expected to be an important point source for mp thereby affecting the distribution of mp in a river boucher et al 2019 the presence of mp in wwtp effluents has been confirmed by multiple studies mintenig et al 2017 simon et al 2018 talvitie et al 2017 though reported concentrations vary considerably koelmans et al 2019 these variations in observed mp concentrations may exist due to when and where samples were taken and thus reflect the variability on a wwtp or system s level these variations however can also depend on how the samples were taken or how mp were extracted and analysed connors et al 2017 filella 2015 to be able to distinguish between system level variability and procedural uncertainty it is required to follow strict quality assurance quality control qa qc procedures recently hermsen et al 2018 and koelmans et al 2019 assessed the reliability of studies by evaluating a set of defined qa qc criteria only four out of 50 reviewed studies that examined mp in aqueous samples were confirmed to fulfil all proposed quality criteria koelmans et al 2019 which indicates limitations with respect to the reliability of studies and increases the uncertainty around generated data one of the proposed criteria describes the need to identify the particles chemical nature for a sufficient amount of particles numerous studies did not include any polymer identification step but purely relied on a visual selection of particles confirming the presence of specific polymer types is essential to be able to see patterns to point out potential sources and to properly link results of exposure and effect studies kooi and koelmans 2019 potthoff et al 2017 the more recent studies do identify the particles chemical nature lorenz et al 2019 mani et al 2019 due to long analysis times this is frequently done for a part of a sample only lorenz et al 2019 mintenig et al 2017 simon et al 2018 peeken et al 2018 applied chemical imaging on three subareas of a filter by which they found that mp were distributed unevenly on a filter analysing small subareas of filters with fourier transform infrared ftir or raman spectroscopy might thus considerably under or overestimate actual mp abundances still the uncertainty introduced by partial filter analysis or by identifying a subset of particles using attenuated total reflectance atr ftir has not yet been quantified we argue that it is needed to systematically assess the trade off between shortening the analysis time and the loss of information and accuracy on mp numbers and polymer types as sample handling and mp analysis are laborious finding the balance between a doable analysis time and an acceptable level of analytically introduced uncertainty constitutes a major step forward this study aimed to assess the occurrence of mp and to explore its variability in surface waters of two dutch river systems strict qa qc procedures hermsen et al 2018 koelmans et al 2019 were followed to identify mp down to 20 μm using ftir microscopy followed by an automated image analysis primpke et al 2019 sampling locations were chosen 1 with a high spatial resolution and at different flow velocities in the river dommel to assess the spatial variability of mp within one river 2 with two locations where the sampling was repeated to assess the seasonal and daily variation of mp occurrences and 3 included wwtp effluents as well as an up and downstream sampling location of their discharging points to assess the relative contribution of wwtps to the total riverine mp load a secondary aim was to assess the introduced uncertainty through partial filter analysis and the analysis of a subset of particles by comparing generated mp data for a series of randomly selected yet ever smaller fractions on their accurate representation of mp numbers and polymer types finally generated mp data are discussed in the context of previously reported concentrations and of anticipated risks for aquatic biota 2 material and methods 2 1 study area mp were identified and quantified in surface waters of the dutch part of the meuse river basin one of its tributaries is the dommel that originates in belgium and flows over a length of 80 km through the netherlands flow velocities of the dommel vary over the river length and over the seasons 0 001 0 98 m s 1 mean 0 28 m s 1 with a mean discharge of 3 1 m3 s 1 the dommel is fed by the discharges of three wwtps as well as by several smaller tributaries and combined sewer overflows de klein et al 2016 the dommel is well studied and described in a temporal and spatial explicit model nanoduflow which is based on hydrological data of the dommel and has been applied to study transport of metal based nanoparticles de klein et al 2016 and nano and microplastics besseling et al 2017 the meuse has an average width of about 100 m and an average discharge of 350 m³ s 1 the meuse is mostly rain fed resulting in strong differences between summer and winter flow regimes the dutch part of the river basin is characterized by a high number of inhabitants intensive agriculture and industry at the same time the meuse is used as a source for drinking water production three subsequent basins built in the 1970s in the national park de biesbosch enable water storage and sedimentation processes to improve water quality surface water samples were taken in the dutch part and over the lengths of both rivers the meuse n 12 and the dommel n 20 fig 2 locations included the sedimentation basins and the effluents of five wwtps discharging directly or indirectly into the two rivers were sampled the majority of samples was taken in autumn 2017 the sampling was repeated at two sites during different seasons in 2018 table s 1 2 2 sampling a centrifugal water pump leo 4xcm 120c china was used to filter surface water over stacked stainless steel sieves with mesh sizes of 300 μm 100 μm and 20 μm ø 20 cm thermofisher scientific usa the inlet tube polyvinyl chloride pvc was equipped with a metal cap opening 2 cm and mounted on a wooden pallet this enabled sampling the upper 5 cm of the water column and an upstream orientation of the tube before sampling tubes and pump were primed for 5 min and the sieves rinsed with filtered surface water the sample volume was determined by a connected water meter between 1 3 and 8 m3 were filtered with a flow rate of approximately 2 m³ h 1 over the two bigger sieves the sample volume depended on the amount of suspended matter regularly the flow was lowered and the 20 μm sieve placed underneath the other sieves by doing so 0 03 2 25 m³ water were filtered over the 20 μm sieve which on average represented 15 of the total sample volume table s 1 the residues were rinsed into individual glass bottles that were closed with aluminium foil and stored at 4 c until further processing in the laboratory materials retained on the sieves or mp enclosed in aggregates resulted in capturing also mp smaller than the respective mesh sizes during sampling care was taken that the outlet tube discharged the filtered water downstream of the sampling location airborne contamination was abated by covering the upper sieve with a metal lid in which the inlet tube was hung 2 3 sample preparation sample preparation to extract mp retained on the 20 and 100 μm sampling sieves was done at kwr watercycle research institute the netherlands the sorting of mp 300 μm and all ftir analyses were conducted in the laboratories of wageningen university and research the netherlands during sample preparation quality criteria as presented by koelmans et al 2019 were followed before starting to handle environmental samples the susceptibility to contamination and the achievability of a good mp recovery were tested for three working places used in literature namely a normal lab bench dris et al 2015 mintenig et al 2017 a glove box torre et al 2016 and a laminar flow hood lorenz et al 2019 peeken et al 2018 to do so samples of 1 l of milli q water underwent the same steps as environmental samples for further details on these pre tests contamination mitigation and quality assurance we refer to the supplementary information paragraph s1 mp 300 μm the residues of the 300 μm sampling sieve were visually inspected using a stereomicroscope nikon stereo smz2t japan the sorting of potential mp particles was facilitated using a bogorov chamber polymethyl methacrylate pmma 70 ml hydrobios germany all particles with a bright or transparent colour no cellular structures and certain bending properties were isolated photographed euromex cmex 5 mp the netherlands and measured at their longest and shortest dimension at the same time their shape and colour were noted mp 300 μm multiple steps were taken to reduce natural organic and inorganic sample components when extracting mp retained on the 20 and 100 μm sampling sieves figure s 1 purification started with the addition of sodium dodecylsulphate sds 5 serva electrophoresis gmbh germany after which potassium hydroxide koh 10 carl roth gmbh germany and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 32 carl roth gmbh germany were added before adding the subsequent chemical samples were filtered over a stainless steel 20 μm mesh placed in a stainless steel filter capsule further required were a vacuum pump me1c dijkstra vereenigde the netherlands and a teflon tube attached to the filter capsule the sample residues on the 20 μm meshes were transferred into beakers and the subsequent chemical was added during all steps an incubation temperature of 35 c was kept for which samples were placed in an oven inorganic particles were removed by performing a density separation using a zinc chloride zncl2 carl roth gmbh germany solution with a density of 1 6 g cm 3 from the 20 μm mesh residues were rinsed with the zncl2 solution into separation funnels and were left to settle for 24 h materials with a density above 1 6 g cm 3 settled to the bottom and were removed by regularly and slowly turning the outlet valve all lighter materials were filtered one more time over the 20 μm mesh then onto 0 2 μm aluminium oxide filters anodisc 25 mm whatman u k for which a filtration funnel with an inner diameter of 15 mm was used these filters were placed into slightly opened glass petri dishes and dried at 35 c for five days during sample preparation cross contamination was minimized by always using the same 20 μm steel mesh and glass beaker for individual samples in parallel to actual samples procedural blanks were treated and analysed and their results were considered when analysing mp in environmental samples paragraph s1 2 4 mp identification and quantification mp 300 μm atr ftir sorted potentially synthetic particles larger than 300 μm were identified using atr ftir varian 1000 ft ir agilent usa particles were placed individually onto the atr crystal polymer types were identified based on the recorded spectra 600 4000 cm 1 with the aid of the hummel polymer and ftir spectral library thermofisher scientific usa if the number of sorted particles was 50 all particles were analysed a subset of 50 randomly chosen particles 32 76 was identified for eight samples with numbers of sorted particles 50 koelmans et al 2019 to assess the loss of accuracy when analysing only a subset of pre sorted particles all particles 73 123 were analysed for further three samples section 2 6 mp 300 μm micro ftir to identify mp 300 μm an ftir microscope equipped with an ultrafast motorized stage and a single mercury cadmium telluride mct detector nicolet in10 thermofisher scientific usa was used the anodisc filters with sample residues were placed on a calcium fluoride caf2 crystal edmundoptics germany to avoid the filter from bending chemical mapping of these samples was conducted in transmission mode for pre defined filter areas löder et al 2015 mintenig et al 2017 2018 mp from the 100 μm sampling sieve was analysed on a filter area of approximately 12 16 mm 66 of the total filter area ir spectra were recorded with a spatial pixel resolution of 30 μm and in a wavenumber range of 1250 3200 cm 1 the aperature size was set as 50 50 μm controlling the energy amount presented to the sample the spectral resolution was set as 16 cm 1 and 1 scan per pixel was conducted for mp analysis retained on the 20 μm sampling sieve two areas both approximately 88 mm2 and together 62 of the filter area were mapped with a spatial pixel resolution of 20 μm with remaining settings kept unchanged the loss of accuracy by partial analysis of the filter area was quantified separately section 2 6 the generated ftir data were automatically analysed using two software tools mphunter liu et al 2019 and mpapp primpke et al 2019 in combination with the reference database presented by primpke et al 2018 these software tools were later transferred into simple a freeware which can be downloaded via https simple plastics eu within the software all recorded spectra are compared against the spectra of a reference library this is done for the raw spectrum and for its first derivative the resulting hits are afterwards evaluated as described by primpke et al 2017b followed by an image analysis using mpapp this analysis uses first a pixel hole closing mechanism prior to a particle fibre recognition with set parameters primpke et al 2019 and yields in numbers and polymer types for mp particles and fibres including the longest and shortest dimension for individual mp based on criteria presented by primpke et al 2018 polymer specific threshold values were determined by evaluating the spectra of five samples manually table s 2 based on the mp two dimensional shapes the mass per mp and subsequently per sample was estimated to do so we followed the approach by simon et al 2018 and calculated the ratio of the shortest and longest dimension of all identified particles which on average was 0 56 with a standard deviation sd of 0 19 for particles it was assumed that this ratio would be the same for a particle s height and its shorter dimension for fibres the individual lengths were given while a fixed diameter of 15 μm was assumed napper and thompson 2016 pirc et al 2016 the mass was calculated from the mp volume and the density of its material as exact particle densities cannot be determined during analysis the mean polymer densities indicated in literature were used table s 2 2 5 statistical analysis the shapiro wilk normality test was used to test if mp number concentrations were normally distributed amongst wwtps and river systems a non parametric kruskal wallis rank sum test was used to compare mp in grouped locations the dunn test resulted in an adjusted p value based on the benjamini hochberg method which was used to compare differences between individual groups all tests were performed using the software rstudio v 1 1 463 2 6 assessment of data reliability based on generated mp data we assessed how randomly selected yet ever smaller sample fractions being analysed can impact final results and when levels of introduced uncertainties become unacceptable this was done for the partial analysis of a filter during chemical mapping and for the identification of only a subset of pre sorted particles 300 μm using atr ftir for both analyses five samples with varying mp abundances were selected these were assessed in regard to an accurate representation of i mp number concentrations and polymer types during chemical mapping and ii polymer types for atr ftir analysis mp abundances varied for the environmental samples from 157 to 2928 per filter during chemical mapping fig 1 that were detected when analysing 66 of the filter for atr ftir analysis the mp abundances varied between 18 and 123 per sample figure s 3 using microsoft excel randomly 10 filter areas subsets of particles respectively were generated representing 75 50 25 10 5 1 and 0 5 of the total sample within these sample fractions the representation of polymer types and mp number concentrations was assessed and their coefficient of variation calculated a coefficient of variation 1 indicates an acceptable variance and was set as threshold to provide sufficiently robust data on mp numbers and respective polymer types 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessment of data reliability this study was conducted by following the qa qc recommendations by koelmans et al 2019 which have also been adopted in recent reports ukwir 2019 who 2019 based on the provided quality criteria this study would score 17 out of 18 points and data would thus be assessed as reliable one point was subtracted as sample preparation was not done under clean air conditions the overall score is higher than the average scores from studies on surface waters 4 15 mean 7 9 and on wwtp effluents 3 13 mean 7 3 koelmans et al 2019 generated data will still inhere a certain degree of uncertainty introduced during sampling sample handling and analysis of parts of a sample only the latter was assessed for an accurate representation of mp number concentrations fig 1a and polymer types after micro ftir analysis fig 1b figure s 2 as well as polymer types after atr ftir analysis figure s 3 independently of varying mp abundances mp number concentrations were represented with an acceptable coefficient of variance 1 when mapping 50 and 75 of the filter area the same applied for 25 if several thousand mp were concentrated on a filter lower mp abundances and especially a partial analysis of 10 or less of a filter considerably increased uncertainties fig 1a the five samples contained 9 to 15 polymer types all were presented with an acceptable level of uncertainty coefficient of variance 0 02 0 53 when analysing 75 of a filter fig 1b fig s2 the same applied for the most common polymer types e g polyethylene pe polypropylene pp or rubber type 3 when analysing at least 5 of the filter the correct representation of more rare polymer types by analysing ever smaller filter areas depends on original mp abundances fig 1b figure s 2 however these rare polymer types are likely overlooked when analysing 5 of a filter and represented inaccurately for a partial filter analysis of 10 50 depending on mp abundances combining these two aspects it is thus recommended to map at least 50 of a filter using micro ftir if a filter contains several thousand mp it might also be sufficient to analyse 10 25 of a filter analysing 5 or less of a filter should certainly be avoided otherwise data on mp numbers and polymer types will entail high uncertainty levels this becomes even more important considering that mp are not distributed evenly on a filter peeken et al 2018 however there are further restrictions during chemical mapping as the correct identification of mp can be hampered by a thick filter cake löder et al 2015 lorenz et al 2019 to generate accurate results high sample volumes and a good sample preparation with a high mp extraction efficiency should be strived for lorenz et al 2019 we also assessed the accurate representation of polymer types when analysing ever smaller subsets of pre sorted particles with atr ftir independently of the samples total number of sorted particles the presence of polymer types was depicted accurately when analysing 75 of all particles figure s 3 rare polymers were overlooked and uncertainties around presented polymer distributions became unacceptably high when analysing 10 25 of the particles which corresponds to approximately 10 20 particles in agreement with the recommendations by koelmans et al 2019 analysing all or at least 50 of the pre sorted potential synthetic particles will depict abundances of different polymer types with an acceptable level of uncertainty 3 2 mp in riverine surface waters mp number concentrations mp particles and fibres down to a detection limit of 20 μm were detected in all samples number concentrations varied between 67 and 11532 median 862 mp m 3 figs 2 and 4 mp in surface waters of the meuse have been assessed by one earlier study the results however are not comparable due to different methodologies and reportage of results leslie et al 2017 globally between 0 and 1 3 104 mp m 3 median 2 75 mp m 3 were reported in riverine surface waters koelmans et al 2019 the here presented numbers are at the higher ends of this range this could be explained by studies targeting different mp sizes the current size limit is lower compared to studies that sampled with a 333 μm neuston net and reported lower number concentrations baldwin et al 2016 hoellein et al 2017 further the majority of studies reported on a few polymer types only koelmans et al 2019 while in the present study 26 different polymer types were identified figure s 4 the here applied automated image analysis of ftir data is a major step forward as it circumvents human bias and automatically compares spectra against a standardized database of common polymer types primpke et al 2018 in this way rare polymer types or very small mp are not overseen but identified correctly mani et al 2019 remarkably several types of rubbers were highly abundant which has not yet been reported for riverine surface waters in earlier studies data on mp in environmental samples constitute merely a snapshot of the environmental situation and the processes taking place until now only a few studies examined individual rivers over their length in detail ding et al 2019 hurley et al 2018 mani et al 2015 to better understand the mp distribution on a systems level the sampling was restricted to two river systems reducing the number of variables that need to be taken into account when comparing generated data the snapshot character of data was reduced by choosing sampling locations at a high spatial resolution and by assessing temporal variations slight differences in regard to mp number concentrations were found for the two river systems in the meuse the concentrations ranged from 177 to 1381 median 867 mp m 3 fig 2a while concentrations in the dommel and its tributaries were in the range of 160 to 11 532 median 654 mp m 3 fig 2b although the discharges of dommel and meuse differ by a factor of 100 mp concentrations are rather similar in both rivers mp abundances did not increase continuously over the river length highest concentrations were detected in the downstream part of the dommel close to the cities eindhoven 8450 mp m 3 and stoedenrode 11532 mp m 3 this is in line with the findings of kataoka et al 2019 and mani et al 2015 who could link higher mp abundances to the vicinity to urban areas in contrast the more rural part of the dommel including all locations that lie upstream of eindhoven revealed much lower mp concentrations median 309 mp m 3 fig 2b the shapiro wilk normality tests indicated that mp number concentrations were non normally distributed amongst wwtp effluents and river systems thus a non parametric kruskal wallis rank sum test was conducted revealing significant differences between the upstream and downstream locations of the dommel p value 0 0032 which was also confirmed by the dunn test adjusted p value of 0 0024 no significant differences were found between these locations and the samples from the meuse or the wwtp effluents to reduce levels of suspended matter the dommel passes the klotputten a wide basin with low flow velocities 0 002 m s 1 on average that facilitates sedimentation processes surface water was sampled at the upstream and downstream end of this basin contrary to expectations mp concentrations did not decrease and were even slightly higher at the downstream location 587 compared to 460 mp m 3 fig 2b in contrast the sampled sedimentation basins of de biesbosch revealed a considerable decrease of mp from surface waters due to low flow velocities this might be explained by the much longer residence times at drimmelen water from the meuse is pumped into the basins to facilitate the settling of natural suspended matter mp also settled resulting in decreasing mp concentrations from 789 mp m 3 drimmelen to 607 mp m 3 biesbosch1 and 67 mp m 3 biesbosch2 fig 2a similar polymer types were present in the three samples however their numbers and proportions changed compared to the inlet water surface water in the first sedimentation pond contained less particles made from pp and the acrylates polyurethanes varnish cluster the lower mp numbers in the second pond can be explained by the strong decline of pe and rubber type 3 particles in comparison to the first pond fig 2a the discharges of wwtps are expected to influence the distribution of mp in a river mp concentrations in the effluents ranged from 941 to 1741 median 1024 mp m 3 fig 2a b they were thus higher than mp detected in the upstream regions of the dommel but comparable to the ones reported for the downstream locations riverine surface water was sampled up and downstream of these effluents discharging points the upstream locations in stoedenrode and roermond revealed a higher contamination than the effluents or the downstream locations the mp concentration in the effluent of the wwtp eindhoven was lower than the one identified in the upstream location and can thus not explain the concentration increase in the dommel from 2678 to 8450 mp m 3 fig 2b although wwtps continuously add mp to the river systems we could not see a general increase in mp abundances at the sampled downstream locations higher mp concentrations might rather be linked to diffuse sources hurley and nizzetto 2018 or other riverine dynamics and processes one of these processes could also be weather induced variations these were assessed at wwtp effluents when examining the effluents of two smaller wwtps maasbommel and oijen for mp 300 μm for which concentrations of 46 and 1494 mp m 3 were observed fig s5 the latter was recorded at the wwtp oijen when sampling the effluent during a strong rain event with an effluent discharge of 10560 m3 h 1 which was considerably higher than the monthly average of 1 550 m3 h 1 two weeks later the same effluent was sampled again three subsequent times under normal weather conditions table s1 lower concentrations of 211 279 and 711 mp m 3 were detected still mp abundances were much higher than determined in the effluents of the other four wwtps where a mean concentration of 77 sd 44 mp m 3 was retained on the 300 μm sieve these data confirm findings that mp number concentrations can vary between wwtp effluents mintenig et al 2017 simon et al 2018 and that this strongly depends on weather and rain conditions primpke et al 2017a wolff et al 2019 this not just holds true for wwtp samples but environmental samples in general where an increase of mp in surface water has been linked to higher flow regimes cheung et al 2018 hurley et al 2018 watkins et al 2019 mp concentrations in the dommel were linked to respective flow velocities table s1 fig s6 the critical shear stress equation waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2019 indicates a critical flow velocity of 0 275 m s 1 that led to an increase of mp in surface waters at flow velocities higher than that concentrations above 6800 mp m 3 were detected for mp 20 μm around eindhoven and stoedenrode these concentrations are considerably higher than at lower flow velocities where we found a mean concentration of 924 sd 722 mp m 3 one of the study aims was to interpret data in respect to the system scale behaviour thus we assessed if the variability of detected mp concentrations would be influenced more by spatial than by temporal aspects within three weeks in autumn 2017 13 locations in the dommel were sampled under very similar weather conditions the sampling was repeated at stoedenrode for another five times in 2018 table s 1 fig 3 the kruskal wallis rank sum test revealed no significant differences p value 0 1346 between spatial seasonal or daily variability fig 3 differences within the dommel only become significant if differentiating again between the rural and urban areas p value 0 0157 while spatial differences caused mp number concentrations to vary by two orders of magnitude temporal variations were lower and induced a maximum variation of one order of magnitude this confirms that spatial differences like geographical and demographic differences or the inputs of wwtps induce larger variations in a system compared to the temporal variations at one location due to e g differences in flow or wind conditions also within a day the determined mp concentrations varied however differences were comparably low and varied by a factor of 1 4 in stoedenrode fig 3 table s 3 and 3 4 in the effluents of the wwtp oijen where mp 300 μm was identified figure s 5 table s 3 mp sizes and shapes in all samples more particles than fibres were detected fibres accounted for 1 4 34 median 12 9 of the total mp numbers in surface water and for 12 5 22 9 median 12 4 in wwtp effluent samples on average fibres were 300 μm long their width was approximately 15 μm which is in accordance to other studies napper and thompson 2016 pirc et al 2016 at all locations increasing abundances with decreasing mp sizes were detected in total 67 1 of all mp was smaller than 100 μm fig 4a with 26 3 being smaller than 25 μm and 18 5 of the mp having their longest dimension between 25 and 50 μm only 6 7 were longer than 300 μm and 1 1 longer than 1 mm respectively the fitted power law resulted in an exponent α 2 79 with an r2 of 0 93 figure s 7 which is comparable to the ones found in literature kooi and koelmans 2019 the mesh size during sampling and sample handling was 20 μm smaller mp could have been retained when filters started clogging however small mp particles or fibres might also have passed sieves vertically or might not have been detected during micro ftir analysis as such number concentrations of mp of approximately 20 μm are likely to even be higher polymer types in total 26 different polymer types were identified figure s 4 the samples from the meuse contained on average 13 sd 2 different polymer types while 12 sd 3 were detected in the dommel and 15 sd 2 in the wwtp effluents respectively most abundant polymer types were pe pp rubber type 3 nitrile rubber and acrylates polyurethanes varnish which together represented 81 of all identified mp particles and fibres fig 2 figure s 4 pe 23 and pp 19 7 were detected most frequently both polymer types have been reported in high concentrations earlier rubber type 3 18 3 which is ethylene propylene diene monomer epdm rubber was the third most abundant polymer type identified epdm is commonly used as sealing material for tubes car doors but also in building and roof constructions until now it was rarely detected in the environment this might be explained by the identification methods used as recent studies that also applied micro ftir with automated image analysis were able to identify epdm and other types of rubber in considerable concentrations haave et al 2019 mani et al 2019 as knowledge on rubber particles in the environment is very limited these data are of particular interest this especially holds true for the abrasion of car tyres which are considered a major source of mp to the environment boucher et al 2019 hurley and nizzetto 2018 however no data are yet available to verify emission statistics kole et al 2017 as already indicated by haave et al 2019 it is difficult to assess car tyre abrasives high contents of carbon black hampers the identification by micro ftir of one of its main components styrene butadiene rubber sbr further its density is higher than the commonly used zncl2 solution 1 6 g cm 3 therefore other sample preparation and identification methods than used in the current study are required to estimate abrasions of car tyres in the environment also remaining rubber types such as nitrile rubber cannot solely be linked to traffic activities as their fields of application are so diverse the different mp sizes also reflect differences in relative abundances of polymer types mp larger than 1 mm were almost exclusively made from pe or pp smaller mp had a much higher polymer diversity fig 4a the same conclusions were drawn by recent studies which also applied micro ftir with automated image analysis haave et al 2019 lorenz et al 2019 mani et al 2019 this emphasizes the importance of examining these small mp to correctly depict occurrences and distributions of polymer types in the environment mp mass concentrations for all samples taken in the dommel and in the meuse the total mp mass concentration was estimated as described in section 2 4 the mass based concentration varied between 51 and 7270 median 670 μg m 3 in general samples with low mp number concentrations also revealed low mass concentrations samples taken in the haringvliet and stoedenrode first replicate taken on 21 8 2018 revealed comparably low mass concentrations which however could not be explained by particularly high numbers of small particles table s 3 mp smaller than 100 μm were most frequent by numbers however their individual weight was so low that they contributed only for approximately 2 to the total mp mass concentration fig 4b total mass was largely determined by the presence of mp 2 mm as these mp are almost exclusively made of pe and pp it is not surprising that the two polymer types constitute the largest share in terms of mp mass concentration fig 4b table s 3 3 3 general discussion until now only a few studies have focused on examining the spatial distribution of mp in individual rivers in detail ding et al 2019 mani et al 2015 only five studies identified mp with a detection limit of approximately 50 μm but all selected particles for further identification and did not include chemical mapping koelmans et al 2019 this is the first study assessing the spatial and temporal variability of mp down to a size of 20 μm using ftir microscopy followed by an automated image analysis primpke et al 2019 as such the results provide a valuable insight into the presence and distribution of various polymer types in riverine surface waters and wwtp effluents several studies have discussed the need to implement standardized qa qc criteria to generate reliable and comparable data filella 2015 hermsen et al 2018 koelmans et al 2019 provided guidelines for nine criteria for the analysis of mp in aqueous samples one of them recommends that at least 25 of a filter should be analysed during chemical mapping based on here presented data we favour that at least 50 of a filter should be mapped to accurately assess mp number concentrations and polymer types this also reduces the risk of data misinterpretation due to the uneven distribution of mp on a filter peeken et al 2018 further aspects that should be considered are high original sample volumes and efficient mp extraction steps to increase actual numbers of identified particles further the analysis of at least 50 pre sorted particles with atr ftir showed that different polymer types were presented with an acceptable level of uncertainty in this study care was taken that the complete sample after mp extraction was concentrated on one or more anodisc filter and that of each filter at least 60 were chemically mapped for mp 300 μm a visual pre selection of potentially synthetic particles was unavoidable from which a minimum of 50 particles 32 76 of the sorted particles was analysed with atr ftir as such we consider our data to reflect actual mp numbers and polymer types relatively accurate however we might have underestimated concentrations of mp of around 20 μm which would imply that levels of mp pollution are higher than concluded here the cumulative frequency distribution of detected mp number concentrations covers a range from 67 to 11532 mp m 3 fig 4c samples were taken from different representative water system types that are typical for the netherlands including small ditches the rural and urban parts of an intermediate river and a big international waterway therefore we argue that this distribution of mp concentrations represents that of all dutch riverine surface waters reasonably well enabling a generic assessment of risks for aquatic biota to do so one needs to combine exposure and effect concentrations koelmans et al 2017 until now four studies presented an environmental risk assessment of mp with estimates for the predicted no effect concentration pnec which is the threshold concentration at which no adverse effects are expected to occur adam et al 2019 besseling et al 2019 burns and boxall 2018 everaert et al 2018 the pnec estimates do not differentiate between mp sizes or polymer types therefore neither does the frequency distribution of mp number concentrations from dommel and meuse the majority of locations revealed mp concentrations that are below or even considerably below the determined pnec concentrations fig 4c only in three surface water samples all taken in the region of eindhoven and stoedenrode mp concentrations were higher than the pnec as derived by everaert 6 7 103 mp m 3 in comparison the pnecs of the other three studies are two to four orders of magnitude higher than the pnec defined by everaert et al 2018 adam et al 2019 found no significant differences of expected effects for different polymer types or shapes it is however assumed that effects vary for the various mp sizes and that smaller sizes will be more hazardous koelmans et al 2017 redondo hasselerharm et al 2018 it should also be mentioned that mp used in toxicity studies underlying the pnec calculations might not represent the various forms sizes and polymer types of environmental mp well enough kooi and koelmans 2019 further it is assumed that concentrations of today are not what can be expected in the future because of increasing plastic production and use the plastics persistance and continous fragmentation in the environment which imply that future mp concentrations will be higher than the ones currently measured everaert et al 2018 koelmans et al 2017 4 conclusions in this study we assessed the distribution of mp in riverine surface waters of two dutch river systems samples were taken at a high spatial resolution and repeated over time at selected locations we further attached particular value to the implementation of high qa qc criteria koelmans et al 2019 to identify mp with a detection limit of 20 μm using ftir microscopy followed by an automated image analysis primpke et al 2019 the latter circumvents any human bias during data analysis by which it is more likely that rare polymer types and very small mp are not overseen but identified correctly this way 26 different polymer types including partly highly abundant rubbers were identified of which several have not yet been reported in riverine surface waters frequently only parts of a sample are analysed for mp by partial filter analysis or subsampling it is however unclear how much analytical uncertainty can be introduced by doing so we estimated that during chemical mapping at least 50 of a filter should be analysed to guarantee an accurate representation of mp number concentrations and polymer types in two dutch river systems between 67 and 11532 mp m 3 were identified virtually all of these concentrations are considerably below known effect thresholds thus based on the current knowledge mp associated risks for aquatic biota are not likely to be anticipated in dutch riverine surface waters the three locations with mp number concentrations above one of the pnecs were in the vicinity to big cities if risks are to be expected they will most likely be highest in highly urbanized and polluted areas authors agreement smm and mk designed the study together with scd aak and apvw smm mk and mwe performed the field work smm and mwe prepared the samples and performed μftir measurements

17969,free nitrous acid fna has been recently reported to be an effective and eco friendly inactivator for waste activated sludge was while the limited decomposition of the extracellular polymeric substance eps matrix hampers resource recovery from was this work employed peracetic acid paa to assist fna and explored the contribution of co pretreatment to hydrogen recovery in a prefermentation bioelectrolysis cascading system the results showed that co pretreatment led to approximately 8 8 and 20 4 increases in the exfoliation of particulate proteins and carbohydrates respectively from tightly bound eps tb eps over that of sole fna pretreatment electron paramagnetic resonance analysis verified that the synergistic effect of fna paa and various generated free radicals was the essential process this effect further promoted the accumulation of volatile fatty acids vfas after 96 h of prefermentation and the peak concentration in co pretreated was ad fpwas was approximately 2 5 fold that in sole fna pretreated was ad fwas subsequently the cascading utilization of organics in the bioelectrolysis step contributed to efficient hydrogen generation a total of 10 8 0 3 mg h2 g vss was harvested in microbial electrolysis cells mecs fed with ad fpwas while 6 2 0 1 mg h2 g vss was obtained from ad fwas x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps revealed the effective decomposition of the phospholipid bilayer in the cytomembrane and the transformation of macromolecular organics into vfas and hydrogen in the cascading system further microbial community analysis demonstrated that co pretreatment enhanced the accumulation of functional consortia including anaerobic fermentative bacteria afb 28 1 e g macellibacteroides 6 3 and sedimentibacter 6 9 and electrochemically active bacteria eab 57 0 e g geobacter 39 0 and pseudomonas 13 6 in the prefermentation and mec steps respectively the possible synergetic and competitive relationships among afb eab homo acetogens nitrate reducing bacteria and methanogens were explored by molecular ecological network analysis from an environmental and economic perspective this promising fna and paa co pretreatment approach provides new insight for energy recovery from was biorefineries graphical abstract image 1 keywords waste activated sludge was peracetic acid paa free nitrous acid fna prefermentation bioelectrolysis hydrogen production 1 introduction waste activated sludge was an inevitable byproduct formed during the activated sludge process in wastewater treatment plants wwtps and the yearly increasing amounts produced have become a huge challenge for treatment and disposal approximately 40 million tons of was 80 moisture content was generated in 2015 this value has steadily increased with an annual growth of 13 in china and will further increase to 60 million tons in 2020 meng et al 2016 yang et al 2015a considering the resource characteristics of was organics and nutrients account for 90 95 by dry weight many researchers have concentrated on converting was to valuable products e g volatile fatty acids vfas he et al 2019 methane mao et al 2015 hydrogen wang et al 2019b or biofuels manara and zabaniotou 2012 hydrogen has tremendous potential as a promising alternative clean energy its combustion product has zero pollution only water and it possesses a higher energy density of 120 mj kg than other gaseous fuels i e methane 50 mj kg and ethanol 26 8 mj kg kadier et al 2016 dark fermentation and microbial electrolysis cells mecs are two feasible technologies to recover hydrogen from was kadier et al 2016 kumar et al 2018 mecs an effective approach for high purity hydrogen generation are less restricted than anaerobic fermentation because they can exploit a wide range of organics as feedstocks e g carbohydrates proteins vfas and ethanol lu et al 2011 in contrast to bioelectrolysis alone coupling with anaerobic fermentation can effectively enhance the hydrogen yield our previous study produced a 0 54 ml g vss hydrogen yield in a system consisting of prefermentation and mecs ad mecs but only 0 17 ml g vss in sole mecs fed with was zhou et al 2019 khongkliang et al obtained 465 ml h2 g cod in a fermentation and mec system while that in the sole mec system was only 182 ml h2 g cod khongkliang et al 2017 however the hydrogen yield in ad mecs is still limited when using raw was as the feedstock because most organics are trapped in microbial cells and extracellular polymeric substances eps which restricts conversion from biodegradable organics to hydrogen li et al 2019a therefore appropriate pretreatment is required to ensure that organics are released and readily available for subsequent cascading conversion free nitrous acid fna which can be produced as a byproduct in situ through the nitritation of anaerobic digestion liquor in wwtps is an eco friendly low cost and renewable chemical law et al 2015 it has been reported that fna and its derivatives at the parts per million ppm level are effective in damaging the cell membrane and destroying intracellular macromolecular organics of microorganisms jiang et al 2011 zhang et al found that fna could lead to was decomposition by triggering the crack of macromolecules especially proteins in eps zhang et al 2015 while the further exploration according to the research of wu et al revealed that fna was extremely effective in membranolysis rather than eps decomposition wu et al 2018 in a word the effect of fna on eps decomposition is still uncertain thus assistive technologies have been explored to fill the gap left by fna such as physical i e heat and ultrasound and chemical methods i e surfactants and fenton hallaji et al 2018 niu et al 2019 wang et al 2014b zhao et al 2016 however these technologies are either eco unfriendly or energy consuming peracetic acid paa is a broad spectrum anti microbial disinfectant e0 1 81 ev that forms no toxic byproducts relevant studies have proven the effectiveness of paa in eps decomposition and cell destruction via the formation of hydroxyl radical oh which further enhances the biodegradability of was appels et al demonstrated the effective solubilization of organics by paa and a 21 increase in methane production from was appels et al 2011 zhang et al indicated that paa can effectively dissolve bound eps into soluble eps especially under acidic conditions zhang et al 2016 therefore employing paa as an assisted pretreatment for fna may lead to cumulative effect on was disintegration this proposal was mainly based on the following hypotheses 1 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and acetic acid hac as two decomposition products of paa may react with fna to generate reactive oxygen and nitrogen species i e oh no no2 and peroxynitrite onoo onooh meanwhile hac can not only maintain the acidic environment required for fna generation but also provide metabolic substrate for microorganism e g nitrate reducing bacteria 2 no toxic byproducts would be generated by coupling of fna and paa 3 the convenience for raw materials acquisition fna can be produced in situ as a byproduct during wastewater treatment and paa is widely applied in the medical and food disinfection this study aimed to investigate 1 whether more effective eps decomposition and organics transformation could be achieved under fna and paa co pretreatment than under sole pretreatment and 2 whether the hydrogen yield organics utilization and electrochemical properties could be further promoted in co pretreated was in a prefermentation bioelectrolysis cascading system to achieve the above goals electron paramagnetic resonance epr was performed to explore the underlying mechanism of paa and fna co pretreatment a proof of concept based on experimental data for the corresponding release and cascading utilization of organics in the whole cascading system was presented in addition the enhancement of electrochemical performance in the mec step by co pretreatment was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry cv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis the enrichment and interaction of different functional microorganisms were revealed by high throughput sequencing canonical correspondence

co pretreatment promotes was disintegration and eps decomposition 3 1 1 effect of sole co pretreatments on was disintegration the sem images intuitively reflect the degree of was disintegration as shown in fig 1 a masses of cocci and bacilli were clustered together and embedded within the gel like eps matrix in rwas obvious cracks in the microbial cells and numerous clear holes appeared in fwas which was mainly due to the biocidal effect of fna while cellular aggregation still existed because of eps protection for pwas the microstructure was less compact and rougher and very few complete cells could be found due to the strongly oxidizing h2o2 generated by paa furthermore the flocs in fpwas were barely formed and the rigid gel matrix and the cells displayed the worst disruption implying that co pretreatment provided the strongest oxidation compared with the sole pretreatments the particle size distributions provided direct evidence for this conclusion fig s1 fpwas exhibited the lowest d50 value 31 0 μm followed by pwas 32 9 μm fwas 34 4 μm and rwas 37 1 μm 3 1 2 effect of sole co pretreatments on eps decomposition the five regions of the fluorescence spectra of dom and tb eps are exhibited in fig 1b and c overall the fluorescence intensities of all five regions were enhanced in dom after the three pretreatments region i tyrosine like substances ex em 220 250 200 330 nm and region iv soluble microbial byproduct like substances ex em 250 280 200 380 nm were the prominent substances in dom for example region i had the highest value in pwas 41 3 followed by fwas 38 6 and fpwas 38 1 all of these values were greater than that of rwas 36 1 in addition the p i n of region i and region ii tryptophan like proteins ex em 200 250 330 380 nm decreased significantly in fpwas and pwas suggesting that the radicals generated by paa may contribute to the degradation of amino acids this result was further proven by the tb eps spectra which showed a corresponding decrease in fluorescent intensity after the three pretreatments fpwas had the lowest value fig 1c co pretreatment caused the most effective release of particulate proteins and carbohydrates and the concentrations dropped by 47 6 and 68 0 respectively with respect to those of rwas while those obtained in fwas were only 38 8 and 46 7 fig 1d and e this result implied that the introduction of paa accelerated the exfoliation of tb eps into dom the concentration of soluble protein increased by 8 3 fold in fpwas compared with that in rwas followed by pwas 5 0 and fwas 2 0 moreover fpwas possessed the highest concentration of soluble carbohydrate 1 6 and 2 6 fold that of fwas and pwas respectively in conclusion co pretreatment showed much greater promise than the sole pretreatments for eps decomposition 3 1 3 identification of the active oxidants contributing to co pretreatment the underlying mechanism of the co pretreatment process is exhibited in fig 2 no and no2 common reactive nitrogen species are first generated through the acid base dissociation of fna hno2 pka 3 4 at 25 c in was these species oxidize many kinds of compounds such as amino acids proteins and several unsaturated fatty acids by electron transfer double bond addition or hydrogen abstraction pérez gonzález et al 2016 n2o3 and n2o4 exist as intermediates and are finally converted to no2 and no3 respectively jiang and yuan 2013 subsequently the added paa is decomposed to hac and h2o2 in aqueous solution h2o2 reacted with fna to produce peroxynitrites onoo and onooh endogenously produced nucleophilic oxidants which can easily diffuse into lipid membranes and damage the structures of various proteins lipids and dna in cells eventually leading to cellular apoptosis prolo et al 2018 onoo can be reversibly converted into no and o2 onooh ph 5 4 25 c can decompose rapidly into approximately 70 nitrate and 30 no2 and oh under acidic conditions ferrer sueta et al 2018 the epr spectra demonstrated that higher intensities of both dmpo oh and dmpo o2 were observed in fpwas than in pwas according to their hyperfine splitting constants further supporting the aforementioned results fig 2b and c the chemical equations involved in co pretreatment are illustrated in table s2 hence the synergistic effect of fna paa and various intermediates no no2 n2o3 n2o4 onoo onooh oh and o2 led to the thorough disruption of was cells and the eps matrix and provided more soluble substrates for the subsequent recovery process 3 2 release and utilization of organics in the cascading system vfas can be converted persistently from the acidification of soluble carbohydrates and proteins overall the vfa concentration sharply increased and peaked at 96 h prefermentation step ii and then decreased over time during mec operation step iii in all groups fig 3 a the maximal vfa concentrations were 2594 84 6453 40 and 7679 86 mg cod l in ad fwas ad pwas and ad fpwas respectively while that obtained in ad rwas was only 868 11 mg cod l fig 3b although the decomposition of paa led to a considerable hac increase 1102 22 mg cod l detected from 1 3 g l paa the net vfa production achieved in ad fpwas was much higher than that obtained in ad pwas and ad fwas remarkably the pretreatments changed the distribution of vfas hac the most prevalent constituent accounted for 50 5 in ad rwas and increased to 77 0 and 67 9 in ad pwas and ad fpwas deducted hac from paa respectively while it was 44 1 in ad fwas increased hac generation benefited hydrogen recovery in the subsequent mec step additionally more valeric acid hva accumulated in ad fpwas 326 0 mg cod l than in the other samples which indicated that much more protein participated in the acidification process efficient cascading conversion of vfas happened in the mec step and the utilization efficiency reached 61 1 in ad fpmec 8 4 and 21 1 higher than that in ad fmec and ad pmec respectively fig 3c fig 3d and e illustrate the evolution of organics in different was fractions during the three operation steps apparently the cascading system played a pivotal role in organics release from tb eps the release efficiencies of proteins and carbohydrates from tb eps in ad fpmec reached 80 6 and 79 8 respectively during the 96 h prefermentation step and further increased to 87 4 and 93 9 during the 96 h bioelectrolysis step at 192 h respectively the variations in fluorescent substances in tb eps are reflected in fig s2 the fluorescence intensities weakened in each step throughout the cascading treatments and reached a minimum in the co pretreatment group the rheological characteristics and incompact structure of lb eps suggested that it can adsorb and transport organics from intracellular substances or tb eps to the liquid phase sheng et al 2010 the small proportion of soluble organics stored in lb eps was nearly the same during the operation of each step the variations in soluble organics in dom after every step were also investigated fig 3d and e a continuous increase in soluble organics was observed in ad rmec with a peak at 192 h while opposite tendencies were obtained in the other groups the highest utilization efficiencies of proteins 42 2 and carbohydrates 56 9 were obtained in ad fpmec followed by ad pmec 27 5 and 24 3 respectively and ad fmec 17 7 and 15 4 at 192 h which showed remarkable superiority to traditional ad yang et al obtained 32 2 and 49 7 utilization of proteins and carbohydrates in was after 42 d ad treatment respectively yang et al 2015b the effective utilization of proteins in ad fpmec is further reflected in fig s3 and table 1 in which the relative abundance of region i iv decreased steadily and finally reduced to a minimum of 29 8 co pretreatment can not only shorten the treatment time but also enhance the utilization of organics especially proteins in cascading systems 3 3 biohydrogen recovery and electrochemical analysis the hydrogen and current generated with the utilization of organics in step iii are shown in figs 3c and 4a respectively the current increased dramatically with the feeding of prefermented was then decreased and tended to become stable the highest current was 6 3 a m2 in ad fpmec followed by 4 5 a m2 and 4 0 a m2 in ad pmec and ad fmec respectively the current in ad rmec was only 3 6 a m2 for hydrogen recovery ad fpmec achieved the highest yield of 10 8 0 30 mg g vss which was 1 4 and 1 7 fold that in ad pmec and ad fmec respectively fig 3c the cascading conversion system fed with co pretreated was i e ad fpmec showed highly superior hydrogen production compared with that in relevant studies niu et al obtained 24 81 1 24 ml h2 g vss equivalent to 2 21 mg h2 g vss after 20 d of dark fermentation of was pretreated with ultrasonication and fna niu et al 2019 yields of 8 50 and 5 4 mg h2 g vss were generated during the cascading utilization of was pretreated with sodium dodecyl sulfate and paa respectively wang et al 2014a the results of cv scanning showed that double layer capacitance formed between the electrode and biofilm to store exoelectrons which could reflect the average current generated in mecs liang et al 2011 ad fpmec generated the highest current 0 023 a and had the largest double layer area in contrast to the currents of 0 015 and 0 018 a generated by ad fmec and ad pmec respectively moreover the oxidation peak at approximately 0 36 v vs sce in both turnover fig 4b and nonturnover fig s4 conditions was the characteristic peak of geobacter sulfurreducens which indicated that the corresponding redox components e g heme groups in cytochrome mainly existed in the biofilm and transferred electrons between the electrode and biofilm jain et al 2011 however the peak current was linearly dependent on the square root of the scan rate insets fig s4 which reflected that the electrochemical redox reaction was a diffusion controlled process in other words efficient pretreatment especially co pretreatment enhanced the capability of electrochemical catalysis during bioelectrolysis which was mainly attributed to the enrichment of electrochemically active bacteria eab this relationship was further demonstrated by the visible microorganisms adhered to the electrodes in the mecs fig s5 more rod shaped microorganisms were attached to the bioanode and biocathode in ad fpmec than in the other three groups the eis results showed that the conductivity of was was clearly enhanced by pretreatment table s1 ad fpmec exhibited the lowest resistance of 10 8 ω followed by ad pmec 15 6 ω ad fmec 20 3 ω and ad rmec 27 6 ω fig 4c and table s1 this result indicated that co pretreatment could enhance the transfer efficiency related to the redox process moreover the lower diffusion resistance rdiff in ad fpmec 6 2 ω accelerated the rate of electron and mass transfer between the electrode and eabs compared to those of ad fmec 11 7 ω and ad pmec 10 5 ω 3 4 xps analysis of different was cascading treatment systems four was samples after 192 h of cascading treatment were analysed by xps c 1s o 1s n 1s and p 2p spectra overall c and o occupied the two largest proportions in the four samples table 2 the spectra of c 1s fig 5a1 and a2 contained four representative peaks the characteristic peak of c1 c c h 284 8 ev was from hydrocarbon like compounds i e lipids amino acid side chains and polysaccharides wang et al 2018a the abundance of c1 the predominant component of eps increased after pretreatment which implied the efficient decomposition of eps the peak at 286 1 ev c2 was attributed to c o n bonds from ethers alcohols amines and amides wang et al 2018a ad fpmec showed the most apparent decline in the binding area of c2 compared with that of ad rmec which indicated that co pretreatment indirectly caused the most effective transformation of macromolecular organics in the cascading system table 2 the weak peak c3 at 288 0 ev was closely related to o c o and c o which mainly existed in amide carboxylate carbonyl acetal and hemiacetal groups notably the bonds of c4 o c or and o c oh 288 5 ev and o2 c o 531 2 ev commonly from carboxyl or ester groups appala raju et al 2008 increased in ad fpmec further proving that co pretreatment led to considerable accumulation of vfas during the prefermentation step after bioelectrolysis utilization the residual vfas were still much higher than those in ad rmec which was consistent with the results of fig 3a and b as shown in table 2 the binding area of n1 n c r 399 6 ev from the amide functions of proteins and peptide chains yu et al 2018 achieved the minimum in ad fpmec indicating that co pretreatment led to the most effective utilization of proteins this result is also intuitively reflected in fig 5b1 and b2 by the accumulation of h n co n2 400 4 ev the typical bond of amino acids in ad fpmec yu et al 2018 the binding energies of 530 8 532 0 and 532 7 ev were assigned to o h o1 p o p o o3 and o c o4 respectively fig 5c1 and c2 martı nez et al 2003 tan et al 2012 notably the binding areas of o3 and p3 c o po3 134 1 ev assigned to the typical bonds in phospholipids sharply dropped to 27 3 and 26 6 in ad fpmec respectively this result implied that the phospholipid bilayer of the cytomembrane was seriously damaged by co pretreatment and further converted into inorganic phosphorus in the cascading conversion system rumble et al 2010 yu et al 2018 this result could further be proven by the increase in p2 133 6 ev from ortho p pyro p fig 5d1 and d2 de carvalho eufrásio pinto et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 this result was also consistent with our previous study on the shifts in phosphorus speciation between sludge and supernatant zhou et al 2019 3 5 microbial community analysis a total of 34660 51218 effective reads were obtained from eight 16s rrna gene libraries by illumina miseq sequencing table s3 the alpha diversity indicated that pretreatment and cascading conversion significantly decreased the richness of the bacterial community and ad fpmec had the lowest richness table s3 to illustrate the interactions among all otus three otu networks were constructed fig s6 in total there were 1877 otus in the eight samples of which only 385 20 5 otus were shared for the prefermentative and bioelectrolytic groups in each of the 4 samples 744 40 9 and 508 27 1 otus were shared respectively but exhibited quite different compositions the dominant phyla of the prefermentative group were proteobacteria 37 bacteroidetes 12 and chloroflexi 10 while those of the bioelectrolytic group were proteobacteria 32 firmicutes 17 and bacteroidetes 16 this result revealed the dissimilarity in the microbial communities participating in the two steps during cascading conversion the bacterial structure and composition at the phylum and class levels are displayed in fig s6 c d proteobacteria and firmicute typical anaerobic or bioelectrochemical communities bonmati et al 2013 cerrillo et al 2016 were highly enriched during the bioelectrolysis step co pretreatment led to a noticeable increase in proteobacteria 62 compared with that in ad fmec 50 and ad pmec 51 at the class level gammaproteobacteria bacteroidia and clostiridia which can convert soluble organics to vfas kato et al 2004 were clearly enriched in the prefermentative samples deltaproteobacteria a reported representative anodic bacteria increased to 43 in ad fpmec a value much higher than that in ad fmec 15 and ad pmec 31 at the genus level fig 6 a representative anaerobic fermentative bacteria afb consisting of citrobacter class gammaproteobacteria macellibacteroides class bacteroidia and two genera of class clostridia proteiniclasticum and sedimentibacter were enriched after prefermentation and became the predominant bacteria in ad fpwas proteiniclasticum responsible for the degradation of proteins to produce hac propionic acid hpr and iso butyric acid iso hbu zhou et al 2018 had an abundance of 6 0 in ad fpwas macellibacteroides can metabolize various carbohydrates for hac hbu and iso hbu generation jabari et al 2012 its proportion in ad fwas was 5 5 and it was further enriched to 6 3 in ad fpwas the genera citrobacter and sedimentibacter can degrade organics to produce vfas and hydrogen during acidogenesis and acetogenesis imachi et al 2016 wang et al 2018c and displayed abundances of 5 7 and 6 9 respectively in ad fpwas followed by ad fwas 1 4 and 5 7 and ad pwas 0 3 and 1 3 in addition other fermentative genera such as terrimonas petrimonas anaerovorax and rhodobacter grabowski et al 2005 kapdan et al 2009 matthies et al 2000 zhang et al 2012 were detected during prefermentation the ultimate enrichment of afb peaked in the prefermentative sample at 28 1 ad fpwas followed by 24 5 ad fwas and 16 1 ad pwas fig 6b notably diaphorobacter and thauera the main nitrate reducing bacteria nrb khardenavis et al 2007 yoshifumi et al 2004 in ad fwas and ad fpwas play important roles in nitrite removal and their cumulative proportions reached 4 0 and 5 0 respectively the structure and abundance of key microbiomes were substantially changed during the bioelectrolysis step six kinds of eabs including geobacter pseudomonas desulfovibrio comamonas shewanella and acinetobacter were enriched in the four bioanodic samples lovley 2011 two genera of class deltaproteobacteria geobacter and desulfovibrio as well as pseudomonas class gammaproteobacteria represented the main eabs in ad fpmec geobacter had the highest accumulation of 39 0 in ad fpmec followed by ad pmec 23 6 ad fmec 9 2 and ad rmec 3 3 pseudomonas and desulfovibrio can conduct respiration by acting as a bioanode and biocathode lin et al 2019 and were enriched to 13 6 and 3 8 respectively in ad fpmec ultimately as shown in fig 6b the total proportion of eab reached 57 0 in ad fpmec which was much higher than those obtained in ad fmec 31 3 and ad pmec 42 1 additionally two homo acetogens acetobacterium and acetoanaerobium were promoted by electro stimulation compared with the values detected in the prefermentation step although very little methane was detected in each group table s4 methanogens were still identified in the was samples the composition and structure of archaea at the genus level are presented in table s5 the overall abundance of archaea accounted for 0 02 1 18 in the eight sludge samples methanosaeta acetotrophic methanogen was the main methanogen in ad rwas 76 and ad fwas 87 5 whereas methanobacterium hydrogenotrophic methanogen was the preponderant genus in ad pwas 63 6 and ad fpwas 58 82 in the bioelectrolysis step the proportion of methanosaeta decreased and methanocorpusculum appeared methanocorpusculum has also been reported to be a typical hydrogenotrophic methanogen although the occurrence of hydrogenotrophic methanogen may lead to the loss of some hydrogen through methanogenesis liu et al 2016 the influences exerted by the low abundance of archaeal sludge samples could be ignored 3 6 cca and mens analysis of the key microbiome the relationship between process variables and microbial populations was revealed by cca analysis vfas and hac showed positive correlations for axis 1 representing 63 4 of the variance while all the environmental variables except methane production were positively related to axis 2 explaining 24 3 of the variance fig 6c detailed information is provided in table s6 vfa production was closely correlated with soluble proteins and carbohydrates according to their small angles 90 implying that the hydrolysis process was the basis of acidification the accumulation of soluble organics was mainly attributed to the enrichment of hydrolytic bacteria furthermore dominant acid producing bacteria such as acinetobacter citrobacter and sedimentibacter gathered along the positive direction of axis 1 and contributed to vfa production two homo acetogens acetobacterium and acetoanaerobium were closely related to hydrogen moreover the current was strongly associated with hydrogen which indicated the effective transfer of protons and electrons in the solution and at the electrodes it was apparent that eabs including geobacter pseudomonas shewanella and desulfovibrio played vital roles in the generation of hydrogen and current methanocorpusculum is also related to hydrogen due to its function of converting hydrogen to methane the overall mens of the key microbiomes in the prefermentation and mec steps are shown in fig s7 based on the network size otu numbers and total links of functional consortia the network complexity of the mec samples was higher than that of the prefermentative samples specifically the mec samples had a higher averaged connectivity 7 83 shorter averaged path distance 3 59 and less modularity 0 41 than the prefermentative samples table s7 to further explore the complex biological relationships i e co existence or competition among the key microbiomes two subnetworks were constructed fig 7 obvious positive correlations were observed among afbs in the prefermentative samples fig 7a for example proteiniclasticum otu149 was positively related to sedimentibacter otu60 and 39 anaerovorax otu439 and pseudomonas otu253 a positive correlation was also observed among macellibacteroides otu579 petrimonas otu15 and 19 sedimentibacter otu39 and bacteroides otu119 this result indicated similar symbiotic and underlying cooperative relationships between fermenters which promoted hydrolysis and acidification regarding nrb diaphorobacter otu695 which can utilize various organics to accomplish denitrification was positively related to sedimentibacter otu147 petrimonas otu15 and 19 and macellibacteroides otu579 nevertheless comamonas otu160 another nrb was negatively correlated with several afbs including macellibacteroides otu579 and 162 citrobacter otu29 bacteroides otu119 and klebsiella otu28 this result indicated their potential competitive relationships during the bioelectrolysis step eab homo acetogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens were promoted geobacter otu24 showed a positive correlation with two afbs rhodobacter otu326 and lentimicrobium otu13 and 18 pseudomonas otu4 was positively related to proteiniclasticum otu909 and desulfovibrio otu38 this result implied an analogical ecological niche or symbiosis between eab and afb accelerating a generation consumption pattern of organics to further promote electron transfer and hydrogen production desulfovibrio otu88 shared a negative relationship with macellibacteroide otu30 terrimonas otu780 and sedimentibacter otu361 signifying a possible competing relationship regarding homo acetogens acetobacterium otu25 displayed positive correlations with two afbs proteiniclasticum otu909 and macellibacteroides otu579 as well as the eab pseudomonas otu4 suggesting mutualistic symbiotic and cooperative interactions among homo acetogens afb and eab that enhanced the cascading utilization of organics through direct or indirect electron respiration from the electrode or intraspecies and interspecies electron transfer processes nagarajan et al 2013 regarding methanogens methanobacterium otu5 and 670 displayed positive correlations with rhodobacter otu326 and acinetobacter otu1810 respectively suggesting potential niche division hydrogenotrophic methanogens including methanocorpusculum otu9 and methanobacterium otu22 may have an underlying syntrophic relationship with geobacter otu10 316 and 152 the same phenomenon was found for methanobacterium otu144 and desulfovibrio otu306 while these genera exhibited a negative relationship with shewanella otu776 indicating niche separation among these genera additionally some otus from the same genus e g otu258 and 909 from proteiniclasticum and otu780 and 860 from terrimonas exhibited opposite correlations with acetobacterium otu300 indicating a possible exclusion mechanism or niche partitioning among versatile genera lin et al 2019 3 7 perspectives with the development of city population and the increased quantity of treated wastewater it will be keeping increasing on the amount of was production from wwtps however safe disposal and efficient treatment of the was are still lacking for many plants lu et al 2019 energy consumption and resource recovery through anaerobic digestion will be fully characterised in a life cycle assessment foley et al 2010 the flows of chemical and energy input have to be considered to fulfil deep sludge utilization batstone et al 2015 considering the low hydrogen conversion from was due to the enmeshment of organics by eps matrix and microbial cells this work innovatively proposes the co pretreatment of fna and paa for accelerating organics transformation from was to hydrogen in prefermentation bioelectrolysis cascading system especially the introduced paa can assist with fna to prompt eps decomposition from was the conceptual scheme of enhanced hydrogen recovery from cascading treatment of was accelerated by fna paa co pretreatment was illustrated in fig 8 the co pretreatment has the synergetic effect on eps decomposition and organics release without any residuals no2 n paa or h2o2 fna can be generated in situ as a byproduct from anaerobic digestion liquor law et al 2015 based on the price of paa 12 1100 1200 t luukkonen et al 2015 100 mg g vss would cost 9 2 10 m3 assuming a vss of 10 g l or 184 200 t dry solids 98 moisture content as the pivotal was treatment process prefermentation electrolysis system shows the great superiority with the short treatment time 8 d high hydrogen recovery 10 8 0 3 mg h2 g vss and current density 6 3 a m2 compared with sole ad or mec process beegle et al pointed out ad mec is more suitable for wastewater treatment than ad or mec on the premise of moderate capital cost operation and maintenance and high revenue potential beegle and borole 2018 although the application of mec in large scale is still facing some challenges i e material costs and external energy input wang et al 2019c 2020 various efforts have made to accomplish the process economically feasible escapa et al estimated that mec would be economically feasible under the current density of 5 a m2 with the capital expense of 1220 m3 anode escapa et al 2012 aiken et al proposed that the target current density of 2 3 a m2 may accomplish break even if reducing relative materials cost of 90 such as electrodes and current collector aiken et al 2019 based on the current density 6 3 a m2 obtained in this study the prefermentation bioelectrolysis system would be economically feasible for the future implement and can be further improved by several aspects like employing cheaper cathode materials e g stainless steel nickel or mos2 based cathodes upgrading the reactor scale and exploring cost effective route for higher current density additionally our previous study found that the cascading system is effective for organic phosphorus release that is a high content of n and p in the effluent could be further recovered as bio fertilizer e g struvite and vivianite which could provide additional economic incentive zhou et al 2019 ultimately lower disposal and transfer costs would be required for the handling of residual sludge due to the efficient degradation of was during the cascading system 4 conclusions this work offers an innovative approach for accelerating eps decomposition and hydrogen recovery from was via paa and fna co pretreatment in a prefermentation mec cascading system the major conclusions include the following 1 paa fna and their intermediates i e no no2 n2o3 n2o4 onoo onooh oh and o2 contributed to effective eps decomposition and was disintegration 2 co pretreatment improved vfa accumulation 1 2 to 2 5 fold that of sole pretreatment in the prefermentation step and the utilization of organics to produce hydrogen 1 4 to 1 7 fold that of sole pretreatment in the bioelectrolysis step 3 xps analysis confirmed that co pretreatment destroyed the phospholipid bilayer of the cytomembrane and accelerated the transformation from macromolecular organics to amide carboxylate and carbonyl groups 4 miseq sequencing showed that co pretreatment stimulated the enrichment of afb 28 1 and eab 57 0 in the prefermentation and bioelectrolysis steps respectively 5 cca and mens revealed the intrinsic correlation between the functional microbiome and environmental factors as well as

17969,free nitrous acid fna has been recently reported to be an effective and eco friendly inactivator for waste activated sludge was while the limited decomposition of the extracellular polymeric substance eps matrix hampers resource recovery from was this work employed peracetic acid paa to assist fna and explored the contribution of co pretreatment to hydrogen recovery in a prefermentation bioelectrolysis cascading system the results showed that co pretreatment led to approximately 8 8 and 20 4 increases in the exfoliation of particulate proteins and carbohydrates respectively from tightly bound eps tb eps over that of sole fna pretreatment electron paramagnetic resonance analysis verified that the synergistic effect of fna paa and various generated free radicals was the essential process this effect further promoted the accumulation of volatile fatty acids vfas after 96 h of prefermentation and the peak concentration in co pretreated was ad fpwas was approximately 2 5 fold that in sole fna pretreated was ad fwas subsequently the cascading utilization of organics in the bioelectrolysis step contributed to efficient hydrogen generation a total of 10 8 0 3 mg h2 g vss was harvested in microbial electrolysis cells mecs fed with ad fpwas while 6 2 0 1 mg h2 g vss was obtained from ad fwas x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps revealed the effective decomposition of the phospholipid bilayer in the cytomembrane and the transformation of macromolecular organics into vfas and hydrogen in the cascading system further microbial community analysis demonstrated that co pretreatment enhanced the accumulation of functional consortia including anaerobic fermentative bacteria afb 28 1 e g macellibacteroides 6 3 and sedimentibacter 6 9 and electrochemically active bacteria eab 57 0 e g geobacter 39 0 and pseudomonas 13 6 in the prefermentation and mec steps respectively the possible synergetic and competitive relationships among afb eab homo acetogens nitrate reducing bacteria and methanogens were explored by molecular ecological network analysis from an environmental and economic perspective this promising fna and paa co pretreatment approach provides new insight for energy recovery from was biorefineries graphical abstract image 1 keywords waste activated sludge was peracetic acid paa free nitrous acid fna prefermentation bioelectrolysis hydrogen production 1 introduction waste activated sludge was an inevitable byproduct formed during the activated sludge process in wastewater treatment plants wwtps and the yearly increasing amounts produced have become a huge challenge for treatment and disposal approximately 40 million tons of was 80 moisture content was generated in 2015 this value has steadily increased with an annual growth of 13 in china and will further increase to 60 million tons in 2020 meng et al 2016 yang et al 2015a considering the resource characteristics of was organics and nutrients account for 90 95 by dry weight many researchers have concentrated on converting was to valuable products e g volatile fatty acids vfas he et al 2019 methane mao et al 2015 hydrogen wang et al 2019b or biofuels manara and zabaniotou 2012 hydrogen has tremendous potential as a promising alternative clean energy its combustion product has zero pollution only water and it possesses a higher energy density of 120 mj kg than other gaseous fuels i e methane 50 mj kg and ethanol 26 8 mj kg kadier et al 2016 dark fermentation and microbial electrolysis cells mecs are two feasible technologies to recover hydrogen from was kadier et al 2016 kumar et al 2018 mecs an effective approach for high purity hydrogen generation are less restricted than anaerobic fermentation because they can exploit a wide range of organics as feedstocks e g carbohydrates proteins vfas and ethanol lu et al 2011 in contrast to bioelectrolysis alone coupling with anaerobic fermentation can effectively enhance the hydrogen yield our previous study produced a 0 54 ml g vss hydrogen yield in a system consisting of prefermentation and mecs ad mecs but only 0 17 ml g vss in sole mecs fed with was zhou et al 2019 khongkliang et al obtained 465 ml h2 g cod in a fermentation and mec system while that in the sole mec system was only 182 ml h2 g cod khongkliang et al 2017 however the hydrogen yield in ad mecs is still limited when using raw was as the feedstock because most organics are trapped in microbial cells and extracellular polymeric substances eps which restricts conversion from biodegradable organics to hydrogen li et al 2019a therefore appropriate pretreatment is required to ensure that organics are released and readily available for subsequent cascading conversion free nitrous acid fna which can be produced as a byproduct in situ through the nitritation of anaerobic digestion liquor in wwtps is an eco friendly low cost and renewable chemical law et al 2015 it has been reported that fna and its derivatives at the parts per million ppm level are effective in damaging the cell membrane and destroying intracellular macromolecular organics of microorganisms jiang et al 2011 zhang et al found that fna could lead to was decomposition by triggering the crack of macromolecules especially proteins in eps zhang et al 2015 while the further exploration according to the research of wu et al revealed that fna was extremely effective in membranolysis rather than eps decomposition wu et al 2018 in a word the effect of fna on eps decomposition is still uncertain thus assistive technologies have been explored to fill the gap left by fna such as physical i e heat and ultrasound and chemical methods i e surfactants and fenton hallaji et al 2018 niu et al 2019 wang et al 2014b zhao et al 2016 however these technologies are either eco unfriendly or energy consuming peracetic acid paa is a broad spectrum anti microbial disinfectant e0 1 81 ev that forms no toxic byproducts relevant studies have proven the effectiveness of paa in eps decomposition and cell destruction via the formation of hydroxyl radical oh which further enhances the biodegradability of was appels et al demonstrated the effective solubilization of organics by paa and a 21 increase in methane production from was appels et al 2011 zhang et al indicated that paa can effectively dissolve bound eps into soluble eps especially under acidic conditions zhang et al 2016 therefore employing paa as an assisted pretreatment for fna may lead to cumulative effect on was disintegration this proposal was mainly based on the following hypotheses 1 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and acetic acid hac as two decomposition products of paa may react with fna to generate reactive oxygen and nitrogen species i e oh no no2 and peroxynitrite onoo onooh meanwhile hac can not only maintain the acidic environment required for fna generation but also provide metabolic substrate for microorganism e g nitrate reducing bacteria 2 no toxic byproducts would be generated by coupling of fna and paa 3 the convenience for raw materials acquisition fna can be produced in situ as a byproduct during wastewater treatment and paa is widely applied in the medical and food disinfection this study aimed to investigate 1 whether more effective eps decomposition and organics transformation could be achieved under fna and paa co pretreatment than under sole pretreatment and 2 whether the hydrogen yield organics utilization and electrochemical properties could be further promoted in co pretreated was in a prefermentation bioelectrolysis cascading system to achieve the above goals electron paramagnetic resonance epr was performed to explore the underlying mechanism of paa and fna co pretreatment a proof of concept based on experimental data for the corresponding release and cascading utilization of organics in the whole cascading system was presented in addition the enhancement of electrochemical performance in the mec step by co pretreatment was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry cv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis the enrichment and interaction of different functional microorganisms were revealed by high throughput sequencing canonical correspondence analysis cca and molecular ecological network analysis mena 2 material and methods 2 1 was characteristics the was used in this study was obtained from a municipal wwtp located in jinzhong city china before the experiment the was was filtered by using a 40 mesh sieve to remove impurities and concentrated by gravitational settling 4 c 24 h the main characteristics of the condensed was named rwas were as follows ph 7 1 0 1 total suspended solids tss 21 3 0 2 g l volatile suspended solids vss 13 0 0 2 g l total chemical oxygen demand tcod 14 7 0 4 g l soluble chemical oxygen demand scod 0 44 0

steps pretreatment step i prefermentation step ii and bioelectrolysis step iii step i three pretreatments were performed fna paa and fna paa for fna pretreatment 2 13 mg n l fna was prepared by adding nitrite stock solution to 2 4 l was in accordance with our previous study liu et al 2018 then 1 m hcl was used to regulate the ph to 5 5 0 1 and the mixture was incubated for 12 h at 22 1 c named fwas paa pretreatment was conducted by adding a paa concentration of 100 mg g vss in accordance with appels et al 2011 named pwas for fna paa pretreatment fwas was subjected to paa pretreatment named fpwas step ii twelve fermenters with a working volume of 400 ml each were divided into four groups run in triplicate for anaerobic prefermentation rwas fwas pwas and fpwas were the feedstocks for the four groups named ad rwas ad fwas ad pwas and ad fpwas respectively and fresh was was added as inoculum 1 9 v v nitrogen was pumped into each bottle which was then capped sealed and stirred in an air bath shaker 120 rpm for 4 d at 35 1 c step iii twelve single chamber mecs were constructed each reactor had a working volume of 200 ml 6 cm diameter 8 cm height and a graphite fibre brush 3 cm diameter 6 cm length 0 22 m2 surface area and carbon cloth 18 cm2 surface area 0 5 mg pt cm 2 were used as the anode and cathode respectively each reactor was fed with 1 5 g l sodium acetate in phosphate buffer solution pbs 100 mm and 1 mineral and vitamin solutions fresh was was inoculated during the first three cycles then the acetate concentration was adjusted to 1 0 g l and mecs were run for no less than ten 24 h cycles at 22 1 c with a voltage of 0 8 v the current and coulombic efficiency were monitored in real time until stable subsequently the reactors were divided into four groups and fed with fermented rwas fwas pwas and fpwas hereinafter named ad rmec ad fmec ad pmec and ad fpmec respectively 2 3 eps extraction and identification two kinds of eps i e loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps were extracted based on the heat protocol wang et al 2018b carbohydrates and proteins the major components of eps were analysed in different was fractions i e dissolved organic matter dom lb eps and tb eps more detailed information on proteins and metabolites was obtained by three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy rf 6000 shimadzu japan and the scanning conditions were consistent with our previous research zhou et al 2017 the eem spectrum consisted of five regions according to different excitation emission wavelengths li et al 2019b and the quantitative calculation method was based on the research of wang et al 2019a 2 4 illumina miseq sequencing and analysis sludge samples were collected from the prefermentation 4 d and mec 4 d biofilms in carbon brushes steps before dna extraction the carbon brushes were dipped in aseptic water and centrifuged at 8000 g the amplicon of the 16s rrna gene was obtained using the specific polymerase chain reaction pcr primers 515f and 806r with barcodes then the pcr products after purification and quantification were sequenced on an illumina miseq platform the raw sequence no srr10337354 was submitted to the ncbi short read archive database cca was performed and visualized using canoco 4 5 molecular ecological networks mens were constructed to reveal the inherent connections between the key microbiomes existing in the anaerobic prefermentation and mec systems based on the random matrix theory interface method deng et al 2012 zhou et al 2010 the original data were uploaded to a network analysis pipeline http ieg2 ou edu mena to analyse the topological properties lin et al 2019 the relative networks were visualized by cytoscape 3 7 1 software 2 5 analysis and calculation methods tcod scod tss and vss were measured according to standard methods vfas hydrogen proteins and carbohydrates were analysed as previously described liu et al 2018 the particle size distribution was determined by a laser particle size analyser bettersize 2000 field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem hitachi jsm 7100f was performed to obtain the morphology of the was and biofilm samples chemical species c o n and p were analysed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo 250xi america free radicals were detected via epr jes fa300 spectrometer japan by using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 0 1 m as the spin trapping agent cv was performed by an electrochemical workstation chenhua chi660 china the scanning speed was 10 mv s and the scanning area ranged from 0 8 v to 0 2 v eis was operated over a frequency range of 1 106 to 0 01 hz with a scanning rate of 10 mv s the data analysis was conducted via zsimpwin software 3 results and discussion 3 1 mechanism of how co pretreatment promotes was disintegration and eps decomposition 3 1 1 effect of sole co pretreatments on was disintegration the sem images intuitively reflect the degree of was disintegration as shown in fig 1 a masses of cocci and bacilli were clustered together and embedded within the gel like eps matrix in rwas obvious cracks in the microbial cells and numerous clear holes appeared in fwas which was mainly due to the biocidal effect of fna while cellular aggregation still existed because of eps protection for pwas the microstructure was less compact and rougher and very few complete cells could be found due to the strongly oxidizing h2o2 generated by paa furthermore the flocs in fpwas were barely formed and the rigid gel matrix and the cells displayed the worst disruption implying that co pretreatment provided the strongest oxidation compared with the sole pretreatments the particle size distributions provided direct evidence for this conclusion fig s1 fpwas exhibited the lowest d50 value 31 0 μm followed by pwas 32 9 μm fwas 34 4 μm and rwas 37 1 μm 3 1 2 effect of sole co pretreatments on eps decomposition the five regions of the fluorescence spectra of dom and tb eps are exhibited in fig 1b and c overall the fluorescence intensities of all five regions were enhanced in dom after the three pretreatments region i tyrosine like substances ex em 220 250 200 330 nm and region iv soluble microbial byproduct like substances ex em 250 280 200 380 nm were the prominent substances in dom for example region i had the highest value in pwas 41 3 followed by fwas 38 6 and fpwas 38 1 all of these values were greater than that of rwas 36 1 in addition the p i n of region i and region ii tryptophan like proteins ex em 200 250 330 380 nm decreased significantly in fpwas and pwas suggesting that the radicals generated by paa may contribute to the degradation of amino acids this result was further proven by the tb eps spectra which showed a corresponding decrease in fluorescent intensity after the three pretreatments fpwas had the lowest value fig 1c co pretreatment caused the most effective release of particulate proteins and carbohydrates and the concentrations dropped by 47 6 and 68 0 respectively with respect to those of rwas while those obtained in fwas were only 38 8 and 46 7 fig 1d and e this result implied that the introduction of paa accelerated the exfoliation of tb eps into dom the concentration of soluble protein increased by 8 3 fold in fpwas compared with that in rwas followed by pwas 5 0 and fwas 2 0 moreover fpwas possessed the highest concentration of soluble carbohydrate 1 6 and 2 6 fold that of fwas and pwas respectively in conclusion co pretreatment showed much greater promise than the sole pretreatments for eps decomposition 3 1 3 identification of the active oxidants contributing to co pretreatment the underlying mechanism of the co pretreatment process is exhibited in fig 2 no and no2 common reactive nitrogen species are first generated through the acid base dissociation of fna hno2 pka 3 4 at 25 c in was these species oxidize many kinds of compounds such as amino acids proteins and several unsaturated fatty acids by electron transfer double bond addition or hydrogen abstraction pérez gonzález et al 2016 n2o3 and n2o4 exist as intermediates and are finally converted to no2 and no3 respectively jiang and yuan 2013 subsequently the added paa is decomposed to hac and h2o2 in aqueous solution h2o2 reacted with fna to produce peroxynitrites onoo and onooh endogenously produced nucleophilic oxidants which can easily diffuse into lipid membranes and damage the structures of various proteins lipids and dna in cells eventually leading to cellular apoptosis prolo et al 2018 onoo can be reversibly converted into no and o2 onooh ph 5 4 25 c can decompose rapidly into approximately 70 nitrate and 30 no2 and oh under acidic conditions ferrer sueta et al 2018 the epr spectra demonstrated that higher intensities of both dmpo oh and dmpo o2 were observed in fpwas than in pwas according to their hyperfine splitting constants further supporting the aforementioned results fig 2b and c the chemical equations involved in co pretreatment are illustrated in table s2 hence the synergistic effect of fna paa and various intermediates no no2 n2o3 n2o4 onoo onooh oh and o2 led to the thorough disruption of was cells and the eps matrix and provided more soluble substrates for the subsequent recovery process 3 2 release and utilization of organics in the cascading system vfas can be converted persistently from the acidification of soluble carbohydrates and proteins overall the vfa concentration sharply increased and peaked at 96 h prefermentation step ii and then decreased over time during mec operation step iii in all groups fig 3 a the maximal vfa concentrations were 2594 84 6453 40 and 7679 86 mg cod l in ad fwas ad pwas and ad fpwas respectively while that obtained in ad rwas was only 868 11 mg cod l fig 3b although the decomposition of paa led to a considerable hac increase 1102 22 mg cod l detected from 1 3 g l paa the net vfa production achieved in ad fpwas was much higher than that obtained in ad pwas and ad fwas remarkably the pretreatments changed the distribution of vfas hac the most prevalent constituent accounted for 50 5 in ad rwas and increased to 77 0 and 67 9 in ad pwas and ad fpwas deducted hac from paa respectively while it was 44 1 in ad fwas increased hac generation benefited hydrogen recovery in the subsequent mec step additionally more valeric acid hva accumulated in ad fpwas 326 0 mg cod l than in the other samples which indicated that much more protein participated in the acidification process efficient cascading conversion of vfas happened in the mec step and the utilization efficiency reached 61 1 in ad fpmec 8 4 and 21 1 higher than that in ad fmec and ad pmec respectively fig 3c fig 3d and e illustrate the evolution of organics in different was fractions during the three operation steps apparently the cascading system played a pivotal role in organics release from tb eps the release efficiencies of proteins and carbohydrates from tb eps in ad fpmec reached 80 6 and 79 8 respectively during the 96 h prefermentation step and further increased to 87 4 and 93 9 during the 96 h bioelectrolysis step at 192 h respectively the variations in fluorescent substances in tb eps are reflected in fig s2 the fluorescence intensities weakened in each step throughout the cascading treatments and reached a minimum in the co pretreatment group the rheological characteristics and incompact structure of lb eps suggested that it can adsorb and transport organics from intracellular substances or tb eps to the liquid phase sheng et al 2010 the small proportion of soluble organics stored in lb eps was nearly the same during the operation of each step the variations in soluble organics in dom after every step were also investigated fig 3d and e a continuous increase in soluble organics was observed in ad rmec with a peak at 192 h while opposite tendencies were obtained in the other groups the highest utilization efficiencies of proteins 42 2 and carbohydrates 56 9 were obtained in ad fpmec followed by ad pmec 27 5 and 24 3 respectively and ad fmec 17 7 and 15 4 at 192 h which showed remarkable superiority to traditional ad yang et al obtained 32 2 and 49 7 utilization of proteins and carbohydrates in was after 42 d ad treatment respectively yang et al 2015b the effective utilization of proteins in ad fpmec is further reflected in fig s3 and table 1 in which the relative abundance of region i iv decreased steadily and finally reduced to a minimum of 29 8 co pretreatment can not only shorten the treatment time but also enhance the utilization of organics especially proteins in cascading systems 3 3 biohydrogen recovery and electrochemical analysis the hydrogen and current generated with the utilization of organics in step iii are shown in figs 3c and 4a respectively the current increased dramatically with the feeding of prefermented was then decreased and tended to become stable the highest current was 6 3 a m2 in ad fpmec followed by 4 5 a m2 and 4 0 a m2 in ad pmec and ad fmec respectively the current in ad rmec was only 3 6 a m2 for hydrogen recovery ad fpmec achieved the highest yield of 10 8 0 30 mg g vss which was 1 4 and 1 7 fold that in ad pmec and ad fmec respectively fig 3c the cascading conversion system fed with co pretreated was i e ad fpmec showed highly superior hydrogen production compared with that in relevant studies niu et al obtained 24 81 1 24 ml h2 g vss equivalent to 2 21 mg h2 g vss after 20 d of dark fermentation of was pretreated with ultrasonication and fna niu et al 2019 yields of 8 50 and 5 4 mg h2 g vss were generated during the cascading utilization of was pretreated with sodium dodecyl sulfate and paa respectively wang et al 2014a the results of cv scanning showed that double layer capacitance formed between the electrode and biofilm to store exoelectrons which could reflect the average current generated in mecs liang et al 2011 ad fpmec generated the highest current 0 023 a and had the largest double layer area in contrast to the currents of 0 015 and 0 018 a generated by ad fmec and ad pmec respectively moreover the oxidation peak at approximately 0 36 v vs sce in both turnover fig 4b and nonturnover fig s4 conditions was the characteristic peak of geobacter sulfurreducens which indicated that the corresponding redox components e g heme groups in cytochrome mainly existed in the biofilm and transferred electrons between the electrode and biofilm jain et al 2011 however the peak current was linearly dependent on the square root of the scan rate insets fig s4 which reflected that the electrochemical redox reaction was a diffusion controlled process in other words efficient pretreatment especially co pretreatment enhanced the capability of electrochemical catalysis during bioelectrolysis which was mainly attributed to the enrichment of electrochemically active bacteria eab this relationship was further demonstrated by the visible microorganisms adhered to the electrodes in the mecs fig s5 more rod shaped microorganisms were attached to the bioanode and biocathode in ad fpmec than in the other three groups the eis results showed that the conductivity of was was clearly enhanced by pretreatment table s1 ad fpmec exhibited the lowest resistance of 10 8 ω followed by ad pmec 15 6 ω ad fmec 20 3 ω and ad rmec 27 6 ω fig 4c and table s1 this result indicated that co pretreatment could enhance the transfer efficiency related to the redox process moreover the lower diffusion resistance rdiff in ad fpmec 6 2 ω accelerated the rate of electron and mass transfer between the electrode and eabs compared to those of ad fmec 11 7 ω and ad pmec 10 5 ω 3 4 xps analysis of different was cascading treatment systems four was samples after 192 h of cascading treatment were analysed by xps c 1s o 1s n 1s and p 2p spectra overall c and o occupied the two largest proportions in the four samples table 2 the spectra of c 1s fig 5a1 and a2 contained four representative peaks the characteristic peak of c1 c c h 284 8 ev was from hydrocarbon like compounds i e lipids amino acid side chains and polysaccharides wang et al 2018a the abundance of c1 the predominant component of eps increased after pretreatment which implied the efficient decomposition of eps the peak at 286 1 ev c2 was attributed to c o n bonds from ethers alcohols amines and amides wang et al 2018a ad fpmec showed the most apparent decline in the binding area of c2 compared with that of ad rmec which indicated that co pretreatment indirectly caused the most effective transformation of macromolecular organics in the cascading system table 2 the weak peak c3 at 288 0 ev was closely related to o c o and c o which mainly existed in amide carboxylate carbonyl acetal and hemiacetal groups notably the bonds of c4 o c or and o c oh 288 5 ev and o2 c o 531 2 ev commonly from carboxyl or ester groups appala raju et al 2008 increased in ad fpmec further proving that co pretreatment led to considerable accumulation of vfas during the prefermentation step after bioelectrolysis utilization the residual vfas were still much higher than those in ad rmec which was consistent with the results of fig 3a and b as shown in table 2 the binding area of n1 n c r 399 6 ev from the amide functions of proteins and peptide chains yu et al 2018 achieved the minimum in ad fpmec indicating that co pretreatment led to the most effective utilization of proteins this result is also intuitively reflected in fig 5b1 and b2 by the accumulation of h n co n2 400 4 ev the typical bond of amino acids in ad fpmec yu et al 2018 the binding energies of 530 8 532 0 and 532 7 ev were assigned to o h o1 p o p o o3 and o c o4 respectively fig 5c1 and c2 martı nez et al 2003 tan et al 2012 notably the binding areas of o3 and p3 c o po3 134 1 ev assigned to the typical bonds in phospholipids sharply dropped to 27 3 and 26 6 in ad fpmec respectively this result implied that the phospholipid bilayer of the cytomembrane was seriously damaged by co pretreatment and further converted into inorganic phosphorus in the cascading conversion system rumble et al 2010 yu et al 2018 this result could further be proven by the increase in p2 133 6 ev from ortho p pyro p fig 5d1 and d2 de carvalho eufrásio pinto et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 this result was also consistent with our previous study on the shifts in phosphorus speciation between sludge and supernatant zhou et al 2019 3 5 microbial community analysis a total of 34660 51218 effective reads were obtained from eight 16s rrna gene libraries by illumina miseq sequencing table s3 the alpha diversity indicated that pretreatment and cascading conversion significantly decreased the richness of the bacterial community and ad fpmec had the lowest richness table s3 to illustrate the interactions among all otus three otu networks were constructed fig s6 in total there were 1877 otus in the eight samples of which only 385 20 5 otus were shared for the prefermentative and bioelectrolytic groups in each of the 4 samples 744 40 9 and 508 27 1 otus were shared respectively but exhibited quite different compositions the dominant phyla of the prefermentative group were proteobacteria 37 bacteroidetes 12 and chloroflexi 10 while those of the bioelectrolytic group were proteobacteria 32 firmicutes 17 and bacteroidetes 16 this result revealed the dissimilarity in the microbial communities participating in the two steps during cascading conversion the bacterial structure and composition at the phylum and class levels are displayed in fig s6 c d proteobacteria and firmicute typical anaerobic or bioelectrochemical communities bonmati et al 2013 cerrillo et al 2016 were highly enriched during the bioelectrolysis step co pretreatment led to a noticeable increase in proteobacteria 62 compared with that in ad fmec 50 and ad pmec 51 at the class level gammaproteobacteria bacteroidia and clostiridia which can convert soluble organics to vfas kato et al 2004 were clearly enriched in the prefermentative samples deltaproteobacteria a reported representative anodic bacteria increased to 43 in ad fpmec a value much higher than that in ad fmec 15 and ad pmec 31 at the genus level fig 6 a representative anaerobic fermentative bacteria afb consisting of citrobacter class gammaproteobacteria macellibacteroides class bacteroidia and two genera of class clostridia proteiniclasticum and sedimentibacter were enriched after prefermentation and became the predominant bacteria in ad fpwas proteiniclasticum responsible for the degradation of proteins to produce hac propionic acid hpr and iso butyric acid iso hbu zhou et al 2018 had an abundance of 6 0 in ad fpwas macellibacteroides can metabolize various carbohydrates for hac hbu and iso hbu generation jabari et al 2012 its proportion in ad fwas was 5 5 and it was further enriched to 6 3 in ad fpwas the genera citrobacter and sedimentibacter can degrade organics to produce vfas and hydrogen during acidogenesis and acetogenesis imachi et al 2016 wang et al 2018c and displayed abundances of 5 7 and 6 9 respectively in ad fpwas followed by ad fwas 1 4 and 5 7 and ad pwas 0 3 and 1 3 in addition other fermentative genera such as terrimonas petrimonas anaerovorax and rhodobacter grabowski et al 2005 kapdan et al 2009 matthies et al 2000 zhang et al 2012 were detected during prefermentation the ultimate enrichment of afb peaked in the prefermentative sample at 28 1 ad fpwas followed by 24 5 ad fwas and 16 1 ad pwas fig 6b notably diaphorobacter and thauera the main nitrate reducing bacteria nrb khardenavis et al 2007 yoshifumi et al 2004 in ad fwas and ad fpwas play important roles in nitrite removal and their cumulative proportions reached 4 0 and 5 0 respectively the structure and abundance of key microbiomes were substantially changed during the bioelectrolysis step six kinds of eabs including geobacter pseudomonas desulfovibrio comamonas shewanella and acinetobacter were enriched in the four bioanodic samples lovley 2011 two genera of class deltaproteobacteria geobacter and desulfovibrio as well as pseudomonas class gammaproteobacteria represented the main eabs in ad fpmec geobacter had the highest accumulation of 39 0 in ad fpmec followed by ad pmec 23 6 ad fmec 9 2 and ad rmec 3 3 pseudomonas and desulfovibrio can conduct respiration by acting as a bioanode and biocathode lin et al 2019 and were enriched to 13 6 and 3 8 respectively in ad fpmec ultimately as shown in fig 6b the total proportion of eab reached 57 0 in ad fpmec which was much higher than those obtained in ad fmec 31 3 and ad pmec 42 1 additionally two homo acetogens acetobacterium and acetoanaerobium were promoted by electro stimulation compared with the values detected in the prefermentation step although very little methane was detected in each group table s4 methanogens were still identified in the was samples the composition and structure of archaea at the genus level are presented in table s5 the overall abundance of archaea accounted for 0 02 1 18 in the eight sludge samples methanosaeta acetotrophic methanogen was the main methanogen in ad rwas 76 and ad fwas 87 5 whereas methanobacterium hydrogenotrophic methanogen was the preponderant genus in ad pwas 63 6 and ad fpwas 58 82 in the bioelectrolysis step the proportion of methanosaeta decreased and methanocorpusculum appeared methanocorpusculum has also been reported to be a typical hydrogenotrophic methanogen although the occurrence of hydrogenotrophic methanogen may lead to the loss of some hydrogen through methanogenesis liu et al 2016 the influences exerted by the low abundance of archaeal sludge samples could be ignored 3 6 cca and mens analysis of the key microbiome the relationship between process variables and microbial populations was revealed by cca analysis vfas and hac showed positive correlations for axis 1 representing 63 4 of the variance while all the environmental variables except methane production were positively related to axis 2 explaining 24 3 of the variance fig 6c detailed information is provided in table s6 vfa production was closely correlated with soluble proteins and carbohydrates according to their small angles 90 implying that the hydrolysis process was the basis of acidification the accumulation of soluble organics was mainly attributed to the enrichment of hydrolytic bacteria furthermore dominant acid producing bacteria such as acinetobacter citrobacter and sedimentibacter gathered along the positive direction of axis 1 and contributed to vfa production two homo acetogens acetobacterium and acetoanaerobium were closely related to hydrogen moreover the current was strongly associated with hydrogen which indicated the effective transfer of protons and electrons in the solution and at the electrodes it was apparent that eabs including geobacter pseudomonas shewanella and desulfovibrio played vital roles in the generation of hydrogen and current methanocorpusculum is also related to hydrogen due to its function of converting hydrogen to methane the overall mens of the key microbiomes in the prefermentation and mec steps are shown in fig s7 based on the network size otu numbers and total links of functional consortia the network complexity of the mec samples was higher than that of the prefermentative samples specifically the mec samples had a higher averaged connectivity 7 83 shorter averaged path distance 3 59 and less modularity 0 41 than the prefermentative samples table s7 to further explore the complex biological relationships i e co existence or competition among the key microbiomes two subnetworks were constructed fig 7 obvious positive correlations were observed among afbs in the prefermentative samples fig 7a for example proteiniclasticum otu149 was positively related to sedimentibacter otu60 and 39 anaerovorax otu439 and pseudomonas otu253 a positive correlation was also observed among macellibacteroides otu579 petrimonas otu15 and 19 sedimentibacter otu39 and bacteroides otu119 this result indicated similar symbiotic and underlying cooperative relationships between fermenters which promoted hydrolysis and acidification regarding nrb diaphorobacter otu695 which can utilize various organics to accomplish denitrification was positively related to sedimentibacter otu147 petrimonas otu15 and 19 and macellibacteroides otu579 nevertheless comamonas otu160 another nrb was negatively correlated with several afbs including macellibacteroides otu579 and 162 citrobacter otu29 bacteroides otu119 and klebsiella otu28 this result indicated their potential competitive relationships during the bioelectrolysis step eab homo acetogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens were promoted geobacter otu24 showed a positive correlation with two afbs rhodobacter otu326 and lentimicrobium otu13 and 18 pseudomonas otu4 was positively related to proteiniclasticum otu909 and desulfovibrio otu38 this result implied an analogical ecological niche or symbiosis between eab and afb accelerating a generation consumption pattern of organics to further promote electron transfer and hydrogen production desulfovibrio otu88 shared a negative relationship with macellibacteroide otu30 terrimonas otu780 and sedimentibacter otu361 signifying a possible competing relationship regarding homo acetogens acetobacterium otu25 displayed positive correlations with two afbs proteiniclasticum otu909 and macellibacteroides otu579 as well as the eab pseudomonas otu4 suggesting mutualistic symbiotic and cooperative interactions among homo acetogens afb and eab that enhanced the cascading utilization of organics through direct or indirect electron respiration from the electrode or intraspecies and interspecies electron transfer processes nagarajan et al 2013 regarding methanogens methanobacterium otu5 and 670 displayed positive correlations with rhodobacter otu326 and acinetobacter otu1810 respectively suggesting potential niche division hydrogenotrophic methanogens including methanocorpusculum otu9 and methanobacterium otu22 may have an underlying syntrophic relationship with geobacter otu10 316 and 152 the same phenomenon was found for methanobacterium otu144 and desulfovibrio otu306 while these genera exhibited a negative relationship with shewanella otu776 indicating niche separation among these genera additionally some otus from the same genus e g otu258 and 909 from proteiniclasticum and otu780 and 860 from terrimonas exhibited opposite correlations with acetobacterium otu300 indicating a possible exclusion mechanism or niche partitioning among versatile genera lin et al 2019 3 7 perspectives with the development of city population and the increased quantity of treated wastewater it will be keeping increasing on the amount of was production from wwtps however safe disposal and efficient treatment of the was are still lacking for many plants lu et al 2019 energy consumption and resource recovery through anaerobic digestion will be fully characterised in a life cycle assessment foley et al 2010 the flows of chemical and energy input have to be considered to fulfil deep sludge utilization batstone et al 2015 considering the low hydrogen conversion from was due to the enmeshment of organics by eps matrix and microbial cells this work innovatively proposes the co pretreatment of fna and paa for accelerating organics transformation from was to hydrogen in prefermentation bioelectrolysis cascading system especially the introduced paa can assist with fna to prompt eps decomposition from was the conceptual scheme of enhanced hydrogen recovery from cascading treatment of was accelerated by fna paa co pretreatment was illustrated in fig 8 the co pretreatment has the synergetic effect on eps decomposition and organics release without any residuals no2 n paa or h2o2 fna can be generated in situ as a byproduct from anaerobic digestion liquor law et al 2015 based on the price of paa 12 1100 1200 t luukkonen et al 2015 100 mg g vss would cost 9 2 10 m3 assuming a vss of 10 g l or 184 200 t dry solids 98 moisture content as the pivotal was treatment process prefermentation electrolysis system shows the great superiority with the short treatment time 8 d high hydrogen recovery 10 8 0 3 mg h2 g vss and current density 6 3 a m2 compared with sole ad or mec process beegle et al pointed out ad mec is more suitable for wastewater treatment than ad or mec on the premise of moderate capital cost operation and maintenance and high revenue potential beegle and borole 2018 although the application of mec in large scale is still facing some challenges i e material costs and external energy input wang et al 2019c 2020 various efforts have made to accomplish the process economically feasible escapa et al estimated that mec would be economically feasible under the current density of 5 a m2 with the capital expense of 1220 m3 anode escapa et al 2012 aiken et al proposed that the target current density of 2 3 a m2 may accomplish break even if reducing relative materials cost of 90 such as electrodes and current collector aiken et al 2019 based on the current density 6 3 a m2 obtained in this study the prefermentation bioelectrolysis system would be economically feasible for the future implement and can be further improved by several aspects like employing cheaper cathode materials e g stainless steel nickel or mos2 based cathodes upgrading the reactor scale and exploring cost effective route for higher current density additionally our previous study found that the cascading system is effective for organic phosphorus release that is a high content of n and p in the effluent could be further recovered as bio fertilizer e g struvite and vivianite which could provide additional economic incentive zhou et al 2019 ultimately lower disposal and transfer costs would be required for the handling of residual sludge due to the efficient degradation of was during the cascading system 4 conclusions this work offers an innovative approach for accelerating eps decomposition and hydrogen recovery from was via paa and fna co pretreatment in a prefermentation mec cascading system the major conclusions include the following 1 paa fna and their intermediates i e no no2 n2o3 n2o4 onoo onooh oh and o2 contributed to effective eps decomposition and was disintegration 2 co pretreatment improved vfa accumulation 1 2 to 2 5 fold that of sole pretreatment in the prefermentation step and the utilization of organics to produce hydrogen 1 4 to 1 7 fold that of sole pretreatment in the bioelectrolysis step 3 xps analysis confirmed that co pretreatment destroyed the phospholipid bilayer of the cytomembrane and accelerated the transformation from macromolecular organics to amide carboxylate and carbonyl groups 4 miseq sequencing showed that co pretreatment stimulated the enrichment of afb 28 1 and eab 57 0 in the prefermentation and bioelectrolysis steps respectively 5 cca and mens revealed the intrinsic correlation between the functional microbiome and environmental factors as well as the interrelation among afb homo acetogens nrb eab and methanogens declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships
