17445,membrane bioreactor mbr is an advantageous technology for wastewater treatment however efficient nutrient removal and membrane fouling mitigation remain major challenges in its applications in this study an electroconductive moving bed membrane bioreactor ecmb mbr was proposed for simultaneous removal of organics and nutrients from domestic wastewater the ecmb mbr was composed of a submerged mbr filled with electrodes and free floating conductive media conductive media were introduced to reduce energy consumption in an electrochemical mbr to improve nitrogen removal and to mitigate membrane fouling the results showed that cod total nitrogen and total phosphorus removal was up to 97 1 1 4 88 8 4 2 and 99 0 0 9 respectively in comparison with those of 93 4 1 5 65 2 5 3 and 20 4 11 3 in a conventional submerged mbr meanwhile a total membrane resistance reduction of 26 7 was obtained in the ecmb mbr the optimized operating condition was determined at an intermittent electricity exposure time of 10 min on 10 min off and a direct current density of 15 a m2 the interactions between electric current and conductive media were explored to understand the working mechanism in this proposed system the conductive media reduced 21 of the electrical resistivity in the mixed liquor at a selected packing density of 0 20 v v the combination of electrochemical process and conductive media specially enhanced the reduction of nitrate nitrogen no3 n through hybrid bio electrochemical denitrification processes these mechanisms involved with electrochemically assisted autotrophic denitrification by autotrophic denitrifying bacteria as a result 5 2 of no3 n remained in the effluent of ecmb mbr in comparison with that of 29 5 in the mbr membrane fouling was minimized via both mechanical scouring and electrochemical decomposition precipitation of organic particulate foulants furthermore a preliminary cost analysis indicated that an additional operating cost of 0 081 usd m3 accounting for 10 30 increment of the operating cost of a conventional mbr was needed to enhance the nitrogen and phosphorus removal correspondingly in the ecmb mbr graphical abstract image

decentralized wastewater treatment 1 introduction membrane bioreactor mbr especially submerged mbr is an attractive technology for wastewater treatment and reclamation due to its advantages over traditional wastewater treatments such as small footprint high contaminant removal efficiency reduced sludge production and flexible operation therefore mbr technology has been successfully commercialized over the past decades the global mbr market valued at 1 2 billion usd in 2016 has continued rising with a compound annual growth rate of 15 and is expected to reach 3 8 billion usd by 2023 leverette 2015 judd 2016 however the lack of nutrient removal function in conventional mbrs remains a bottleneck for broader application as a single stage technology especially for decentralized wastewater treatment systems a submerged mbr can typically remove 30 67 of total nitrogen tn and 12 59 of total phosphorus tp in domestic wastewater kim et al 2010 li et al 2008 subtil et al 2014 to make up for the shortcomings in low nitrogen and phosphorous removal a mbr was usually combined with one or several other treatment processes such as anoxic or anaerobic anoxic processes xiao et al 2019 this usually resulted in a long and complex process containing a number of compartments which consumed large footprint and limited the flexibility and application potential of mbr as a modularized compact system for wastewater treatment and reclamation recent studies examined the electrochemical process assisted mbr referred to as embr which incorporated mbr with electrochemical oxidation and precipitation processes enhanced removals of organic matters and phosphorous in embrs were extensively reported kim et al 2010 observed a tp removal increment from 41 0 in a conventional mbr to 79 9 in an embr hosseinzadeh et al 2015 found that cod removal was slightly increased in an embr 85 compared with 80 in mbr in addition membrane fouling mitigation was obtained in embrs due to the influence of multiple electrochemical effects such as electrochemical oxidation electrochemical precipitation and electrophoresis ibeid et al 2015 nonetheless the performance of embr on nitrogen removal and associated mechanisms have rarely been reported in previous literature su et al 2020 observed enhanced ammonia removal up to 77 8 in an embr compared with 65 0 in a conventional mbr whereas several studies have challenged this conclusion finding no differences in ammonia removal in their experiments battistelli et al 2019 hasan et al 2012 wei et al 2009 in addition little information with respect to tn elimination in embr is available considering the significance of nitrogen removal in modern wastewater treatment a systematic investigation with firm conclusions should be explored for embrs despite high contaminant removal intensive energy consumption associated with the utilization of electricity remained a bottleneck for embr technology as an attractive approach for domestic wastewater treatment hasan et al 2014 hence effectively reducing energy usage without compromising treatment performance is a key to the future development of embr technology this study introduced low cost conductive media into an electrochemical assisted mbr namely electroconductive moving bed membrane bioreactor ecmb mbr in order to reduce the energy consumption and to diversify the cod and nutrient elimination routes interactions between the added conductive media and electric current were assumed to largely improve the removal of nitrogen and phosphorous in domestic wastewater as well as to effectively control the development of membrane fouling through hybrid mechanisms the modified ecmb mbr is recommended as a high efficiency one step system for treating domestic wastewater decentrally to verify these hypotheses the performance contaminant removal mechanisms and additional operating cost of an ecmb mbr was comprehensively investigated in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory experimental setup a laboratory scale ecmb mbr was set up as presented in fig 1 the ecmb mbr reactor was fabricated using transparent acrylic material with a working volume of 8 4 l a hollow fiber polyvinylidene difluoride membrane module 50s0070sa mitsubishi rayon aqua solutions japan with a pore size of 0 04 µm and an effective membrane surface area of 0 07 m2 was submerged in the reactor a pre perforated iron anode and a stainless steel cathode were immersed at a distance of 4 cm from each side of the membrane module the effective area of each electrode was approximately 234 cm2 the dc power supply rxn 303d zhaoxin china was connected to the electrodes driving various electrochemical effects in the reactor the power supply was able to provide an output voltage and current up to 30 v and 5 a respectively activated carbon coated sponges tako thailand co ltd thailand with the general properties presented in table s1 were applied as the conductive media in this study the conductive media were filled into the reactor at a packing density of 0 20 v v meanwhile a conventional submerged mbr with the same dimension was operated as a comparison in parallel with the ecmb mbr air diffusers were installed at the bottom of the reactors to provide oxygen for biomass and to maintain the well blended conductive media in the reactor peristaltic pumps masterflex cole parmer vernon hills il were used to feed wastewater into reactors and to discharge the effluent at a mean daily flow rate of 50 l float switches were used to control water levels in both reactors activated sludge seeded in the reactors was collected from a sequencing batch reactor at a wastewater treatment plant wwtp in pathumthani thailand this wwtp has an average capacity of 1 500 m3 d and is fed with combined domestic wastewater and rainwater raw wastewater collected from the same wwtp was used as the influent in this study table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the influent wastewater average cod and nutrient concentrations in the influent were comparable to the values reported in typical domestic wastewater tchobanoglous et al 2003 fluctuations in influent quality were attributed to the influence of heavy rainfall during the experimental period 2 2 operating conditions the experiment was conducted by comparing two reactors the ecmb mbr and the mbr the mbr was set up as a control without installing the electrodes and conductive media the ecmb mbr was operated under two scenarios the moving bed membrane bioreactor mb mbr without application of electricity in the reactor and the ecmb mbr with various intermittent exposure time and current density in particular the effect of intermittent exposure time was investigated by varying the on off mode of power supply with a duration ratio of 1 2 5 min on 10 min off 1 1 10 min on 10 min off and 2 1 10 min on 5 min off at a constant current density of 15 a m2 this was followed by examining the effect of varied current density 10 a m2 15 a m2 and 20 a m2 with a selected intermittent exposure time each designed condition was operated in parallel with the conventional mbr for approximately one month to obtain stable biological performance in the reactors the significant difference between performance observed under different operating conditions was determined using two tailed t test with a significance level of 0 05 the reactors were operated at a constant permeate flux of 0 71 m3 m2 d with an average influent organic loading rate of 2 44 kg cod m3 d a hydraulic retention time hrt of four hours was designed to obtain a high throughput of wastewater a solid retention time srt of 20 days was controlled during the operation acclimatization of activated sludge was performed for approximately a week before data collection until the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss reached the values of around 8 000 mg l and 6 000 mg l respectively both mlss and mlvss were maintained constantly throughout the whole experimental period fig s1 2 3 analytical methods ph was measured using a ph meter seven2gotm s2 mettler toledo switzerland dissolved oxygen do concentration and temperature were monitored using a do meter seven2gotm s9 mettler toledo switzerland the oxidation reduction potential orp of mixed liquor was measured using an orp meter seven2gotm s7 mettler toledo switzerland water samples were collected from influent mixed liquor and effluent respectively concentrations of cod total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n tp and total iron fe in collected samples were analyzed according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater baird et al 2017 tn was then calculated as the sum of tkn no2 n and no3 n membrane fouling development was monitored by transmembrane pressure tmp over time using vacuum gauges total membrane resistance r t membrane resistance r m and fouling resistance r f were determined according to judd 2010 when the tmp of mbr reached the maximum allowed level 30 kpa extracellular polymeric substances eps in mixed liquor were measured in both forms of soluble eps seps and bound eps beps to gain further insight into the foulant property eps compounds in mixed liquor were firstly extracted using the thermal extraction method le clech et al 2006 morgan et al 1990 then centrifuged at 5 000 rpm for 20 min the supernatant representing seps was filtered through gf c paper whatman usa the remaining sludge was resuspended in di water then it was mixed and heated at 80 c for 10 min before being centrifuged again at 5 000 rpm for 20 min the supernatant was collected and filtered through gf c paper for beps measurement relative contents of protein and carbohydrate in eps were determined following the lowry assay method lowry et al 1951 and phenol sulfuric method dubois et al 1956 respectively 2 4 microbial community analysis sludge samples from mbr mb mbr and ecmb mbr 10 min on 10 min off mode at 15 a m2 were collected at the end of each operation period and sent for microbial community analysis total genomic dna was extracted using the phenol chloroform method the v3 v4 region of 16s rrna genes were amplified with selected primers in the phusion high fidelity pcr master mix new england biolabs the pcr products were mixed in equidensity ratios and then were purified with the qiagen gel extraction kit qiagen germany the effective sequences were clustered as operational taxonomic units outs with over 97 similarity and screened for species annotation based on ribosomal database project rdp classifier ver 2 2 the phylogenetic relationship of different otus and the different dominant species was analyzed using the muscle program ver 3 8 31 2 5 preliminary operating cost analysis for ecmb mbr the additional operating cost of an ecmb mbr was composed of energy consumption electricity and material consumption electrode which drove the electrochemical processes it was estimated using the following equation 1 c a enc b elc where c refers to the additional operating cost usd m3 enc is the energy consumption kwh m3 elc is the electrode consumption kg m3 a is the unit cost of electricity i e 0 102 usd kwh mea 2015 and b is the unit cost of the iron electrode i e 0 066 usd kg the energy consumption was calculated using eq 2 khandegar and saroha 2013 while the electrode consumption was determined following faraday s law kobya et al 2006 as expressed in eq 3 2 enc u i t v 3 elc i m t n f v where u is the applied voltage on electrodes v i is the applied current a t is the electrolysis time h v is the volume of treated effluent m3 m is the molecular weight of iron electrode g mol n is the number of transferred electrons and f is the faraday constant coulomb mol 3 results and discussion 3 1 treatment performance of ecmb mbr in comparison with mbr and mb mbr the performance of ecmb mbr on removal of cod tp and tn was compared with that in mbr and mb mbr fig 2 though cod concentration in influent fluctuated over time its concentration in the effluent of each reactor was relatively stable comparable average cod removals in mbr and mb mbr were obtained at 93 4 1 5 and 94 4 1 7 respectively p 0 05 a slight increase in cod removal was observed up to 97 1 1 4 in ecmb mbr p 0 05 improved cod removal in an electrochemical mbr was reported in previous studies bani melhem and elektorowicz 2011 hosseinzadeh et al 2015 this was attributed to the enhanced removal of organics due to electrochemical oxidation and electrocoagulation borea et al 2017 with the presence of conductive media approximately 10 increase of tn removal was obtained in mb mbr in comparison with the mbr control fig 2b tn removal in ecmb mbr was further increased to 88 8 4 2 comparing with that of 75 8 3 6 in mb mbr and 65 2 5 3 in mbr control p 0 05 interestingly an average no3 n concentration of 1 60 0 73 mg l in the effluent of ecmb mbr was obtained much lower than that of 9 32 1 00 mg l observed in mbr p 0 05 fig 2c this demonstrates that the high tn removal was primarily attributed to enhanced denitrification especially no3 n reduction in the ecmb mbr the mass balance analyses of nitrogen compositions in wastewater influent and effluent of different reactors provided further insight into the enhancement of tn removal fig 3 the fractions of biomass synthesized n org n and nh3 n were maintained at approximately 7 3 2 0 and 2 0 respectively in effluents of all reactors indicating an insignificant effect brought by introducing electrochemical process and conductive media on biomass assimilation and nitrification nonetheless only 5 2 of nitrogen ended as no3 n in the ecmb mbr effluent while this value was as high as 29 5 in the mbr effluent revealing that the enhanced tn removal in ecmb mbr was primarily due to the strengthened denitrification process on the other hand a slight improvement of no3 n reduction was observed in mb mbr whose effluent contained 16 9 of no3 n this was primarily due to the biofilm formation in mb mbr which created the spatial heterogeneity of aerobic anoxic environment for nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria nonetheless a higher performance in ecmb mbr indicates a more effective denitrification mechanism with the presence of electric current the tp removal increased from 20 4 11 3 in mbr to 99 0 0 9 in ecmb mbr fig 2d removal of tp in the mbr was primarily due to bio assimilation and membrane filtration particulate p electrochemical precipitation has been identified as a principal mechanism responsible for the high tp removal in an embr wei et al 2009 this process involves the chemical reaction between iron ions and phosphate ions po4 3 in a reactor the dissociated fe3 from anode reacts with oh generated from cathode to form iron hydroxide fe oh 3 which has a large specific surface area and is able to adsorb po4 3 rapidly from the mixed liquor bayramoglu et al 2004 meanwhile free fe3 is able to react with po4 3 through direct contact and precipitate in the form of fepo4 fig 2e provided direct evidence on the abovementioned hypothesis with the fe concentration in effluent of ecmb mbr of 0 75 0 48 mg l much higher than that observed in mbr effluent i e 0 22 0 10 mg l these processes ultimately enhanced the removal of tp in the ecmb mbr approximately 16 of tp removal increment was obtained in mb mbr compared with the mbr control this was possibly due to the enhanced biological phosphorous induced by the conductive media hence the improvement of tp removal in an ecmb mbr was an integrated result of electrochemical precipitation and biological phosphorus removal with the former playing a primary role apart from cod and nutrient removal membrane fouling mitigation performance in the proposed ecmb mbr was evaluated via comparing the tmp variation with that in mbr and mb mbr fig 4 delayed tmp increment was identified in the ecmb mbr followed by that in mb mbr while the fastest increase in tmp was observed in the mbr the results of fouling resistance calculation revealed a 29 2 reduction of r f in ecmb mbr with the values being calculated as 2 31 1012 m 1 2 72 1012 m 1 and 3 26 1012 m 1 for ecmb mbr mb mbr and mbr respectively the mitigation of membrane fouling in ecmb mbr was comparable to or slightly higher than those have been reported previously bani melhem and elektorowicz 2011 hosseinzadeh et al 2015 suganthi et al 2013 possibly due to the combined effect of conductive media and electric current 3 2 effects of intermittent exposure time and current density on the performance of ecmb mbr the effects of intermittent exposure time and current density on treatment performance of ecmb mbr were studied by comparing the cod tn and tp removal under various operating conditions as presented in table 2 the best performance for cod and tn removal was obtained with 10 min on 10 min off mode and a current density of 15 a m2 varying degrees of decline in cod and tn removal was observed in the other tested conditions especially for tn removal at a relatively low intermittent exposure time and low current density previous studies have stated that increasing power input in embr strengthened the electrochemical oxidation and resulted in improved organic matter degradation and nitrification qian et al 2017 radha et al 2009 however the nitrogen compositions in the current study revealed that no3 n was the primary fraction influenced by modified operating parameters fig s2 compared with a relatively low intermittent exposure time 5 min on 10 min off at 15 a m2 or current density 10 min on 10 min off at 10 a m2 the optimized condition 10 min on 10 min off at 15 a m2 provided a 7 5 of increase on no3 n elimination with comparable removal of the other nitrogen fractions p 0 05 nevertheless the improvement of cod and tn removal was not observed in any further increased intermittent exposure time 10 min on 5 min off at 15 a m2 or current density 10 min on 10 min off at 20 a m2 p 0 05 one possible explanation may be that intensified fe3 dissociation and accumulation table 2 adversely affected microorganisms via inhibiting their metabolic activities philips et al 2003 demonstrated that fe3 presence in the mixed liquor reduced the oxygen uptake rate of microorganisms especially heterotrophs and nitrifying bacteria fe3 can attach to the cell membrane which interferes with oxygen and nutrient absorption by microorganisms hu et al 2004 furthermore accumulated fe3 may destroy the structure and function of proteins in cells causing a drop in biological processes and nitrification performance clark et al 2000 consistent with the findings in previous studies on nitrate removal in drinking water using electrochemical process park et al 2005 zhao et al 2011 over elevated intermittent exposure time or current density did not improve no3 n reduction the excessive generation of oxygen due to increased power input may inhibit the denitrification process constant tp removal was obtained regardless of the applied intermittent exposure time and current density according to hossain et al 2013 a longer electricity exposure time improved the removal of tp due to a higher amount of fe3 released into the mixed liquor guo et al 2020 reported that current density positively affected the removal of tp whereas insignificant difference in tp removal was identified among the examined operating parameters in this study p 0 05 indicating a sufficient fe3 supply from the iron electrode under the tested conditions a rough comparison between the lowest fe3 generation rate 2 g d among tested conditions and tp influent rate 0 2 g d also supports our inference although with varied operating parameters the similar power inputs table 2 between the test pair of 5 min on 10 min off at 15 a m2 and 10 min on 10 min off at 10 a m2 as well as the test pair of 10 min on 5 min off at 15 a m2 and 10 min on 10 min off at 20 a m2 may explain their comparable performance respectively hence power input is probably a critical parameter to control the treatment performance especially for tn removal in ecmb mbr nonetheless varied design on these two parameters may differentially influence the microbial community and function during a long term application despite the same power input further research is necessary to clarify the possible impact on microorganisms with long term operation and observation 3 3 interactions between electric current and conductive media for enhanced performance in ecmb mbr in addition to the microbiological oxidation and membrane filtration processes in a conventional submerged mbr remarkable tn and tp removal together with effective membrane fouling control was simultaneously obtained in the proposed ecmb mbr system through the interactions between electric current and floating conductive media fig 5 the moving bed composed of conductive media was assumed to increase the conductivity in the mixed liquor between the two electrodes hence reducing the energy consumption for triggering electrochemical reactions khandegar and saroha 2013 this hypothesis was supported as depicted in fig 7a which demonstrates that the resistivity of mixed liquor decreased with an increasing packing density of the conductive media approximately 21 of resistivity reduction was obtained with a packing density of 0 20 v v indicating a potential energy saving of around 21 in the studied ecmb mbr future studies can be conducted with increased packing density of conductive media to further reduce energy consumption in the system the significant enhancement of no3 n reduction in the ecmb mbr was attributed to the integration of electric current and conductive media from a macro perspective electrochemical assisted reduction induced by adding electric current was able to generate temporal heterogeneity of the redox potential in the system meanwhile the presence of conductive media increased the spatial heterogeneity of redox potential in the reactor enhanced denitrification due to the introduced temporal and spatial heterogeneity was revealed through the difference in effluent no3 n fractions between ecmb mbr 5 2 and mbr 29 5 as shown in fig 3 two potential denitrification mechanisms were behind this result fig 6 the first mechanism involves the direct electrochemical reduction of no3 n with enhanced electron transportation applying electric current potentially promoted denitrification by providing electrons from anode oxidation furthermore conductive media acted as secondary electron providers and encouraged the electron conduction in the reactor these produced electrons could be in situ electron donors for no3 n reduction resulting in enhanced denitrification in ecmb mbr fig 7 b illustrates that applying electric current intermittently caused significant fluctuation in the bulk orp the observed bulk orp dropped to 145 mv with a current density at 15 a m2 and raised to 43 mv in the absence of an electric field hence an alternative oxidizing and reducing environment was generated in the mixed liquor the reduced orp facilitated the electrochemical reduction of no3 n subsequently generating no2 n and n2 this electrochemical reduction of no3 n has been previously demonstrated and applied especially in nitrate rich surface water and groundwater treatment processes guo et al 2020 koparal and öğütveren 2002 however the observed bulk orp was slightly higher than the theoretical value 250 mv to widely promote denitrification karanasios et al 2010 this mechanism may occur locally in the reactor where a highly reducing environment was induced e g the area surrounding the anode and conductive media the second mechanism involves electrochemically enhanced autotrophic denitrification with the presence of electric current hydrogen was produced from electrolysis of water around the cathode electrode the generated hydrogen molecules can be utilized as electron donors by autotrophic denitrifying bacteria instead of carbon sources to complete the denitrification process fig 7c illustrates that hydrogenophilaceae was detected at a relative abundance up to 10 3 only in ecmb mbr providing a direct support of our hypothesis according to xing et al 2017 hydrogenophilaceae is a family of autotrophic denitrifying bacteria that uses hydrogen as electron donors similar electrochemically assisted autotrophic denitrification has been applied and reported in bio electrochemical reactors for the treatment of drinking water and groundwater biswas and bose 2005 sunger and bose 2009 membrane fouling mitigation was achieved through a hybrid mechanism combining mechanical scouring of membrane surface and electrochemical decomposition of suspended organic foulants mechanical scouring was carried out by the floating conductive media moreover the media probably acted as a pre filter to capture some of the fouling substances in mixed liquor before they deposited on the membrane surface johir et al 2011 according to fig 4 16 6 of r f reduction was observed in mb mbr compared with mbr resulting in a slower rise in tmp while reduction in eps was not observed in the mb mbr fig 7d on the other hand 28 8 of eps reduction was observed in the ecmb mbr particularly the fraction of beps which was responsible for a further reduced r f at 15 1 compared with mb mbr fig 4 several studies have revealed that eps has a strong impact on membrane fouling through pore blocking and deposition wang et al 2009 out of the total eps beps proteins are considered the main components leading to organic membrane fouling li et al 2019 the results of the eps analysis fig 7d proved the efficiency of electric current on membrane fouling mitigation through various potential mechanisms such as electrochemical degradation electrochemical precipitation and electrophoresis ibeid et al 2015 overall the introduction of conductive media and electric current in an ecmb mbr induced multiple interactions well diversified the processes occurring in the reactor and improved the energy efficiency that drove these processes fig 5 in particular the performance on nutrient removal was significantly improved surpassing most of the currently reported biological processes that have been applied for decentralized wastewater treatment bajpai et al 2019 3 4 preliminary estimation of additional operating cost of ecmb mbr the operating cost in an electrochemical assisted mbr was one of the major concerns that restricts its wide application in wastewater treatment ghosh et al 2011 an estimation of the additional operating cost induced by electricity and electrode consumption in an ecmb mbr was carried out to fill the information gap regarding this newly proposed technology though cost estimation was based on data collected from the operation of a laboratory scale testing system valuable reference was able to be provided for future study on the feasibility of the technology in particular electricity consumption for driving the electrochemical reactions and electrode material consumption for generating free fe3 were considered in the preliminary cost analysis the electrode consumption was estimated based on the weight loss of the anode during the operation weight loss of electrodes is a combined result of oxidation and corrosion when applying an electric current ghosh et al 2011 in the current study we observed comparable electrode consumption in the reactor with the calculated rate based on eq 3 suggesting an efficient utilization of the electrode material in the system table 2 shows that energy and electrode consumption proportionally related to the amount of power input to obtain the best cod tn and tp removal the energy and electrode consumption of 0 778 kwh m3 and 0 035 kg m3 respectively were needed these required an additional operating cost of approximately 0 081 usd m3 in which 95 accounted for energy consumption according to lo et al 2015 and verrecht et al 2012 the operating cost of small scale mbrs with treatment capacity between 25 m3 d and 2 500 m3 d could vary from 0 56 usd m3 to 0 27 usd m3 the results demonstrate that ecmb mbr can significantly upgrade the effluent quality with a slight cost increase by approximately 10 30 it is worth noting that this additional operating cost may be overestimated since it was calculated based on a laboratory scale reactor further applicability assessment should be carried out through process scale up in the future 4 conclusions an ecmb mbr incorporating a submerged mbr electrochemical processes and conductive media was proposed as a single step technology for decentralized wastewater treatment the simultaneous cod tn and tp removal at the selected operating condition 10 min on 10 min off at 15 a m2 reached 97 1 1 4 88 8 4 2 and 99 0 0 9 respectively significantly surpassing the performance observed in a compared mbr in addition improved membrane fouling mitigation was noted with a fouling resistance reduction up to 29 2 in the tested ecmb mbr the enhanced performance of ecmb mbr was attributed to the effective interactions between the conductive media and electric current this study demonstrated that approximately 21 of energy consumption was saved by adding conductive media at a packing density of 0 20 v v in the reactor a hybrid process composed of both direct electrochemical no3 n reduction and electrochemical enhanced autotrophic denitrification accounted for the additional 24 of tn removal observed in the ecmb mbr furthermore integrated mechanical scouring and electrochemical decomposition of eps derived from conductive media and electric current respectively was responsible for the fouling mitigation in the ecmb mbr a preliminary cost analysis revealed that 0 081 usd m3 of additional operating cost was needed for the ecmb mbr which accounted for approximately 10 30 of the typical operating cost in a small scale mbr accounting for its remarkable performance and relatively low energy cost the ecmb mbr is recommended as a high efficiency one step system especially for decentralized domestic

and conductive media specially enhanced the reduction of nitrate nitrogen no3 n through hybrid bio electrochemical denitrification processes these mechanisms involved with electrochemically assisted autotrophic denitrification by autotrophic denitrifying bacteria as a result 5 2 of no3 n remained in the effluent of ecmb mbr in comparison with that of 29 5 in the mbr membrane fouling was minimized via both mechanical scouring and electrochemical decomposition precipitation of organic particulate foulants furthermore a preliminary cost analysis indicated that an additional operating cost of 0 081 usd m3 accounting for 10 30 increment of the operating cost of a conventional mbr was needed to enhance the nitrogen and phosphorus removal correspondingly in the ecmb mbr graphical abstract image

decentralized wastewater treatment 1 introduction membrane bioreactor mbr especially submerged mbr is an attractive technology for wastewater treatment and reclamation due to its advantages over traditional wastewater treatments such as small footprint high contaminant removal efficiency reduced sludge production and flexible operation therefore mbr technology has been successfully commercialized over the past decades the global mbr market valued at 1 2 billion usd in 2016 has continued rising with a compound annual growth rate of 15 and is expected to reach 3 8 billion usd by 2023 leverette 2015 judd 2016 however the lack of nutrient removal function in conventional mbrs remains a bottleneck for broader application as a single stage technology especially for decentralized wastewater treatment systems a submerged mbr can typically remove 30 67 of total nitrogen tn and 12 59 of total phosphorus tp in domestic wastewater kim et al 2010 li et al 2008 subtil et al 2014 to make up for the shortcomings in low nitrogen and phosphorous removal a mbr was usually combined with one or several other treatment processes such as anoxic or anaerobic anoxic processes xiao et al 2019 this usually resulted in a long and complex process containing a number of compartments which consumed large footprint and limited the flexibility and application potential of mbr as a modularized compact system for wastewater treatment and reclamation recent studies examined the electrochemical process assisted mbr referred to as embr which incorporated mbr with electrochemical oxidation and precipitation processes enhanced removals of organic matters and phosphorous in embrs were extensively reported kim et al 2010 observed a tp removal increment from 41 0 in a conventional mbr to 79 9 in an embr hosseinzadeh et al 2015 found that cod removal was slightly increased in an embr 85 compared with 80 in mbr in addition membrane fouling mitigation was obtained in embrs due to the influence of multiple electrochemical effects such as electrochemical oxidation electrochemical precipitation and electrophoresis ibeid et al 2015 nonetheless the performance of embr on nitrogen removal and associated mechanisms have rarely been reported in previous literature su et al 2020 observed enhanced ammonia removal up to 77 8 in an embr compared with 65 0 in a conventional mbr whereas several studies have challenged this conclusion finding no differences in ammonia removal in their experiments battistelli et al 2019 hasan et al 2012 wei et al 2009 in addition little information with respect to tn elimination in embr is available considering the significance of nitrogen removal in modern wastewater treatment a systematic investigation with firm conclusions should be explored for embrs despite high contaminant removal intensive energy consumption associated with the utilization of electricity remained a bottleneck for embr technology as an attractive approach for domestic wastewater treatment hasan et al 2014 hence effectively reducing energy usage without compromising treatment performance is a key to the future development of embr technology this study introduced low cost conductive media into an electrochemical assisted mbr namely electroconductive moving bed membrane bioreactor ecmb mbr in order to reduce the energy consumption and to diversify the cod and nutrient elimination routes interactions between the added conductive media and electric current were assumed to largely improve the removal of nitrogen and phosphorous in domestic wastewater as well as to effectively control the development of membrane fouling through hybrid mechanisms the modified ecmb mbr is recommended as a high efficiency one step system for treating domestic wastewater decentrally to verify these hypotheses the performance contaminant removal mechanisms and additional operating cost of an ecmb mbr was comprehensively investigated in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory experimental setup a laboratory scale ecmb mbr was set up as presented in fig 1 the ecmb mbr reactor was fabricated using transparent acrylic material with a working volume of 8 4 l a hollow fiber polyvinylidene difluoride membrane module 50s0070sa mitsubishi rayon aqua solutions japan with a pore size of 0 04 µm and an effective membrane surface area of 0 07 m2 was submerged in the reactor a pre perforated iron anode and a stainless steel cathode were immersed at a distance of 4 cm from each side of the membrane module the effective area of each electrode was approximately 234 cm2 the dc power supply rxn 303d zhaoxin china was connected to the electrodes driving various electrochemical effects in the reactor the power supply was able to provide an output voltage and current up to 30 v and 5 a respectively activated carbon coated sponges tako thailand co ltd thailand with the general properties presented in table s1 were applied as the conductive media in this study the conductive media were filled into the reactor at a packing density of 0 20 v v meanwhile a conventional submerged mbr with the same dimension was operated as a comparison in parallel with the ecmb mbr air diffusers were installed at the bottom of the reactors to provide oxygen for biomass and to maintain the well blended conductive media in the reactor peristaltic pumps masterflex cole parmer vernon hills il were used to feed wastewater into reactors and to discharge the effluent at a mean daily flow rate of 50 l float switches were used to control water levels in both reactors activated sludge seeded in the reactors was collected from a sequencing batch reactor at a wastewater treatment plant wwtp in pathumthani thailand this wwtp has an average capacity of 1 500 m3 d and is fed with combined domestic wastewater and rainwater raw wastewater collected from the same wwtp was used as the influent in this study table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the influent wastewater average cod and nutrient concentrations in the influent were comparable to the values reported in typical domestic wastewater tchobanoglous et al 2003 fluctuations in influent quality were attributed to the influence of heavy rainfall during the experimental period 2 2 operating conditions the experiment was conducted by comparing two reactors the ecmb mbr and the mbr the mbr was set up as a control without installing the electrodes and conductive media the ecmb mbr was operated under two scenarios the moving bed membrane bioreactor mb mbr without application of electricity in the reactor and the ecmb mbr with various intermittent exposure time and current density in particular the effect of intermittent exposure time was investigated by varying the on off mode of power supply with a duration ratio of 1 2 5 min on 10 min off 1 1 10 min on 10 min off and 2 1 10 min on 5 min off at a constant current density of 15 a m2 this was followed by examining the effect of varied current density 10 a m2 15 a m2 and 20 a m2 with a selected intermittent exposure time each designed condition was operated in parallel with the conventional mbr for approximately one month to obtain stable biological performance in the reactors the significant difference between performance observed under different operating conditions was determined using two tailed t test with a significance level of 0 05 the reactors were operated at a constant permeate flux of 0 71 m3 m2 d with an average influent organic loading rate of 2 44 kg cod m3 d a hydraulic retention time hrt of four hours was designed to obtain a high throughput of wastewater a solid retention time srt of 20 days was controlled during the operation acclimatization of activated sludge was performed for approximately a week before data collection until the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss reached the values of around 8 000 mg l and 6 000 mg l respectively both mlss and mlvss were maintained constantly throughout the whole experimental period fig s1 2 3 analytical methods ph was measured using a ph meter seven2gotm s2 mettler toledo switzerland dissolved oxygen do concentration and temperature were monitored using a do meter seven2gotm s9 mettler toledo switzerland the oxidation reduction potential orp of mixed liquor was measured using an orp meter seven2gotm s7 mettler toledo switzerland water samples were collected from influent mixed liquor and effluent respectively concentrations of cod total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n tp and total iron fe in collected samples were analyzed according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater baird et al 2017 tn was then calculated as the sum of tkn no2 n and no3 n membrane fouling development was monitored by transmembrane pressure tmp over time using vacuum gauges total membrane resistance r t membrane resistance r m and fouling resistance r f were determined according to judd 2010 when the tmp of mbr reached the maximum allowed level 30 kpa extracellular polymeric substances eps in mixed liquor were measured in both forms of soluble eps seps and bound eps beps to gain further insight into the foulant property eps compounds in mixed liquor were firstly extracted using the thermal extraction method le clech et al 2006 morgan et al 1990 then centrifuged at 5 000 rpm for 20 min the supernatant representing seps was filtered through gf c paper whatman usa the remaining sludge was resuspended in di water then it was mixed and heated at 80 c for 10 min before being centrifuged again at 5 000 rpm for 20 min the supernatant was collected and filtered through gf c paper for beps measurement relative contents of protein and carbohydrate in eps were determined following the lowry assay method lowry et al 1951 and phenol sulfuric method dubois et al 1956 respectively 2 4 microbial community analysis sludge samples from mbr mb mbr and ecmb mbr 10 min on 10 min off mode at 15 a m2 were collected at the end of each operation period and sent for microbial community analysis total genomic dna was extracted using the phenol chloroform method the v3 v4 region of 16s rrna genes were amplified with selected primers in the phusion high fidelity pcr master mix new england biolabs the pcr products were mixed in equidensity ratios and then were purified with the qiagen gel extraction kit qiagen germany the effective sequences were clustered as operational taxonomic units outs with over 97 similarity and screened for species annotation based on ribosomal database project rdp classifier ver 2 2 the phylogenetic relationship of different otus and the different dominant species was analyzed using the muscle program ver 3 8 31 2 5 preliminary operating cost analysis for ecmb mbr the additional operating cost of an ecmb mbr was composed of energy consumption electricity and material consumption electrode which drove the electrochemical processes it was estimated using the following equation 1 c a enc b elc where c refers to the additional operating cost usd m3 enc is the energy consumption kwh m3 elc is the electrode consumption kg m3 a is the unit cost of electricity i e 0 102 usd kwh mea 2015 and b is the unit cost of the iron electrode i e 0 066 usd kg the energy consumption was calculated using eq 2 khandegar and saroha 2013 while the electrode consumption was determined following faraday s law kobya et al 2006 as expressed in eq 3 2 enc u i t v 3 elc i m t n f v where u is the applied voltage on electrodes v i is the applied current a t is the electrolysis time h v is the volume of treated effluent m3 m is the molecular weight of iron electrode g mol n is the number of transferred electrons and f is the faraday constant coulomb mol 3 results and discussion 3 1 treatment performance of ecmb mbr in comparison with mbr and mb mbr the performance of ecmb mbr on removal of cod tp and tn was compared with that in mbr and mb mbr fig 2 though cod concentration in influent fluctuated over time its concentration in the effluent of each reactor was relatively stable comparable average cod removals in mbr and mb mbr were obtained at 93 4 1 5 and 94 4 1 7 respectively p 0 05 a slight increase in cod removal was observed up to 97 1 1 4 in ecmb mbr p 0 05 improved cod removal in an electrochemical mbr was reported in previous studies bani melhem and elektorowicz 2011 hosseinzadeh et al 2015 this was attributed to the enhanced removal of organics due to electrochemical oxidation and electrocoagulation borea et al 2017 with the presence of conductive media approximately 10 increase of tn removal was obtained in mb mbr in comparison with the mbr control fig 2b tn removal in ecmb mbr was further increased to 88 8 4 2 comparing with that of 75 8 3 6 in mb mbr and 65 2 5 3 in mbr control p 0 05 interestingly an average no3 n concentration of 1 60 0 73 mg l in the effluent of ecmb mbr was obtained much lower than that of 9 32 1 00 mg l observed in mbr p 0 05 fig 2c this demonstrates that the high tn removal was primarily attributed to enhanced denitrification especially no3 n reduction in the ecmb mbr the mass balance analyses of nitrogen compositions in wastewater influent and effluent of different reactors provided further insight into the enhancement of tn removal fig 3 the fractions of biomass synthesized n org n and nh3 n were maintained at approximately 7 3 2 0 and 2 0 respectively in effluents of all reactors indicating an insignificant effect brought by introducing electrochemical process and conductive media on biomass assimilation and nitrification nonetheless only 5 2 of nitrogen ended as no3 n in the ecmb mbr effluent while this value was as high as 29 5 in the mbr effluent revealing that the enhanced tn removal in ecmb mbr was primarily due to the strengthened denitrification process on the other hand a slight improvement of no3 n reduction was observed in mb mbr whose effluent contained 16 9 of no3 n this was primarily due to the biofilm formation in mb mbr which created the spatial heterogeneity of aerobic anoxic environment for nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria nonetheless a higher performance in ecmb mbr indicates a more effective denitrification mechanism with the presence of electric current the tp removal increased from 20 4 11 3 in mbr to 99 0 0 9 in ecmb mbr fig 2d removal of tp in the mbr was primarily due to bio assimilation and membrane filtration particulate p electrochemical precipitation has been identified as a principal mechanism responsible for the high tp removal in an embr wei et al 2009 this process involves the chemical reaction between iron ions and phosphate ions po4 3 in a reactor the dissociated fe3 from anode reacts with oh generated from cathode to form iron hydroxide fe oh 3 which has a large specific surface area and is able to adsorb po4 3 rapidly from the mixed liquor bayramoglu et al 2004 meanwhile free fe3 is able to react with po4 3 through direct contact and precipitate in the form of fepo4 fig 2e provided direct evidence on the abovementioned hypothesis with the fe concentration in effluent of ecmb mbr of 0 75 0 48 mg l much higher than that observed in mbr effluent i e 0 22 0 10 mg l these processes ultimately enhanced the removal of tp in the ecmb mbr approximately 16 of tp removal increment was obtained in mb mbr compared with the mbr control this was possibly due to the enhanced biological phosphorous induced by the conductive media hence the improvement of tp removal in an ecmb mbr was an integrated result of electrochemical precipitation and biological phosphorus removal with the former playing a primary role apart from cod and nutrient removal membrane fouling mitigation performance in the proposed ecmb mbr was evaluated via comparing the tmp variation with that in mbr and mb mbr fig 4 delayed tmp increment was identified in the ecmb mbr followed by that in mb mbr while the fastest increase in tmp was observed in the mbr the results of fouling resistance calculation revealed a 29 2 reduction of r f in ecmb mbr with the values being calculated as 2 31 1012 m 1 2 72 1012 m 1 and 3 26 1012 m 1 for ecmb mbr mb mbr and mbr respectively the mitigation of membrane fouling in ecmb mbr was comparable to or slightly higher than those have been reported previously bani melhem and elektorowicz 2011 hosseinzadeh et al 2015 suganthi et al 2013 possibly due to the combined effect of conductive media and electric current 3 2 effects of intermittent exposure time and current density on the performance of ecmb mbr the effects of intermittent exposure time and current density on treatment performance of ecmb mbr were studied by comparing the cod tn and tp removal under various operating conditions as presented in table 2 the best performance for cod and tn removal was obtained with 10 min on 10 min off mode and a current density of 15 a m2 varying degrees of decline in cod and tn removal was observed in the other tested conditions especially for tn removal at a relatively low intermittent exposure time and low current density previous studies have stated that increasing power input in embr strengthened the electrochemical oxidation and resulted in improved organic matter degradation and nitrification qian et al 2017 radha et al 2009 however the nitrogen compositions in the current study revealed that no3 n was the primary fraction influenced by modified operating parameters fig s2 compared with a relatively low intermittent exposure time 5 min on 10 min off at 15 a m2 or current density 10 min on 10 min off at 10 a m2 the optimized condition 10 min on 10 min off at 15 a m2 provided a 7 5 of increase on no3 n elimination with comparable removal of the other nitrogen fractions p 0 05 nevertheless the improvement of cod and tn removal was not observed in any further increased intermittent exposure time 10 min on 5 min off at 15 a m2 or current density 10 min on 10 min off at 20 a m2 p 0 05 one possible explanation may be that intensified fe3 dissociation and accumulation table 2 adversely affected microorganisms via inhibiting their metabolic activities philips et al 2003 demonstrated that fe3 presence in the mixed liquor reduced the oxygen uptake rate of microorganisms especially heterotrophs and nitrifying bacteria fe3 can attach to the cell membrane which interferes with oxygen and nutrient absorption by microorganisms hu et al 2004 furthermore accumulated fe3 may destroy the structure and function of proteins in cells causing a drop in biological processes and nitrification performance clark et al 2000 consistent with the findings in previous studies on nitrate removal in drinking water using electrochemical process park et al 2005 zhao et al 2011 over elevated intermittent exposure time or current density did not improve no3 n reduction the excessive generation of oxygen due to increased power input may inhibit the denitrification process constant tp removal was obtained regardless of the applied intermittent exposure time and current density according to hossain et al 2013 a longer electricity exposure time improved the removal of tp due to a higher amount of fe3 released into the mixed liquor guo et al 2020 reported that current density positively affected the removal of tp whereas insignificant difference in tp removal was identified among the examined operating parameters in this study p 0 05 indicating a sufficient fe3 supply from the iron electrode under the tested conditions a rough comparison between the lowest fe3 generation rate 2 g d among tested conditions and tp influent rate 0 2 g d also supports our inference although with varied operating parameters the similar power inputs table 2 between the test pair of 5 min on 10 min off at 15 a m2 and 10 min on 10 min off at 10 a m2 as well as the test pair of 10 min on 5 min off at 15 a m2 and 10 min on 10 min off at 20 a m2 may explain their comparable performance respectively hence power input is probably a critical parameter to control the treatment performance especially for tn removal in ecmb mbr nonetheless varied design on these two parameters may differentially influence the microbial community and function during a long term application despite the same power input further research is necessary to clarify the possible impact on microorganisms with long term operation and observation 3 3 interactions between electric current and conductive media for enhanced performance in ecmb mbr in addition to the microbiological oxidation and membrane filtration processes in a conventional submerged mbr remarkable tn and tp removal together with effective membrane fouling control was simultaneously obtained in the proposed ecmb mbr system through the interactions between electric current and floating conductive media fig 5 the moving bed composed of conductive media was assumed to increase the conductivity in the mixed liquor between the two electrodes hence reducing the energy consumption for triggering electrochemical reactions khandegar and saroha 2013 this hypothesis was supported as depicted in fig 7a which demonstrates that the resistivity of mixed liquor decreased with an increasing packing density of the conductive media approximately 21 of resistivity reduction was obtained with a packing density of 0 20 v v indicating a potential energy saving of around 21 in the studied ecmb mbr future studies can be conducted with increased packing density of conductive media to further reduce energy consumption in the system the significant enhancement of no3 n reduction in the ecmb mbr was attributed to the integration of electric current and conductive media from a macro perspective electrochemical assisted reduction induced by adding electric current was able to generate temporal heterogeneity of the redox potential in the system meanwhile the presence of conductive media increased the spatial heterogeneity of redox potential in the reactor enhanced denitrification due to the introduced temporal and spatial heterogeneity was revealed through the difference in effluent no3 n fractions between ecmb mbr 5 2 and mbr 29 5 as shown in fig 3 two potential denitrification mechanisms were behind this result fig 6 the first mechanism involves the direct electrochemical reduction of no3 n with enhanced electron transportation applying electric current potentially promoted denitrification by providing electrons from anode oxidation furthermore conductive media acted as secondary electron providers and encouraged the electron conduction in the reactor these produced electrons could be in situ electron donors for no3 n reduction resulting in enhanced denitrification in ecmb mbr fig 7 b illustrates that applying electric current intermittently caused significant fluctuation in the bulk orp the observed bulk orp dropped to 145 mv with a current density at 15 a m2 and raised to 43 mv in the absence of an electric field hence an alternative oxidizing and reducing environment was generated in the mixed liquor the reduced orp facilitated the electrochemical reduction of no3 n subsequently generating no2 n and n2 this electrochemical reduction of no3 n has been previously demonstrated and applied especially in nitrate rich surface water and groundwater treatment processes guo et al 2020 koparal and öğütveren 2002 however the observed bulk orp was slightly higher than the theoretical value 250 mv to widely promote denitrification karanasios et al 2010 this mechanism may occur locally in the reactor where a highly reducing environment was induced e g the area surrounding the anode and conductive media the second mechanism involves electrochemically enhanced autotrophic denitrification with the presence of electric current hydrogen was produced from electrolysis of water around the cathode electrode the generated hydrogen molecules can be utilized as electron donors by autotrophic denitrifying bacteria instead of carbon sources to complete the denitrification process fig 7c illustrates that hydrogenophilaceae was detected at a relative abundance up to 10 3 only in ecmb mbr providing a direct support of our hypothesis according to xing et al 2017 hydrogenophilaceae is a family of autotrophic denitrifying bacteria that uses hydrogen as electron donors similar electrochemically assisted autotrophic denitrification has been applied and reported in bio electrochemical reactors for the treatment of drinking water and groundwater biswas and bose 2005 sunger and bose 2009 membrane fouling mitigation was achieved through a hybrid mechanism combining mechanical scouring of membrane surface and electrochemical decomposition of suspended organic foulants mechanical scouring was carried out by the floating conductive media moreover the media probably acted as a pre filter to capture some of the fouling substances in mixed liquor before they deposited on the membrane surface johir et al 2011 according to fig 4 16 6 of r f reduction was observed in mb mbr compared with mbr resulting in a slower rise in tmp while reduction in eps was not observed in the mb mbr fig 7d on the other hand 28 8 of eps reduction was observed in the ecmb mbr particularly the fraction of beps which was responsible for a further reduced r f at 15 1 compared with mb mbr fig 4 several studies have revealed that eps has a strong impact on membrane fouling through pore blocking and deposition wang et al 2009 out of the total eps beps proteins are considered the main components leading to organic membrane fouling li et al 2019 the results of the eps analysis fig 7d proved the efficiency of electric current on membrane fouling mitigation through various potential mechanisms such as electrochemical degradation electrochemical precipitation and electrophoresis ibeid et al 2015 overall the introduction of conductive media and electric current in an ecmb mbr induced multiple interactions well diversified the processes occurring in the reactor and improved the energy efficiency that drove these processes fig 5 in particular the performance on nutrient removal was significantly improved surpassing most of the currently reported biological processes that have been applied for decentralized wastewater treatment bajpai et al 2019 3 4 preliminary estimation of additional operating cost of ecmb mbr the operating cost in an electrochemical assisted mbr was one of the major concerns that restricts its wide application in wastewater treatment ghosh et al 2011 an estimation of the additional operating cost induced by electricity and electrode consumption in an ecmb mbr was carried out to fill the information gap regarding this newly proposed technology though cost estimation was based on data collected from the operation of a laboratory scale testing system valuable reference was able to be provided for future study on the feasibility of the technology in particular electricity consumption for driving the electrochemical reactions and electrode material consumption for generating free fe3 were considered in the preliminary cost analysis the electrode consumption was estimated based on the weight loss of the anode during the operation weight loss of electrodes is a combined result of oxidation and corrosion when applying an electric current ghosh et al 2011 in the current study we observed comparable electrode consumption in the reactor with the calculated rate based on eq 3 suggesting an efficient utilization of the electrode material in the system table 2 shows that energy and electrode consumption proportionally related to the amount of power input to obtain the best cod tn and tp removal the energy and electrode consumption of 0 778 kwh m3 and 0 035 kg m3 respectively were needed these required an additional operating cost of approximately 0 081 usd m3 in which 95 accounted for energy consumption according to lo et al 2015 and verrecht et al 2012 the operating cost of small scale mbrs with treatment capacity between 25 m3 d and 2 500 m3 d could vary from 0 56 usd m3 to 0 27 usd m3 the results demonstrate that ecmb mbr can significantly upgrade the effluent quality with a slight cost increase by approximately 10 30 it is worth noting that this additional operating cost may be overestimated since it was calculated based on a laboratory scale reactor further applicability assessment should be carried out through process scale up in the future 4 conclusions an ecmb mbr incorporating a submerged mbr electrochemical processes and conductive media was proposed as a single step technology for decentralized wastewater treatment the simultaneous cod tn and tp removal at the selected operating condition 10 min on 10 min off at 15 a m2 reached 97 1 1 4 88 8 4 2 and 99 0 0 9 respectively significantly surpassing the performance observed in a compared mbr in addition improved membrane fouling mitigation was noted with a fouling resistance reduction up to 29 2 in the tested ecmb mbr the enhanced performance of ecmb mbr was attributed to the effective interactions between the conductive media and electric current this study demonstrated that approximately 21 of energy consumption was saved by adding conductive media at a packing density of 0 20 v v in the reactor a hybrid process composed of both direct electrochemical no3 n reduction and electrochemical enhanced autotrophic denitrification accounted for the additional 24 of tn removal observed in the ecmb mbr furthermore integrated mechanical scouring and electrochemical decomposition of eps derived from conductive media and electric current respectively was responsible for the fouling mitigation in the ecmb mbr a preliminary cost analysis revealed that 0 081 usd m3 of additional operating cost was needed for the ecmb mbr which accounted for approximately 10 30 of the typical operating cost in a small scale mbr accounting for its remarkable performance and relatively low energy cost the ecmb mbr is recommended as a high efficiency one step system especially for decentralized domestic

17446,in aquatic environments the ecological risks posed by metals are greatly affected by water chemistry thereby creating challenges for water quality management biotic ligand models blms have become the most widely used tools to interpret and predict water chemistry effects traditional blm development methods require a large number of toxicity tests and organisms and model predictions are limited to certain toxicity statistics e g 48 h median effective concentration 48 h ec50 to which the models were calibrated to address these limitations we propose a new method to develop blms by integrating them into the toxicokinetic toxicodynamic tk td framework metal bioaccumulation was predicted from metal exposure and water chemistry using the blm type toxicokinetics whilst metal toxicity was predicted from metal bioaccumulation using the toxicodynamics using the new method we developed a kinetic blm of cadmium for daphnia magna with only six toxicity tests and 1540 daphnids this represents a 60 80 reduction compared to the traditional methods the model was validated in the presence of commercial dissolved organic matter dom and in natural waters sampled from 12 lakes the kinetic blm was able to accurately simulate the protective effects of the commercial dom by employing the stockholm humic model whilst the complexation capabilities of some natural dom were overestimated we further used the model to predict cd ec50 and no effect concentrations for different waters generating predictions close to the effect concentrations reported in the literature overall our method requires fewer resources and presents an easier approach to develop blms the kinetic blm is more flexible and can serve as a useful tool for developing water quality criteria graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biotic ligand model water quality criteria toxicokinetics toxicodynamics cadmium 1 introduction metals are usually present in trace amounts in natural waters although their concentrations may be easily elevated as a result of human activities thereby harming aquatic life luoma and rainbow 2008 metal toxicity is dependent on the metal concentrations and on water chemistry adams et al 2020 currently the effects of water chemistry on metal bioavailability and toxicity are best modeled by biotic ligand models blms mebane et al 2020 paquin et al 2002 biotic ligands bls are hypothetical sensitive sites on the surface of an organism the binding of active metal species mainly free metal ions at these sites results in toxicity di toro et al 2001 slaveykova and wilkinson 2005 metal toxicity may be alleviated by dual effects 1 the complexation of aqueous ligands e g cl hco3 and dissolved organic matter reduces the concentration of free metal ions and 2 the competition from co existing major cations e g ca2 mg2 na k and h reduces metal binding on bls the complexation effects may be readily modeled using well established thermodynamic speciation programs such as visual minteq mineql windermere humic aqueous model wham and phreeqc however the competition effects involve interactions between cations including metal ions and bls which vary among organism species essentially developing a blm is to quantify the competition effects which necessitates the derivation of stability constants for the metal bl and cation bl complexes blm stability constants may be derived using several different methods slaveykova and wilkinson 2005 among these methods estimating blm parameters from toxicity tests de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 is the most relevant method to establish the water quality criteria niyogi and wood 2004 which has been designed to protect aquatic life from the toxicity of contaminants using this traditional method multiple toxicity tests typically 4 to 7 are required to estimate each stability constant clifford and mcgeer 2010 de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 this implies that large scale toxicity testing should be conducted simultaneously using a large number of test organisms this may pose logistic challenges and hamper the application of blms in the derivation of the water quality criteria which requires a toxicity database for a wide variety of species moreover predictions from traditional blms are limited to certain toxicity statistics e g median effective concentration ec50 and exposure time e g 48 h to which the model parameters have been calibrated in traditional blms toxicity is directly linked to constant exposure for a specified time as such if the exposure is unstable or if the exposure time is not the specified length the blm becomes inapplicable some of these limitations have been addressed by two notable endeavors that extended blms for time variable toxicity hatano and shoji 2010 meyer et al 2007 hatano and shoji 2010 used an empirical equation to model the temporal decrease in f 50 i e the fraction of occupied bl associated with 50 mortality and ec50 whilst meyer et al 2007 used a one compartment uptake depuration model to calculate the metal concentration ec50 required to reach c l 50 metal concentration at the site of action resulting in 50 mortality by employing different exposure times these modifications add flexibility to traditional blms thereby enabling them to predict ec50 for different exposure times however these extended blms were still limited to predicting the 50 effect concentrations this study aims to provide a new method to develop blms using substantially fewer toxicity tests and organisms and to eliminate the limitations of specified exposure time specified percentage of organism response and constant exposure concentration in blms specifically we integrate blm with a toxicokinetic toxicodynamic tk td framework ashauer and escher 2010 jager et al 2011 wang and tan 2019 thereby kinetically relating toxicity to metal bioaccumulation toxicodynamics and metal bioaccumulation to metal exposure and water chemistry toxicokinetics we developed the kinetic blm for cd and the freshwater microcrustacean daphnia magna validated the model in the presence of dissolved organic matter dom in natural waters we modeled ec50 values for a range of reasonable exposure times and derived the no effect concentrations necs of cd under different conditions which are essential to develop science based water quality criteria 2 materials and methods 2 1 model concept the cd uptake rate in organisms j μg g 1 h 1 is a function of dissolved cd concentration and water chemistry in the blm framework this function may be described by the michaelis menten equation see supplementary material note s1 for equation derivation which considers the competition between cd2 and major cations in binding biotic ligands slaveykova and wilkinson 2005 tan et al 2017 1 j t j max k cdbl c d 2 t 1 k cdbl c d 2 t k c i bl c i z t where j max μg g 1 h 1 is the maximum uptake rate of cd bl is the biotic ligand c i z represents competing cations including ca2 mg2 na k and h k cdbl and k c i bl l mol 1 are stability constants of cdbl and c i bl complexes respectively and cd2 t and c i z t are the free ion activity mol l 1 of cd2 and the competing cations respectively we used both units μg and mol for model application convenience μg is used in water quality management whilst mol is more useful for model calculation cd accumulation in organisms represents the balance between cd uptake and elimination and may be described as wang et al 1996 wang and tan 2019 2 d c int t d t j t k e c int t where c int t is the cd concentration in organisms μg g 1 and k e is the elimination rate constant h 1 cd toxicity is a consequence of cd bioaccumulation when accumulated cd concentrations in organisms exceeds an internal threshold c it μg g 1 the risk of mortality will be higher than the background risk h 0 h 1 the excess risk is proportional to the excessive amount of cd bioaccumulated the instantaneous risk for an individual to die namely the hazard rate d h t d t is described as jager et al 2011 wang and tan 2019 3 d h t d t k k c int t c it h 0 where h t is the hazard dimensionless and k k is the killing rate constant g μg 1 h 1 the survival probability s t of the organisms may be calculated as jager et al 2011 kleinbaum and klein 2012 wang and tan 2019 4 s t e h t taken together the four equations integrate the blm that is equation 1 into the tk td framework this integrated model is referred to as the kinetic blm equations 1 and 2 relate cd bioaccumulation to cd exposure and water chemistry toxicokinetics whilst equations 3 and 4 relate cd toxicity to cd bioaccumulation toxicodynamics therefore the blm parameters that is the k values in equation 1 may be estimated by observing the survivorship of organisms in response to varying cd and major cation concentrations see supplementary material note s2 for detailed procedures of parameter estimation 2 2 experimental design three series of cd toxicity tests were conducted on daphnia magna namely 1 tests for estimating blm parameters 2 model validation tests to investigate the complexation effects of dom and 3 model validation tests conducted in natural water sampled from 12 lakes table s1 provides an overview of the experimental design exposure media used for test series 1 and 2 were prepared by modifying the concentrations of major cations in synthetic water simplified elendt m7 medium sm7 and by adding defined concentrations of cd and dom the original composition of the sm7 medium is listed in tables s2 and s3 and the preparation of the test solution is detailed in supplementary material note s3 and tables s4 to s6 estimating blm parameters blm parameters were estimated from cation competition experiments fig 1 using a series of steps first a cd toxicity test was conducted on a gradient of six cd concentrations 0 400 μg l 1 then five toxicity tests were conducted to individually investigate the competition effects of the major cations ca2 mg2 na k and h in these five tests the cd concentration was held constant at an appropriate concentration whilst only one of the major cations was varied in each test see table s4 for details the appropriate cd concentration was selected based on the cd concentration gradient test which was 100 μg l 1 this cd concentration could cause substantial mortality of organisms within the test duration and would facilitate the observation of the protective effects of major cations complexation effects of dom two toxicity tests were conducted at 100 μg l 1 of cd in the presence of a gradient of fulvic acid suwannee river fulvic acid standard ii international humic substances society or humic acid sigma aldrich catalog no h16752 the two tests were used to investigate the complexation effects of dom on cd toxicity cd toxicity in natural waters cd toxicity tests were conducted in water samples collected from 12 natural freshwater lakes to validate the established cd blm these freshwater lakes were located near xiamen and samples were collected throughout september and october 2017 see table s7 s8 for details and figure s1 for the map water samples were filtered through a glass fiber filter gf f whatman pore size 0 7 μm and stored at 4 c in the dark prior to use exposure cd concentrations were also held constant at 100 μg l 1 2 3 toxicity testing the 48 h toxicity tests were conducted following the organization for economic co operation and development oecd guideline 202 oecd 2004 the only variation to the guideline was that daphnid immobilization was recorded more frequently a healthy culture of daphnia magna was routinely maintained in the laboratory neonate daphnids less than 24 h were used for the toxicity tests the water for culturing d magna was prepared by passing tap water through a polypropylene pleated cartridge filter and two activated carbon cartridge filters and then aerating to dechlorinate for at least 8 h the culture density was kept below 100 daphnids per liter to avoid overcrowding a mixture of two green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii and scenedesmus obliquus was fed to the daphnids daily culturing water was refreshed every 2 to 3 d culturing of the organism and toxicity tests were all conducted at the temperature of 21 1 c and with the 14 h light 10 h dark cycle three replicate beakers were used for each treatment the control for each treatment consisted of another beaker containing the same test solution without cd the exception to this was the cd concentration gradient test in which three control beakers were used fig 1 each beaker contained 10 daphnids in 100 ml of test solution prior to use polypropylene beakers were cleaned by soaking in 5 hno3 overnight and rinsing with reverse osmosis water and then with deionized water 18 2 mω cm the daphnid survivorship was recorded every 8 h daphnids that could not resume swimming within 15 s after gentle agitation were considered immobilized or dead and were removed from the test solution tests were considered valid when survivorship in all controls was no less than 90 at the beginning and end of the exposure water samples were collected from each replicate beaker and mixed into a composite sample per treatment to measure cd and major cation concentrations water samples for metal analysis were preserved by adding 10 μl of 1 1 hno3 per ml of sample similarly 30 ml water samples from each treatment were collected into amber glass vials for dissolved organic carbon doc analysis the doc samples were acidified by adding 40 μl h3po4 85 and stored at 4 c prior to analysis 2 4 chemical analysis cd and major cations i e ca2 mg2 na k concentrations were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7700x the internal standards 72ge and 115in were used to correct the sample matrix effects and the instrument drift during analysis the concentrations of dissolved anions i e cl so4 2 no3 and po4 3 were measured in filtered natural freshwater samples 0 22 μm using ion chromatography dionex ics 1100 concentrations of hco3 were calculated based on total alkalinity which was measured using an alkalinity titrator as alk 2 apollo scitech doc was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu whilst the ph of the water was measured using a ph meter orion 310p 01 2 5 data analysis activities of free cd2 and major cations were calculated using the visual minteq v3 1 software with the following settings 1 the stockholm humic model shm was used for modeling dom complexation 2 the concentration mg l 1 ratio of active dom to doc was set to 2 and 3 100 of active dom was composed of fulvic acid 4 co2 partial pressure was set to 4 10 6 atm the software openmodel v2 4 2 was used to implement the kinetic blm model and estimate the values and uncertainties of model parameters see supplementary material note s2 for detailed procedures the measured cd concentration and water chemistry parameters see table s5 s7 were used for data analysis whenever available all figures were generated using the r software v3 6 3 with the package ggplot2 3 results and discussion 3 1 estimates of blm parameters log k increasing cd concentrations decreased the survivorship of d magna fig 2 a lower organism survivorship at higher cd concentrations was attributable to the higher fraction of biotic ligands occupied by cd2 thereby leading to higher cd bioaccumulation the log k cdbl value determined the extent of variation in survivorship along the cd gradient as such k cdbl may be estimated by fitting the kinetic blm to the observed survivorship fig 1a in the cation competition experiments at fixed cd concentrations 100 μg l 1 see the measured concentrations in table s5 d magna survivorship was observed to increase with increasing cation concentrations ca2 mg2 na and k and decreasing ph equivalent to increasing h concentrations this result indicated the protective effects of the cations figs 2b e similarly the log k values for the five competing cations were estimated by fitting the kinetic blm to the five sets of observed survivorship fig 1b the estimated values of log k are listed in table 1 the log k cdbl in d magna was estimated to be 7 96 table 1 this value was one log unit higher than that reported in daphnia pulex 6 97 clifford and mcgeer 2010 although closer to those reported in several fish species table s9 including 8 6 in the fathead minnow pimephales promebs playle et al 1993 7 34 or 8 0 in the rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss niyogi et al 2004 niyogi et al 2008 and 7 20 in yellow perch perca flavescens niyogi et al 2004 the log k values reflected the affinity of the metal to bind with the bl and were positively correlated with the toxicity of metals measured in ec50 or lc50 expressed in free ion activity ardestani et al 2014 in d magna higher log k values were generally observed for more toxic metals including ag 8 88 and cu2 7 4 or 8 02 whilst lower values were observed for less toxic metals including zn2 5 31 or 5 5 and ni2 4 0 ardestani et al 2014 the log k values of competing cations with the exception of h ranged from 3 42 for na to 4 34 for ca2 table 1 our estimates were within the range of 3 to 5 as reported in previous blms of cd and other metals for various fish and daphnid species ardestani et al 2014 the log k values of na and k have been less frequently reported due to the absence of their protective effects in many cases for example no significant effects of na 0 54 1 65 mm or k 0 05 1 43 mm on cd toxicity were observed in d pulex clifford and mcgeer 2010 and no effects of na 0 06 2 20 mm were observed in terms of cd bioaccumulation in the gills of rainbow trout niyogi et al 2008 the log k values of competing cations i e ca2 mg2 na and k were approximately four log units lower than that of cd2 this implies that their concentrations need to be close to four orders of magnitude higher than those of cd2 0 5 μm to satisfy the k c i bl c i z k cdbl c d 2 condition and thus manifest substantial protective effects see equation 1 and figs 2b e we calculated the cation concentrations that were required to markedly decrease cd bioaccumulation and increase organism survivorship during the 48 h toxicity testing these calculations are presented in figure s2 when investigating the competition effects of a major cation the concentrations of other cations in the baseline medium should be as low as possible otherwise the protective effects of the cation may be masked interestingly the highest organism survivorship did not correspond with the treatments that were carried out using the highest concentrations of mg2 3 0 mm and na 14 mm similar non monotonic trends have also previously been observed for example the effects of mg2 on the cd toxicity to d pulex niyogi et al 2004 and the effects of k on the cu toxicity to d magna de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 the high concentrations of major cations did not show toxicity per se i e no daphnid mortality in the corresponding controls although they may have increased the sensitivity of daphnids to cd the underlying physiological mechanisms are currently unclear and such effects cannot be readily considered in the current blm as such caution should be applied in extrapolating the model to waters with higher cation concentrations beyond the model calibration range the log k hbl 8 79 was one log unit higher than log k cdbl as such h needed to be close to 0 1 times the concentration of cd2 i e ph 7 3 to substantially reduce cd toxicity figs 2f and s2 the measured log k hbl was significantly higher than that reported in cd blms of other organisms for example larvae of insect chaoborus punctipennis 5 7 hare and tessier 1996 d pulex 6 13 clifford and mcgeer 2010 and fathead minnow 6 7 playle et al 1993 it was also much higher than the general log k hbl range 4 3 7 6 exhibited by blms of other metals for various biological species ardestani et al 2014 the overestimation of log k hbl for the cu blm was observed if assuming cu2 to be the only toxic species due to the contribution of cuoh and cuco3 to toxicity de schamphelaere et al 2002 de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 however this potential was excluded for our cd blm this is because cd speciation was not very sensitive to variations in ph and cd2 ions were always the dominant 82 88 species across the investigated ph range figure s3 interestingly the log k hbl value of 8 79 was similar to the pk a values for the dissociation of thiol sh or amine nh3 groups in weak acids harris 2010 suggesting that the bls may be amino acid residues with thiol groups 3 2 estimates of tk td parameters in addition to the log k values which quantify the effects of water chemistry on cd bioavailability four additional parameters were required to translate the water chemistry effects to toxicity prediction two of these parameters are the tk parameters i e j max and k e to describe the bioaccumulation processes the other two parameters are the td parameters i e c it k k to measure the sensitivity of organisms the four parameters were also estimated concurrently by fitting the kinetic blm to the observed survivorships see supplementary material note s2 for detailed procedures listed in table 1 j max and k e have no counterparts in traditional blms for modeling metal toxicity they are needed in the kinetic blm as we relate toxicity to metal concentration accumulated in organisms instead of metals on bls or metal bioavailability in the exposure solution in fact j max not k e was included in the version of blms for modeling metal biouptake kola and wilkinson 2005 lavoie et al 2014 slaveykova and wilkinson 2005 metal elimination and thus k e have previously been dismissed for short term e g 1 h bio uptake experiments although they cannot be ignored for 48 h toxicity tests the two tk parameters should be measured using a bioaccumulation experiment in parallel to the toxicity tests radioactive or stable isotope tracer techniques are preferred for this purpose tan et al 2019 tan and wang 2011 however if tk is available in the literature these values may be used and optimized if necessary cd tk was previously measured for adult d magna a j max of 4 3 to 30 μg g 1 h 1 and a k e of 0 00162 h 1 have been reported tan and wang 2011 2012 in this study neonatal 24 h d magna was used for toxicity testing as such j max and k e were optimized to 3 16 μg g 1 h 1 and 0 00308 h 1 respectively after fitting the toxicity data if the tk reported in the literature was unavailable for the test organism an educated guess based on similar species may also be acceptable to initialize optimization the two td parameters in combination measure the sensitivity of organisms although from different aspects c it measures the quantity of cd organisms exhibit tolerance without showing elevated risks of mortality whilst k k measures how fast the mortality rate will increase when the threshold is exceeded ashauer and brown 2008 tan and wang 2012 the initial c it 41 0 μg g 1 and k k 0 00267 g μg 1 h 1 vales were obtained from a previous study tan and wang 2012 following optimization c it decreased to 33 5 μg g 1 whilst k k had remained unchanged empirically measured initial values were useful although not indispensable to initialize model optimization as mentioned above an educated guess was able to serve the purpose of providing the initial values in the traditional blm framework sensitivity has been measured using only one parameter that is either la50 the lethal accumulation associated with 50 mortality clifford and mcgeer 2010 santore et al 2001 or f 50 the fraction of occupied bls associated with 50 mortality de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 la50 and f 50 are counterparts of c it although they differ from c it in several ways 1 la50 or f 50 represents the metals that bind to bls on the surface of organisms whilst c it represents the metals that accumulate in organisms 2 la50 or f 50 corresponds to 50 effect concentration ec50 whereas c it corresponds to the no effect concentration nec and 3 la50 or f 50 is tied to a specific exposure duration for example 48 h for d magna clifford and mcgeer 2010 de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 whilst c it is time independent 3 3 complexation effects of dissolved organic matter to validate the kinetic blm in the presence of dom cd toxicity was observed at different fulvic acid 0 13 15 5 mg c l 1 and humic acid 0 17 17 44 mg c l 1 concentrations increasing concentrations of the fulvic and humic acids increased the survivorship of d magna as expected due to the decrease in the free cd2 concentration from 0 48 to 0 06 μm the protective effects of dom were generally well predicted by the kinetic blm figure s4 although it was overestimated at high dom levels 8 17 mg c l 1 overestimation of the protective effects of dom has also previously been reported clifford and mcgeer 2010 and was possibly due to the uncertainties that arise in the estimation of the active dom fraction dom doc ratio during the modeling of cd speciation a different dom doc ratio 1 4 was selected to model the ha complexion by assuming a lower fraction of active dom bryan et al 2002 with an improvement in fitting figure s4b 3 4 prediction of cd toxicity in natural waters the survivorship of d magna in natural freshwater lakes was predicted based on the measured water chemistry using the kinetic blm figure s5 the predicted survivorship was in good agreement with observed values for half of the 12 lakes whilst overestimation of survivorship was observed for the other lakes i e lakes 1 3 5 9 11 and 12 the most obvious overestimation occurred in lakes 1 and 3 both of which had high doc concentrations 6 7 and 6 9 mg c l 1 principal component analysis pca also showed a correlation between the overestimation in the two lakes and their high doc concentrations figure s6 as such it was speculated that overestimation was due to errors in modeling cd complexation via natural dom the complexation capability of the natural dom appeared to be lower than that of the two commercial dom of which the complexation effects were better modeled figure s4 changing the settings of the dom doc ratio from 2 0 to 1 4 as we did for the two commercial dom showed no appreciable effects in model prediction this result suggested that the dom in lake water substantially differed from the dom using which the shm model was calibrated gustafsson and berggren kleja 2005 the application of the cd blm to natural waters may underestimate the real risks if an improved understanding of the complexation effects of natural dom is lacking therefore unless the complexation effects of dom are better understood we recommend calculating cd complexation using a lower doc concentration e g 2 mg c l 1 as a temporary fix instead of the higher measured doc 3 5 calculating ec50 and no effect concentration ec50 using the kinetic blm we were able to predict the time course of the survivorship of organisms exposed to a specific cd concentration and water chemistry reversely we were able to calculate the cd concentration that causes 50 mortality after t h of exposure i e t h ec50 the exposure time t may be any reasonable duration e g 40 200 h see figure s7 and is not necessarily the same duration as that used in model calibration i e 48 h the r code for calculating ec50 is provided in the supplementary material note s4 most of the calculated 48 h ec50 values were in the range of 30 to 100 μg l 1 fig 3 a higher ec50 values were predicted for waters with higher concentrations of competing cations dom and especially lower ph these predicted ec50 values were in agreement with the 48 h ec50 values previously reported in d magna which increased with ca 0 013 5 mm from 9 to 42 μg l 1 and increased with decreasing ph 8 2 5 8 from 22 to 200 μg l 1 tan and wang 2011 similarly in daphnia pulex the 48 h cd ec50 increased with ca 0 03 1 61 mm from 17 to 155 μg l 1 and increased with the added natural dom 9 1 16 5 mg c l 1 from 79 to 114 μg l 1 clifford and mcgeer 2010 no effect concentration nec using the kinetic blm necs may also be calculated nec is defined as the maximum cd concentration that does not cause mortality of organisms except background mortality under lasting exposure in other words at dissolved cd concentrations of nec the cd concentrations accumulated in organisms should never exceed the threshold c it see equation 3 tan et al 2019 5 c int t c it under constant exposure the maximum cd concentration in organisms is reached at the steady state i e d c int t d t 0 in equation 2 and thus is 6 c int j k e therefore the nec may be calculated by determining the cd concentration that allows the following equation stand 7 c it j k e for simplicity the growth of the organisms was dismissed when calculating the steady state cd in organisms equation 6 generating lower and more conservative nec values growth may be readily accommodated if growth information is available and when necessary wang and tan 2019 the r code for calculating nec is also provided in the supplementary material most of the calculated necs ranged from 1 to 10 μg l 1 with some higher necs observed at low ph and high doc levels fig 3b deriving nec from kinetic blm calibrated with acute tests provides an alternative method to develop chronic blms chronic tests have greater relevancy in terms of establishing water quality criteria nys et al 2014 peters et al 2011 however developing chronic blms is more logistically challenging and resource intensive necs predicted using the kinetic blm were very close to those chronic cd toxicity statistics endpoint mortality in d magna that were compiled in the ecotox database i e no observed effect concentration noec of 3 to 5 μg l 1 lowest observed effect concentration loec of 1 5 to 10 μg l 1 and 7 to 25 d lc50 of 3 to 670 μg l 1 fig 3c 3 6 advantages of the kinetic blm the first advantage of the kinetic blm is that it requires fewer toxicity tests and organisms to develop using the traditional method de schamphelaere and jassen 2002 developed a cu blm using 38 tests and more than 6840 d magna clifford and mcgeer 2010 developed a cd blm using 22 tests and 3520 daphnia pulex see table s10 in comparison we developed the kinetic blm using only six tests and 1540 d magna typically to calibrate a stability constant using the traditional method four to seven tests are required clifford and mcgeer 2010 de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 but using the kinetic blm method only one toxicity predictions also benefit from the kinetic nature of the kinetic blm such as the prediction of effective concentrations with differing exposure times and fluctuating conditions in the traditional method blm parameters are calibrated with toxicity statistics such as t time ec x e g 48 h ec50 as a result model parameters representing the intrinsic sensitivity of organisms e g la50 f 50 are time specific and response specific and the model can only calculate the t h ec x i e the metal concentration that causes x response after t h exposure in contrast the kinetic blm offers greater flexibility and can predict the metal concentration that causes any responses i e 0 100 after any realistic exposure time see figs 3 s7 and r code in supplementary material note s4 the limitation of classic blms is rooted in the toxicity statistic t h ec x which directly relates the x response to metal concentration in water or on biotic ligands by specifying an arbitrary exposure time as the test condition jager 2011 in the kinetic blm exposure time itself is the independent variable model parameters thus become time and response independent for the kinetic blm stable metal concentration and water chemistry are not required for model calibration and application as for the classic blms this flexibility is especially useful for tests using larger organisms such as fish and bivalves tan et al 2019 where it is more challenging to maintain stable water chemistry in addition the kinetic blm may be applied to fluctuating concentration scenarios which are more suitable for dynamic real water bodies finally the less tangible advantage of the kinetic blm is that it is more flexible to prepare test media for model calibration to calibrate traditional blms the mathematical requirement is to vary only one major cation while maintaining all other medium constituents constant however this is practically impossible nys et al 2014 and some approximation must be adopted in the kinetic blm model parameters were estimated concurrently from multivariate non linear fitting and variations in multiple water chemistry parameters may be mathematically handled and are acceptable a detailed description of the test media preparation is provided in the supplementary material note s3 3 7 limitations and perspectives the advantage of using fewer toxicity tests to calibrate the kinetic blm may potentially compromise model robustness model parameters are more susceptible to errors in toxicity testing and as such require toxicity data of higher quality to be calibrated an interesting test of the generality of this method would be to repeat the fixed cd toxicity tests at a different concentration such as 50 µg l 1 conceptually it is likely to produce similar log k values in calibrating the kinetic blm the parameters were optimized simultaneously the potential correlation of parameters in their estimation may lead to larger uncertainties in their values figure s8 therefore it is critical that the initial parameter values are sound in extrapolating the kinetic blm to predict nec we implicitly assumed that model parameters were constant over time with the growth and development of organisms this assumption was not tested and is unlikely to be strictly true in this respect the inclusion of population demography in modeling may be considered if necessary gergs et al 2016 we implicitly assumed that there were no delayed or carry over effects and that organisms recovered instantly when the internal cd concentration dropped below the threshold value c it these assumptions could neither be proved nor disproved by the observations within this study although model predictions were in good agreement with observations if evidence suggests significant delayed or carry over toxicity particularly when applying the model to fluctuating or pulse exposure conditions ashauer et al 2010 brent and herricks 1998 td models that are able to simulate such effects e g a model assuming a slower recovery rate should be adopted ashauer and brown 2008 ashauer et al 2010 we used the stochastic death model as opposed to the individual threshold model in the td model jager et al 2011 aiming to derive the nec from the parameter c it see equations 5 7 except this there is no other scientific reason to prefer the stochastic death model over the individual threshold model which is also compatible with the kinetic blm the kinetic blm in its current form is only able to model lethal effects although the sub lethal effects e g growth and reproduction may be more ecologically relevant modeling the sub lethal effects is possible using more sophisticated tk td models ashauer et al 2011 jager et al 2014 martin et al 2019 the kinetic blm framework is flexible enough to incorporate these existing and future tk td models for further iteration and improvement and in turn derive more realistic water quality criteria for metals 4 conclusion we developed a new method to calibrate the blm this new method required only one toxicity test as opposed to 4 7 tests to estimate each log k and thus reduced the resources required e g toxicity tests organisms time and laboratory space to develop a blm by at least 60 to 80 this convenience will greatly facilitate the application of blms to a greater number of species and metal contaminants we substantially improved traditional blms by integrating the blm into the tk td framework and creating a kinetic model the kinetic blm is compatible with the traditional blms and is more flexible it is not limited to test duration e g 48 h or the toxicity statistic ec50 to which the model was calibrated and was able to predict ec x after any realistic exposure time it was able to predict a more ecologically relevant no

17446,in aquatic environments the ecological risks posed by metals are greatly affected by water chemistry thereby creating challenges for water quality management biotic ligand models blms have become the most widely used tools to interpret and predict water chemistry effects traditional blm development methods require a large number of toxicity tests and organisms and model predictions are limited to certain toxicity statistics e g 48 h median effective concentration 48 h ec50 to which the models were calibrated to address these limitations we propose a new method to develop blms by integrating them into the toxicokinetic toxicodynamic tk td framework metal bioaccumulation was predicted from metal exposure and water chemistry using the blm type toxicokinetics whilst metal toxicity was predicted from metal bioaccumulation using the toxicodynamics using the new method we developed a kinetic blm of cadmium for daphnia magna with only six toxicity tests and 1540 daphnids this represents a 60 80 reduction compared to the traditional methods the model was validated in the presence of commercial dissolved organic matter dom and in natural waters sampled from 12 lakes the kinetic blm was able to accurately simulate the protective effects of the commercial dom by employing the stockholm humic model whilst the complexation capabilities of some natural dom were overestimated we further used the model to predict cd ec50 and no effect concentrations for different waters generating predictions close to the effect concentrations reported in the literature overall our method requires fewer resources and presents an easier approach to develop blms the kinetic blm is more flexible and can serve as a useful tool for developing water quality criteria

natural waters although their concentrations may be easily elevated as a result of human activities thereby harming aquatic life luoma and rainbow 2008 metal toxicity is dependent on the metal concentrations and on water chemistry adams et al 2020 currently the effects of water chemistry on metal bioavailability and toxicity are best modeled by biotic ligand models blms mebane et al 2020 paquin et al 2002 biotic ligands bls are hypothetical sensitive sites on the surface of an organism the binding of active metal species mainly free metal ions at these sites results in toxicity di toro et al 2001 slaveykova and wilkinson 2005 metal toxicity may be alleviated by dual effects 1 the complexation of aqueous ligands e g cl hco3 and dissolved organic matter reduces the concentration of free metal ions and 2 the competition from co existing major cations e g ca2 mg2 na k and h reduces metal binding on bls the complexation effects may be readily modeled using well established thermodynamic speciation programs such as visual minteq mineql windermere humic aqueous model wham and phreeqc however the competition effects involve interactions between cations including metal ions and bls which vary among organism species essentially developing a blm is to quantify the competition effects which necessitates the derivation of stability constants for the metal bl and cation bl complexes blm stability constants may be derived using several different methods slaveykova and wilkinson 2005 among these methods estimating blm parameters from toxicity tests de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 is the most relevant method to establish the water quality criteria niyogi and wood 2004 which has been designed to protect aquatic life from the toxicity of contaminants using this traditional method multiple toxicity tests typically 4 to 7 are required to estimate each stability constant clifford and mcgeer 2010 de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 this implies that large scale toxicity testing should be conducted simultaneously using a large number of test organisms this may pose logistic challenges and hamper the application of blms in the derivation of the water quality criteria which requires a toxicity database for a wide variety of species moreover predictions from traditional blms are limited to certain toxicity statistics e g median effective concentration ec50 and exposure time e g 48 h to which the model parameters have been calibrated in traditional blms toxicity is directly linked to constant exposure for a specified time as such if the exposure is unstable or if the exposure time is not the specified length the blm becomes inapplicable some of these limitations have been addressed by two notable endeavors that extended blms for time variable toxicity hatano and shoji 2010 meyer et al 2007 hatano and shoji 2010 used an empirical equation to model the temporal decrease in f 50 i e the fraction of occupied bl associated with 50 mortality and ec50 whilst meyer et al 2007 used a one compartment uptake depuration model to calculate the metal concentration ec50 required to reach c l 50 metal concentration at the site of action resulting in 50 mortality by employing different exposure times these modifications add flexibility to traditional blms thereby enabling them to predict ec50 for different exposure times however these extended blms were still limited to predicting the 50 effect concentrations this study aims to provide a new method to develop blms using substantially fewer toxicity tests and organisms and to eliminate the limitations of specified exposure time specified percentage of organism response and constant exposure concentration in blms specifically we integrate blm with a toxicokinetic toxicodynamic tk td framework ashauer and escher 2010 jager et al 2011 wang and tan 2019 thereby kinetically relating toxicity to metal bioaccumulation toxicodynamics and metal bioaccumulation to metal exposure and water chemistry toxicokinetics we developed the kinetic blm for cd and the freshwater microcrustacean daphnia magna validated the model in the presence of dissolved organic matter dom in natural waters we modeled ec50 values for a range of reasonable exposure times and derived the no effect concentrations necs of cd under different conditions which are essential to develop science based water quality criteria 2 materials and methods 2 1 model concept the cd uptake rate in organisms j μg g 1 h 1 is a function of dissolved cd concentration and water chemistry in the blm framework this function may be described by the michaelis menten equation see supplementary material note s1 for equation derivation which considers the competition between cd2 and major cations in binding biotic ligands slaveykova and wilkinson 2005 tan et al 2017 1 j t j max k cdbl c d 2 t 1 k cdbl c d 2 t k c i bl c i z t where j max μg g 1 h 1 is the maximum uptake rate of cd bl is the biotic ligand c i z represents competing cations including ca2 mg2 na k and h k cdbl and k c i bl l mol 1 are stability constants of cdbl and c i bl complexes respectively and cd2 t and c i z t are the free ion activity mol l 1 of cd2 and the competing cations respectively we used both units μg and mol for model application convenience μg is used in water quality management whilst mol is more useful for model calculation cd accumulation in organisms represents the balance between cd uptake and elimination and may be described as wang et al 1996 wang and tan 2019 2 d c int t d t j t k e c int t where c int t is the cd concentration in organisms μg g 1 and k e is the elimination rate constant h 1 cd toxicity is a consequence of cd bioaccumulation when accumulated cd concentrations in organisms exceeds an internal threshold c it μg g 1 the risk of mortality will be higher than the background risk h 0 h 1 the excess risk is proportional to the excessive amount of cd bioaccumulated the instantaneous risk for an individual to die namely the hazard rate d h t d t is described as jager et al 2011 wang and tan 2019 3 d h t d t k k c int t c it h 0 where h t is the hazard dimensionless and k k is the killing rate constant g μg 1 h 1 the survival probability s t of the organisms may be calculated as jager et al 2011 kleinbaum and klein 2012 wang and tan 2019 4 s t e h t taken together the four equations integrate the blm that is equation 1 into the tk td framework this integrated model is referred to as the kinetic blm equations 1 and 2 relate cd bioaccumulation to cd exposure and water chemistry toxicokinetics whilst equations 3 and 4 relate cd toxicity to cd bioaccumulation toxicodynamics therefore the blm parameters that is the k values in equation 1 may be estimated by observing the survivorship of organisms in response to varying cd and major cation concentrations see supplementary material note s2 for detailed procedures of parameter estimation 2 2 experimental design three series of cd toxicity tests were conducted on daphnia magna namely 1 tests for estimating blm parameters 2 model validation tests to investigate the complexation effects of dom and 3 model validation tests conducted in natural water sampled from 12 lakes table s1 provides an overview of the experimental design exposure media used for test series 1 and 2 were prepared by modifying the concentrations of major cations in synthetic water simplified elendt m7 medium sm7 and by adding defined concentrations of cd and dom the original composition of the sm7 medium is listed in tables s2 and s3 and the preparation of the test solution is detailed in supplementary material note s3 and tables s4 to s6 estimating blm parameters blm parameters were estimated from cation competition experiments fig 1 using a series of steps first a cd toxicity test was conducted on a gradient of six cd concentrations 0 400 μg l 1 then five toxicity tests were conducted to individually investigate the competition effects of the major cations ca2 mg2 na k and h in these five tests the cd concentration was held constant at an appropriate concentration whilst only one of the major cations was varied in each test see table s4 for details the appropriate cd concentration was selected based on the cd concentration gradient test which was 100 μg l 1 this cd concentration could cause substantial mortality of organisms within the test duration and would facilitate the observation of the protective effects of major cations complexation effects of dom two toxicity tests were conducted at 100 μg l 1 of cd in the presence of a gradient of fulvic acid suwannee river fulvic acid standard ii international humic substances society or humic acid sigma aldrich catalog no h16752 the two tests were used to investigate the complexation effects of dom on cd toxicity cd toxicity in natural waters cd toxicity tests were conducted in water samples collected from 12 natural freshwater lakes to validate the established cd blm these freshwater lakes were located near xiamen and samples were collected throughout september and october 2017 see table s7 s8 for details and figure s1 for the map water samples were filtered through a glass fiber filter gf f whatman pore size 0 7 μm and stored at 4 c in the dark prior to use exposure cd concentrations were also held constant at 100 μg l 1 2 3 toxicity testing the 48 h toxicity tests were conducted following the organization for economic co operation and development oecd guideline 202 oecd 2004 the only variation to the guideline was that daphnid immobilization was recorded more frequently a healthy culture of daphnia magna was routinely maintained in the laboratory neonate daphnids less than 24 h were used for the toxicity tests the water for culturing d magna was prepared by passing tap water through a polypropylene pleated cartridge filter and two activated carbon cartridge filters and then aerating to dechlorinate for at least 8 h the culture density was kept below 100 daphnids per liter to avoid overcrowding a mixture of two green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii and scenedesmus obliquus was fed to the daphnids daily culturing water was refreshed every 2 to 3 d culturing of the organism and toxicity tests were all conducted at the temperature of 21 1 c and with the 14 h light 10 h dark cycle three replicate beakers were used for each treatment the control for each treatment consisted of another beaker containing the same test solution without cd the exception to this was the cd concentration gradient test in which three control beakers were used fig 1 each beaker contained 10 daphnids in 100 ml of test solution prior to use polypropylene beakers were cleaned by soaking in 5 hno3 overnight and rinsing with reverse osmosis water and then with deionized water 18 2 mω cm the daphnid survivorship was recorded every 8 h daphnids that could not resume swimming within 15 s after gentle agitation were considered immobilized or dead and were removed from the test solution tests were considered valid when survivorship in all controls was no less than 90 at the beginning and end of the exposure water samples were collected from each replicate beaker and mixed into a composite sample per treatment to measure cd and major cation concentrations water samples for metal analysis were preserved by adding 10 μl of 1 1 hno3 per ml of sample similarly 30 ml water samples from each treatment were collected into amber glass vials for dissolved organic carbon doc analysis the doc samples were acidified by adding 40 μl h3po4 85 and stored at 4 c prior to analysis 2 4 chemical analysis cd and major cations i e ca2 mg2 na k concentrations were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7700x the internal standards 72ge and 115in were used to correct the sample matrix effects and the instrument drift during analysis the concentrations of dissolved anions i e cl so4 2 no3 and po4 3 were measured in filtered natural freshwater samples 0 22 μm using ion chromatography dionex ics 1100 concentrations of hco3 were calculated based on total alkalinity which was measured using an alkalinity titrator as alk 2 apollo scitech doc was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu whilst the ph of the water was measured using a ph meter orion 310p 01 2 5 data analysis activities of free cd2 and major cations were calculated using the visual minteq v3 1 software with the following settings 1 the stockholm humic model shm was used for modeling dom complexation 2 the concentration mg l 1 ratio of active dom to doc was set to 2 and 3 100 of active dom was composed of fulvic acid 4 co2 partial pressure was set to 4 10 6 atm the software openmodel v2 4 2 was used to implement the kinetic blm model and estimate the values and uncertainties of model parameters see supplementary material note s2 for detailed procedures the measured cd concentration and water chemistry parameters see table s5 s7 were used for data analysis whenever available all figures were generated using the r software v3 6 3 with the package ggplot2 3 results and discussion 3 1 estimates of blm parameters log k increasing cd concentrations decreased the survivorship of d magna fig 2 a lower organism survivorship at higher cd concentrations was attributable to the higher fraction of biotic ligands occupied by cd2 thereby leading to higher cd bioaccumulation the log k cdbl value determined the extent of variation in survivorship along the cd gradient as such k cdbl may be estimated by fitting the kinetic blm to the observed survivorship fig 1a in the cation competition experiments at fixed cd concentrations 100 μg l 1 see the measured concentrations in table s5 d magna survivorship was observed to increase with increasing cation concentrations ca2 mg2 na and k and decreasing ph equivalent to increasing h concentrations this result indicated the protective effects of the cations figs 2b e similarly the log k values for the five competing cations were estimated by fitting the kinetic blm to the five sets of observed survivorship fig 1b the estimated values of log k are listed in table 1 the log k cdbl in d magna was estimated to be 7 96 table 1 this value was one log unit higher than that reported in daphnia pulex 6 97 clifford and mcgeer 2010 although closer to those reported in several fish species table s9 including 8 6 in the fathead minnow pimephales promebs playle et al 1993 7 34 or 8 0 in the rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss niyogi et al 2004 niyogi et al 2008 and 7 20 in yellow perch perca flavescens niyogi et al 2004 the log k values reflected the affinity of the metal to bind with the bl and were positively correlated with the toxicity of metals measured in ec50 or lc50 expressed in free ion activity ardestani et al 2014 in d magna higher log k values were generally observed for more toxic metals including ag 8 88 and cu2 7 4 or 8 02 whilst lower values were observed for less toxic metals including zn2 5 31 or 5 5 and ni2 4 0 ardestani et al 2014 the log k values of competing cations with the exception of h ranged from 3 42 for na to 4 34 for ca2 table 1 our estimates were within the range of 3 to 5 as reported in previous blms of cd and other metals for various fish and daphnid species ardestani et al 2014 the log k values of na and k have been less frequently reported due to the absence of their protective effects in many cases for example no significant effects of na 0 54 1 65 mm or k 0 05 1 43 mm on cd toxicity were observed in d pulex clifford and mcgeer 2010 and no effects of na 0 06 2 20 mm were observed in terms of cd bioaccumulation in the gills of rainbow trout niyogi et al 2008 the log k values of competing cations i e ca2 mg2 na and k were approximately four log units lower than that of cd2 this implies that their concentrations need to be close to four orders of magnitude higher than those of cd2 0 5 μm to satisfy the k c i bl c i z k cdbl c d 2 condition and thus manifest substantial protective effects see equation 1 and figs 2b e we calculated the cation concentrations that were required to markedly decrease cd bioaccumulation and increase organism survivorship during the 48 h toxicity testing these calculations are presented in figure s2 when investigating the competition effects of a major cation the concentrations of other cations in the baseline medium should be as low as possible otherwise the protective effects of the cation may be masked interestingly the highest organism survivorship did not correspond with the treatments that were carried out using the highest concentrations of mg2 3 0 mm and na 14 mm similar non monotonic trends have also previously been observed for example the effects of mg2 on the cd toxicity to d pulex niyogi et al 2004 and the effects of k on the cu toxicity to d magna de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 the high concentrations of major cations did not show toxicity per se i e no daphnid mortality in the corresponding controls although they may have increased the sensitivity of daphnids to cd the underlying physiological mechanisms are currently unclear and such effects cannot be readily considered in the current blm as such caution should be applied in extrapolating the model to waters with higher cation concentrations beyond the model calibration range the log k hbl 8 79 was one log unit higher than log k cdbl as such h needed to be close to 0 1 times the concentration of cd2 i e ph 7 3 to substantially reduce cd toxicity figs 2f and s2 the measured log k hbl was significantly higher than that reported in cd blms of other organisms for example larvae of insect chaoborus punctipennis 5 7 hare and tessier 1996 d pulex 6 13 clifford and mcgeer 2010 and fathead minnow 6 7 playle et al 1993 it was also much higher than the general log k hbl range 4 3 7 6 exhibited by blms of other metals for various biological species ardestani et al 2014 the overestimation of log k hbl for the cu blm was observed if assuming cu2 to be the only toxic species due to the contribution of cuoh and cuco3 to toxicity de schamphelaere et al 2002 de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 however this potential was excluded for our cd blm this is because cd speciation was not very sensitive to variations in ph and cd2 ions were always the dominant 82 88 species across the investigated ph range figure s3 interestingly the log k hbl value of 8 79 was similar to the pk a values for the dissociation of thiol sh or amine nh3 groups in weak acids harris 2010 suggesting that the bls may be amino acid residues with thiol groups 3 2 estimates of tk td parameters in addition to the log k values which quantify the effects of water chemistry on cd bioavailability four additional parameters were required to translate the water chemistry effects to toxicity prediction two of these parameters are the tk parameters i e j max and k e to describe the bioaccumulation processes the other two parameters are the td parameters i e c it k k to measure the sensitivity of organisms the four parameters were also estimated concurrently by fitting the kinetic blm to the observed survivorships see supplementary material note s2 for detailed procedures listed in table 1 j max and k e have no counterparts in traditional blms for modeling metal toxicity they are needed in the kinetic blm as we relate toxicity to metal concentration accumulated in organisms instead of metals on bls or metal bioavailability in the exposure solution in fact j max not k e was included in the version of blms for modeling metal biouptake kola and wilkinson 2005 lavoie et al 2014 slaveykova and wilkinson 2005 metal elimination and thus k e have previously been dismissed for short term e g 1 h bio uptake experiments although they cannot be ignored for 48 h toxicity tests the two tk parameters should be measured using a bioaccumulation experiment in parallel to the toxicity tests radioactive or stable isotope tracer techniques are preferred for this purpose tan et al 2019 tan and wang 2011 however if tk is available in the literature these values may be used and optimized if necessary cd tk was previously measured for adult d magna a j max of 4 3 to 30 μg g 1 h 1 and a k e of 0 00162 h 1 have been reported tan and wang 2011 2012 in this study neonatal 24 h d magna was used for toxicity testing as such j max and k e were optimized to 3 16 μg g 1 h 1 and 0 00308 h 1 respectively after fitting the toxicity data if the tk reported in the literature was unavailable for the test organism an educated guess based on similar species may also be acceptable to initialize optimization the two td parameters in combination measure the sensitivity of organisms although from different aspects c it measures the quantity of cd organisms exhibit tolerance without showing elevated risks of mortality whilst k k measures how fast the mortality rate will increase when the threshold is exceeded ashauer and brown 2008 tan and wang 2012 the initial c it 41 0 μg g 1 and k k 0 00267 g μg 1 h 1 vales were obtained from a previous study tan and wang 2012 following optimization c it decreased to 33 5 μg g 1 whilst k k had remained unchanged empirically measured initial values were useful although not indispensable to initialize model optimization as mentioned above an educated guess was able to serve the purpose of providing the initial values in the traditional blm framework sensitivity has been measured using only one parameter that is either la50 the lethal accumulation associated with 50 mortality clifford and mcgeer 2010 santore et al 2001 or f 50 the fraction of occupied bls associated with 50 mortality de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 la50 and f 50 are counterparts of c it although they differ from c it in several ways 1 la50 or f 50 represents the metals that bind to bls on the surface of organisms whilst c it represents the metals that accumulate in organisms 2 la50 or f 50 corresponds to 50 effect concentration ec50 whereas c it corresponds to the no effect concentration nec and 3 la50 or f 50 is tied to a specific exposure duration for example 48 h for d magna clifford and mcgeer 2010 de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 whilst c it is time independent 3 3 complexation effects of dissolved organic matter to validate the kinetic blm in the presence of dom cd toxicity was observed at different fulvic acid 0 13 15 5 mg c l 1 and humic acid 0 17 17 44 mg c l 1 concentrations increasing concentrations of the fulvic and humic acids increased the survivorship of d magna as expected due to the decrease in the free cd2 concentration from 0 48 to 0 06 μm the protective effects of dom were generally well predicted by the kinetic blm figure s4 although it was overestimated at high dom levels 8 17 mg c l 1 overestimation of the protective effects of dom has also previously been reported clifford and mcgeer 2010 and was possibly due to the uncertainties that arise in the estimation of the active dom fraction dom doc ratio during the modeling of cd speciation a different dom doc ratio 1 4 was selected to model the ha complexion by assuming a lower fraction of active dom bryan et al 2002 with an improvement in fitting figure s4b 3 4 prediction of cd toxicity in natural waters the survivorship of d magna in natural freshwater lakes was predicted based on the measured water chemistry using the kinetic blm figure s5 the predicted survivorship was in good agreement with observed values for half of the 12 lakes whilst overestimation of survivorship was observed for the other lakes i e lakes 1 3 5 9 11 and 12 the most obvious overestimation occurred in lakes 1 and 3 both of which had high doc concentrations 6 7 and 6 9 mg c l 1 principal component analysis pca also showed a correlation between the overestimation in the two lakes and their high doc concentrations figure s6 as such it was speculated that overestimation was due to errors in modeling cd complexation via natural dom the complexation capability of the natural dom appeared to be lower than that of the two commercial dom of which the complexation effects were better modeled figure s4 changing the settings of the dom doc ratio from 2 0 to 1 4 as we did for the two commercial dom showed no appreciable effects in model prediction this result suggested that the dom in lake water substantially differed from the dom using which the shm model was calibrated gustafsson and berggren kleja 2005 the application of the cd blm to natural waters may underestimate the real risks if an improved understanding of the complexation effects of natural dom is lacking therefore unless the complexation effects of dom are better understood we recommend calculating cd complexation using a lower doc concentration e g 2 mg c l 1 as a temporary fix instead of the higher measured doc 3 5 calculating ec50 and no effect concentration ec50 using the kinetic blm we were able to predict the time course of the survivorship of organisms exposed to a specific cd concentration and water chemistry reversely we were able to calculate the cd concentration that causes 50 mortality after t h of exposure i e t h ec50 the exposure time t may be any reasonable duration e g 40 200 h see figure s7 and is not necessarily the same duration as that used in model calibration i e 48 h the r code for calculating ec50 is provided in the supplementary material note s4 most of the calculated 48 h ec50 values were in the range of 30 to 100 μg l 1 fig 3 a higher ec50 values were predicted for waters with higher concentrations of competing cations dom and especially lower ph these predicted ec50 values were in agreement with the 48 h ec50 values previously reported in d magna which increased with ca 0 013 5 mm from 9 to 42 μg l 1 and increased with decreasing ph 8 2 5 8 from 22 to 200 μg l 1 tan and wang 2011 similarly in daphnia pulex the 48 h cd ec50 increased with ca 0 03 1 61 mm from 17 to 155 μg l 1 and increased with the added natural dom 9 1 16 5 mg c l 1 from 79 to 114 μg l 1 clifford and mcgeer 2010 no effect concentration nec using the kinetic blm necs may also be calculated nec is defined as the maximum cd concentration that does not cause mortality of organisms except background mortality under lasting exposure in other words at dissolved cd concentrations of nec the cd concentrations accumulated in organisms should never exceed the threshold c it see equation 3 tan et al 2019 5 c int t c it under constant exposure the maximum cd concentration in organisms is reached at the steady state i e d c int t d t 0 in equation 2 and thus is 6 c int j k e therefore the nec may be calculated by determining the cd concentration that allows the following equation stand 7 c it j k e for simplicity the growth of the organisms was dismissed when calculating the steady state cd in organisms equation 6 generating lower and more conservative nec values growth may be readily accommodated if growth information is available and when necessary wang and tan 2019 the r code for calculating nec is also provided in the supplementary material most of the calculated necs ranged from 1 to 10 μg l 1 with some higher necs observed at low ph and high doc levels fig 3b deriving nec from kinetic blm calibrated with acute tests provides an alternative method to develop chronic blms chronic tests have greater relevancy in terms of establishing water quality criteria nys et al 2014 peters et al 2011 however developing chronic blms is more logistically challenging and resource intensive necs predicted using the kinetic blm were very close to those chronic cd toxicity statistics endpoint mortality in d magna that were compiled in the ecotox database i e no observed effect concentration noec of 3 to 5 μg l 1 lowest observed effect concentration loec of 1 5 to 10 μg l 1 and 7 to 25 d lc50 of 3 to 670 μg l 1 fig 3c 3 6 advantages of the kinetic blm the first advantage of the kinetic blm is that it requires fewer toxicity tests and organisms to develop using the traditional method de schamphelaere and jassen 2002 developed a cu blm using 38 tests and more than 6840 d magna clifford and mcgeer 2010 developed a cd blm using 22 tests and 3520 daphnia pulex see table s10 in comparison we developed the kinetic blm using only six tests and 1540 d magna typically to calibrate a stability constant using the traditional method four to seven tests are required clifford and mcgeer 2010 de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 but using the kinetic blm method only one toxicity predictions also benefit from the kinetic nature of the kinetic blm such as the prediction of effective concentrations with differing exposure times and fluctuating conditions in the traditional method blm parameters are calibrated with toxicity statistics such as t time ec x e g 48 h ec50 as a result model parameters representing the intrinsic sensitivity of organisms e g la50 f 50 are time specific and response specific and the model can only calculate the t h ec x i e the metal concentration that causes x response after t h exposure in contrast the kinetic blm offers greater flexibility and can predict the metal concentration that causes any responses i e 0 100 after any realistic exposure time see figs 3 s7 and r code in supplementary material note s4 the limitation of classic blms is rooted in the toxicity statistic t h ec x which directly relates the x response to metal concentration in water or on biotic ligands by specifying an arbitrary exposure time as the test condition jager 2011 in the kinetic blm exposure time itself is the independent variable model parameters thus become time and response independent for the kinetic blm stable metal concentration and water chemistry are not required for model calibration and application as for the classic blms this flexibility is especially useful for tests using larger organisms such as fish and bivalves tan et al 2019 where it is more challenging to maintain stable water chemistry in addition the kinetic blm may be applied to fluctuating concentration scenarios which are more suitable for dynamic real water bodies finally the less tangible advantage of the kinetic blm is that it is more flexible to prepare test media for model calibration to calibrate traditional blms the mathematical requirement is to vary only one major cation while maintaining all other medium constituents constant however this is practically impossible nys et al 2014 and some approximation must be adopted in the kinetic blm model parameters were estimated concurrently from multivariate non linear fitting and variations in multiple water chemistry parameters may be mathematically handled and are acceptable a detailed description of the test media preparation is provided in the supplementary material note s3 3 7 limitations and perspectives the advantage of using fewer toxicity tests to calibrate the kinetic blm may potentially compromise model robustness model parameters are more susceptible to errors in toxicity testing and as such require toxicity data of higher quality to be calibrated an interesting test of the generality of this method would be to repeat the fixed cd toxicity tests at a different concentration such as 50 µg l 1 conceptually it is likely to produce similar log k values in calibrating the kinetic blm the parameters were optimized simultaneously the potential correlation of parameters in their estimation may lead to larger uncertainties in their values figure s8 therefore it is critical that the initial parameter values are sound in extrapolating the kinetic blm to predict nec we implicitly assumed that model parameters were constant over time with the growth and development of organisms this assumption was not tested and is unlikely to be strictly true in this respect the inclusion of population demography in modeling may be considered if necessary gergs et al 2016 we implicitly assumed that there were no delayed or carry over effects and that organisms recovered instantly when the internal cd concentration dropped below the threshold value c it these assumptions could neither be proved nor disproved by the observations within this study although model predictions were in good agreement with observations if evidence suggests significant delayed or carry over toxicity particularly when applying the model to fluctuating or pulse exposure conditions ashauer et al 2010 brent and herricks 1998 td models that are able to simulate such effects e g a model assuming a slower recovery rate should be adopted ashauer and brown 2008 ashauer et al 2010 we used the stochastic death model as opposed to the individual threshold model in the td model jager et al 2011 aiming to derive the nec from the parameter c it see equations 5 7 except this there is no other scientific reason to prefer the stochastic death model over the individual threshold model which is also compatible with the kinetic blm the kinetic blm in its current form is only able to model lethal effects although the sub lethal effects e g growth and reproduction may be more ecologically relevant modeling the sub lethal effects is possible using more sophisticated tk td models ashauer et al 2011 jager et al 2014 martin et al 2019 the kinetic blm framework is flexible enough to incorporate these existing and future tk td models for further iteration and improvement and in turn derive more realistic water quality criteria for metals 4 conclusion we developed a new method to calibrate the blm this new method required only one toxicity test as opposed to 4 7 tests to estimate each log k and thus reduced the resources required e g toxicity tests organisms time and laboratory space to develop a blm by at least 60 to 80 this convenience will greatly facilitate the application of blms to a greater number of species and metal contaminants we substantially improved traditional blms by integrating the blm into the tk td framework and creating a kinetic model the kinetic blm is compatible with the traditional blms and is more flexible it is not limited to test duration e g 48 h or the toxicity statistic ec50 to which the model was calibrated and was able to predict ec x after any realistic exposure time it was able to predict a more ecologically relevant no

17447,response of microbial interactions to environmental perturbations has been a central issue in wastewater treatment system however the interactions among anammox microbial community under salt perturbation is still unclear here we used random matrix theory rmt based network analysis to investigate the dynamics of networks under elevated salinity in an anammox system results showed that high salinity 20 and 30 g l nacl inhibited anammox performance salinity led to closer and more complex networks for the overall network and subnetwork of planctomycetes and proteobacteria especially under low salinity 5 g l nacl which could serve as a strategy to survive under salt perturbation planctomycetes most dominant phylum and playing crucial roles in anammox possessed higher proportion of competitive relationships 64 3 under 30 g l nacl otu 109 closely related to ignavibacterium the only network hub detected in the anammox system also had larger amount of competitive relationships 27 3 than the control 0 under 30 g l nacl similar result was found for the most abundant keystone bacteria candidatus kuenenia these increasing competitions at different taxa level could be responsible for the deterioration of nitrogen removal besides all the network topological features tended to reach the values of the original network which showed the network of microbial community could gradually adapt to the elevated salinity microbial network analysis adds a different dimension for our understanding of the response in microbial community to elevated salinity graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords elevated salinity anammox biological nitrogen removal microbial interactions molecular ecological network 1 introduction anammox is a biologically mediated process in which ammonium is oxidized to dinitrogen gas n2 with nitrite serving as electron acceptor under anaerobic condition boran et al 2011 anammox based processes have been applied to treat high strength ammonium wastewaters including industrial wastewater and sidestream wastewater they are also considered the most promising alternative for biological nitrogen removal in municipal wastewater applications due to its advantages over traditional processes such as energy conservation low sludge production and cost saving kartal et al 2010 tang et al 2011 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 some industrial wastewater from textile dyeing organic pigments and coking not only contain ammonium but also high salinity bassin et al 2012 ma et al 2012 furthermore in some coastal areas seawater is used as industrial water or domestic water to alleviate the shortage of fresh water but generate large amounts of saline municipal wastewater hurlimann and mckay 2007 therefore the treatment of high salinity sewage based on anammox process has recently drawn great interest previous study showed that anammox reactor inoculated with freshwater anammox bacteria could acclimate to salinity as high as 29 2 g l nacl while salinity up to 35 mg l nacl could cause a collapse of anammox reactor performance even after a long term stepwise acclimatization huifeng et al 2019 more studies indicated that the extent of salinity effects hinges on the feeding strategy sludge aggregation type bioreactor configuration biomass etc lin et al 2020 furthermore some studies showed that different anammox species have different physiological characteristics and exhibits different tolerance to salinity ali et al 2020 zhang and okabe 2020 for example ca kuenenia can tolerate high salinity to 30 g l while ca brocadia is inhibited severely by salinity higher than 4 g l ali et al 2020 the desirable performance of anammox process depend on the collective activities of various anammox species as well as autotrophic nitrifying bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria lawson et al 2017 these microbes in anammox bioreactor cooperate with each other and form complex networks to achieve system level function e g nitrogen removal which could not be accomplished by individual species wang et al 2019b for example lawson et al 2017 found that chlorobi affiliated bacteria could use extracellular peptide released by anammox bacteria as carbon and energy sources while converting nitrate to nitrite subsequent reports revealed that symbiotic heterotrophic bacteria could provide necessary folate and molybdopterin cofactor for anammox bacteria to benefit their activity and growth wang et al 2019b zhao et al 2018 however previous researches mainly focused on the richness and compositions of anammox microbial community and network analysis could add an important dimension to our understanding of microbial community of anammox process shi et al 2016 it is expected that the elevated salinity could disturb the microbial networks and further cause poor performance of nitrogen removal therefore understanding these interactions and their response to environmental perturbation such as elevated salinity in anammox system is crucial to develop operational strategies to resist unfavorable perturbation and boost the performance of anammox processes yu et al 2019 however our understanding of microbial interactions in anammox processes and how they react to disturbance of elevated salinity remains scant microbial cooccurrence networks have recently been used to unravel the microbe microbe relationships in complex environments such as human gut oceans soils barberan et al 2012 and activated sludge li et al 2020 it was found particularly useful to understand how microbial interactions respond to environmental perturbations banerjee et al 2019 in addition network analysis can also be used to identify putative keystone taxa which are regarded to be important to maintain the stability of ecosystem function shi et al 2016 in this study we evaluated the microbial interaction dynamics along a salinity gradient by performing rmt based network analysis deng et al 2012 faust and raes 2012 of the anammox microbial communities a clear successional dynamics of anammox bacteria network was identified to address the three questions i how does elevated salinity affect the anammox performance ii how does the network structure respond to a salinity gradient iii what are the changes of key populations over time in response to elevated salinity 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operation an uasb reactor with a working volume of 1 6 l was operated in this study the seeding sludge was taken from a long running uasb anammox reactor the entire operational period was divided into five operational phases phase a phase e according to the influent salt concentrations i e 0 5 10 20 30 g l nacl in phase a the uasb reactor was operated stably for 40 d without nacl and then the influent nacl concentration increased stepwise from 5 g l to 30 g l 5 g l in phase b 41 84 d 10 g l in phase c 85 132 d 20 g l in phase d 133 178 d and 30 g l in phase e 133 210 d dissolved oxygen do was measured every day ph nh4 n no2 n and no3 n from both influent and effluent were measured every other day mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were measured at the end of each phase the measurements of the ph nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were performed according to the standard method gilcreas 2012 the variation of ph mlss and mlvss during five phases was provided in table s1 2 2 synthetic wastewater the synthetic wastewater used in uasb reactor in mg l were as follows nh4cl 191 nano2 325 nahco3 1250 mgso4 7h2o 300 kh2po4 10 and cacl2 5 6 lotti et al 2015 strous et al 1998 the compositions of trace elements i and ⅱ were described in our previous literature and the dosage of both trace elements was 1 ml l du et al 2020 the nitrogen loading rate nlr was maintained at 0 928 kg m3 d during the operational phases influent do was maintained below 0 05 mg l by adding anhydrous na2so3 in influent tank 2 3 dna extraction and high throughput sequencing biomass samples were collected from reactor during the final eight consecutive days of each phase and a total of 40 samples from five phases were collected and then stored at 20 c for sequencing microbial dna was extracted by using a fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals america according to the manufacturer instructions pcr amplification was performed with a set of primers 338f and 806r targeting the v4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene hai et al 2014 the qiaquick pcr purification kit qiagen germany was used to purified the pcr products and about 500 ng purified pcr amplicons for each sample was send to majorbio co ltd shanghai china for high throughput sequencing using the illumina miseq platform quality filtering of raw sequences was conducted as described earlier wang et al 2017a the raw sequence of high throughput sequencing was deposited into the ncbi short read archive database bioproject id prjna658837 2 4 statistical analysis and network construction alpha diversity analysis and principal coordinate analysis pcoa were performed using the vegan package in r v 3 5 1 http www r project org to determine the effects of elevated salinity on network interactions in the microbial communities five mens were constructed using rmt based bioinformatic approach at http ieg2 ou edu mena deng et al 2016 tu et al 2015 the detail process of network construction was given by wang et al 2019a to examine the statistical significance of empirical networks a total of 100 random networks corresponding to each empirical network were built using the maslov sneppen procedure maslov and sneppen 2002 then the average and standard deviation for each index of all of the random networks were obtained a standard t test was applied to determine the significance of network topology indexes between the empirical networks and random networks the networks were graphed using cytoscape 3 6 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 process performance the nitrogen removal performance of the anammox system was investigated over 210 days fig 1 the uasb anammox system was operated for 40 days without salinity in phase a during the last 20 days of phase a the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and no2 n were stabilized at 96 97 0 70 and 95 49 1 41 and the stoichiometric ratios rs removed no2 n removed nh4 n and rp produced no3 n removed nh4 n were 1 30 0 02 and 0 27 0 04 which were close to the theoretical values of 1 32 and 0 26 strous et al 1998 indicating that the stable anammox was achieved subsequently 170 days exposure experiment was conducted to evaluate the reactor performance under elevated salinity phases b e in phase b with 5 g l nacl the effluent concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n soared steeply and then declined rapidly during 60 70 d the steep increase in the effluent concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n was probably attributed to the continued accumulation of salinity and then the system might adapt to the low salinity at the end of phase b in phases c e the removal rate of nh4 n was kept at 95 79 2 59 while the effluent no2 n concentration increased from 6 10 mg l to 19 80 mg l after 156 d and the removal efficiency of no2 n dropped to 75 34 2 63 under 30 g l nacl the production of no3 n also reduced from 15 13 1 71 mg l in phase c to 10 86 1 12 mg l in phase e indicative of lower yield of anammox reactor furthermore the ratios of rs and rp deviated from the theoretical values of phase c with 10 g l nacl and reached the lowest of 1 04 0 04 and 0 22 0 02 in the phase e with 30 g l nacl the removal efficiency of nh4 n did not decrease with the decline of the removal efficiency of no2 n which may be the phenomenon of overconsumption of ammonium due to the complexity in anammox reactor jin et al 2019 3 2 the dynamics of microbial communities in anammox reactor with the increasing of salinity the sobs indices reduced from 365 88 phase a to 283 75 phase e and the shannon indices also decreased from 3 49 phase a to 2 82 2 99 phase b e as well as the shannoneven declined from 0 59 phase a to 0 49 0 52 phase b e table s2 fig s1 which leading to the declines in microbial richness diversity and evenness along the salinity gradient the dynamics of microbial communities in anammox reactor was shown in fig s1 the three most abundant bacterial phyla were planctomycetes 29 9 46 8 proteobacteria 20 8 38 2 and chloroflexi 18 1 27 1 the relative abundance of planctomycetes increased with the salinity rising while the relative abundance of proteobacteria and chloroflexi showed opposite trend proteobacteria and chloroflexi were found to be important symbiotic organisms with anammox bacteria and their decrease maybe affect the activity growth and aggregation of anammox bacteria and lead to the deterioration of nitrogen removal at the genus level fig s1c table s3 chryseolinea cryomorphaceae vitellibacter sm1a02 and denitromonas increased at high salt conditions implying that these bacteria might be able to adapt to high salinity candidatus kuenenia was the dominant anammox bacteria 27 8 34 9 during the whole study period which was in accordance with previous study kartal et al 2006 some denitrifiers i e denitratisoma and denitromonas were detected under high salinity which might contribute to the decrease of no3 n production during phases c e at the otu level fig s1d otu 465 genus kuenenia and otu 558 genus sm1a02 were typical anammox bacteria and they gradually increased under elevated salinity 0 20 g l although otu 56 genus denitratisoma and otu 317 genus arenimonas were both denitrifying bacterium xing et al 2018 their responses to salinity were different the above results indicated that elevated salinity 0 30 g l could affect the structure and diversity of microbial community and then probably impacted the performance of anammox reactor 3 3 characteristics of the microbial networks to identify potential microbial interactions in anammox system we constructed five co occurrence networks during bacterial dynamics along a salinity gradient the overall topology indices are summarized in table s4 all these networks exhibited the common network topology properties such as scale free small world and modularity faust and raes 2012 liang et al 2016 the degrees of network connectivity distribution were fitted well with the power law model r2 from 0 645 to 0 862 displaying scale free behavior which indicated that most nodes had few connections while only fewer nodes had more connections in the networks blonder et al 2012 deng et al 2012 the average path distance gd from 3 184 to 6 634 were significantly different to those in corresponding randomized networks the average clustering coefficient were larger than those in corresponding randomized networks suggesting that these networks of anammox system microbial communities demonstrated a typical property of small world watts and strogatz 1998 also all modularity values m were significantly higher than the m values p 0 001 from their corresponding randomized networks indicative of modularity of networks these indices indicated the network structures constructed were not random and unlikely to be accidental 3 4 overall network succession along a salinity gradient multiple network topological metrics showed that the five networks differed profoundly table s4 fig 2 elevated salinity stimulated the networks more connected and complex especially in the presence of 5 10 g l nacl as reflected by the increased links average degree as well as the shorter path distance despite that elevated salinity networks contained fewer otus 229 246 nodes than control 281 nodes the average degree representing the microbial interaction complexity increased from the minimum of 3 431 0 g l nacl to the maximum of 11 078 5 g l nacl and then gradually declined to 10 873 5 488 and 5 253 under 10 20 and 30 g l nacl respectively an opposite trend of average path distance was observed a smaller average path distance not only means that all nodes in the network are closer but also represents the faster exchange of information energy and substances between populations luo et al 2006a the above results indicated that salinity likely led to closer and more complex networks especially under low salinity 5 g l nacl which could serve as a strategy to survive under the stressful conditions imposed by salinity on the other hand all the network topological features tended to reach the values of the original network net a which showed the network of microbial community could gradually adapt to the elevated salinity in this study the proportion of negative edges declined from 40 0 to 3 9 and then recovered to 17 5 17 8 and 33 8 corresponding to a salinity gradient of 0 30 g l nacl in microbial network negative relationships include competition predation amensalism and so on deng et al 2016 wu et al 2016 predation and amensalism were unlikely to emerge in anammox system therefore most of the negative relationships in networks could be competition it seemed that an increasing trend in competition might be an adaptation process as the proportion of negative links gradually recovered to the original state in phase a along with the increasing of salinity in men a module was regarded as a functional unit in the bacterial community and populations within it may tend to own similar ecological niches eiler et al 2012 luo et al 2006a in our study the algorithm of fast greedy modularity optimization was used to isolate modules clauset et al 2004 newman 2004 as a result five networks generated 12 5 11 8 and 10 modules with 5 nodes with m values of 0 739 0 292 0 323 0 587 and 0 594 respectively under elevated salinity of 0 5 10 20 and 30 g l nacl fig 2 3 it appeared that salinity decreased the modularity especially under low salinity 5 g l nacl in addition similar to the overall network structure modules became smaller containing fewer modules and nodes and more connected under salt environment for example net b under 5 g l nacl had the smallest number of modules but a relatively large number of connected links fig 3 table s5 in addition the majority of the nodes in five networks were derived from 13 phyla but their distribution among different phyla varied greatly fig 4 among them proteobacteria and chloroflexi were more dominant followed by actinobacteria and planctomycetes for most phylogenetic groups the proportions of nodes were significantly different from their relative abundance among the microbial communities fig 4 fig s1 for instance planctomycetes was the most abundant bacterial phylum 29 9 46 8 in microbial communities but the percentage of nodes belonged to planctomycetes in these five networks ranked fourth accounting for 3 56 6 44 besides the largest number of the nodes in these five networks were related to proteobacteria which contained 94 69 81 87 and 85 nodes and accounted for 33 45 30 13 33 06 35 37 and 36 48 fig 4 respectively the inconsistency of relative abundance in the microbial communities and networks highlights the importance of studying the microbial interactions as they provide a crucial dimension to our understanding of microbial assemblages beyond those of simple diversity and composition 3 5 successional dynamics of subnetworks under elevated salinity to further illuminate the potential influences of the salinity gradient on the internal organization and structures of microbial mens two subnetworks consisting of the top three nodes with the highest connectivity in planctomycetes and proteobacteria were constructed respectively fig 5 the dominant population in the anammox system was planctomycetes with the addition of salinity the number of nodes increased from 23 0 g l nacl to 94 5 g l nacl and then quickly dropped to 50 25 and 37 corresponding to the salinities of 10 20 and 30 g l nacl fig 5a consistent with the number of nodes there were 25 110 99 22 and 56 links under elevated salinity it showed that lower salinities increased the size and complexity of the subnetworks among the top three nodes with the highest connectivity in five subnetworks 13 out of 15 nodes were belong to genera candidatus kuenenia candidatus brocadia and sm1a02 which were typical or potential anammox bacteria yin et al 2018 especially when exposure to 30 g l nacl the top three otus were all from candidatus kuenenia indicating candidatus kuenenia could tolerate high salinity which was consistent with previous researches meng et al 2018 wang et al 2017b the negative links proportions were 32 0 0 9 5 1 22 7 and 64 3 under salinity gradient the rapid increase of competitive relationship under 30 g l nacl may be responsible to the decline in nitrogen removal all these negative connections involved 6 1 3 5 and 23 otus corresponding to elevated salinities in planctomycetes subnetworks the information of major competing microbes was presented in table s6 among them 17 otus belonged to proteobacteria 10 otus belonged to chloroflexi and 5 otus belonged to actinobacteria only few competitive relationships between species from planctomycetes were detected proteobacteria mainly responsible for the removal of nutrients and organic matters was frequently detected to be the most abundant population in anammox wastewater treatment processes he et al 2018 jeon et al 2003 yang et al 2018 in this study the subnetworks of proteobacteria in the presence of salinity had more complex interactions and bigger size than that without salinity as there were 35 107 74 52 and 36 nodes with 38 218 172 63 and 56 links respectively especially under 5 10 g l nacl fig 5b in addition heterotrophic bacteria affiliated with the phyla chloroflexi and bacteroidetes also play a crucial role in anammox performance zhao et al 2018 and the subnetworks of chloroflexi and bacteroidetes showed similar characteristics to the subnetworks of proteobacteria fig s2 3 6 topological consistency between otus across networks there were 446 otus with at least one connection in five networks a total of 3979 edges were identified among these edges 89 9 of connections were detected only once in five networks which might be random or temporary interactions between organisms hubbell and borda de agua 2004 334 pairs of connections were found in two or more networks and 97 6 of these links were positive correlations besides 48 edges between otu pairs were identified in three or more networks table s7a which were all positive interactions consequently these interactions were unlikely to be accidental and the topological consistency between species became stronger when the same links were detected in more networks the 12 otus involved in the eight pairs identified in four or more networks are summarized in table s7b three pairs of otus otu 467 and otu 432 otu 62 and otu 467 otu 521 and otu 432 were from the phylum proteobacteria one pair of otus otu 484 and otu 547 were from the same order akyg1722 all these four pairs were positive correlations in four networks two pairs of otus otu 473 and otu 291 otu 539 and otu 300 with positive interaction were present in five networks and all of them were affiliated with the family anaerolineaceae therefore we speculated that more phylogenetically closely related otus were likely to have stronger positive interactions and phylogeny probably shaped the positive connections among species in addition most nodes from the same otus pairs were present in the same module table s7c especially under higher salinities displaying stronger association than other otus pairs 3 7 identification of keystone functional populations to assess the topological role of nodes the z p parameter plot fig 6 a were shown according to luo et al 2006b all nodes were divided into four categories peripherals module hubs connectors and network hub olesen et al 2007 considered peripherals as specialists module hubs and connectors as generalists and network hubs as super generalists here the majority of nodes 95 0 were detected as peripherals in five networks fig 6a in contrast only a small number of hubs and connectors were identified previous works have suggested that hubs and connectors may function as key species since they play disproportionately crucial roles in maintaining ecosystem stability olesen et al 2007 shi et al 2016 in this study 14 module hubs table s8 were identified in these elevated salinity networks these 14 module hubs were derived from a variety of phyla 6 belonged to chloroflexi 5 belonged to proteobacteria and others were related to planctomycetes and actinobacteria which spanned a range of richness relative abundances from 0 002 to 28 4 fig 6b among them hubs of net b presented in high abundance total relative abundance of nine hubs 48 2 and eight out of nine hubs were from two modules while hubs of other networks were from different modules and merely amounted to a very low abundance relative abundance of each hub 3 0 19 connectors were detected in all five networks table s9 47 3 connectors were proteobacteria while the others were from different taxa i e gemmatimonadetes chloroflexi acidobacteria bacteroidetes etc a majority of connectors had relatively low richness relative abundance from 0 009 to 7 8 only one taxon otu 109 acted as supergeneralist network hub was detected in net b which was closely related to ignavibacterium in addition only two organisms otu 109 and otu 547 served as generalists or super generalists in two different networks otu 109 was the network hub in net b and the connector in net e otu 547 was the connector in net a and the module hub in net c the above results suggested that the keystone taxa and networks structure were substantially dynamic in response to different salinity this was consistent with the context dependency theory that keystone taxa play important roles only under certain conditions power et al 1996 previous studies also reported that putative keystone populations were very dynamic in different conditions shi et al 2016 wang et al 2019a in addition some keystone species acted as module hubs or connectors were related to the same genera or different genera with similar functions for example otus 539 300 325 and 653 belonged to the same genus anaerolineaceae table s8 displaying the function of degradation carbohydrates and other cell tissues lei et al 2016 when otus 539 300 325 did not act as the module hubs in net c otu 653 replaced them as the module hub to maintain the stability of network structure under 10 mg l nacl therefore functional redundancy could be one of the reasons of the keystone species dynamics among different networks it is worth noticing that many putative keystone species in this study had relatively low abundances indicating that low abundance species could act as important roles in the anammox system previous studies also found that less abundant or even rare populations could act as keystone taxa in soil microbial communities manoeli et al 2014 therefore low abundance species are likely as important or even more important than the abundant taxa in maintaining the structure of microbial networks shi et al 2016 especially otu 109 related to ignavibacterium was the only network hub found in net b this is the only a few times that network hubs were identified by microbial network analysis wu et al 2016 otu 109 also represented a connector in net e and was detected in all samples indicating the importance in anammox reactor albeit it comprised only 0 6 2 1 of all sequences the network complexity of otu 109 with first neighbors was consistent with the whole networks under different conditions the subnetworks of otu 109 with its first neighbors were constructed as shown in fig 7 a there were 2 79 58 18 and 11 closest neighbors corresponding to salinity of 0 5 10 20 and 30 g l nacl respectively this might indicate that salinity promoted a tighter interaction of otu 109 to adapt to the salt environment and lower concentrations of nacl 5 10 g l was conducive to the formation of closer interactions a study showed that most characterized ignavibacterium are chemoheterotrophs with a versatile metabolism which appear to be capable of mixotrophy and also act as a denitrifier liu et al 2012 yu et al 2017 however the specific function of ignavibacterium in anammox process remains to be explored the most abundant generalist was otu 465 28 4 in net b which affiliated with candidatus kuenenia a typical anammox bacteria in sewage treatment plants fig 7b shows the subnetwork dynamic of otu 465 and its first neighbors generally the closest neighbors of otu 465 increased firstly and then decreased along the elevated salinity gradient and the maximum reached 89 neighbors under 5 g l nacl mougi and kondoh 2012 regarded that the increase of network complexity is likely to enhance the stability of a microbial community while decrease of network complexity could cause a worse stability it was speculated that the increasing network complexity of otu 465 could maintain the functional stability of anammox system under salt stress furthermore the relative abundance of otu 465 increased from 27 5 without salinity to 34 4 under 30 g l nacl suggesting the good salt tolerance of otu 465 however most negative correlations 61 1 links were found in the presence of 30 g l nacl which could be responsible to the deterioration of nitrogen removal in addition it was found that 14 out of 34 hub and connector were affiliated with proteobacteria fig 6a most of them were from the orders rhodocyclales and xanthomonadales which are known as heterotrophic denitrifiers khanongnuch et al 2019 wang et al 2019a implicating a potentially important nitrogen removal pathway in anammox reactor thus the above results suggested that the generalists i e hub and connector identified through rmt based men analysis could take responsibility for maintaining the functional stability of anammox reactor in the presence of high salinity although most hubs and connectors were not abundant in the anammox microbial communities fig 6b c it was also noted that 58 8 generalists belonged to unclassified species so it is crucial to study the uncultured keystone species to gain a better understanding of the roles of these populations in the future 4 conclusion in conclusion response of microbial network interactions to environmental perturbations has emerged as a central issue in wastewater treatment system this study focused on the impact of salinity perturbation on nitrogen removal and the successional dynamics of network interaction under elevated salinity in anammox microbial community the results showed that exposure to high salinity 20 and 30 g l nacl led to the deterioration of no2 n removal and a deviation of the theoretical values of rs and rp indicative of poor anammox performance the mens analysis revealed that salinity improved the connectivity and complexity of the networks which probably act as a strategy to adapt the disturbance of elevated salinity especially under 5 g l nacl competitive relationships were promoted among phyla of planctomycetes and proteobacteria as well as the putative keystone species of otu 109 closely related to ignavibacterium and otu 465 candidatus kuenenia which could be responsible for the deterioration of nitrogen removal under high salinity condition overall this study offered a valuable perspective in understanding of the

17447,response of microbial interactions to environmental perturbations has been a central issue in wastewater treatment system however the interactions among anammox microbial community under salt perturbation is still unclear here we used random matrix theory rmt based network analysis to investigate the dynamics of networks under elevated salinity in an anammox system results showed that high salinity 20 and 30 g l nacl inhibited anammox performance salinity led to closer and more complex networks for the overall network and subnetwork of planctomycetes and proteobacteria especially under low salinity 5 g l nacl which could serve as a strategy to survive under salt perturbation planctomycetes most dominant phylum and playing crucial roles in anammox possessed higher proportion of competitive relationships 64 3 under 30 g l nacl otu 109 closely related to ignavibacterium the only network hub detected in the anammox system also had larger amount of competitive relationships 27 3 than the control 0 under 30 g l nacl similar result was found for the most abundant keystone bacteria candidatus kuenenia these increasing competitions at different taxa level could be responsible for the deterioration of nitrogen removal besides all the network topological features tended to reach the values of the original network which showed the network of microbial community could gradually adapt to the elevated salinity microbial network analysis adds a different dimension for our understanding of the response in microbial community to elevated salinity graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords elevated salinity anammox biological nitrogen removal microbial interactions molecular ecological network 1 introduction anammox is a biologically mediated process in which ammonium is oxidized to dinitrogen gas n2 with nitrite serving as electron acceptor under anaerobic condition boran et al 2011 anammox based processes have been applied to treat high strength ammonium wastewaters including industrial wastewater and sidestream wastewater they are also considered the most promising alternative for biological nitrogen removal in municipal wastewater applications due to its advantages over traditional processes such as energy conservation low sludge production and cost saving kartal et al 2010 tang et al 2011 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 some industrial wastewater from textile dyeing organic pigments and coking not only contain ammonium but also high salinity bassin et al 2012 ma et al 2012 furthermore in some coastal areas seawater is used as industrial water or domestic water to alleviate the shortage of fresh water but generate large amounts of saline municipal wastewater hurlimann and mckay 2007 therefore the treatment of high salinity sewage based on anammox process has recently drawn great interest previous study showed that anammox reactor inoculated with freshwater anammox bacteria could acclimate to salinity as high as 29 2 g l nacl while salinity up to 35 mg l nacl could cause a collapse of anammox reactor performance even after a long term stepwise acclimatization huifeng et al 2019 more studies indicated that the extent of salinity effects hinges on the feeding strategy sludge aggregation type bioreactor configuration biomass etc lin et al 2020 furthermore some studies showed that different anammox species have different physiological characteristics and exhibits different tolerance to salinity ali et al 2020 zhang and okabe 2020 for example ca kuenenia can tolerate high salinity to 30 g l while ca brocadia is inhibited severely by salinity higher than 4 g l ali et al 2020 the desirable performance of anammox process depend on the collective activities of various anammox species as well as autotrophic nitrifying bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria lawson et al 2017 these microbes in anammox bioreactor cooperate with each other and form complex networks to achieve system level function e g nitrogen removal which could not be accomplished by individual species wang et al 2019b for example lawson et al 2017 found that chlorobi affiliated bacteria could use extracellular peptide released by anammox bacteria as carbon and energy sources while converting nitrate to nitrite subsequent reports revealed that symbiotic heterotrophic bacteria could provide necessary folate and molybdopterin cofactor for anammox bacteria to benefit their activity and growth wang et al 2019b zhao et al 2018 however previous researches mainly focused on the richness and compositions of anammox microbial community and network analysis could add an important dimension to our understanding of microbial community of anammox process shi et al 2016 it is expected that the elevated salinity could disturb the microbial networks and further cause poor performance of nitrogen removal therefore understanding these interactions and their response to environmental perturbation such as elevated salinity in anammox system is crucial to develop operational strategies to resist unfavorable perturbation and boost the performance of anammox processes yu et al 2019 however our understanding of microbial interactions in anammox processes and how they react to disturbance of elevated salinity remains scant microbial cooccurrence networks have recently been used to unravel the microbe microbe relationships in complex environments such as human gut oceans soils barberan et al 2012 and activated sludge li et al 2020 it was found particularly useful to understand how microbial interactions respond to environmental perturbations banerjee et al 2019 in addition network analysis can also be used to identify putative keystone taxa which are regarded to be important to maintain the stability of ecosystem function shi et al 2016 in this study we evaluated the microbial interaction dynamics along a salinity gradient by performing rmt based network analysis deng et al 2012 faust and raes 2012 of the anammox microbial communities a clear successional dynamics of anammox bacteria network was identified to address the three questions i how does elevated salinity affect the anammox performance ii how does the network structure respond to a salinity gradient iii what are the changes of key populations over time in response to elevated salinity 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operation an uasb reactor with a working volume of 1 6 l was operated in this study the seeding sludge was taken from a long running uasb anammox reactor the entire operational period was divided into five operational phases phase a phase e according to the influent salt concentrations i e 0 5 10 20 30 g l nacl in phase a the uasb reactor was operated stably for 40 d without nacl and then the influent nacl concentration increased stepwise from 5 g l to 30 g l 5 g l in phase b 41 84 d 10 g l in phase c 85 132 d 20 g l in phase d 133 178 d and 30 g l in phase e 133 210 d dissolved oxygen do was measured every day ph nh4 n no2 n and no3 n from both influent and effluent were measured every other day mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were measured at the end of each phase the measurements of the ph nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were performed according to the standard method gilcreas 2012 the variation of ph mlss and mlvss during five phases was provided in table s1 2 2 synthetic wastewater the synthetic wastewater used in uasb reactor in mg l were as follows nh4cl 191 nano2 325 nahco3 1250 mgso4 7h2o 300 kh2po4 10 and cacl2 5 6 lotti et al 2015 strous et al 1998 the compositions of trace elements i and ⅱ were described in our previous literature and the dosage of both trace elements was 1 ml l du et al 2020 the nitrogen loading rate nlr was maintained at 0 928 kg m3 d during the operational phases influent do was maintained below 0 05 mg l by adding anhydrous na2so3 in influent tank 2 3 dna extraction and high throughput sequencing biomass samples were collected from reactor during the final eight consecutive days of each phase and a total of 40 samples from five phases were collected and then stored at 20 c for sequencing microbial dna was extracted by using a fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals america according to the manufacturer instructions pcr amplification was performed with a set of primers 338f and 806r targeting the v4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene hai et al 2014 the qiaquick pcr purification kit qiagen germany was used to purified the pcr products and about 500 ng purified pcr amplicons for each sample was send to majorbio co ltd shanghai china for high throughput sequencing using the illumina miseq platform quality filtering of raw sequences was conducted as described earlier wang et al 2017a the raw sequence of high throughput sequencing was deposited into the ncbi short read archive database bioproject id prjna658837 2 4 statistical analysis and network construction alpha diversity analysis and principal coordinate analysis pcoa were performed using the vegan package in r v 3 5 1 http www r project org to determine the effects of elevated salinity on network interactions in the microbial communities five mens were constructed using rmt based bioinformatic approach at http ieg2 ou edu mena deng et al 2016 tu et al 2015 the detail process of network construction was given by wang et al 2019a to examine the statistical significance of empirical networks a total of 100 random networks corresponding to each empirical network were built using the maslov sneppen procedure maslov and sneppen 2002 then the average and standard deviation for each index of all of the random networks were obtained a standard t test was applied to determine the significance of network topology indexes between the empirical networks and random networks the networks were graphed using cytoscape 3 6 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 process performance the nitrogen removal performance of the anammox system was investigated over 210 days fig 1 the uasb anammox system was operated for 40 days without salinity in phase a during the last 20 days of phase a the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and no2 n were stabilized at 96 97 0 70 and 95 49 1 41 and the stoichiometric ratios rs removed no2 n removed nh4 n and rp produced no3 n removed nh4 n were 1 30 0 02 and 0 27 0 04 which were close to the theoretical values of 1 32 and 0 26 strous et al 1998 indicating that the stable anammox was achieved subsequently 170 days exposure experiment was conducted to evaluate the reactor performance under elevated salinity phases b e in phase b with 5 g l nacl the effluent concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n soared steeply and then declined rapidly during 60 70 d the steep increase in the effluent concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n was probably attributed to the continued accumulation of salinity and then the system might adapt to the low salinity at the end of phase b in phases c e the removal rate of nh4 n was kept at 95 79 2 59 while the effluent no2 n concentration increased from 6 10 mg l to 19 80 mg l after 156 d and the removal efficiency of no2 n dropped to 75 34 2 63 under 30 g l nacl the production of no3 n also reduced from 15 13 1 71 mg l in phase c to 10 86 1 12 mg l in phase e indicative of lower yield of anammox reactor furthermore the ratios of rs and rp deviated from the theoretical values of phase c with 10 g l nacl and reached the lowest of 1 04 0 04 and 0 22 0 02 in the phase e with 30 g l nacl the removal efficiency of nh4 n did not decrease with the decline of the removal efficiency of no2 n which may be the phenomenon of overconsumption of ammonium due to the complexity in anammox reactor jin et al 2019 3 2 the dynamics of microbial communities in anammox reactor with the increasing of salinity the sobs indices reduced from 365 88 phase a to 283 75 phase e and the shannon indices also decreased from 3 49 phase a to 2 82 2 99 phase b e as well as the shannoneven declined from 0 59 phase a to 0 49 0 52 phase b e table s2 fig s1 which leading to the declines in microbial richness diversity and evenness along the salinity gradient the dynamics of microbial communities in anammox reactor was shown in fig s1 the three most abundant bacterial phyla were planctomycetes 29 9 46 8 proteobacteria 20 8 38 2 and chloroflexi 18 1 27 1 the relative abundance of planctomycetes increased with the salinity rising while the relative abundance of proteobacteria and chloroflexi showed opposite trend proteobacteria and chloroflexi were found to be important symbiotic organisms with anammox bacteria and their decrease maybe affect the activity growth and aggregation of anammox bacteria and lead to the deterioration of nitrogen removal at the genus level fig s1c table s3 chryseolinea cryomorphaceae vitellibacter sm1a02 and denitromonas increased at high salt conditions implying that these bacteria might be able to adapt to high salinity candidatus kuenenia was the dominant anammox bacteria 27 8 34 9 during the whole study period which was in accordance with previous study kartal et al 2006 some denitrifiers i e denitratisoma and denitromonas were detected under high salinity which might contribute to the decrease of no3 n production during phases c e at the otu level fig s1d otu 465 genus kuenenia and otu 558 genus sm1a02 were typical anammox bacteria and they gradually increased under elevated salinity 0 20 g l although otu 56 genus denitratisoma and otu 317 genus arenimonas were both denitrifying bacterium xing et al 2018 their responses to salinity were different the above results indicated that elevated salinity 0 30 g l could affect the structure and diversity of microbial community and then probably impacted the performance of anammox reactor 3 3 characteristics of the microbial networks to identify potential microbial interactions in anammox system we constructed five co occurrence networks during bacterial dynamics along a salinity gradient the overall topology indices are summarized in table s4 all these networks exhibited the common network topology properties such as scale free small world and modularity faust and raes 2012 liang et al 2016 the degrees of network connectivity distribution were fitted well with the power law model r2 from 0 645 to 0 862 displaying scale free behavior which indicated that most nodes had few connections while only fewer nodes had more connections in the networks blonder et al 2012 deng et al 2012 the average path distance gd from 3 184 to 6 634 were significantly different to those in corresponding randomized networks the average clustering coefficient were larger than those in corresponding randomized networks suggesting that these networks of anammox system microbial communities demonstrated a typical property of small world watts and strogatz 1998 also all modularity values m were significantly higher than the m values p 0 001 from their corresponding randomized networks indicative of modularity of networks these indices indicated the network structures constructed were not random and unlikely to be accidental 3 4 overall network succession along a salinity gradient multiple network topological metrics showed that the five networks differed profoundly table s4 fig 2 elevated salinity stimulated the networks more connected and complex especially in the presence of 5 10 g l nacl as reflected by the increased links average degree as well as the shorter path distance despite that elevated salinity networks contained fewer otus 229 246 nodes than control 281 nodes the average degree representing the microbial interaction complexity increased from the minimum of 3 431 0 g l nacl to the maximum of 11 078 5 g l nacl and then gradually declined to 10 873 5 488 and 5 253 under 10 20 and 30 g l nacl respectively an opposite trend of average path distance was observed a smaller average path distance not only means that all nodes in the network are closer but also represents the faster exchange of information energy and substances between populations luo et al 2006a the above results indicated that salinity likely led to closer and more complex networks especially under low salinity 5 g l nacl which could serve as a strategy to survive under the stressful conditions imposed by salinity on the other hand all the network topological features tended to reach the values of the original network net a which showed the network of microbial community could gradually adapt to the elevated salinity in this study the proportion of negative edges declined from 40 0 to 3 9 and then recovered to 17 5 17 8 and 33 8 corresponding to a salinity gradient of 0 30 g l nacl in microbial network negative relationships include competition predation amensalism and so on deng et al 2016 wu et al 2016 predation and amensalism were unlikely to emerge in anammox system therefore most of the negative relationships in networks could be competition it seemed that an increasing trend in competition might be an adaptation process as the proportion of negative links gradually recovered to the original state in phase a along with the increasing of salinity in men a module was regarded as a functional unit in the bacterial community and populations within it may tend to own similar ecological niches eiler et al 2012 luo et al 2006a in our study the algorithm of fast greedy modularity optimization was used to isolate modules clauset et al 2004 newman 2004 as a result five networks generated 12 5 11 8 and 10 modules with 5 nodes with m values of 0 739 0 292 0 323 0 587 and 0 594 respectively under elevated salinity of 0 5 10 20 and 30 g l nacl fig 2 3 it appeared that salinity decreased the modularity especially under low salinity 5 g l nacl in addition similar to the overall network structure modules became smaller containing fewer modules and nodes and more connected under salt environment for example net b under 5 g l nacl had the smallest number of modules but a relatively large number of connected links fig 3 table s5 in addition the majority of the nodes in five networks were derived from 13 phyla but their distribution among different phyla varied greatly fig 4 among them proteobacteria and chloroflexi were more dominant followed by actinobacteria and planctomycetes for most phylogenetic groups the proportions of nodes were significantly different from their relative abundance among the microbial communities fig 4 fig s1 for instance planctomycetes was the most abundant bacterial phylum 29 9 46 8 in microbial communities but the percentage of nodes belonged to planctomycetes in these five networks ranked fourth accounting for 3 56 6 44 besides the largest number of the nodes in these five networks were related to proteobacteria which contained 94 69 81 87 and 85 nodes and accounted for 33 45 30 13 33 06 35 37 and 36 48 fig 4 respectively the inconsistency of relative abundance in the microbial communities and networks highlights the importance of studying the microbial interactions as they provide a crucial dimension to our understanding of microbial assemblages beyond those of simple diversity and composition 3 5 successional dynamics of subnetworks under elevated salinity to further illuminate the potential influences of the salinity gradient on the internal organization and structures of microbial mens two subnetworks consisting of the top three nodes with the highest connectivity in planctomycetes and proteobacteria were constructed respectively fig 5 the dominant population in the anammox system was planctomycetes with the addition of salinity the number of nodes increased from 23 0 g l nacl to 94 5 g l nacl and then quickly dropped to 50 25 and 37 corresponding to the salinities of 10 20 and 30 g l nacl fig 5a consistent with the number of nodes there were 25 110 99 22 and 56 links under elevated salinity it showed that lower salinities increased the size and complexity of the subnetworks among the top three nodes with the highest connectivity in five subnetworks 13 out of 15 nodes were belong to genera candidatus kuenenia candidatus brocadia and sm1a02 which were typical or potential anammox bacteria yin et al 2018 especially when exposure to 30 g l nacl the top three otus were all from candidatus kuenenia indicating candidatus kuenenia could tolerate high salinity which was consistent with previous researches meng et al 2018 wang et al 2017b the negative links proportions were 32 0 0 9 5 1 22 7 and 64 3 under salinity gradient the rapid increase of competitive relationship under 30 g l nacl may be responsible to the decline in nitrogen removal all these negative connections involved 6 1 3 5 and 23 otus corresponding to elevated salinities in planctomycetes subnetworks the information of major competing microbes was presented in table s6 among them 17 otus belonged to proteobacteria 10 otus belonged to chloroflexi and 5 otus belonged to actinobacteria only few competitive relationships between species from planctomycetes were detected proteobacteria mainly responsible for the removal of nutrients and organic matters was frequently detected to be the most abundant population in anammox wastewater treatment processes he et al 2018 jeon et al 2003 yang et al 2018 in this study the subnetworks of proteobacteria in the presence of salinity had more complex interactions and bigger size than that without salinity as there were 35 107 74 52 and 36 nodes with 38 218 172 63 and 56 links respectively especially under 5 10 g l nacl fig 5b in addition heterotrophic bacteria affiliated with the phyla chloroflexi and bacteroidetes also play a crucial role in anammox performance zhao et al 2018 and the subnetworks of chloroflexi and bacteroidetes showed similar characteristics to the subnetworks of proteobacteria fig s2 3 6 topological consistency between otus across networks there were 446 otus with at least one connection in five networks a total of 3979 edges were identified among these edges 89 9 of connections were detected only once in five networks which might be random or temporary interactions between organisms hubbell and borda de agua 2004 334 pairs of connections were found in two or more networks and 97 6 of these links were positive correlations besides 48 edges between otu pairs were identified in three or more networks table s7a which were all positive interactions consequently these interactions were unlikely to be accidental and the topological consistency between species became stronger when the same links were detected in more networks the 12 otus involved in the eight pairs identified in four or more networks are summarized in table s7b three pairs of otus otu 467 and otu 432 otu 62 and otu 467 otu 521 and otu 432 were from the phylum proteobacteria one pair of otus otu 484 and otu 547 were from the same order akyg1722 all these four pairs were positive correlations in four networks two pairs of otus otu 473 and otu 291 otu 539 and otu 300 with positive interaction were present in five networks and all of them were affiliated with the family anaerolineaceae therefore we speculated that more phylogenetically closely related otus were likely to have stronger positive interactions and phylogeny probably shaped the positive connections among species in addition most nodes from the same otus pairs were present in the same module table s7c especially under higher salinities displaying stronger association than other otus pairs 3 7 identification of keystone functional populations to assess the topological role of nodes the z p parameter plot fig 6 a were shown according to luo et al 2006b all nodes were divided into four categories peripherals module hubs connectors and network hub olesen et al 2007 considered peripherals as specialists module hubs and connectors as generalists and network hubs as super generalists here the majority of nodes 95 0 were detected as peripherals in five networks fig 6a in contrast only a small number of hubs and connectors were identified previous works have suggested that hubs and connectors may function as key species since they play disproportionately crucial roles in maintaining ecosystem stability olesen et al 2007 shi et al 2016 in this study 14 module hubs table s8 were identified in these elevated salinity networks these 14 module hubs were derived from a variety of phyla 6 belonged to chloroflexi 5 belonged to proteobacteria and others were related to planctomycetes and actinobacteria which spanned a range of richness relative abundances from 0 002 to 28 4 fig 6b among them hubs of net b presented in high abundance total relative abundance of nine hubs 48 2 and eight out of nine hubs were from two modules while hubs of other networks were from different modules and merely amounted to a very low abundance relative abundance of each hub 3 0 19 connectors were detected in all five networks table s9 47 3 connectors were proteobacteria while the others were from different taxa i e gemmatimonadetes chloroflexi acidobacteria bacteroidetes etc a majority of connectors had relatively low richness relative abundance from 0 009 to 7 8 only one taxon otu 109 acted as supergeneralist network hub was detected in net b which was closely related to ignavibacterium in addition only two organisms otu 109 and otu 547 served as generalists or super generalists in two different networks otu 109 was the network hub in net b and the connector in net e otu 547 was the connector in net a and the module hub in net c the above results suggested that the keystone taxa and networks structure were substantially dynamic in response to different salinity this was consistent with the context dependency theory that keystone taxa play important roles only under certain conditions power et al 1996 previous studies also reported that putative keystone populations were very dynamic in different conditions shi et al 2016 wang et al 2019a in addition some keystone species acted as module hubs or connectors were related to the same genera or different genera with similar functions for example otus 539 300 325 and 653 belonged to the same genus anaerolineaceae table s8 displaying the function of degradation carbohydrates and other cell tissues lei et al 2016 when otus 539 300 325 did not act as the module hubs in net c otu 653 replaced them as the module hub to maintain the stability of network structure under 10 mg l nacl therefore functional redundancy could be one of the reasons of the keystone species dynamics among different networks it is worth noticing that many putative keystone species in this study had relatively low abundances indicating that low abundance species could act as important roles in the anammox system previous studies also found that less abundant or even rare populations could act as keystone taxa in soil microbial communities manoeli et al 2014 therefore low abundance species are likely as important or even more important than the abundant taxa in maintaining the structure of microbial networks shi et al 2016 especially otu 109 related to ignavibacterium was the only network hub found in net b this is the only a few times that network hubs were identified by microbial network analysis wu et al 2016 otu 109 also represented a connector in net e and was detected in all samples indicating the importance in anammox reactor albeit it comprised only 0 6 2 1 of all sequences the network complexity of otu 109 with first neighbors was consistent with the whole networks under different conditions the subnetworks of otu 109 with its first neighbors were constructed as shown in fig 7 a there were 2 79 58 18 and 11 closest neighbors corresponding to salinity of 0 5 10 20 and 30 g l nacl respectively this might indicate that salinity promoted a tighter interaction of otu 109 to adapt to the salt environment and lower concentrations of nacl 5 10 g l was conducive to the formation of closer interactions a study showed that most characterized ignavibacterium are chemoheterotrophs with a versatile metabolism which appear to be capable of mixotrophy and also act as a denitrifier liu et al 2012 yu et al 2017 however the specific function of ignavibacterium in anammox process remains to be explored the most abundant generalist was otu 465 28 4 in net b which affiliated with candidatus kuenenia a typical anammox bacteria in sewage treatment plants fig 7b shows the subnetwork dynamic of otu 465 and its first neighbors generally the closest neighbors of otu 465 increased firstly and then decreased along the elevated salinity gradient and the maximum reached 89 neighbors under 5 g l nacl mougi and kondoh 2012 regarded that the increase of network complexity is likely to enhance the stability of a microbial community while decrease of network complexity could cause a worse stability it was speculated that the increasing network complexity of otu 465 could maintain the functional stability of anammox system under salt stress furthermore the relative abundance of otu 465 increased from 27 5 without salinity to 34 4 under 30 g l nacl suggesting the good salt tolerance of otu 465 however most negative correlations 61 1 links were found in the presence of 30 g l nacl which could be responsible to the deterioration of nitrogen removal in addition it was found that 14 out of 34 hub and connector were affiliated with proteobacteria fig 6a most of them were from the orders rhodocyclales and xanthomonadales which are known as heterotrophic denitrifiers khanongnuch et al 2019 wang et al 2019a implicating a potentially important nitrogen removal pathway in anammox reactor thus the above results suggested that the generalists i e hub and connector identified through rmt based men analysis could take responsibility for maintaining the functional stability of anammox reactor in the presence of high salinity although most hubs and connectors were not abundant in the anammox microbial communities fig 6b c it was also noted that 58 8 generalists belonged to unclassified species so it is crucial to study the uncultured keystone species to gain a better understanding of the roles of these populations in the future 4 conclusion in conclusion response of microbial network interactions to environmental perturbations has emerged as a central issue in wastewater treatment system this study focused on the impact of salinity perturbation on nitrogen removal and the successional dynamics of network interaction under elevated salinity in anammox microbial community the results showed that exposure to high salinity 20 and 30 g l nacl led to the deterioration of no2 n removal and a deviation of the theoretical values of rs and rp indicative of poor anammox performance the mens analysis revealed that salinity improved the connectivity and complexity of the networks which probably act as a strategy to adapt the disturbance of elevated salinity especially under 5 g l nacl competitive relationships were promoted among phyla of planctomycetes and proteobacteria as well as the putative keystone species of otu 109 closely related to ignavibacterium and otu 465 candidatus kuenenia which could be responsible for the deterioration of nitrogen removal under high salinity condition overall this study offered a valuable perspective in understanding of the

water environment management despite of their wide application in hydro chemical analysis absence of a comprehensive workflow hinders the practices and further studies the present study constructed a workflow on the application of multivariate statistical techniques in spatio seasonal hydro chemical analysis which provided a basic guidance for practices and a systematic support to future exploration selection of the methods and work paths for spatio seasonal analysis largely depends on the structure of data set and the requirements of specific tasks trial and adjustment could be repeatedly performed to optimize the analysis strategy and identify more underlying patterns given a multiscale dataset concerning complex spatio seasonal variations temporal or spatial grouping using appropriate methods to reasonably divide the complicated data set contributes to data interpretation and pattern recognition the upper yangtze river basin uyrb china was employed for case analysis to demonstrate how the workflow guides an efficient and effective data exploration efforts could be made in future works to continually improve the workflow to involve more complicated analysis and

in the sustainable development of not only the natural ecological environment but also the human social economy as they provide the main water resources for drinking agricultural industrial and recreational purposes influenced by climatic factors topographical and geological conditions anthropogenic activities as well as environmental capacity of river itself river systems demonstrate the spatio temporal complexity in hydro chemistry which brings challenges to the surface water management ouyang et al 2006 zhou et al 2007 huang et al 2010 zhao et al 2011 characterization of the spatial and seasonal water quality variation patterns is necessary for the efficient pollution control and effective aquatic environmental protection in most inland water systems and coastal areas there are always long term routine monitoring data which provides critical information about the dynamic changes of hydrology and water quality for instance in china environmental monitoring systems have been gradually established for most river basins since 1980s su et al 2011 various water quality monitoring programs have been carried out for decades and optimized continually however given a multiscale dataset concerning spatial seasonal variations and a large number of inter related hydro chemical variables it is difficult to evaluate the water environmental quality and identify the underlying influencing factors multivariate statistical techniques including correlation analysis coa hierarchical cluster analysis hca discriminant analysis da and factor analysis principal component analysis fa pca are capable of data interpretation and pattern recognition wunderlin et al 2001 singh et al 2004 consequently with the development of monitoring programs in 1990s these methods have been introduced to explore the relationship among water quality variables assist the assessment of water environment and identification of pollution sources and optimize the monitoring network and basin management vega et al 1998 in the following two decades studies on spatio seasonal hydro chemical variations using multivariate statistical techniques have been extensively carried out in rivers wunderlin et al 2001 simeonov et al 2003 singh et al 2004 ouyang et al 2006 kannel et al 2007 shrestha and kazama 2007 huang et al 2010 su et al 2011 haji gholizadeh et al 2016 river estuarine systems panda et al 2006 sundaray et al 2006 lake basins kazi et al 2009 yang et al 2010 reservoir areas zhao et al 2011 karami et al 2012 coastal waters zhou et al 2007 wu et al 2016 and groundwaters helena et al 2000 chen et al 2007 belkhiri and narany 2015 data set used for exploratory analysis was relatively simple in the beginning mainly due to the limited sampling conditions and incomplete monitoring network with the development of monitoring programs in many countries or regions the volume of data set was increased no matter in spatial coverage sampling frequency or water quality variables which also led to the diversification of data analysis while water quality assessment and spatio seasonal variation patterns recognition have been widely conducted using multivariate statistical analysis each case was unique in terms of the specific hydro chemical characteristics and database structure as a consequence data analysis and subsequent interpretation have discrepancies in different studies most practices conducted analysis subjectively or simply following a precedent without a systematic guideline absence of a comprehensive workflow causes inconvenience and confusions to the practices and further studies this study aimed to construct a workflow on the application of multivariate statistical techniques in hydro chemical analysis instead of exploring the water quality variation patterns in a specific case the primary contribution of this study is to analyze the commonalities and differences from a methodological perspective and subsequently generalize the principles of implementation to guide future applications consequently this work can be considered as a meta analysis focusing on the spatio seasonal variation patterns recognition using multivariate statistical techniques this kind of meta analysis has emerged in various fields especially for the rapidly developed and continually enriched ones which require a timely summarization sedlmair et al 2012 mcnabb and laramee 2017 since spatio seasonal hydro chemical analysis has been developing for decades a comprehensive summarization and a systematic workflow are desiderated to support future studies and practices in the following parts section 2 briefly introduced the multivariate statistical techniques and their applications in water quality assessment section 3 constructed a workflow for spatio seasonal hydro chemical analysis following which the examples from related works were used for verification in section 4 in section 5 the upper yangtze river basin uyrb china was employed as a case to demonstrate how the workflow guides an efficient and effective data exploration section 6 discussed the practical implications via an inter comparison with related works and proposed the research prospects section 7 concluded the primary findings in the present study 2 multivariate statistical techniques data set used for water environment assessment usually consists of three dimensions a temporal dimension e g water was sampled and determined monthly in most cases b spatial dimension i e a study basin always has multiple monitoring sites and c variable dimension including all the hydro chemical parameters interpretation of a large scale data set with multiple dimensions requires separation of variation trends and recognition of patterns peña araya et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b given the satisfactory capability and applicability coa hca da and fa pca are the most commonly used statistical techniques in water quality assessment and pattern recognition 2 1 coa usually coa is conducted to provide a pre perception of the interrelation between variables vega et al 1998 wang et al 2016 correlation matrices are always presented for initial recognition and to assist the further exploration ouyang et al 2006 kannel et al 2007 2 2 hca cluster analysis an unsupervised pattern recognition technique specializes in revealing the intrinsic correlation or similarity between objects vega et al 1998 zhou et al 2007 zhao et al 2011 hca is the most commonly used clustering method which groups the objects using inter sample distance as the measurement of similarity wunderlin et al 2001 singh et al 2004 li et al 2019 when conducting hca sampling times or sites were always considered as the grouping dependent variables while the measured parameters constituted the independent variables wunderlin et al 2001 singh et al 2004 kazi et al 2009 2 3 da in contrast to the exploratory features of hca da statistically classifies the samples into particular groups in accordance with prior knowledge of membership of objects such as temporal or spatial grouping of a sample according to its sampling time or site singh et al 2004 in some cases combination of hca and da was adopted to similarity exploration and pattern recognition temporal or spatial grouping results from hca were used as the prerequisite classification for da while da was conducted to verify the rationality of clustering and identify the parameters that were significant for temporal or spatial variations singh et al 2004 kannel et al 2007 shrestha and kazama 2007 zhou et al 2007 yang et al 2010 karami et al 2012 stepwise mode for da has been shown to conduct reasonably correct assignation using less discriminant parameters compared to standard mode 2 4 fa pca fa pca is a powerful technique to reduce the dimensionality of data set concerning a large number of inter related variables with minimum loss of original information helena et al 2000 singh et al 2004 it attempts to explain the variance by a small number of orthogonal principal components pcs following that rotation transformation was performed to produce a new set of pcs called varifactors vfs which can provide more meaningful interpretation of underlying correlation with less overlap involving original variables vega et al 1998 ouyang et al 2006 usually each component extracted by fa pca would be ascribed to a latent pollution source to further conduct quantitative source apportionment absolute principal component score with multivariate linear regression apcs mlr a robust receptor model could be used to estimate the contribution of each pollution component extracted by fa pca simeonov et al 2003 zhou et al 2007 huang et al 2010 su et al 2011 karami et al 2012 haji gholizadeh et al 2016 3 workflow of spatio seasonal analysis based on the above techniques data preparation grouping and analysis are three primary procedures to perform spatio seasonal hydro chemical analysis this section generalized the rationales of these procedures and the related methods following which a workflow was constructed to provide a practical guidance 3 1 data preparation data preparation starts with collection of the multivariate data set pretreatments including elimination of non informative variables treatment of missing data values and detection of outliers are generally required before further analysis 3 2 grouping when conducting spatio seasonal analysis the most significant difference is whether performing temporal spatial grouping or not before data analysis while statistical and machine learning techniques are powerful in handling huge data set they could achieve more robust results and uncover more underlying patterns when applied to reasonable subsets du et al 2017 accordingly grouping could be performed either empirically or statistically before analysis to divide the data set in temporal or spatial dimensions generally temporal dimension could be divided empirically based on local climatic and hydrological conditions while prior knowledge of geological and topographical conditions is required for spatial grouping when the necessary knowledge is unavailable statistics based grouping is alternative hca is a powerful statistical technique to perform spatial temporal grouping while other methods such as fuzzy comprehensive assessment have also been applied huang et al 2010 3 3 analysis analysis includes coa hca da and fa pca while other statistical techniques might also be used in some cases they are beyond the scope of the present study practitioners can choose one method or combine several according to their analysis purposes coa hca and fa pca can be performed either using the whole data set or the subsets extracted by grouping in contrast da could only be performed following temporal or spatial grouping which is used to verify the rationality of grouping and identify the parameters that are significant for temporal or spatial variations while hca presents as a technique both in grouping and analysis procedures it should be noted that the grouping variables are different under these two circumstances sampling times or periods are used as grouping dependent objects for hca in grouping while hca in analysis considers all the data points as grouping objects this could be illustrated by the case analysis in figs 3 and 5 respectively fa pca is performed either using the whole data set or corresponding to spatio seasonal grouping to identify the latent pollution sources and explore the interrelation between variables apcs mlr could be jointly used to quantify the contribution of each pollution source identified by fa pca 3 4 workflow diagram based on the methods and procedures generalized above a workflow diagram was proposed to demonstrate how to conduct spatio seasonal analysis with multivariate statistical techniques fig 1 accordingly this workflow consists of three basic modules data preparation grouping and analysis paths between elements represent the possible work flows while the width of each path implies the frequency of usage calculated from 20 representative examples table 1 when grouping is inappropriate or unnecessary analysis could be directly conducted following data preparation paths d1 d2 d3 otherwise grouping is performed on temporal path a1 or spatial path a2 dimensions via either experience based paths b1 b3 or statistics based paths b2 b4 methods temporal grouping and spatial grouping could be performed either in parallel or serially with path b0 based on the subsets extracted by grouping analysis is conducted to explore the spatio seasonal variation patterns via paths c1 c8 e using this workflow practitioners and researchers can combine the paths according to the features of data set and specific requirements of tasks 4 verification with examples in this section 20 representative examples table 1 covering the spatio seasonal hydro chemical analysis in river systems river estuarine systems reservoir areas lake basins coastal areas and groundwaters were used to verify the rationality of workflow construction 4 1 combining work paths for the early study on pisuerga river spain vega et al 1998 conducted data analysis using the whole data set without grouping due to the relatively limited sampling sites and frequencies similarly analysis concerning groundwater was mostly conducted with the whole data set helena et al 2000 belkhiri and narany 2015 since the groundwater data was sampled by limited surveys instead of regular monitoring in river systems for the subsequent studies data grouping has been gradually adopted with the growing volume of data set simeonov et al 2003 kazi et al 2009 and wu et al 2016 employed hca to divide the sampling sites into different clusters reflecting varying physicochemical characteristics and pollution levels wunderlin et al 2001 and singh et al 2004 performed data grouping both in spatial and temporal dimensions and kannel et al 2007 performed spatial grouping with statistics based method following which da was used to verify the rationality of these groupings however for these six cases data dimensionality reduction was still performed on the whole data set with further extension of sampling periods and regions data analysis was performed based on temporal spatial grouping ouyang et al 2006 sundaray et al 2006 and haji gholizadeh et al 2016 divided the data set in temporal dimension empirically and then conducted fa pca on each temporal subset for the study on qiantang river china huang et al 2010 and su et al 2011 divided the study area into several zones using statistics and experience based methods respectively and then performed fa pca on each spatial subset meanwhile coa was performed by ouyang et al 2006 on the temporal subsets to identify the seasonal effect hca was employed by sundaray et al 2006 to explore the relationships among data samples and da was used by su et al 2011 to extract the parameters that significantly contributed to spatial differences apcs mlr was used for pollutant source apportionment in the studies conducted by huang et al 2010 su et al 2011 and haji gholizadeh et al 2016 the remaining examples grouped the data set both in temporal and spatial dimensions shrestha and kazama 2007 performed temporal and spatial groupings using experience and statistics based methods respectively on the data collected from fuji river basin japan for the studies on lake dianchi china and coastal water of eastern hong kong china hca was employed for data grouping both in temporal and spatial dimensions zhou et al 2007 yang et al 2010 while da was used to identify the influencing factors for both spatial and seasonal variations data dimensionality reduction using fa pca was always performed on either spatial or seasonal subsets different from the above cases temporal grouping and spatial grouping could also be performed serially in the case of mahanadi river india panda et al 2006 divided the sampling periods empirically into pre monsoon and monsoon seasons and then further divided each subset into river area and estuarine area according to the sampling locations following that data exploration was conducted via hca and fa pca zhao et al 2011 performed spatial grouping in the three gorges area china via hca and then further divided each subset in temporal dimension following which fa pca was used for data exploration for the study on latyan dam basin iran karami et al 2012 took each calendar month as a temporal group and conducted spatial grouping via hca for each month da fa pca and apcs mlr were performed on the subsets for pollution source apportionment 4 2 spatio seasonal grouping summarized from the above examples temporal dimension was usually divided empirically into four seasons ouyang et al 2006 shrestha and kazama 2007 wet and dry seasons wunderlin et al 2001 haji gholizadeh et al 2016 or monsoon and non monsoon seasons singh et al 2004 panda et al 2006 sundaray et al 2006 in some cases temporal grouping was performed statistically e g zhao et al 2011 divided 12 months by hca into low flow oct feb normal flow mar may and high flow jun sep periods however using the whole monitoring data set for hca the grouping results were not only determined by hydrological conditions but also affected by water pollution characteristics zhou et al 2007 on the contrary statistics based grouping mostly via hca was more commonly used for spatial division simeonov et al 2003 singh et al 2004 kannel et al 2007 shrestha and kazama 2007 zhou et al 2007 kazi et al 2009 yang et al 2010 zhao et al 2011 karami et al 2012 wu et al 2016 which can provide reasonable information about spatial difference of physicochemical characteristics and pollution levels with prior knowledge of geological and topographical conditions spatial dimension could also be divided empirically i e wunderlin et al 2001 categorized the sampling sites into high basin middle basin lower basin and dam area su et al 2011 employed functional zoning assigned by the local environmental protection bureau for spatial grouping which also increased the practicability of analysis results for water environmental management in sum selection of methods and work paths for spatio seasonal analysis depends on the volume of data set the availability of prior knowledge and the requirements of specific tasks which would be discussed in detail below 5 case analysis of uyrb in this section uyrb was used as a case to illustrate how to apply the workflow in spatio seasonal hydro chemical analysis 5 1 study area and data collection uyrb plays a vital role in drinking water supply agricultural irrigation hydropower generation fishery industry shipping transportation and ecological landscape in china it originates from the central tibetan plateau and extends approximately 4500 km with a steep slope to the three gorge reservoir tgr in yichang city hubei province fig 2 it covers a drainage basin of about 1 million km2 comprising of five watersheds and sequentially flowing through different provinces autonomous region and municipality due to the large expanse associated with various terrains and administrative regions climatic conditions and anthropogenic activities in uyrb are extremely complex resulting in significant spatial and seasonal variations of hydro chemistry identifying the variation patterns and their influencing factors is essential for the sustainable development of the whole river basin or even nationally twelve sampling sites were selected in the study area fig 2 ht and xjb stations locate in the jinsha river the upper stretch of uyrb hj station locates in the hengjiang river a tributary flowing into the yangtze river main stream at the right bank downstream from xjb station the jialing river a large tributary of uyrb have three sampling sites in total namely ws bb and ljm stations ldx and wl stations locate in the qujiang river and the wujiang river respectively there are four stations located in the yangtze river main stream defined as the main channel beginning with the confluence of min river which possesses significantly increased flow volume due to the inflow of min river tuo river etc zt and ct stations locate upstream and downstream from the confluence with the jialing river respectively qxc station locates within the influencing area of tgr while wx station locates in the vital area of tgr hydro chemistry of the study area was determined monthly in 2010 water was sampled more than three times at each sampling site and analyzed by yangtze river upstream water environment monitoring center twenty parameters were measured which can be classified into six categories a physical parameters including water stage flow rate water temperature dissolved oxygen do and conductivity b general chemical parameters including ph chloride sulfate suspended solids ss and hardness c heavy metals including iron copper and lead d toxicity indicators typically fluoride e microbial indicators typically fecal coliforms fcoli f eutrophication indicators including total nitrogen tn nitrate nitrogen nn total phosphorus tp permanganate index codmn and 5 day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 5 2 exploratory analysis after data preparation the whole data set could be analyzed in accordance with paths d1 d2 d3 to provide a global perception following that data analysis with grouping was performed to evaluate the necessity of grouping and explore more underlying patterns comparison of the analysis results with and without grouping would be discussed in detail afterwards 5 2 1 grouping given the desirable integrity of data set and prior knowledge about study area both experience and statistics based groupings are theoretically feasible in our case in uyrb wet season starts from may to october annually and dry season is from november to the following april accordingly the alternative dry wet seasons were adopted as empirical grouping in temporal dimension paths a1 b1 hca was performed as the statistical method for grouping temporal hca of the whole data set produced a dendrogram grouping the 12 months into two clusters at dlink dmax 0 6 fig 3 a paths a1 b2 the first cluster consisted of jul sep which might imply a high flow period zhao et al 2011 and the remaining months were grouped into the second cluster as for spatial dimension empirical grouping was performed according to the locations of sampling sites in main stream or tributaries four sites located in the main stream zt ct qxc and wx were grouped into the first cluster while the others constituted the second one paths a2 b3 spatial hca generated a dendrogram grouping the 12 sampling sites into three clusters at dlink dmax 0 6 fig 3b paths a2 b4 ht and xjb stations which located in the jinsha river were grouped into the first cluster the second cluster consisted of ws bb ldx and hj and the remaining sites constituted the third one 5 2 2 da since both experience and statistics based groupings are theoretically feasible the next question is how to select the preferable one stepwise da was performed to evaluate the above groupings and identify the parameters that were significant for these seasonal and spatial variations paths c1 c5 for the dry wet season scenario da produced a classification matrix cm with about 96 correct assignments table 3 using only three discriminant variables temperature sulfate and hardness table 2 for the seasonal classification determined by hca da produced a cm with 98 correct assignments but using five more discriminant variables ph chloride fe cu and tn water stage flow rate temperature hardness chloride ss and bod5 were discriminated as significantly contributing to the hydro chemical differences between main stream and tributaries with a 99 correct assignment similarly nine parameters were discriminated as statistically significant to the spatial variations determined by hca with a 97 correct assignment accordingly experience based methods seemed to be more efficient in variable extraction for both seasonal and spatial dimensions without loss of valuable information 5 2 3 coa coa was conducted using the whole data set path d1 to explore the interrelation between the 20 hydro chemical variables however it was found that most seasonal patterns were concealed probably due to the significant spatial variations in this case coa based on the main stream tributaries grouping cannot effectively reduce this effect either consequently data collected from the 12 sampling sites were calculated respectively paths a2 b3 c2 to minimize the spatial effects table 4 shows the correlation matrix determined at zt station as a typical example and universality was observed for the other sites typical seasonal factors including water stage flow rate and temperature were closely correlated contamination parameters such as ss heavy metals tp fcoli and codmn were positively correlated to flow rate and temperature indicating that these contaminants were mainly input as non point sources accompanying with an increase of surface runoff zhao et al 2011 karami et al 2012 on the contrary mineral components including water hardness and sulfate which mainly originated from natural processes and discharged more constantly throughout the year edwards and withers 2008 zhao et al 2011 showed negative correlation with flow rate all these season related patterns cannot be identified without an appropriate grouping 5 2 4 fa pca data dimensionality reduction via fa pca using the whole data set path d3 extracted six vfs with eigenvalues higher than 1 0 accounting for 75 8 of the total variance samples were projected on the bi dimensional plane defined by the first two vfs with different colors and markers representing different sampling sites and periods respectively fig 4 a vf1 explained 19 3 of the variance positively associated with water stage chloride cu and negatively with tn nn while vf2 was positively contributed by flow rate temperature ss fe fcoli and codmn explaining 16 7 of the variance fig 4d accordingly vf1 and vf2 represented the spatial and seasonal factors respectively data clusters from different sampling sites distributed along the horizontal axis vf1 most samples from wet season typically with high flow rate temperature ss fe fcoli and codmn presented at the positive vf2 axis while dry season samples were mostly at the negative one fig 4a then fa pca using the grouped data subsets was performed to evaluate the necessity of grouping and explore more underlying patterns adopting an appropriate grouping aspect for fa pca contributes to an effective pattern recognition in our case 12 sampling sites represent different geographically controlling points and show distinct clustering under dimensionality reduction fig 4a fa pca based on the main stream tributaries grouping might conceal some patterns at specific sites in contrast observations from different seasons were distinguished under dimensionality reduction therefore data determined in dry and wet seasons were dimensionality reduced via fa pca separately to perform the trial with seasonal grouping paths a1 b1 c4 six vfs were extracted for the data set from each season similarly vf1 can be interpreted as spatial factor for both situations however the positive correlation between water stage and ss fe could only be determined in dry season fig 4e indicating that there were some particular sources of ss and fe associating with the spatial positions this pattern was concealed with wet season fig 4f or whole year fig 4d analysis due to the effect of significant hydrological variations demonstrating that temporal grouping helped to identify more variation patterns under dimensionality reduction for this reason samples from wet season distributed dispersedly on the projected plane fig 4c in contrast sample projections for dry season showed more recognizable patterns fig 4b reflecting the distinct hydro chemical characteristics among different sampling sites 5 2 5 hca similar to coa and fa pca hca on the whole data set path d2 was also found to conceal some similarities between samples besides a dendrogram showing the clustering of 144 samples was less visualized for pattern exploration accordingly hca was performed based on the dry wet season grouping paths a1 b1 c3 for dry season sample clustering reflected significant spatial effect fig 5 a samples from ht and xjb stations were grouped as a cluster separately from the other samples at dlink dmax 0 6 due to the distinct hydrological conditions and less human interference in upstream area samples determined in the main stream zt ct qxc and wx presented a considerable similarity in hydro chemistry samples from ws bb and ldx stations were grouped together resulted from the close positions and similar influence of anthropogenic activities therefore environmental capacity relative up down stream location and anthropogenic activities all contributed to the spatial variations of hydro chemistry in river systems for wet season spatial effect was less distinct compared to dry season due to the effect of significant hydrological variations ht and xjb samples were still grouped together while the samples from main stream determined in high flow period also showed significant similarity with ht and xjb samples fig 5b 6 practical implications and research prospects following workflow construction example verification and case analysis this section proposed some practical implications via an inter comparison and discussed the research prospects 6 1 selection of work paths drawn from the case analysis in section 5 a wise selection of work paths requires a certain level of awareness and familiarity with the data set trial and adjustment could be repeatedly performed to determine the optimal combination of work paths and explore more underlying patterns path b0 was excluded in our case analysis from the beginning while the serial temporal spatial grouping could be conducive to the interpretation of the data sets with a large volume in temporal and or spatial dimensions zhao et al 2011 karami et al 2012 it would be underemployed to be applied to a one year data set with 12 sampling sits indeed it would probably fail to identify the most important patterns using the fragmented subsets given the robust performance in pollutant source identification fa pca was the most frequently used technique in spatio seasonal water quality analysis while grouping could be performed in both dimensions to explore the seasonal and spatial similarity of observations usually data dimensionality reduction only needs to be conducted on either spatial or seasonal subsets for the study on eastern hong kong china zhou et al 2007 monthly monitoring of hydro chemistry was carried out at 27 sites in the coastal area for 5 years dimensionality reduction performed on two spatial subsets divided by hca helped to explore respective pollution sources and identify the factors accounting for this spatial difference similar data sets and related processing can also be found in the studies concerning fuji river basin japan shrestha and kazama 2007 and lake dianchi china yang et al 2010 in contrast one year data was employed in our case to minimize the influence caused by the significant inter year variations in uyrb the 12 sampling sites represented geographically controlling points and involved distinct hydro chemical characteristics to be explored given the data set features and analysis purposes fa pca was performed based on dry wet seasonal grouping instead of experience based spatial grouping in future study which extends this analysis to a multi year data set fa pca can be performed on spatial subsets e g each tributary or each sampling site to explore the temporal trend of hydro chemistry and the most likely evaluate the effects of pollution control or other human interventions under this circumstance serial temporal spatial grouping using path b0 could also be helpful for pattern exploration given the above analysis adopting an appropriate grouping aspect for fa pca contributes to an effective pattern recognition however in some cases involving more complicated information or specific requirement dimensionality reduction could be performed considering both spatial and seasonal groupings for example when analyzing the water quality in a constructed wetland purification system li et al 2015 conducted fa pca on seasonal subsets spring summer and autumn and spatial subsets four functional zones respectively to explore the spatio seasonal variations accordingly selection of the work paths for spatio seasonal analysis largely depends on the structure of data set and the requirements of specific tasks based on the construction of this workflow some paths and their combinations which are logically available but have been seldomly used could be identified for example there is no practice associated with paths c6 c7 among the examples discussed above under some circumstances where prior knowledge is absent for empirical grouping statistics based grouping could be employed to identify the global differences between subsets following which hca and coa can be used to explore the detailed variation patterns within each subset besides in grouping module there are more than 10 ways of combining paths to perform serial temporal spatial grouping to meet different analysis demands this offered the possibility and guidance for some difficult analysis tasks with limited information or peculiar requirements 6 2 feasibility of grouping similar to work path selection feasibility of grouping is also associated with data set features and analysis tasks when the sampling sites frequencies are limited analysis using the whole data set without grouping would be more appropriate for data interpretation as the cases in early study vega et al 1998 or concerning groundwater helena et al 2000 belkhiri and narany 2015 despite of the considerable volume of data set for the study on manchar lake pakistan kazi et al 2009 dimensionality reduction and factor extraction showed a high efficiency without grouping as only three vfs were extracted and vf1 accounted for 78 6 of the total variance this might be because that the lake area was relatively small compared to river basins or coastal area and consequently the hydrogeological conditions were more similar and human activities in lakesides were less complex indeed the number of pollution sources identified using fa pca was not only influenced by the scale of data set used for calculation but also determined by the actual pollution levels and complexity of variations with the extension of study region and seasonal complexity grouping before analysis contributes to identify more spatio seasonal variation patterns e g in our case and improve the efficiency of dimensionality reduction via fa pca as the study on mahanadi river estuarine system india panda et al 2006 given various ways of data grouping e g temporally or spatially as discussed in section 6 1 empirically or statistically as the examples shown in section 4 2 and the exploratory analysis in section 5 2 the confronting question is how to determine the preferable one even for a certain statistics based seasonal grouping the optimal number of groups is remained to be determined accordingly wunderlin et al 2001 and zhou et al 2007 employed da to determine the preferable number of groups divided via hca trial and error method was also used to determine the best grouping of sampling sites wunderlin et al 2001 yu et al 2015 as for our case experience based spatial grouping could be performed in several ways such as the locations in main stream or tributaries within the influencing area of tgr or not even each sampling site can be considered as an individual group as discussed in section 5 2 spatial variation patterns of hydro chemistry were influenced by several natural or anthropogenic factors an inappropriate artificial classification might conceal some critical patterns to be explored similarly selection of the basis for grouping depends on the structure of data set and requirements of analysis tasks 6 3 research prospects the present study focused on the spatial and seasonal variations of hydro chemistry however due to the global climatic changes and human interventions such as hydropower development temporal variation trend of hydro chemistry in aquatic systems is also of great concern chang 2008 wang et al 2008 su et al 2011 take uyrb for example given the huge and valuable hydro energy uyrb is typical of hydropower cascade development with tens of reservoirs either in operation or under construction these human interventions significantly influenced the hydro chemical characteristics the workflow we proposed could be extended to involve temporal trend analysis as well as the integrated application of more techniques such as geographic information systems zhou et al 2007 remote sensing karami et al 2012 and isotope ratio analysis huang et al 2015 in future study while the present study aimed to explore the hydro chemical variations in river systems the workflow we proposed is also applicable to other fields concerning spatio seasonal variation patterns and multivariate statistical techniques for example huang et al 2015 applied multivariate statistical techniques for heavy metal source apportionment in peri urban agricultural soils following the work paths of a2 b3 c4 d2 d3 in the workflow muxika et al 2007 assessed the benthic ecological status using multivariate analysis in accordance with the work flows of a2 b3 c4 nnane 2010 combined the paths of a1 b1 c4 a2 b4 d1 to explore the relationships between microbial contamination and chemo physical water quality parameters souissi et al 2000 performed multivariate analysis to identify the effects of nutrient dynamics in the bay of tunis on phyto and zooplankton distribution using the work paths of a1 b1 b0 b4 for atmospheric research amodio et al 2010 combined the paths of a2 b3 c1c4 d3 e to conduct a statistical investigation about the sources of pm2 5 in south italy in future works this workflow could be continually improved and applied to various fields furthermore with the explosion of data scale and diversification of analysis tasks visualization plays an important role in the selection and optimization of analysis methods rautenhaus et al 2018 which combines the expertise with statistical techniques through interactive mode to preferably meet varying analysis requirements especially for multivariate spatio temporal data zhang et al 2020a the workflow we constructed paves the way for the connection with visualization module in future works 7 conclusions this study proposed a workflow to guide the application of multivariate statistical techniques in spatio seasonal hydro chemical analysis which could help the practitioners in analysis method selection data interpretation and variation pattern recognition according to their data set structure and specific task requirements given a multiscale dataset concerning complex spatio seasonal variations appropriate grouping before analysis contributes to data exploration and pattern recognition hydro chemistry in uyrb was analyzed following the guidance of workflow and impressive variation patterns were identified via trials and optimizing the combination of work paths efforts could be made in future works to extend the workflow to involve inter year variation trend and more advanced analysis methods as well as to the application in various fields declaration of competing interest the

water environment management despite of their wide application in hydro chemical analysis absence of a comprehensive workflow hinders the practices and further studies the present study constructed a workflow on the application of multivariate statistical techniques in spatio seasonal hydro chemical analysis which provided a basic guidance for practices and a systematic support to future exploration selection of the methods and work paths for spatio seasonal analysis largely depends on the structure of data set and the requirements of specific tasks trial and adjustment could be repeatedly performed to optimize the analysis strategy and identify more underlying patterns given a multiscale dataset concerning complex spatio seasonal variations temporal or spatial grouping using appropriate methods to reasonably divide the complicated data set contributes to data interpretation and pattern recognition the upper yangtze river basin uyrb china was employed for case analysis to demonstrate how the workflow guides an efficient and effective data exploration efforts could be made in future works to continually improve the workflow to involve more complicated analysis and

in the sustainable development of not only the natural ecological environment but also the human social economy as they provide the main water resources for drinking agricultural industrial and recreational purposes influenced by climatic factors topographical and geological conditions anthropogenic activities as well as environmental capacity of river itself river systems demonstrate the spatio temporal complexity in hydro chemistry which brings challenges to the surface water management ouyang et al 2006 zhou et al 2007 huang et al 2010 zhao et al 2011 characterization of the spatial and seasonal water quality variation patterns is necessary for the efficient pollution control and effective aquatic environmental protection in most inland water systems and coastal areas there are always long term routine monitoring data which provides critical information about the dynamic changes of hydrology and water quality for instance in china environmental monitoring systems have been gradually established for most river basins since 1980s su et al 2011 various water quality monitoring programs have been carried out for decades and optimized continually however given a multiscale dataset concerning spatial seasonal variations and a large number of inter related hydro chemical variables it is difficult to evaluate the water environmental quality and identify the underlying influencing factors multivariate statistical techniques including correlation analysis coa hierarchical cluster analysis hca discriminant analysis da and factor analysis principal component analysis fa pca are capable of data interpretation and pattern recognition wunderlin et al 2001 singh et al 2004 consequently with the development of monitoring programs in 1990s these methods have been introduced to explore the relationship among water quality variables assist the assessment of water environment and identification of pollution sources and optimize the monitoring network and basin management vega et al 1998 in the following two decades studies on spatio seasonal hydro chemical variations using multivariate statistical techniques have been extensively carried out in rivers wunderlin et al 2001 simeonov et al 2003 singh et al 2004 ouyang et al 2006 kannel et al 2007 shrestha and kazama 2007 huang et al 2010 su et al 2011 haji gholizadeh et al 2016 river estuarine systems panda et al 2006 sundaray et al 2006 lake basins kazi et al 2009 yang et al 2010 reservoir areas zhao et al 2011 karami et al 2012 coastal waters zhou et al 2007 wu et al 2016 and groundwaters helena et al 2000 chen et al 2007 belkhiri and narany 2015 data set used for exploratory analysis was relatively simple in the beginning mainly due to the limited sampling conditions and incomplete monitoring network with the development of monitoring programs in many countries or regions the volume of data set was increased no matter in spatial coverage sampling frequency or water quality variables which also led to the diversification of data analysis while water quality assessment and spatio seasonal variation patterns recognition have been widely conducted using multivariate statistical analysis each case was unique in terms of the specific hydro chemical characteristics and database structure as a consequence data analysis and subsequent interpretation have discrepancies in different studies most practices conducted analysis subjectively or simply following a precedent without a systematic guideline absence of a comprehensive workflow causes inconvenience and confusions to the practices and further studies this study aimed to construct a workflow on the application of multivariate statistical techniques in hydro chemical analysis instead of exploring the water quality variation patterns in a specific case the primary contribution of this study is to analyze the commonalities and differences from a methodological perspective and subsequently generalize the principles of implementation to guide future applications consequently this work can be considered as a meta analysis focusing on the spatio seasonal variation patterns recognition using multivariate statistical techniques this kind of meta analysis has emerged in various fields especially for the rapidly developed and continually enriched ones which require a timely summarization sedlmair et al 2012 mcnabb and laramee 2017 since spatio seasonal hydro chemical analysis has been developing for decades a comprehensive summarization and a systematic workflow are desiderated to support future studies and practices in the following parts section 2 briefly introduced the multivariate statistical techniques and their applications in water quality assessment section 3 constructed a workflow for spatio seasonal hydro chemical analysis following which the examples from related works were used for verification in section 4 in section 5 the upper yangtze river basin uyrb china was employed as a case to demonstrate how the workflow guides an efficient and effective data exploration section 6 discussed the practical implications via an inter comparison with related works and proposed the research prospects section 7 concluded the primary findings in the present study 2 multivariate statistical techniques data set used for water environment assessment usually consists of three dimensions a temporal dimension e g water was sampled and determined monthly in most cases b spatial dimension i e a study basin always has multiple monitoring sites and c variable dimension including all the hydro chemical parameters interpretation of a large scale data set with multiple dimensions requires separation of variation trends and recognition of patterns peña araya et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b given the satisfactory capability and applicability coa hca da and fa pca are the most commonly used statistical techniques in water quality assessment and pattern recognition 2 1 coa usually coa is conducted to provide a pre perception of the interrelation between variables vega et al 1998 wang et al 2016 correlation matrices are always presented for initial recognition and to assist the further exploration ouyang et al 2006 kannel et al 2007 2 2 hca cluster analysis an unsupervised pattern recognition technique specializes in revealing the intrinsic correlation or similarity between objects vega et al 1998 zhou et al 2007 zhao et al 2011 hca is the most commonly used clustering method which groups the objects using inter sample distance as the measurement of similarity wunderlin et al 2001 singh et al 2004 li et al 2019 when conducting hca sampling times or sites were always considered as the grouping dependent variables while the measured parameters constituted the independent variables wunderlin et al 2001 singh et al 2004 kazi et al 2009 2 3 da in contrast to the exploratory features of hca da statistically classifies the samples into particular groups in accordance with prior knowledge of membership of objects such as temporal or spatial grouping of a sample according to its sampling time or site singh et al 2004 in some cases combination of hca and da was adopted to similarity exploration and pattern recognition temporal or spatial grouping results from hca were used as the prerequisite classification for da while da was conducted to verify the rationality of clustering and identify the parameters that were significant for temporal or spatial variations singh et al 2004 kannel et al 2007 shrestha and kazama 2007 zhou et al 2007 yang et al 2010 karami et al 2012 stepwise mode for da has been shown to conduct reasonably correct assignation using less discriminant parameters compared to standard mode 2 4 fa pca fa pca is a powerful technique to reduce the dimensionality of data set concerning a large number of inter related variables with minimum loss of original information helena et al 2000 singh et al 2004 it attempts to explain the variance by a small number of orthogonal principal components pcs following that rotation transformation was performed to produce a new set of pcs called varifactors vfs which can provide more meaningful interpretation of underlying correlation with less overlap involving original variables vega et al 1998 ouyang et al 2006 usually each component extracted by fa pca would be ascribed to a latent pollution source to further conduct quantitative source apportionment absolute principal component score with multivariate linear regression apcs mlr a robust receptor model could be used to estimate the contribution of each pollution component extracted by fa pca simeonov et al 2003 zhou et al 2007 huang et al 2010 su et al 2011 karami et al 2012 haji gholizadeh et al 2016 3 workflow of spatio seasonal analysis based on the above techniques data preparation grouping and analysis are three primary procedures to perform spatio seasonal hydro chemical analysis this section generalized the rationales of these procedures and the related methods following which a workflow was constructed to provide a practical guidance 3 1 data preparation data preparation starts with collection of the multivariate data set pretreatments including elimination of non informative variables treatment of missing data values and detection of outliers are generally required before further analysis 3 2 grouping when conducting spatio seasonal analysis the most significant difference is whether performing temporal spatial grouping or not before data analysis while statistical and machine learning techniques are powerful in handling huge data set they could achieve more robust results and uncover more underlying patterns when applied to reasonable subsets du et al 2017 accordingly grouping could be performed either empirically or statistically before analysis to divide the data set in temporal or spatial dimensions generally temporal dimension could be divided empirically based on local climatic and hydrological conditions while prior knowledge of geological and topographical conditions is required for spatial grouping when the necessary knowledge is unavailable statistics based grouping is alternative hca is a powerful statistical technique to perform spatial temporal grouping while other methods such as fuzzy comprehensive assessment have also been applied huang et al 2010 3 3 analysis analysis includes coa hca da and fa pca while other statistical techniques might also be used in some cases they are beyond the scope of the present study practitioners can choose one method or combine several according to their analysis purposes coa hca and fa pca can be performed either using the whole data set or the subsets extracted by grouping in contrast da could only be performed following temporal or spatial grouping which is used to verify the rationality of grouping and identify the parameters that are significant for temporal or spatial variations while hca presents as a technique both in grouping and analysis procedures it should be noted that the grouping variables are different under these two circumstances sampling times or periods are used as grouping dependent objects for hca in grouping while hca in analysis considers all the data points as grouping objects this could be illustrated by the case analysis in figs 3 and 5 respectively fa pca is performed either using the whole data set or corresponding to spatio seasonal grouping to identify the latent pollution sources and explore the interrelation between variables apcs mlr could be jointly used to quantify the contribution of each pollution source identified by fa pca 3 4 workflow diagram based on the methods and procedures generalized above a workflow diagram was proposed to demonstrate how to conduct spatio seasonal analysis with multivariate statistical techniques fig 1 accordingly this workflow consists of three basic modules data preparation grouping and analysis paths between elements represent the possible work flows while the width of each path implies the frequency of usage calculated from 20 representative examples table 1 when grouping is inappropriate or unnecessary analysis could be directly conducted following data preparation paths d1 d2 d3 otherwise grouping is performed on temporal path a1 or spatial path a2 dimensions via either experience based paths b1 b3 or statistics based paths b2 b4 methods temporal grouping and spatial grouping could be performed either in parallel or serially with path b0 based on the subsets extracted by grouping analysis is conducted to explore the spatio seasonal variation patterns via paths c1 c8 e using this workflow practitioners and researchers can combine the paths according to the features of data set and specific requirements of tasks 4 verification with examples in this section 20 representative examples table 1 covering the spatio seasonal hydro chemical analysis in river systems river estuarine systems reservoir areas lake basins coastal areas and groundwaters were used to verify the rationality of workflow construction 4 1 combining work paths for the early study on pisuerga river spain vega et al 1998 conducted data analysis using the whole data set without grouping due to the relatively limited sampling sites and frequencies similarly analysis concerning groundwater was mostly conducted with the whole data set helena et al 2000 belkhiri and narany 2015 since the groundwater data was sampled by limited surveys instead of regular monitoring in river systems for the subsequent studies data grouping has been gradually adopted with the growing volume of data set simeonov et al 2003 kazi et al 2009 and wu et al 2016 employed hca to divide the sampling sites into different clusters reflecting varying physicochemical characteristics and pollution levels wunderlin et al 2001 and singh et al 2004 performed data grouping both in spatial and temporal dimensions and kannel et al 2007 performed spatial grouping with statistics based method following which da was used to verify the rationality of these groupings however for these six cases data dimensionality reduction was still performed on the whole data set with further extension of sampling periods and regions data analysis was performed based on temporal spatial grouping ouyang et al 2006 sundaray et al 2006 and haji gholizadeh et al 2016 divided the data set in temporal dimension empirically and then conducted fa pca on each temporal subset for the study on qiantang river china huang et al 2010 and su et al 2011 divided the study area into several zones using statistics and experience based methods respectively and then performed fa pca on each spatial subset meanwhile coa was performed by ouyang et al 2006 on the temporal subsets to identify the seasonal effect hca was employed by sundaray et al 2006 to explore the relationships among data samples and da was used by su et al 2011 to extract the parameters that significantly contributed to spatial differences apcs mlr was used for pollutant source apportionment in the studies conducted by huang et al 2010 su et al 2011 and haji gholizadeh et al 2016 the remaining examples grouped the data set both in temporal and spatial dimensions shrestha and kazama 2007 performed temporal and spatial groupings using experience and statistics based methods respectively on the data collected from fuji river basin japan for the studies on lake dianchi china and coastal water of eastern hong kong china hca was employed for data grouping both in temporal and spatial dimensions zhou et al 2007 yang et al 2010 while da was used to identify the influencing factors for both spatial and seasonal variations data dimensionality reduction using fa pca was always performed on either spatial or seasonal subsets different from the above cases temporal grouping and spatial grouping could also be performed serially in the case of mahanadi river india panda et al 2006 divided the sampling periods empirically into pre monsoon and monsoon seasons and then further divided each subset into river area and estuarine area according to the sampling locations following that data exploration was conducted via hca and fa pca zhao et al 2011 performed spatial grouping in the three gorges area china via hca and then further divided each subset in temporal dimension following which fa pca was used for data exploration for the study on latyan dam basin iran karami et al 2012 took each calendar month as a temporal group and conducted spatial grouping via hca for each month da fa pca and apcs mlr were performed on the subsets for pollution source apportionment 4 2 spatio seasonal grouping summarized from the above examples temporal dimension was usually divided empirically into four seasons ouyang et al 2006 shrestha and kazama 2007 wet and dry seasons wunderlin et al 2001 haji gholizadeh et al 2016 or monsoon and non monsoon seasons singh et al 2004 panda et al 2006 sundaray et al 2006 in some cases temporal grouping was performed statistically e g zhao et al 2011 divided 12 months by hca into low flow oct feb normal flow mar may and high flow jun sep periods however using the whole monitoring data set for hca the grouping results were not only determined by hydrological conditions but also affected by water pollution characteristics zhou et al 2007 on the contrary statistics based grouping mostly via hca was more commonly used for spatial division simeonov et al 2003 singh et al 2004 kannel et al 2007 shrestha and kazama 2007 zhou et al 2007 kazi et al 2009 yang et al 2010 zhao et al 2011 karami et al 2012 wu et al 2016 which can provide reasonable information about spatial difference of physicochemical characteristics and pollution levels with prior knowledge of geological and topographical conditions spatial dimension could also be divided empirically i e wunderlin et al 2001 categorized the sampling sites into high basin middle basin lower basin and dam area su et al 2011 employed functional zoning assigned by the local environmental protection bureau for spatial grouping which also increased the practicability of analysis results for water environmental management in sum selection of methods and work paths for spatio seasonal analysis depends on the volume of data set the availability of prior knowledge and the requirements of specific tasks which would be discussed in detail below 5 case analysis of uyrb in this section uyrb was used as a case to illustrate how to apply the workflow in spatio seasonal hydro chemical analysis 5 1 study area and data collection uyrb plays a vital role in drinking water

activities in uyrb are extremely complex resulting in significant spatial and seasonal variations of hydro chemistry identifying the variation patterns and their influencing factors is essential for the sustainable development of the whole river basin or even nationally twelve sampling sites were selected in the study area fig 2 ht and xjb stations locate in the jinsha river the upper stretch of uyrb hj station locates in the hengjiang river a tributary flowing into the yangtze river main stream at the right bank downstream from xjb station the jialing river a large tributary of uyrb have three sampling sites in total namely ws bb and ljm stations ldx and wl stations locate in the qujiang river and the wujiang river respectively there are four stations located in the yangtze river main stream defined as the main channel beginning with the confluence of min river which possesses significantly increased flow volume due to the inflow of min river tuo river etc zt and ct stations locate upstream and downstream from the confluence with the jialing river respectively qxc station locates within the influencing area of tgr while wx station locates in the vital area of tgr hydro chemistry of the study area was determined monthly in 2010 water was sampled more than three times at each sampling site and analyzed by yangtze river upstream water environment monitoring center twenty parameters were measured which can be classified into six categories a physical parameters including water stage flow rate water temperature dissolved oxygen do and conductivity b general chemical parameters including ph chloride sulfate suspended solids ss and hardness c heavy metals including iron copper and lead d toxicity indicators typically fluoride e microbial indicators typically fecal coliforms fcoli f eutrophication indicators including total nitrogen tn nitrate nitrogen nn total phosphorus tp permanganate index codmn and 5 day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 5 2 exploratory analysis after data preparation the whole data set could be analyzed in accordance with paths d1 d2 d3 to provide a global perception following that data analysis with grouping was performed to evaluate the necessity of grouping and explore more underlying patterns comparison of the analysis results with and without grouping would be discussed in detail afterwards 5 2 1 grouping given the desirable integrity of data set and prior knowledge about study area both experience and statistics based groupings are theoretically feasible in our case in uyrb wet season starts from may to october annually and dry season is from november to the following april accordingly the alternative dry wet seasons were adopted as empirical grouping in temporal dimension paths a1 b1 hca was performed as the statistical method for grouping temporal hca of the whole data set produced a dendrogram grouping the 12 months into two clusters at dlink dmax 0 6 fig 3 a paths a1 b2 the first cluster consisted of jul sep which might imply a high flow period zhao et al 2011 and the remaining months were grouped into the second cluster as for spatial dimension empirical grouping was performed according to the locations of sampling sites in main stream or tributaries four sites located in the main stream zt ct qxc and wx were grouped into the first cluster while the others constituted the second one paths a2 b3 spatial hca generated a dendrogram grouping the 12 sampling sites into three clusters at dlink dmax 0 6 fig 3b paths a2 b4 ht and xjb stations which located in the jinsha river were grouped into the first cluster the second cluster consisted of ws bb ldx and hj and the remaining sites constituted the third one 5 2 2 da since both experience and statistics based groupings are theoretically feasible the next question is how to select the preferable one stepwise da was performed to evaluate the above groupings and identify the parameters that were significant for these seasonal and spatial variations paths c1 c5 for the dry wet season scenario da produced a classification matrix cm with about 96 correct assignments table 3 using only three discriminant variables temperature sulfate and hardness table 2 for the seasonal classification determined by hca da produced a cm with 98 correct assignments but using five more discriminant variables ph chloride fe cu and tn water stage flow rate temperature hardness chloride ss and bod5 were discriminated as significantly contributing to the hydro chemical differences between main stream and tributaries with a 99 correct assignment similarly nine parameters were discriminated as statistically significant to the spatial variations determined by hca with a 97 correct assignment accordingly experience based methods seemed to be more efficient in variable extraction for both seasonal and spatial dimensions without loss of valuable information 5 2 3 coa coa was conducted using the whole data set path d1 to explore the interrelation between the 20 hydro chemical variables however it was found that most seasonal patterns were concealed probably due to the significant spatial variations in this case coa based on the main stream tributaries grouping cannot effectively reduce this effect either consequently data collected from the 12 sampling sites were calculated respectively paths a2 b3 c2 to minimize the spatial effects table 4 shows the correlation matrix determined at zt station as a typical example and universality was observed for the other sites typical seasonal factors including water stage flow rate and temperature were closely correlated contamination parameters such as ss heavy metals tp fcoli and codmn were positively correlated to flow rate and temperature indicating that these contaminants were mainly input as non point sources accompanying with an increase of surface runoff zhao et al 2011 karami et al 2012 on the contrary mineral components including water hardness and sulfate which mainly originated from natural processes and discharged more constantly throughout the year edwards and withers 2008 zhao et al 2011 showed negative correlation with flow rate all these season related patterns cannot be identified without an appropriate grouping 5 2 4 fa pca data dimensionality reduction via fa pca using the whole data set path d3 extracted six vfs with eigenvalues higher than 1 0 accounting for 75 8 of the total variance samples were projected on the bi dimensional plane defined by the first two vfs with different colors and markers representing different sampling sites and periods respectively fig 4 a vf1 explained 19 3 of the variance positively associated with water stage chloride cu and negatively with tn nn while vf2 was positively contributed by flow rate temperature ss fe fcoli and codmn explaining 16 7 of the variance fig 4d accordingly vf1 and vf2 represented the spatial and seasonal factors respectively data clusters from different sampling sites distributed along the horizontal axis vf1 most samples from wet season typically with high flow rate temperature ss fe fcoli and codmn presented at the positive vf2 axis while dry season samples were mostly at the negative one fig 4a then fa pca using the grouped data subsets was performed to evaluate the necessity of grouping and explore more underlying patterns adopting an appropriate grouping aspect for fa pca contributes to an effective pattern recognition in our case 12 sampling sites represent different geographically controlling points and show distinct clustering under dimensionality reduction fig 4a fa pca based on the main stream tributaries grouping might conceal some patterns at specific sites in contrast observations from different seasons were distinguished under dimensionality reduction therefore data determined in dry and wet seasons were dimensionality reduced via fa pca separately to perform the trial with seasonal grouping paths a1 b1 c4 six vfs were extracted for the data set from each season similarly vf1 can be interpreted as spatial factor for both situations however the positive correlation between water stage and ss fe could only be determined in dry season fig 4e indicating that there were some particular sources of ss and fe associating with the spatial positions this pattern was concealed with wet season fig 4f or whole year fig 4d analysis due to the effect of significant hydrological variations demonstrating that temporal grouping helped to identify more variation patterns under dimensionality reduction for this reason samples from wet season distributed dispersedly on the projected plane fig 4c in contrast sample projections for dry season showed more recognizable patterns fig 4b reflecting the distinct hydro chemical characteristics among different sampling sites 5 2 5 hca similar to coa and fa pca hca on the whole data set path d2 was also found to conceal some similarities between samples besides a dendrogram showing the clustering of 144 samples was less visualized for pattern exploration accordingly hca was performed based on the dry wet season grouping paths a1 b1 c3 for dry season sample clustering reflected significant spatial effect fig 5 a samples from ht and xjb stations were grouped as a cluster separately from the other samples at dlink dmax 0 6 due to the distinct hydrological conditions and less human interference in upstream area samples determined in the main stream zt ct qxc and wx presented a considerable similarity in hydro chemistry samples from ws bb and ldx stations were grouped together resulted from the close positions and similar influence of anthropogenic activities therefore environmental capacity relative up down stream location and anthropogenic activities all contributed to the spatial variations of hydro chemistry in river systems for wet season spatial effect was less distinct compared to dry season due to the effect of significant hydrological variations ht and xjb samples were still grouped together while the samples from main stream determined in high flow period also showed significant similarity with ht and xjb samples fig 5b 6 practical implications and research prospects following workflow construction example verification and case analysis this section proposed some practical implications via an inter comparison and discussed the research prospects 6 1 selection of work paths drawn from the case analysis in section 5 a wise selection of work paths requires a certain level of awareness and familiarity with the data set trial and adjustment could be repeatedly performed to determine the optimal combination of work paths and explore more underlying patterns path b0 was excluded in our case analysis from the beginning while the serial temporal spatial grouping could be conducive to the interpretation of the data sets with a large volume in temporal and or spatial dimensions zhao et al 2011 karami et al 2012 it would be underemployed to be applied to a one year data set with 12 sampling sits indeed it would probably fail to identify the most important patterns using the fragmented subsets given the robust performance in pollutant source identification fa pca was the most frequently used technique in spatio seasonal water quality analysis while grouping could be performed in both dimensions to explore the seasonal and spatial similarity of observations usually data dimensionality reduction only needs to be conducted on either spatial or seasonal subsets for the study on eastern hong kong china zhou et al 2007 monthly monitoring of hydro chemistry was carried out at 27 sites in the coastal area for 5 years dimensionality reduction performed on two spatial subsets divided by hca helped to explore respective pollution sources and identify the factors accounting for this spatial difference similar data sets and related processing can also be found in the studies concerning fuji river basin japan shrestha and kazama 2007 and lake dianchi china yang et al 2010 in contrast one year data was employed in our case to minimize the influence caused by the significant inter year variations in uyrb the 12 sampling sites represented geographically controlling points and involved distinct hydro chemical characteristics to be explored given the data set features and analysis purposes fa pca was performed based on dry wet seasonal grouping instead of experience based spatial grouping in future study which extends this analysis to a multi year data set fa pca can be performed on spatial subsets e g each tributary or each sampling site to explore the temporal trend of hydro chemistry and the most likely evaluate the effects of pollution control or other human interventions under this circumstance serial temporal spatial grouping using path b0 could also be helpful for pattern exploration given the above analysis adopting an appropriate grouping aspect for fa pca contributes to an effective pattern recognition however in some cases involving more complicated information or specific requirement dimensionality reduction could be performed considering both spatial and seasonal groupings for example when analyzing the water quality in a constructed wetland purification system li et al 2015 conducted fa pca on seasonal subsets spring summer and autumn and spatial subsets four functional zones respectively to explore the spatio seasonal variations accordingly selection of the work paths for spatio seasonal analysis largely depends on the structure of data set and the requirements of specific tasks based on the construction of this workflow some paths and their combinations which are logically available but have been seldomly used could be identified for example there is no practice associated with paths c6 c7 among the examples discussed above under some circumstances where prior knowledge is absent for empirical grouping statistics based grouping could be employed to identify the global differences between subsets following which hca and coa can be used to explore the detailed variation patterns within each subset besides in grouping module there are more than 10 ways of combining paths to perform serial temporal spatial grouping to meet different analysis demands this offered the possibility and guidance for some difficult analysis tasks with limited information or peculiar requirements 6 2 feasibility of grouping similar to work path selection feasibility of grouping is also associated with data set features and analysis tasks when the sampling sites frequencies are limited analysis using the whole data set without grouping would be more appropriate for data interpretation as the cases in early study vega et al 1998 or concerning groundwater helena et al 2000 belkhiri and narany 2015 despite of the considerable volume of data set for the study on manchar lake pakistan kazi et al 2009 dimensionality reduction and factor extraction showed a high efficiency without grouping as only three vfs were extracted and vf1 accounted for 78 6 of the total variance this might be because that the lake area was relatively small compared to river basins or coastal area and consequently the hydrogeological conditions were more similar and human activities in lakesides were less complex indeed the number of pollution sources identified using fa pca was not only influenced by the scale of data set used for calculation but also determined by the actual pollution levels and complexity of variations with the extension of study region and seasonal complexity grouping before analysis contributes to identify more spatio seasonal variation patterns e g in our case and improve the efficiency of dimensionality reduction via fa pca as the study on mahanadi river estuarine system india panda et al 2006 given various ways of data grouping e g temporally or spatially as discussed in section 6 1 empirically or statistically as the examples shown in section 4 2 and the exploratory analysis in section 5 2 the confronting question is how to determine the preferable one even for a certain statistics based seasonal grouping the optimal number of groups is remained to be determined accordingly wunderlin et al 2001 and zhou et al 2007 employed da to determine the preferable number of groups divided via hca trial and error method was also used to determine the best grouping of sampling sites wunderlin et al 2001 yu et al 2015 as for our case experience based spatial grouping could be performed in several ways such as the locations in main stream or tributaries within the influencing area of tgr or not even each sampling site can be considered as an individual group as discussed in section 5 2 spatial variation patterns of hydro chemistry were influenced by several natural or anthropogenic factors an inappropriate artificial classification might conceal some critical patterns to be explored similarly selection of the basis for grouping depends on the structure of data set and requirements of analysis tasks 6 3 research prospects the present study focused on the spatial and seasonal variations of hydro chemistry however due to the global climatic changes and human interventions such as hydropower development temporal variation trend of hydro chemistry in aquatic systems is also of great concern chang 2008 wang et al 2008 su et al 2011 take uyrb for example given the huge and valuable hydro energy uyrb is typical of hydropower cascade development with tens of reservoirs either in operation or under construction these human interventions significantly influenced the hydro chemical characteristics the workflow we proposed could be extended to involve temporal trend analysis as well as the integrated application of more techniques such as geographic information systems zhou et al 2007 remote sensing karami et al 2012 and isotope ratio analysis huang et al 2015 in future study while the present study aimed to explore the hydro chemical variations in river systems the workflow we proposed is also applicable to other fields concerning spatio seasonal variation patterns and multivariate statistical techniques for example huang et al 2015 applied multivariate statistical techniques for heavy metal source apportionment in peri urban agricultural soils following the work paths of a2 b3 c4 d2 d3 in the workflow muxika et al 2007 assessed the benthic ecological status using multivariate analysis in accordance with the work flows of a2 b3 c4 nnane 2010 combined the paths of a1 b1 c4 a2 b4 d1 to explore the relationships between microbial contamination and chemo physical water quality parameters souissi et al 2000 performed multivariate analysis to identify the effects of nutrient dynamics in the bay of tunis on phyto and zooplankton distribution using the work paths of a1 b1 b0 b4 for atmospheric research amodio et al 2010 combined the paths of a2 b3 c1c4 d3 e to conduct a statistical investigation about the sources of pm2 5 in south italy in future works this workflow could be continually improved and applied to various fields furthermore with the explosion of data scale and diversification of analysis tasks visualization plays an important role in the selection and optimization of analysis methods rautenhaus et al 2018 which combines the expertise with statistical techniques through interactive mode to preferably meet varying analysis requirements especially for multivariate spatio temporal data zhang et al 2020a the workflow we constructed paves the way for the connection with visualization module in future works 7 conclusions this study proposed a workflow to guide the application of multivariate statistical techniques in spatio seasonal hydro chemical analysis which could help the practitioners in analysis method selection data interpretation and variation pattern recognition according to their data set structure and specific task requirements given a multiscale dataset concerning complex spatio seasonal variations appropriate grouping before analysis contributes to data exploration and pattern recognition hydro chemistry in uyrb was analyzed following the guidance of workflow and impressive variation patterns were identified via trials and optimizing the combination of work paths efforts could be made in future works to extend the workflow to involve inter year variation trend and more advanced analysis methods as well as to the application in various fields declaration of competing interest the

17449,previous studies have shown the high ecotoxicological potential of progestogens pgs on the reproductive system of aquatic organisms yet the ubiquitous presence of several pgs in wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents indicates an incomplete removal during treatment to investigate the fate and behavior of pgs during biological wastewater treatment nine commonly used pgs were incubated in aerobic lab scale degradation experiments with activated sludge taken from a municipal wwtp the degradation kinetics revealed a fast removal after 48 h for most of the compounds cyproterone acetate and dienogest were the most recalcitrant of the analyzed steroids with half lives of 8 65 h and 4 55 h respectively thus only moderate removals of these pgs can be predicted in full scale wwtps moreover numerous transformation products tps were detected via high resolution mass spectrometry hydrogenation or dehydrogenation of ring a and non selective hydroxylations of 17α hydroxyprogesterone derivatives medroxyprogesterone acetate chlormadinone acetate cyproterone acetate as well as for 19 nortestosterone derivatives dienogest norethisterone acetate etonogestrel were observed as major transformation reactions seven of the identified tps were confirmed by reference standards the biodegradation of cyproterone acetate revealed an almost quantitative transformation to 3α hydroxy cyproterone acetate which is reported to be genotoxic in a comparative evaluation of the tps formed and the steroid structure it was observed that molecular structure played a role in the inhibition of several transformation reactions explaining the increased recalcitrance of these compounds in addition aromatization of the steroid ring a was identified for the 19 nortestosterone derivatives leading to the formation of estrogen like tps for instance the degradation of norethisterone acetate led to the formation of 17α ethinylestradiol a well known and very potent synthetic estrogen the evidence of the conversion of progestogenic to estrogenic compounds and the formation of potentially hazardous tps indicates the need of a more comprehensive environmental risk assessment for synthetic steroids two of the newly identified tps 3α hydroxy cyproterone acetate and 9 11 dehydro 17α cyanomethyl estradiol were detected in wwtp effluents for the first time graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords 17α ethinylestradiol transformation products biological wastewater treatment synthetic oral contraceptives steroid hormones 1 introduction from today s perspective the introduction of hormonal contraception in the early sixties can be regarded as historical for the development of society regardless of the social and medical importance endogenous steroid hormones can cause adverse effects when released into environmental compartments reviewed in fent 2015 kumar et al 2015 and liu et al 2011a progestogens pgs used in cancer treatment contraception and replacement therapies are synthetic steroid hormones that were designed to mimic natural progesterone the properties and potency of active steroids used in hormonal contraception were optimized by alterations of the structure of natural hormones for instance the introduction of substituents into the progesterone e g 17α hydroxy progesterone skeleton resulted in increased hormonal potency and slower inactivation rates via the endogenous metabolism kuhl 2011 it has been shown that esterification at c17 leads to an inhibition of the 20 keto reduction for which the steric hindrance of the space filling 17α ester was found to be responsible in addition the metabolic hydroxylation at the c6 position was significantly inhibited by introducing a methyl or chlorine at c6 neumann 1994 the result of these observations was the development of potent synthetic progesterone derivatives such as medroxyprogesterone acetate chlormadinone acetate or cyproterone acetate 19 nortestosterone derivatives are another class of steroids frequently used for hormonal contraception they are derived from the anabolic compound nandrolone 19 nortestosterone modifications of the steroid skeleton led to various derivatives which differ in their potency and pattern of hormonal activities kuhl 2011 the introduction of a 17α ethinyl moiety caused a shift from androgenic to progestogenic activity owing to the inhibition of the 17β oxidation kuhl 2011 over the last decades it was shown that pgs induce diverse adverse effects in fish at concentrations down to the low or sub nanogram per liter range reviewed in fent 2015 kumar et al 2015 and liu et al 2011a for instance levonorgestrel inhibited the reproduction in fathead minnows at 0 8 ng l zeilinger et al 2010 cyproterone acetate was found to decrease the testosterone plasma level in adult mummichog after exposure to 1 0 ng l sharpe et al 2004 and an exposure to 1 0 ng l norethisterone caused a decrease in fecundity in fathead minnows paulos et al 2010 an exposure to 3 2 ng l etonogestrel was responsible for a reduction of the mating activity in endler guppy males and completely suppressed the reproduction ability of the females steinbach et al 2019 in addition the additive effects of pg mixtures might be expected as recently reported zhao et al 2015 these multiple effects on different indicator organisms highlighted serious ecotoxicological consequences for fish and other aquatic wildlife from steroid burdens at environmentally relevant concentrations since most of the effects reported showed significant impacts on reproduction this property makes them the most important pharmaceutical group of concern after 17α ethinylestradiol kumar et al 2015 even though it was shown that different pgs were discharged mainly by municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps chang et al 2008 2011 liu et al 2011b golovko et al 2018 weizel et al 2018 yu et al 2019 knowledge about their behavior during biological wastewater treatment is scarce the consumption profile of pgs varies between countries and regions thus different regions reported different dominant pgs occurring in the municipal wwtp effluents chang et al 2011 found progesterone as the predominant pg in seven wwtp effluents in beijing while yu et al 2019 reported progesterone drospirenone dydrogesterone and levonorgestrel as the most frequently detected pgs in 21 wwtp effluents in china in swiss wwtp effluents progesterone and medroxyprogesterone acetate were most prominent zhang et al 2017 golovko et al 2018 detected dienogest medroxyprogesterone acetate and megestrol acetate most often in czech wwtp effluents on the other hand dienogest and cyproterone acetate could be identified ubiquitously in german wwtp effluents weizel et al 2018 some studies reported that pgs were partially removed in wwtps fan et al 2011 chang et al 2008 2011 and were still discharged into receiving waters however these studies covered a limited number of target steroids and the fate of many commonly used pgs is unknown which could explain the detected progestogenic activity of wwtp effluents in further studies bain et al 2014 van der linden et al 2008 houtman et al 2018 in addition to the incomplete removal of pgs their biological transformation products tps formed during the wastewater treatment can contribute to the endocrine activity of the wwtp effluents yu et al 2018 the tps of common pgs are mainly unknown since only a very few studies investigated their fate and the formation of tps in these rare studies the importance of tp formation is highlighted for instance the analysis of the microbiological degradation of progesterone with activated sludge results in the formation of 12 tps yu et al 2018 and for levonorgestrel four tps were identified liu et al 2013 the main transformation reactions include hydrogenations dehydrogenations as well as side chain degradation in the case of progesterone the side chain degradation results in the formation of potent androgens such as 4 adrostene 3 17 dione and 5α dihydrotestosterone yu et al 2018 it is noted that the postulated tps exhibit the intact steroid core thus there is some evidence that the degradation of pgs still leads to endocrine active compounds which can be discharged into receiving waters a prominent example of adverse effects in the aquatic environment caused by steroid transformation was reported by jenkins et al 2004 it was found that androgens can be formed from progesterone by the bacterium mycobacterium smegmatis the researchers hypothesized that environmentally induced masculinization among natural populations of female mosquitofish was caused by the microbiological transformation of plant steroids into progesterone and subsequently to potent androgens these plant steroids were emitted into the rivers by the waste streams of wood pulping processes at local paper mills therefore the transformation of steroids can cause a shift in the steroid selectivity and has to be addressed through the consideration of the tps which are formed overall there is a major lack of understanding of the transformation processes of pgs in wastewater treatment in this context this study was initiated to elucidate the removal of common pgs during biological wastewater treatment therefore we analyzed the biodegradability of nine pgs 17α hydroxyprogesterone medroxyprogesterone acetate chlormadinone acetate cyproterone acetate levonorgestrel dienogest norethisterone acetate etonogestrel drospirenone in aerated lab scale incubation experiments with activated sludge taken from a municipal wwtp furthermore experiments were conducted for the identification of the main tps of six pgs medroxyprogesterone acetate chlormadinone acetate cyproterone acetate dienogest etonogestrel norethisterone acetate finally the identified tps and the parent pgs were analyzed in eight german municipal wwtp effluents 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and compound selection chemical suppliers and further information for the reference standards used in this study are provided in the supporting information tab s1 the parent pgs analyzed in this study as well as their annual consumption volumes in germany for 2018 are shown in table 1 the analyzed steroid substrates were selected based on i the consumption level in germany ii the reported ecotoxicological potency and iii the chemical structure 2 2 removal experiments for the elucidation of the kinetic behavior volumes of 200 ml of freshly sampled activated sludge slurry were filled into 2 l brown glass vessels and were immediately diluted with wwtp effluent from the same wwtp to a final volume of 2 l dilution 1 10 was utilized to reduce sorption onto suspended solids and to minimize matrix effects during chemical analysis the activated sludge was sampled from the aeration tank of a conventional wwtp capacity 320 000 population equivalents sludge retention time approx 12

conditions and temperature and ph were controlled as well no significant drifts and changes were observed within the incubation experiments prior to the addition of the steroids the preparations were allowed to equilibrate for approximately 12 h the kinetic experiments were conducted in triplicate at an initial concentration of 200 ng l of each analyte inactive sterilized control experiments autoclaved at 121 c for 60 min were run in parallel to differentiate between biotic abiotic degradation and to assess the impact of sorption all conducted experiments and their experimental conditions

in weizel et al 2018 2 3 degradation experiments for the identification of transformation products for the degradation experiments 20 ml of freshly sampled activated sludge was filled into 250 ml

chromatographic conditions and the gradient used were previously reported in weizel et al 2020 the acquired data were processed by a non target approach automated peak picking and alignment procedures were assessed via a data evaluation script in r r development core team 2008 briefly the xics extracted ion chromatogram were extracted using the xcms package smith et al 2006 the xics were then checked for local maxima after signal to noise calculation sn 3 and further filtering a peak list was generated finally the features were automatically aligned between the samples by comparing m z and retention time of all generated features in all samples the aligned peak lists were obtained by grouping those within a tolerance window of m z 5 ppm and rt 10 s afterwards the aligned peak lists were searched for clear differences in the time courses between spiked batches and non spiked controls for potential tps as criteria for the prioritization of tps an increasing or decreasing trend or an intermediate maximum of the intensity within the incubation time was defined in addition only peaks detected in at least three consecutive samples were considered the tentatively identified tps were verified by the measurements of reference standards through a comparison of retention times rt accurate masses and ms² spectra in those cases without commercially available standards chemical structures of the tps were proposed by characterizing the spectra and comparing these to the ms² fragmentation of related compounds obtained from other experiments in this study quantitative analysis

cyproterone acetate to 110 l gss d drospirenone table 3 for 17α hydroxyprogesterone and norethisterone acetate a very fast degradation was observed rate constants for these pgs were not calculated since only very few sampling points exhibited concentrations above the loq the concentrations of the pgs during incubation experiments are shown in fig 1 the comparison of the sterile control experiments and non sterile experiments indicated that biodegradation e g transformation was the major removal process since sorption on suspended solids was negligible fig 1 overall pgs were degraded below their loqs within six hours of incubation except dienogest and cyproterone acetate both pgs were the most recalcitrant steroids in the study however dt50 values dissipation time needed for 50 removal of these were still below 12 h regarding the comparison to literature studies of pgs the kinetic behavior is consistent with previously reported results from a lab scale degradation study chang et al 2011 since the calculated half lives were in the same range in addition the concentrations in german wwtp effluents underscore the behavior of the analyzed pgs as only dienogest and cyproterone acetate could be frequently detected in the effluents up to 4 4 ng l and 3 7 ng l respectively weizel et al 2018 according to the observed kinetics it is very unlikely that pgs with half lives below 1 h in this study 17α hydroxyprogesterone levonorgestrel norethisterone acetate etonogestrel drospirenone are present in municipal wwtp effluents in appreciable concentrations since the total consumption of the individual pgs is relatively low in comparison to other pharmaceuticals however a few studies did report sporadic detections of these pgs vulliet et al 2007 liu et al 2011b liu et al 2014 petrovic et al 2002 endogenous pgs such as progesterone not included in this study or 17α hydroxyprogesterone were frequently detected in wwtp effluents despite their high degradation rates zhang et al 2017 weizel et al 2018 these findings can be linked to the natural origin of this compound leading to much higher influent concentrations in comparison to other pgs schöneshöfer et al 1986 this is also true for other steroid hormones since weizel et al 2020 showed that hydrocortisone was present in wwtp effluents despite the rapid microbial degradation of this compound concerning cyproterone acetate the knowledge that this compound can adversely impact fish at concentrations as low as 1 ng l sharpe et al 2004 and the observed moderate removal it represents a risk for aquatic organisms in surface waters receiving wwtp effluents this is also true for dienogest though reliable data of its impact on aquatic biota are scarce schmid et al 2020 fent 2015 kumar et al 2015 3 2 fate of 17α hydroxyprogesterone derivatives three 17α acetate esters chlormadinone acetate medroxyprogesterone acetate cyproterone acetate were used as steroid substrates for the degradation study an overview of the detected tps is provided in the supporting information tab s3 it should be noted that due to the high initial concentrations used for the tp identification experiments 500 µg l numerous minor tps were detected as well therefore only the main tps are discussed in the following sections moreover a consistent terminology was used for the tps consisting of their monoisotopic mass and retention time during the biodegradation of medroxyprogesterone acetate 18 tps were detected of which two of them were confirmed by the measurement of authentic reference standards tp402 18 1 tp386 21 3 chlormadinone acetate showed the formation of 21 tps one of these was unambiguously identified as the active steroid delmadinone acetate tp402 20 5 via a reference standard for cyproterone acetate 10 tps were detected the main identified tps of medroxyprogesterone acetate were the 1 dehydro tp tp384 20 4 and the 1 isomer tp386 21 3 fig 2 a similar tps tp402 20 6 and tp404 21 0 were found for chlormadinone acetate fig 2b in addition to de hydrogenation of the carbon double bonds the reduction of the 3 keto moiety was observed for chlormadinone acetate which led to the considerable formation of tp404 20 2 and tp406 20 7 these tps were tentatively proposed as the 3α hydroxy derivatives of tp402 20 6 and tp404 21 0 while cyproterone acetate showed only the formation of the main tp 3α hydroxy cyproterone acetate tp418 20 4 to an appreciable extent fig 2c the formation of 3β hydroxy chlormadinone acetate can be excluded as confirmed by the measurement of a reference standard fig 2b since the stereochemistry of the c3 hydroxy group is crucial for the activity and binding affinity of steroids schneider et al 2009 the verification of the chlormadinone tps and other proposed tps should be a subject of further research as stated tp418 20 4 fig 2c was found as the major tp of cyproterone acetate the elevated formation of this tp indicates that the treatment with activated sludge does not eliminate the endocrine activity since c3 reduced tps of the 17α hydroxyprogesterone derivatives are known to still be endocrine active schneider et al 2009 in addition 3α hydroxy steroids tp404 20 2 and tp406 20 7 tp418 20 4 and tp420 20 6 can bind covalently to dna leading to the formation of dna adducts and pronounced genotoxicity kerdar et al 1995 martelli et al 1996 kasper 2001 however of the identified tps only a few of them exhibited more than 10 of the initial peak area of their parent steroid at t0 based on the obtained results we proposed initial degradation pathways for the three analyzed 17α hydroxyprogesterone derivatives fig 3 martelli et al 1996 proposed similar structure relationships for the observed reactivity of cyproterone acetate chlormadinone actetate and megestrol acetate with dna due to the different extent of metabolic 3 keto reduction both results in combination suggest that the activated sludge treatment of megestrol acetate not included in this study might lead to a lesser extent of 3 keto reduction and a higher rate of 1 dehydrogenation as observed for chlormadinone acetate in this study the specific structural moiety responsible for the 3 keto reduction of steroids is most likely the 6 double bond this hypothesis should be addressed in further degradation studies the ring a de hydrogenations of progesterone derivatives varied significantly from those observed for glucocorticoids weizel et al 2020 since glucocorticoids were preferably reduced at the 4 double bond in α position as shown in fig 2 4 hydrogenated tps were detected but with less intensity than the dehydrogenated tps this behavior might be explained by the inhibitory effect of c6 substituents on the reduction of the 4 double bond as described by kuhl 2011 hydrogenation in α position is hampered by the steric configuration e g c6α methyl for medroxyprogesterone the hydrolysis of the 17α ester during the incubation with activated sludge was not observed recently it has been shown that the ester cleavage at position c17 occurs via isomerization while direct hydrolysis is sterically hindered at this position weizel et al 2020 thus the ester hydrolysis can be excluded as a major degradation reaction in biological wastewater treatment of such pgs in addition several minor hydroxylated tps have been identified the hydroxylation was not selective since several isomers were detected for the analyzed steroids fig s3 the hydroxylated tps were formed from all primary de hydrogenated tps and vice versa these tps can be expected as intermediates in the biodegradation route of steroids which can be further transformed to carboxylates and compounds with a broken steroid skeleton e g 9 10 seco pathway within the evaluation of the results minor tps containing a carboxylic moiety were indicated by the characteristic loss of carbon dioxide during ms² fragmentation in addition dechlorinated tps of chlormadinone acetate and cyproterone acetate were identified since these tps were formed to a small degree dechlorination seems not to be a significant degradation pathway of chlormadinone acetate and cyproterone acetate in microbiological wastewater treatment however the dechlorination of cyproterone acetate was previously reported in fish tissue liu et al 2019 the elucidation of the exact structures of these secondary tertiary or higher tps was out of the scope of this study since our work focused on the main primary tps which are formed to an appreciable degree 3 3 fate of 19 nortestosterone derivatives steroids of this type are characterized by a 17α ethinyl group cyanomethyl in case of dienogest and the missing methyl group at c19 the identified tps of the 19 nortestosterone derivatives dienogest norethisterone acetate and etonogestrel are summarized in the supporting information tab s4 three main tps tp309 11 9 tp309 16 4 and tp327 13 0 were detected for dienogest fig 4 a further 20 tps were detected with a maximum formation of less than 5 of the initial peak area of dienogest as shown in fig 4b etonogestrel was degraded to four main tps tp326 20 8 tp324 20 6 tp344 16 4 and tp374 15 7 here 22 tps minor with maximum peak areas below 5 of the initial peak area of the precursor were tentatively identified the degradation of norethisterone acetate revealed the formation of three major tps norethisterone tp300 19 8 tp318 13 8 fig 4c and further 30 tps with less than 5 of the initial peak area of the precursor the main tps observed for all analyzed model compounds were 5α hydrogenated derivatives tp326 20 8 tp300 19 8 and also hydroxylated tps of the parent steroids tp327 13 0 tp344 16 4 tp318 13 8 moreover the large number of different tps emphasized that many transformation reactions are responsible for the removal of the steroids during wastewater treatment with activated sludge for instance the insertion of one or more hydroxyl groups was not regioselective since in those cases several isomers could be detected and thus numerous tps were formed fig s4 similar to the 17α hydroxy progesterone derivatives several carboxylates were tentatively identified fig s2 by their characteristic loss of carbon dioxide in the ms² fragmentation in the lab scale experiments norethisterone acetate prodrug was rapidly hydrolyzed to its active human metabolite norethisterone tp298 18 3 kuhl 2011 in contrast to the 17α acetate esters discussed in section 3 2 the 17β position is favored for the initial ester hydrolysis on the other hand the 17α ethinyl and the nitrile group of dienogest were not degraded as was already consistently reported cirja et al 2007 cajthaml et al 2009 in addition the initial 4 hydrogenation was confirmed since tp300 19 8 was identified as 5α dihydro norethisterone via the measurement of an authentic reference standard this tp is known to interact with the progestogen and estrogen receptors larrea et al 2001 analogous to the confirmed results of norethisterone acetate the major tps of etonogestrel were proposed as the 4 hydrogenated product tp326 20 8 and the 1 isomer of etonogestrel tp324 20 6 final confirmation of the etonogestrel tps was impossible since reference compounds were not available recently similar transformation was found during the microbial degradation of levonorgestrel in soil tang et al 2019 activated sludge liu et al 2013 and by freshwater microalgae peng et al 2014 although tetrahydrogenated products 3α 5α 3β 5α tetrahydro tps are known as human metabolites lemus et al 2009 such tps were not detected in our experiments in addition the 1 dehydrogenated derivatives of norethisterone tp296 17 5 and etonogestrel tp322 19 6 were detected to a lesser extent 5 the behavior was consistent with the observed de hydrogenations of glucocorticoids weizel et al 2020 3 4 aromatization of ring a in addition to the tps mentioned above the formation of an aromatized ring a was found for all 19 nortestosterone steroids the elucidation of the tps revealed the formation of 17α ethinylestradiol tp296 18 5 ee2 by the aromatization of norethisterone fig 5 which was unambiguously confirmed via its reference standard for dienogest and etonogestrel similar tps were detected tp309 16 4 tp322 20 0 fig s5 and thus the obtained results indicate that 19 nortestosterone pgs can be converted to highly potent estrogenic steroids during biological wastewater treatment moreover ee2 reached concentrations as high as 7 after 24 h of the initial concentration of the precursor this suggests that the transformation of 0 5 ng l norethisterone can lead to the formation of 0 035 ng l ee2 worst case concerning the proposed european environmental quality standard of the water framework directive eu decision 2015 for ee2 0 035 ng l the biotransformation of elevated norethisterone concentrations might be significant for environmental ee2 concentrations and especially when determining the removal of ee2 in wwtps the aromatization leading to estrogen like tps was not detected for the 17α hydroxyprogesterone derivatives due to the c19 methyl group an oxidative elimination of the methyl group is needed for the formation of the phenolic ring a the enzymatically mediated conversion of c19 methyl steroids into estrogens requires specific enzymes such as aromatase cyp19 kao et al 2001 in the case of 19 nortestosterone derivatives dehydrogenation followed by enolisation of the 3 oxo moiety leads to the formation of the phenolic ring a this transformation reaction can likely be mediated by bacteria from activated sludge as it was identified in this study 19 nortestosterone derivatives were found to metabolize to estrogens in the liver of human adults without the presence of aromatase thus a similar mechanism of the aromatization was assumed kuhnz et al 1997 kuhl and wiegratz 2007 in addition sulfate conjugates of the corresponding aromatized tps were detected tp376 14 6 tp389 12 9 tp402 16 7 which is consistent with the reported behavior of ee2 and other estrogens during activated sludge treatment yi and harper 2007 the consideration of the fragmentation spectra ms² spectra are provided in the supporting information indicated that the sulfate groups are bonded to the aromatized moiety phenolic sulfate conjugate thus these findings indicated the formation of an aromatized site as only the cleavage of so3 m z 79 9568 da could be observed without the presence of hso4 m z 96 9596 da which is characteristic for phenolic sulfate conjugates weidolf et al 1988 these results supported the proposed structure for the estrogen like tps indirectly based on the identified tps an initial degradation pathway was proposed and illustrated exemplarily for norethisterone acetate in fig 6 3 5 occurrence of pgs and their tps in wwtp effluents the occurrence of the pgs from table 1 and their main tps was analyzed in eight wwtp effluents before the analysis recoveries and detection limits were determined for the targeted steroids results of the method performance are provided in the supporting information tab s5 the recoveries ranged between 84 tp388 21 6 and 115 drospirenone while the loqs ranged from 0 3 ng l dienogest to 5 6 ng l chlormadinol acetate as recently indicated weizel et al 2018 cyproterone acetate and dienogest were ubiquitously detected in the wwtp effluents table 4 in addition to these chlormadinone acetate 3 8 and endogenous 17α hydroxyprogesterone 8 8 were frequently detected these results are consistent with the relative consumption of pgs in germany table 4 as dienogest and cyproterone acetate have the highest consumption levels furthermore both compounds were only moderately degraded in the lab experiments as a consequence relatively high concentrations were found in german wwtp effluents the cyproterone acetate concentrations were above 7 ng l in two wwtp effluents and dienogest was detected up to 3 7 ng l especially the high cyproterone acetate concentrations are of ecological relevance since the concentrations were significantly higher than the compound s lowest observed effect concentration of 1 ng l sharpe et al 2004 in addition the screening for the identified tps revealed the occurrence of two dienogest and one cyproterone acetate tp tps of other pgs were not detected likely due to the low consumption of these steroids in germany the 3 oxo reduced tp of cyproterone acetate tp418 20 4 was detected in all wwtp effluents an estimation of the concentration using the cyproterone acetate calibration revealed elevated concentrations up to 8 1 ng l fig s6 tps of dienogest tp309 16 4 and tp327 11 3 were detected in all wwtp effluents the 6β hydroxy tp tp327 11 3 was found with concentrations up to 1 6 ng l since 6β hydroxy dienogest is a human metabolite as well the observation that only a limited quantity of this tp was formed in the degradation experiments its occurrence might be attributed to the incomplete removal in the wwtps rather than by its formation tp309 16 4 was tentatively identified as the ring a aromatized tp of dienogest with an estrogen like structure this tp was detected in all wwtp effluents similar to the tp of cyproterone acetate an estimation of the concentration was made via the calibration of dienogest this approach revealed partially very high concentrations up to 16 ng l in all cases the concentration of the tp was higher than that of dienogest fig s6 however an accurate quantification of the detected tps has to be addressed in further research 4 conclusions the results of pg analysis enabled new insights into the structure stability relationship of synthetic steroids 17α hydroxyprogesterone derivatives were degraded initially at ring a via carbon double bond de hydrogenations a 6 double bond promotes the 3 keto reduction which was particularly pronounced for cyproterone acetate due to the inhibition of the 1 dehydrogenation by the cyclopropane moiety 19 nortestosterone derivatives showed the formation of estrogen like tps by the aromatization of ring a leading to a shift in the receptor binding capability there is evidence that many tps are still biologically active thus tp formation must be taken into account for the environmental risk profile these outcomes reinforce that it is mandatory to consider tp formation of steroids as an assessment criterion for industrial discharge permissions into municipal wwtps with biological treatment trains most pgs were degraded within six hours in contact with activated sludge only cyproterone acetate and dienogest showed moderate stability half lives of 8 65 h and 4 55 h cyproterone acetate and dienogest as well as their main tps were ubiquitously discharged into the environment from german wwtps both tps could be significant drivers of anthropogenically induced endocrine activity in the environment detected concentrations of pgs and tps

17449,previous studies have shown the high ecotoxicological potential of progestogens pgs on the reproductive system of aquatic organisms yet the ubiquitous presence of several pgs in wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents indicates an incomplete removal during treatment to investigate the fate and behavior of pgs during biological wastewater treatment nine commonly used pgs were incubated in aerobic lab scale degradation experiments with activated sludge taken from a municipal wwtp the degradation kinetics revealed a fast removal after 48 h for most of the compounds cyproterone acetate and dienogest were the most recalcitrant of the analyzed steroids with half lives of 8 65 h and 4 55 h respectively thus only moderate removals of these pgs can be predicted in full scale wwtps moreover numerous transformation products tps were detected via high resolution mass spectrometry hydrogenation or dehydrogenation of ring a and non selective hydroxylations of 17α hydroxyprogesterone derivatives medroxyprogesterone acetate chlormadinone acetate cyproterone acetate as well as for 19 nortestosterone derivatives dienogest norethisterone acetate etonogestrel were observed as major transformation reactions seven of the identified tps were confirmed by reference standards the biodegradation of cyproterone acetate revealed an almost quantitative transformation to 3α hydroxy cyproterone acetate which is reported to be genotoxic in a comparative evaluation of the tps formed and the steroid structure it was observed that molecular structure played a role in the inhibition of several transformation reactions explaining the increased recalcitrance of these compounds in addition aromatization of the steroid ring a was identified for the 19 nortestosterone derivatives leading to the formation of estrogen like tps for instance the degradation of norethisterone acetate led to the formation of 17α ethinylestradiol a well known and very potent synthetic estrogen the evidence of the conversion of progestogenic to estrogenic compounds and the formation of potentially hazardous tps indicates the need of a more comprehensive environmental risk assessment for synthetic steroids two of the newly identified tps 3α hydroxy cyproterone acetate and 9 11 dehydro 17α cyanomethyl estradiol were detected in wwtp effluents for the first time graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords 17α ethinylestradiol transformation products biological wastewater treatment synthetic oral contraceptives steroid hormones 1 introduction from today s perspective the introduction of hormonal contraception in the early sixties can be regarded as historical for the development of society regardless of the social and medical importance endogenous steroid hormones can cause adverse effects when released into environmental compartments reviewed in fent 2015 kumar et al 2015 and liu et al 2011a progestogens pgs used in cancer treatment contraception and replacement therapies are synthetic steroid hormones that were designed to mimic natural progesterone the properties and potency of active steroids used in hormonal contraception were optimized by alterations of the structure of natural hormones for instance the introduction of substituents into the progesterone e g 17α hydroxy progesterone skeleton resulted in increased hormonal potency and slower inactivation rates via the endogenous metabolism kuhl 2011 it has been shown that esterification at c17 leads to an inhibition of the 20 keto reduction for which the steric hindrance of the space filling 17α ester was found to be responsible in addition the metabolic hydroxylation at the c6 position was significantly inhibited by introducing a methyl or chlorine at c6 neumann 1994 the result of these observations was the development of potent synthetic progesterone derivatives such as medroxyprogesterone acetate chlormadinone acetate or cyproterone acetate 19 nortestosterone derivatives are another class of steroids frequently used for hormonal contraception they are derived from the anabolic compound nandrolone 19 nortestosterone modifications of the steroid skeleton led to various derivatives which differ in their potency and pattern of hormonal activities kuhl 2011 the introduction of a 17α ethinyl moiety caused a shift from androgenic to progestogenic activity owing to the inhibition of the 17β oxidation kuhl 2011 over the last decades it was shown that pgs induce diverse adverse effects in fish at concentrations down to the low or sub nanogram per liter range reviewed in fent 2015 kumar et al 2015 and liu et al 2011a for instance levonorgestrel inhibited the reproduction in fathead minnows at 0 8 ng l zeilinger et al 2010 cyproterone acetate was found to decrease the testosterone plasma level in adult mummichog after exposure to 1 0 ng l sharpe et al 2004 and an exposure to 1 0 ng l norethisterone caused a decrease in fecundity in fathead minnows paulos et al 2010 an exposure to 3 2 ng l etonogestrel was responsible for a reduction of the mating activity in endler guppy males and completely suppressed the reproduction ability of the females steinbach et al 2019 in addition the additive effects of pg mixtures might be expected as recently reported zhao et al 2015 these multiple effects on different indicator organisms highlighted serious ecotoxicological consequences for fish and other aquatic wildlife from steroid burdens at environmentally relevant concentrations since most of the effects reported showed significant impacts on reproduction this property makes them the most important pharmaceutical group of concern after 17α ethinylestradiol kumar et al 2015 even though it was shown that different pgs were discharged mainly by municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps chang et al 2008 2011 liu et al 2011b golovko et al 2018 weizel et al 2018 yu et al 2019 knowledge about their behavior during biological wastewater treatment is scarce the consumption profile of pgs varies between countries and regions thus different regions reported different dominant pgs occurring in the municipal wwtp effluents chang et al 2011 found progesterone as the predominant pg in seven wwtp effluents in beijing while yu et al 2019 reported progesterone drospirenone dydrogesterone and levonorgestrel as the most frequently detected pgs in 21 wwtp effluents in china in swiss wwtp effluents progesterone and medroxyprogesterone acetate were most prominent zhang et al 2017 golovko et al 2018 detected dienogest medroxyprogesterone acetate and megestrol acetate most often in czech wwtp effluents on the other hand dienogest and cyproterone acetate could be identified ubiquitously in german wwtp effluents weizel et al 2018 some studies reported that pgs were partially removed in wwtps fan et al 2011 chang et al 2008 2011 and were still discharged into receiving waters however these studies covered a limited number of target steroids and the fate of many commonly used pgs is unknown which could explain the detected progestogenic activity of wwtp effluents in further studies bain et al 2014 van der linden et al 2008 houtman et al 2018 in addition to the incomplete removal of pgs their biological transformation products tps formed during the wastewater treatment can contribute to the endocrine activity of the wwtp effluents yu et al 2018 the tps of common pgs are mainly unknown since only a very few studies investigated their fate and the formation of tps in these rare studies the importance of tp formation is highlighted for instance the analysis of the microbiological degradation of progesterone with activated sludge results in the formation of 12 tps yu et al 2018 and for levonorgestrel four tps were identified liu et al 2013 the main transformation reactions include hydrogenations dehydrogenations as well as side chain degradation in the case of progesterone the side chain degradation results in the formation of potent androgens such as 4 adrostene 3 17 dione and 5α dihydrotestosterone yu et al 2018 it is noted that the postulated tps exhibit the intact steroid core thus there is some evidence that the degradation of pgs still leads to endocrine active compounds which can be discharged into receiving waters a prominent example of adverse effects in the aquatic environment caused by steroid transformation was reported by jenkins et al 2004 it was found that androgens can be formed from progesterone by the bacterium mycobacterium smegmatis the researchers hypothesized that environmentally induced masculinization among natural populations of female mosquitofish was caused by the microbiological transformation of plant steroids into progesterone and subsequently to potent androgens these plant steroids were emitted into the rivers by the waste streams of wood pulping processes at local paper mills therefore the transformation of steroids can cause a shift in the steroid selectivity and has to be addressed through the consideration of the tps which are formed overall there is a major lack of understanding of the transformation processes of pgs in wastewater treatment in this context this study was initiated to elucidate the removal of common pgs during biological wastewater treatment therefore we analyzed the biodegradability of nine pgs 17α hydroxyprogesterone medroxyprogesterone acetate chlormadinone acetate cyproterone acetate levonorgestrel dienogest norethisterone acetate etonogestrel drospirenone in aerated lab scale incubation experiments with activated sludge taken from a municipal wwtp furthermore experiments were conducted for the identification of the main tps of six pgs medroxyprogesterone acetate chlormadinone acetate cyproterone acetate dienogest etonogestrel norethisterone acetate finally the identified tps and the parent pgs were analyzed in eight german municipal wwtp effluents 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and compound selection chemical suppliers and further information for the reference standards used in this study are provided in the supporting information tab s1 the parent pgs analyzed in this study as well as their annual consumption volumes in germany for 2018 are shown in table 1 the analyzed steroid substrates were selected based on i the consumption level in germany ii the reported ecotoxicological potency and iii the chemical structure 2 2 removal experiments for the elucidation of the kinetic behavior volumes of 200 ml of freshly sampled activated sludge slurry were filled into 2 l brown glass vessels and were immediately diluted with wwtp effluent from the same wwtp to a final volume of 2 l dilution 1 10 was utilized to reduce sorption onto suspended solids and to minimize matrix effects during chemical analysis the activated sludge was sampled from the aeration tank of a conventional wwtp capacity 320 000 population equivalents sludge retention time approx 12

conditions and temperature and ph were controlled as well no significant drifts and changes were observed within the incubation experiments prior to the addition of the steroids the preparations were allowed to equilibrate for approximately 12 h the kinetic experiments were conducted in triplicate at an initial concentration of 200 ng l of each analyte inactive sterilized control experiments autoclaved at 121 c for 60 min were run in parallel to differentiate between biotic abiotic degradation and to assess the impact of sorption all conducted experiments and their experimental conditions

in weizel et al 2018 2 3 degradation experiments for the identification of transformation products for the degradation experiments 20 ml of freshly sampled activated sludge was filled into 250 ml brown glass vessels and diluted by wwtp effluent to a final volume of 200 ml experiments for tp identification were conducted at an initial analyte concentration of 500 µg l in individual experiments

fiber syringe filters 1 µm gf6 whatman afterwards aliquots of 1 ml were spiked with 2 ng of each isotope labeled internal standard and were stored at 4 c until hrms analysis the samples were not enriched via spe and tp identification was carried out by direct injection of 80 µl filtered sample 2 4 sampling of wwtp effluents the target pgs and their tps were quantified in eight effluents from wwtps in germany details regarding the sample locations are provided in the supporting information tab s2 all sampled wwtps are equipped with conventional activated sludge treatment trains with denitrification and nitrification for quantification and verification of pgs and tps grab samples were taken directly from the wwtp effluents and were immediately cooled with ice during the transport

chromatographic conditions and the gradient used were previously reported in weizel et al 2020 the acquired data were processed by a non target approach automated peak picking and alignment procedures were assessed via a data evaluation script in r r development core team 2008 briefly the xics extracted ion chromatogram were extracted using the xcms package smith et al 2006 the xics were then checked for local maxima after signal to noise calculation sn 3 and further filtering a peak list was generated finally the features were automatically aligned between the samples by comparing m z and retention time of all generated features in all samples the aligned peak lists were obtained by grouping those within a tolerance window of m z 5 ppm and rt 10 s afterwards the aligned peak lists were searched for clear differences in the time courses between spiked batches and non spiked controls for potential tps as criteria for the prioritization of tps an increasing or decreasing trend or an intermediate maximum of the intensity within the incubation time was defined in addition only peaks detected in at least three consecutive samples were considered the tentatively identified tps were verified by the measurements of reference standards through a comparison of retention times rt accurate masses and ms² spectra in those cases without commercially available standards chemical structures of the tps were proposed by characterizing the spectra and comparing these to the ms² fragmentation of related compounds obtained from other experiments in this study quantitative analysis of the analytes was carried out with a triplequad lit ms triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer api 6500 qtrap sciex utilizing the smrm scheduled multiple reaction monitoring mode for sample extraction 500 ml of filtered wwtp effluent 1 µm glass fiber gf6 whatman was spiked with 2 ng of each isotope labeled internal standard and enriched via spe 6 ml 500 mg c18ec chromabond macherey nagel the elution of the target analytes was achieved with methanol the extracts were then evaporated to dryness by a gentle nitrogen stream at 40 c after reconstitution with 0 3 ml n hexane and 0 7 ml acetone the re dissolved extracts were loaded onto dried and pre conditioned silica gel cartridges 1 g 6 ml chromabond sioh machery nagel for sample clean up the cartridges were eluted with acetone n hexane 7 3 afterwards the extracts were evaporated via a gentle nitrogen stream at 40 c and were finally dissolved in 250 µl methanol and 250 µl milli q water before detection the wwtp effluent samples were prepared within 24 h after sampling more details regarding the chemical analysis used in this study can be found in weizel et al 2018 a calibration curve ranging from 0 05 to 500 ng ml was used for quantification all standard solutions and mixes were dissolved in methanol and were diluted accordingly linear regression was applied with a weighting factor 1 x for each analyte stable isotope dilution analysis was used for the correction of ion suppression recoveries were evaluated from spiked wwtp effluents 10 ng l in quadruplicate the calculations of the limits of quantification loqs were based on a signal to noise ratio of 10 either using the detected peaks in the non spiked wwtp effluent samples or the peaks in the spiked samples noise area was selected manually from the baseline that bordered on the chromatographic peak for the determination the 3σ values were used and were extrapolated accordingly results of the method performance are provided in the supporting information tab s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetical behavior of progestogens as model substances four 17α hydroxyprogesterone derivatives 17α hydroxyprogesterone medroxyprogesterone acetate chlormadinone acetate and cyproterone acetate and four 19 nortestosterone derivatives dienogest norethisterone acetate etonogestrel and levonorgestrel were selected and analyzed in addition drospirenone a spironolactone derivative used in hormonal contraception was considered as well the microbiological removal of pgs can be described by pseudo first order kinetics schwarzenbach et al 2005 the determined rate constants kbiol were normalized to the total concentration of suspended solids the rate constants for the aerobic biodegradation ranged from 5 2 l gss d cyproterone acetate to 110 l gss d drospirenone table 3 for 17α hydroxyprogesterone and norethisterone acetate a very fast degradation was observed rate constants for these pgs were not calculated since only very few sampling points exhibited concentrations above the loq the concentrations of the pgs during incubation experiments are shown in fig 1 the comparison of the sterile control experiments and non sterile experiments indicated that biodegradation e g transformation was the major removal process since sorption on suspended solids was negligible fig 1 overall pgs were degraded below their loqs within six hours of incubation except dienogest and cyproterone acetate both pgs were the most recalcitrant steroids in the study however dt50 values dissipation time needed for 50 removal of these were still below 12 h regarding the comparison to literature studies of pgs the kinetic behavior is consistent with previously reported results from a lab scale degradation study chang et al 2011 since the calculated half lives were in the same range in addition the concentrations in german wwtp effluents underscore the behavior of the analyzed pgs as only dienogest and cyproterone acetate could be frequently detected in the effluents up to 4 4 ng l and 3 7 ng l respectively weizel et al 2018 according to the observed kinetics it is very unlikely that pgs with half lives below 1 h in this study 17α hydroxyprogesterone levonorgestrel norethisterone acetate etonogestrel drospirenone are present in municipal wwtp effluents in appreciable concentrations since the total consumption of the individual pgs is relatively low in comparison to other pharmaceuticals however a few studies did report sporadic detections of these pgs vulliet et al 2007 liu et al 2011b liu et al 2014 petrovic et al 2002 endogenous pgs such as progesterone not included in this study or 17α hydroxyprogesterone were frequently detected in wwtp effluents despite their high degradation rates zhang et al 2017 weizel et al 2018 these findings can be linked to the natural origin of this compound leading to much higher influent concentrations in comparison to other pgs schöneshöfer et al 1986 this is also true for other steroid hormones since weizel et al 2020 showed that hydrocortisone was present in wwtp effluents despite the rapid microbial degradation of this compound concerning cyproterone acetate the knowledge that this compound can adversely impact fish at concentrations as low as 1 ng l sharpe et al 2004 and the observed moderate removal it represents a risk for aquatic organisms in surface waters receiving wwtp effluents this is also true for dienogest though reliable data of its impact on aquatic biota are scarce schmid et al 2020 fent 2015 kumar et al 2015 3 2 fate of 17α hydroxyprogesterone derivatives three 17α acetate esters chlormadinone acetate medroxyprogesterone acetate cyproterone acetate were used as steroid substrates for the degradation study an overview of the detected tps is provided in the supporting information tab s3 it should be noted that due to the high initial concentrations used for the tp identification experiments 500 µg l numerous minor tps were detected as well therefore only the main tps are discussed in the following sections moreover a consistent terminology was used for the tps consisting of their monoisotopic mass and retention time during the biodegradation of medroxyprogesterone acetate 18 tps were detected of which two of them were confirmed by the measurement of authentic reference standards tp402 18 1 tp386 21 3 chlormadinone acetate showed the formation of 21 tps one of these was unambiguously identified as the active steroid delmadinone acetate tp402 20 5 via a reference standard for cyproterone acetate 10 tps were detected the main identified tps of medroxyprogesterone acetate were the 1 dehydro tp tp384 20 4 and the 1 isomer tp386 21 3 fig 2 a similar tps tp402 20 6 and tp404 21 0 were found for chlormadinone acetate fig 2b in addition to de hydrogenation of the carbon double bonds the reduction of the 3 keto moiety was observed for chlormadinone acetate which led to the considerable formation of tp404 20 2 and tp406 20 7 these tps were tentatively proposed as the 3α hydroxy derivatives of tp402 20 6 and tp404 21 0 while cyproterone acetate showed only the formation of the main tp 3α hydroxy cyproterone acetate tp418 20 4 to an appreciable extent fig 2c the formation of 3β hydroxy chlormadinone acetate can be excluded as confirmed by the measurement of a reference standard fig 2b since the stereochemistry of the c3 hydroxy group is crucial for the activity and binding affinity of steroids schneider et al 2009 the verification of the chlormadinone tps and other proposed tps should be a subject of further research as stated tp418 20 4 fig 2c was found as the major tp of cyproterone acetate the elevated formation of this tp indicates that the treatment with activated sludge does not eliminate the endocrine activity since c3 reduced tps of the 17α hydroxyprogesterone derivatives are known to still be endocrine active schneider et al 2009 in addition 3α hydroxy steroids tp404 20 2 and tp406 20 7 tp418 20 4 and tp420 20 6 can bind covalently to dna leading to the formation of dna adducts and pronounced genotoxicity kerdar et al 1995 martelli et al 1996 kasper 2001 however of the identified tps only a few of them exhibited more than 10 of the initial peak area of their parent steroid at t0 based on the obtained results we proposed initial degradation pathways for the three analyzed 17α hydroxyprogesterone derivatives fig 3 martelli et al 1996 proposed similar structure relationships for the observed reactivity of cyproterone acetate chlormadinone actetate and megestrol acetate with dna due to the different extent of metabolic 3 keto reduction both results in combination suggest that the activated sludge treatment of megestrol acetate not included in this study might lead to a lesser extent of 3 keto reduction and a higher rate of 1 dehydrogenation as observed for chlormadinone acetate in this study the specific structural moiety responsible for the 3 keto reduction of steroids is most likely the 6 double bond this hypothesis should be addressed in further degradation studies the ring a de hydrogenations of progesterone derivatives varied significantly from those observed for glucocorticoids weizel et al 2020 since glucocorticoids were preferably reduced at the 4 double bond in α position as shown in fig 2 4 hydrogenated tps were detected but with less intensity than the dehydrogenated tps this behavior might be explained by the inhibitory effect of c6 substituents on the reduction of the 4 double bond as described by kuhl 2011 hydrogenation in α position is hampered by the steric configuration e g c6α methyl for medroxyprogesterone the hydrolysis of the 17α ester during the incubation with activated sludge was not observed recently it has been shown that the ester cleavage at position c17 occurs via isomerization while direct hydrolysis is sterically hindered at this position weizel et al 2020 thus the ester hydrolysis can be excluded as a major degradation reaction in biological wastewater treatment of such pgs in addition several minor hydroxylated tps have been identified the hydroxylation was not selective since several isomers were detected for the analyzed steroids fig s3 the hydroxylated tps were formed from all primary de hydrogenated tps and vice versa these tps can be expected as intermediates in the biodegradation route of steroids which can be further transformed to carboxylates and compounds with a broken steroid skeleton e g 9 10 seco pathway within the evaluation of the results minor tps containing a carboxylic moiety were indicated by the characteristic loss of carbon dioxide during ms² fragmentation in addition dechlorinated tps of chlormadinone acetate and cyproterone acetate were identified since these tps were formed to a small degree dechlorination seems not to be a significant degradation pathway of chlormadinone acetate and cyproterone acetate in microbiological wastewater treatment however the dechlorination of cyproterone acetate was previously reported in fish tissue liu et al 2019 the elucidation of the exact structures of these secondary tertiary or higher tps was out of the scope of this study since our work focused on the main primary tps which are formed to an appreciable degree 3 3 fate of 19 nortestosterone derivatives steroids of this type are characterized by a 17α ethinyl group cyanomethyl in case of dienogest and the missing methyl group at c19 the identified tps of the 19 nortestosterone derivatives dienogest norethisterone acetate and etonogestrel are summarized in the supporting information tab s4 three main tps tp309 11 9 tp309 16 4 and tp327 13 0 were detected for dienogest fig 4 a further 20 tps were detected with a maximum formation of less than 5 of the initial peak area of dienogest as shown in fig 4b etonogestrel was degraded to four main tps tp326 20 8 tp324 20 6 tp344 16 4 and tp374 15 7 here 22 tps minor with maximum peak areas below 5 of the initial peak area of the precursor were tentatively identified the degradation of norethisterone acetate revealed the formation of three major tps norethisterone tp300 19 8 tp318 13 8 fig 4c and further 30 tps with less than 5 of the initial peak area of the precursor the main tps observed for all analyzed model compounds were 5α hydrogenated derivatives tp326 20 8 tp300 19 8 and also hydroxylated tps of the parent steroids tp327 13 0 tp344 16 4 tp318 13 8 moreover the large number of different tps emphasized that many transformation reactions are responsible for the removal of the steroids during wastewater treatment with activated sludge for instance the insertion of one or more hydroxyl groups was not regioselective since in those cases several isomers could be detected and thus numerous tps were formed fig s4 similar to the 17α hydroxy progesterone derivatives several carboxylates were tentatively identified fig s2 by their characteristic loss of carbon dioxide in the ms² fragmentation in the lab scale experiments norethisterone acetate prodrug was rapidly hydrolyzed to its active human metabolite norethisterone tp298 18 3 kuhl 2011 in contrast to the 17α acetate esters discussed in section 3 2 the 17β position is favored for the initial ester hydrolysis on the other hand the 17α ethinyl and the nitrile group of dienogest were not degraded as was already consistently reported cirja et al 2007 cajthaml et al 2009 in addition the initial 4 hydrogenation was confirmed since tp300 19 8 was identified as 5α dihydro norethisterone via the measurement of an authentic reference standard this tp is known to interact with the progestogen and estrogen receptors larrea et al 2001 analogous to the confirmed results of norethisterone acetate the major tps of etonogestrel were proposed as the 4 hydrogenated product tp326 20 8 and the 1 isomer of etonogestrel tp324 20 6 final confirmation of the etonogestrel tps was impossible since reference compounds were not available recently similar transformation was found during the microbial degradation of levonorgestrel in soil tang et al 2019 activated sludge liu et al 2013 and by freshwater microalgae peng et al 2014 although tetrahydrogenated products 3α 5α 3β 5α tetrahydro tps are known as human metabolites lemus et al 2009 such tps were not detected in our experiments in addition the 1 dehydrogenated derivatives of norethisterone tp296 17 5 and etonogestrel tp322 19 6 were detected to a lesser extent 5 the behavior was consistent with the observed de hydrogenations of glucocorticoids weizel et al 2020 3 4 aromatization of ring a in addition to the tps mentioned above the formation of an aromatized ring a was found for all 19 nortestosterone steroids the elucidation of the tps revealed the formation of 17α ethinylestradiol tp296 18 5 ee2 by the aromatization of norethisterone fig 5 which was unambiguously confirmed via its reference standard for dienogest and etonogestrel similar tps were detected tp309 16 4 tp322 20 0 fig s5 and thus the obtained results indicate that 19 nortestosterone pgs can be converted to highly potent estrogenic steroids during biological wastewater treatment moreover ee2 reached concentrations as high as 7 after 24 h of the initial concentration of the precursor this suggests that the transformation of 0 5 ng l norethisterone can lead to the formation of 0 035 ng l ee2 worst case concerning the proposed european environmental quality standard of the water framework directive eu decision 2015 for ee2 0 035 ng l the biotransformation of elevated norethisterone concentrations might be significant for environmental ee2 concentrations and especially when determining the removal of ee2 in wwtps the aromatization leading to estrogen like tps was not detected for the 17α hydroxyprogesterone derivatives due to the c19 methyl group an oxidative elimination of the methyl group is needed for the formation of the phenolic ring a the enzymatically mediated conversion of c19 methyl steroids into estrogens requires specific enzymes such as aromatase cyp19 kao et al 2001 in the case of 19 nortestosterone derivatives dehydrogenation followed by enolisation of the 3 oxo moiety leads to the formation of the phenolic ring a this transformation reaction can likely be mediated by bacteria from activated sludge as it was identified in this study 19 nortestosterone derivatives were found to metabolize to estrogens in the liver of human adults without the presence of aromatase thus a similar mechanism of the aromatization was assumed kuhnz et al 1997 kuhl and wiegratz 2007 in addition sulfate conjugates of the corresponding aromatized tps were detected tp376 14 6 tp389 12 9 tp402 16 7 which is consistent with the reported behavior of ee2 and other estrogens during activated sludge treatment yi and harper 2007 the consideration of the fragmentation spectra ms² spectra are provided in the supporting information indicated that the sulfate groups are bonded to the aromatized moiety phenolic sulfate conjugate thus these findings indicated the formation of an aromatized site as only the cleavage of so3 m z 79 9568 da could be observed without the presence of hso4 m z 96 9596 da which is characteristic for phenolic sulfate conjugates weidolf et al 1988 these results supported the proposed structure for the estrogen like tps indirectly based on the identified tps an initial degradation pathway was proposed and illustrated exemplarily for norethisterone acetate in fig 6 3 5 occurrence of pgs and their tps in wwtp effluents the occurrence of the pgs from table 1 and their main tps was analyzed in eight wwtp effluents before the analysis recoveries and detection limits were determined for the targeted steroids results of the method performance are provided in the supporting information tab s5 the recoveries ranged between 84 tp388 21 6 and 115 drospirenone while the loqs ranged from 0 3 ng l dienogest to 5 6 ng l chlormadinol acetate as recently indicated weizel et al 2018 cyproterone acetate and dienogest were ubiquitously detected in the wwtp effluents table 4 in addition to these chlormadinone acetate 3 8 and endogenous 17α hydroxyprogesterone 8 8 were frequently detected these results are consistent with the relative consumption of pgs in germany table 4 as dienogest and cyproterone acetate have the highest consumption levels furthermore both compounds were only moderately degraded in the lab experiments as a consequence relatively high concentrations were found in german wwtp effluents the cyproterone acetate concentrations were above 7 ng l in two wwtp effluents and dienogest was detected up to 3 7 ng l especially the high cyproterone acetate concentrations are of ecological relevance since the concentrations were significantly higher than the compound s lowest observed effect concentration of 1 ng l sharpe et al 2004 in addition the screening for the identified tps revealed the occurrence of two dienogest and one cyproterone acetate tp tps of other pgs were not detected likely due to the low consumption of these steroids in germany the 3 oxo reduced tp of cyproterone acetate tp418 20 4 was detected in all wwtp effluents an estimation of the concentration using the cyproterone acetate calibration revealed elevated concentrations up to 8 1 ng l fig s6 tps of dienogest tp309 16 4 and tp327 11 3 were detected in all wwtp effluents the 6β hydroxy tp tp327 11 3 was found with concentrations up to 1 6 ng l since 6β hydroxy dienogest is a human metabolite as well the observation that only a limited quantity of this tp was formed in the degradation experiments its occurrence might be attributed to the incomplete removal in the wwtps rather than by its formation tp309 16 4 was tentatively identified as the ring a aromatized tp of dienogest with an estrogen like structure this tp was detected in all wwtp effluents similar to the tp of cyproterone acetate an estimation of the concentration was made via the calibration of dienogest this approach revealed partially very high concentrations up to 16 ng l in all cases the concentration of the tp was higher than that of dienogest fig s6 however an accurate quantification of the detected tps has to be addressed in further research 4 conclusions the results of pg analysis enabled new insights into the structure stability relationship of synthetic steroids 17α hydroxyprogesterone derivatives were degraded initially at ring a via carbon double bond de hydrogenations a 6 double bond promotes the 3 keto reduction which was particularly pronounced for cyproterone acetate due to the inhibition of the 1 dehydrogenation by the cyclopropane moiety 19 nortestosterone derivatives showed the formation of estrogen like tps by the aromatization of ring a leading to a shift in the receptor binding capability there is evidence that many tps are still biologically active thus tp formation must be taken into account for the environmental risk profile these outcomes reinforce that it is mandatory to consider tp formation of steroids as an assessment criterion for industrial discharge permissions into municipal wwtps with biological treatment trains most pgs were degraded within six hours in contact with activated sludge only cyproterone acetate and dienogest showed moderate stability half lives of 8 65 h and 4 55 h cyproterone acetate and dienogest as well as their main tps were ubiquitously discharged into the environment from german wwtps both tps could be significant drivers of anthropogenically induced endocrine activity in the environment detected concentrations of pgs and tps
