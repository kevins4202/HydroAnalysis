1655,the generation of acid mine drainage amd remains a major environmental challenge for the mining industry the reclamation of old mine sites with pre oxidized tailings is particularly challenging because of indirect oxidation reactions which can limit the overall effectiveness of an oxygen barrier to prevent amd the goal of this project was to quantitatively compare the effectiveness of different cover systems to reclaim two pre oxidized acid generating tailings sites located in quebec canada following laboratory column tests field measurements and observations coupled hydrogeological and geochemical numerical simulations were conducted to evaluate the effect of various system characteristics cover performance was assessed by simulating the evolution of the degree of water saturation pore water pressures oxygen fluxes and leachate quality several reclamation options including monolayer covers and two or three layer covers with capillary barrier effect s were simulated the simulations indicate that because of reduced cover effectiveness with pre oxidized tailings the general design targets developed for non oxidized tailings may not always be directly applicable to already oxidized tailings the simulations also illustrate how the behaviour and efficiency of a monolayer cover placed over reactive tailings depend on specific factors including water table position initial porewater chemistry and cover materials hydrogeological properties and thicknesses the results indicate that under a given set of conditions a bilayer cover with a capillary break above the reactive tailings would not significantly improve cover performance compared to a monolayer cover due to water losses by evaporation the simulations show however that a well designed three layer cover with capillary barrier effects ccbe would be efficient in reducing the oxygen flux and amd generation even in the case of highly pre oxidized tailings the outcomes from this investigation highlight some of the advantages of carrying out coupled hydrogeological and geochemical simulations to assess the long term behaviour of reclaimed mining sites keywords acid generating tailings multilayer cover systems ccbe monolayer elevated water table hydrogeological simulations reactive transport 1 introduction tailings produced by hard rock mines are usually stored in surface disposal facilities often called impoundments when they contain iron sulfides tailings can react with oxygen and water to generate acid mine drainage amd amd is usually characterized by a low ph and high concentrations of dissolved metals and sulfates e g aubertin et al 2002 blowes et al 2003 2014 lindsay et al 2015 nordstrom et al 2015 effluent treatment can be used during mine operations but this is neither a sustainable nor a viable solution in the long term aubertin et al 2015 2016 it is much more efficient to prevent the oxidation reactions from occurring at the source several control and reclamation approaches exist to control oxidation including various types of cover systems aiming at controlling oxygen and or water fluxes to the reactive tailings e g aubertin et al 2002 reclamation of reactive mine waste disposal sites is best achieved when it is planned in advance and integrated into the mining production cycle according to the principle of designing for closure e g srk 1989 aubertin and chapuis 1991 hutchison and ellison 1992 aubertin et al 2002 2016 this allows preventing the production of acidic waters however in some cases and especially for old mine sites tailings have been left exposed for decades and can produce large quantities of amd the pore water is then already acidic and heavily contaminated the reclamation of these sites is more complex due in large part to indirect oxidation reactions that occur when the ph is acidic nicholson 1994 williamson and rimstidt 1994 kirby et al 1999 nordstrom 2000 in this case fe iii remains in solution and can play the role of oxidant indirect oxidation reactions are typically much faster than direct oxidation reactions and they produce more acid e g williamson and rimstidt 1994 indirect oxidation can affect the overall effectiveness of an oxygen barrier to prevent amd and should be taken into account when designing a cover system for a pre oxidized tailings impoundment the goal of this paper is to quantitatively compare the effectiveness of different cover options to reclaim pre oxidized tailings impoundments the paper focuses on the behaviour of two acid generating tailings disposal sites sites a and b located in the abitibi region in quebec canada for site a the reclamation method initially considered involved the addition of a single layer of slightly alkaline non acid generating tailings produced at a nearby mine onto the pre oxidized reactive tailings with a limited rise of the water table position in the old impoundment to help increase the degree of saturation the tailings impoundment at site b has already been covered by 1 to 2 m of a widely graded and heterogeneous till extracted in the vicinity of the site the water table in this case is well below the reactive tailings surface the hydrogeological and geochemical behaviour of these two tailings cover systems was assessed experimentally and numerically to determine the efficiency of monolayer covers under the actual or anticipated field conditions the program included fieldwork and a series of column tests conducted in the laboratory pabst 2011 pabst et al 2014 2017a b the experimental data obtained from the laboratory tests were used to validate and calibrate numerical models constructed with vadose w geoslope int ltd version 2007 and min3p mayer and benner 1999 mayer et al 2002 the effect of various influence factors such as climatic conditions cover thickness depth of the water table and material properties were specifically addressed pabst 2011 pabst et al 2017a b in this paper alternative cover configurations are analysed using the same cover materials and other materials available locally the efficiency of the cover systems at limiting oxygen ingress is evaluated using different approaches first the oxygen flux reaching the reactive tailings is evaluated for each system and set of conditions using the code vadose w geo slope int ltd a cover is usually considered efficient when it can achieve at least the same performance as a 1 m thick still water cover with an oxygen flux equal to or less than about 50 g m2 y aubertin et al 1999 dagenais 2005 the degree of saturation sr in the moisture retaining layer mrl is also a good indicator for the efficiency of an oxygen barrier a degree of saturation sr 85 usually implies that oxygen diffusion will be low enough to prevent amd e g ricard et al 1997 1999 bussière et al 2003 mbonimpa et al 2003 dagenais et al 2006 finally the simulated water quality obtained from reactive transport modelling carried out with min3p mayer and benner 1999 mayer et al 2002 is also used as a direct indication of the cover performance the combination of these various indicators obtained using two different numerical codes helped assess the performance of these cover systems this paper presents and discusses the main results from this parametric analysis which complements previous experimental work and provides recommendations for the reclamation of pre oxidized tailings impoundments in relatively humid climates previous work mainly focused on monolayer covers coupled with an elevated water table pabst et al 2017a b this paper compares the performance of monolayer bilayer and multilayer covers to control amd generation from pre oxidized tailings this assessment is based on coupled hydrogeochemical simulations calibrated on experimental results the effect of climatic conditions water table depth tailings and cover material properties and cover thickness are specifically addressed the approach and results presented here have helped the decision process for selecting the final cover design at one of the targeted tailings disposal sites 2 background on reclamation of acid generating tailings sites under relatively humid climatic conditions i e where the water balance is positive most of the year prevention of amd usually relies on controlling oxygen flux with water or a nearly saturated porous medium e g collin 1987 nicholson et al 1989 aachib et al 1994 1998 2004 water covers typically consist of disposing reactive mine tailings under at least 1 m of water e g li 1997 yanful and catalan 2002 mbonimpa et al 2008 awoh et al 2013 the oxygen diffusive flux in water being approximately 10 000 times lower than in air the oxygen supply is then sufficiently small that the generation of amd remains negligible although generally effective for preventing the oxidation of reactive tailings this approach can be complex and costly to implement particularly for older artificial impoundments also building dikes that will last the indefinite lifetime of tailings ponds is a major challenge aubertin et al 1997 2016 vick 2001 another approach to control amd generation relies on the use of engineered soil covers these include multilayered covers made of several soils placed on top of each other aubertin and chapuis 1991 hutchison and ellison 1992 aubertin et al 2002 the number of layers can vary depending on the design the climate and the position of the water table aubertin et al 1995 1999 for instance a typical 3 layer cover is made of a 0 5 to 1 m thick mrl made of fine grained material sandwiched between two 30 to 50 cm thick coarse grained material layers aubertin et al 1994 1999 2006 bussière et al 2003 2006 bussière 2007 the coarser material layers are expected to drain easily and rapidly reaching a low volumetric water content and low unsaturated hydraulic conductivity thus preventing both water rise and loss by evaporation and drainage from the fine grained layer the mrl can therefore remain nearly saturated over a relatively long time hence limiting oxygen diffusion to the underlying reactive tailings over time this fine grained material could eventually desaturate but it can be expected that natural precipitation would provide sufficient recharge so it can remain highly saturated at all time these types of covers which are referred to as covers with capillary barrier effects ccbes have been proven efficient at several mine sites including les terrains aurifères lta mcmullen et al 1997 ricard et al 1999 bussière et al 2006 and lorraine dagenais et al 2002 2005 as an alternative to water covers and multilayered covers the elevated water table ewt approach relies on controlling the water table level and degree of saturation of the reactive tailings orava et al 1997 the technique essentially consists of raising and maintaining the water table to a depth less than the height of the capillary fringe dagenais 2005 ouangrawa et al 2006 2009 2010 a layer of granular material a monolayer cover is usually placed above the reactive tailings with an ewt a coarse grained material cover helps with the recharge and limits water loss by evaporation dagenais et al 2006 while a fine grained material cover may promote water retention through the capillary rise and prevent oxygen diffusion demers et al 2008 the efficiency of the monolayer cover is then highly dependent on the water table position e g cosset and aubertin 2010 dobchuk et al 2013 when well designed and implemented the ewt technique can be quite efficient to limit the generation of amd dagenais 2005 ouangrawa 2007 demers et al 2008 2009 ethier et al 2014 2016 while having been fairly well studied the performance of mono and multilayered cover systems has until now mainly been assessed for non oxidized tailings and the design recommendations e g layer thickness and properties water table position made only for fresh tailings at ongoing or recently closed mining sites one of the objectives of this paper is therefore to assess cover performance for pre oxidized tailings at two mine sites and to compare the results with general design targets developed for non oxidized tailings 3 methodology 3 1 materials four types of materials were considered in the present study reactive tailings ta and tb non reactive tailings ca and till cover material cb reactive tailings ta and tb were sampled from sites a and b respectively non acid generating tailings ca used as cover material on tailings ta were provided by the operating mine involved in the reclamation work the till cb used for the cover on site b was sampled at the same time as tailings tb these four materials have been extensively characterized in the laboratory pabst 2011 pabst et al 2014 while field data including in situ porosity reaction rate coefficient volumetric water content and water table depth were also measured pabst 2011 the water retention curve wrc was also evaluated for each material using modified tempe cells with the experimental results fitted with the van genuchten 1980 model the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat was measured in flexible wall permeameters the experimental ksat values obtained from these permeameter tests were compared and validated with predictive estimates obtained from the kozeny carman kc equation chapuis and aubertin 2003 and the kozeny carman modified kcm equation mbonimpa et al 2002 the permeability function was obtained using the mualem 1976 formulation based on the approximate analytical solution proposed by van genuchten 1980 the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the different materials under various degrees of saturation could thus be estimated the parameters used in the numerical models are summarized in fig 1 and table 1 in addition to the two reactive tailings ta and tb and the two cover materials ca non acid generating tailings and cb natural till two non acid generating waste rocks wr1 and wr2 were also considered in this study their coarse grain size distribution can be expected to contribute to the development of a capillary break with the finer materials ca and cb in two or three layer ccbes the properties of the waste rock wr1 and wr2 were taken from dawood et al 2011 fig 1 and table 1 both waste rocks have a hydraulic conductivity comparable to a sandy soil wr2 is slightly coarser than wr1 which has little effect on the saturated hydraulic conductivity but is more noticeable with the estimated water retention curves fig 1 the residual water content θr is relatively high around 0 06 i e sr 24 because of the significant proportion of fine grained particles in these waste rocks dawood et al 2011 also see peregoedova 2012 oxygen consumption tests conducted for this project gosselin 2007 gosselin et al 2012 gave a reaction rate coefficient kr 3 10 5 s 1 for tailings ta and kr 1 10 5 s 1 for tailings tb the cover materials ca and cb can be considered non reactive as no significant oxygen consumption was measured waste rocks wr1 and wr2 are also assumed to be non reactive the effective diffusion coefficient de was measured in diffusion cells following the procedures described by mbonimpa et al 2003 2011 and aachib et al 2004 experimental results indicate that the collin and rasmuson 1988 model used in vadose w and the related aachib et al 2004 model used in min3p accurately represent the effective diffusion coefficient de pabst et al 2014 the mineralogical compositions of reactive tailings ta and tb and cover materials ca and cb are given in table 2 these values were included in the hydrogeochemical model min3p reactive tailings ta and tb contain a relatively high proportion of pyrite respectively around 12 0 and 4 0 by weight cover material ca contains about 5 5 calcite and 2 0 dolomite while 2 0 calcite but no dolomite was measured in cover material cb both ca and cb are rich in albite respectively 47 0 and 28 5 by weight a relatively high content of anorthite 10 was identified in the cover material ca xrd measurements were repeated on each of these four materials before and after the column tests but no significant variations were observed waste rocks wr1 and wr2 not used in these column tests were assumed non reactive no sulfides and for the purpose of the models assumed made only of quartz 3 2 laboratory column tests large instrumented columns 230 cm high 14 5 cm internal diameter were set up in the laboratory to provide representative large scale experimental results for the validation and calibration if needed of numerical models columns contained 170 cm of reactive tailings ta or tb covered by 30 to 40 cm of cover materials ca or cb a total of 19 wetting and drying cycles were applied during the column tests the reference position of the water table was set at 90 cm below the base of the columns i e about 260 cm below the reactive tailings surface the top of each column was open to the atmosphere each column was instrumented with pore water pressure water content and oxygen sensors water was regularly added at the top of the columns and sampled at their base and analysed a detailed description of the column tests can be found in pabst 2011 and pabst et al 2014 the methodology is similar to that developed over several years by the authors research group aachib et al 1994 1998 aubertin et al 1995 1999 bussière et al 2004 ouangrawa et al 2010 demers et al 2011 3 3 validation of numerical simulations vadose w 2007 geoslope int ltd was used in this study to simulate water flow and oxygen diffusion in the tailings cover systems vadose w is a finite element code that includes variable climatic boundary conditions surface ponding and soil atmosphere liquid and gaseous phase exchange this commercial code has been commonly used to assess the behaviour of tailings and covers e g shackelford and benson 2006 adu wusu and yanful 2007 gosselin 2007 cissokho 2007 demers et al 2009 martin et al 2010 kalonji kabambi et al 2017 oxygen flux in vadose w is simulated using reaction rate coefficients reported above evaporation in vadose w is simulated using the penman wilson equation wilson 1990 reactive transport hydro geochemical simulations were conducted using min3p a 3d finite volume numerical model developed for simulating 3d reactive transport including variably saturated flow diffusive gas transport sulfide mineral oxidation and kinetic or equilibrium controlled geochemical reactions mayer and benner 1999 mayer et al 2002 the model has been previously tested verified and applied to several studies of acid mine drainage e g jurjovec et al 2004 molson et al 2005 2008 ouangrawa et al 2009 demers et al 2013 sulfide oxidation reactions and oxygen fluxes were simulated in min3p based in part on the input mineralogy table 2 although only direct oxidation is simulated in min3p indirect oxidation reactions were taken into account by calibrating the reactive transport model based on column tests pabst et al 2017b since min3p cannot simulate evaporation the same way as vadose w does water fluxes either positive or negative at the surface of the simulated columns were therefore imported from the vadose w simulation results and applied as boundary conditions in the min3p column models the resulting water content and suction profiles within the tailings and cover systems were identical to vadose w results also oxygen fluxes simulated in vadose w were input as boundary conditions in min3p to facilitate the comparison between the two codes 3 4 simulation of basic field conditions numerical models were validated and calibrated using the results from laboratory column tests a detailed description of the numerical modelling of the column tests and their calibration is presented by pabst et al 2017a for the hydrogeological behaviour simulations and pabst et al 2017b for the hydrogeochemical reactive transport response models after the numerical models were validated they were expanded to simulate alternate scenarios initially based on field conditions observed at the two mine sites abitibi region quebec a climatic boundary condition based on daily local field data including air temperatures relative humidity precipitation and wind speed obtained from environment canada fig 2 was applied at the surface of the model year 2009 was used as a reference case most of the fieldwork was carried out that year the simulations were run for ten years with the same climatic boundary conditions each year hydrogeological simulation results showed no significant variations from one year to the next and are thus only presented over a single year year 10 during the four winter months dec march the surface of the simulated site was considered frozen and consequently there was no water or gas movement in the cover during this period in some cases the environmental conditions applied in the model were altered to simulate a drought and to assess the corresponding response of the cover system s dry periods can significantly affect the performance of oxygen barriers that rely on precipitation recharge to replenish water losses and maintain a high degree of saturation for these simulations the imposed recharge in the months of july and august day 180 to day 240 was nil with the other parameters remaining unchanged in such cases the yearly precipitation was reduced to 631 mm while it is around 844 mm for a normal year a two month drought in this part of canada is rather extreme and has been considered a worst case scenario for cover design e g ricard et al 1997 1999 different cases with various water table elevations were simulated water table elevation in situ may vary over time and location the considered design in the various simulations was 2 m 4 m and 6 m below the tailings cover interface an additional case with a water table located 1 m below reactive tailings ta was also simulated such a situation is not representative of current or achievable conditions for site b the water table was imposed at the base of the models 10 m below the reactive tailings surface to avoid numerical conflicts between the climatic and hydrogeological boundary conditions the simulated water table during severe evaporative phases can therefore be deeper than imposed this allows for a more accurate assessment of the ewt technique and the performance of the monolayer cover as an evaporation barrier 3 5 simulated cover configurations three different types and configurations of oxygen barrier cover systems were simulated fig 3 monolayer covers made of non acid generating tailings ca or till cb with different thicknesses varying from 1 to 4 m bilayer covers with a 1 m to 3 m thick mrl made of ca or cb installed on top of 1 m of coarse grained material wr1 or wr2 which acts as a capillary break layer multilayer covers where a 1 m thick retention layer ca or cb is placed between two coarse grained material layers wr1 or wr2 the coarse layer at the base is 1 m thick and the coarse layer on top is 0 5 m this layered system represents a ccbe designed to act as an oxygen barrier e g aubertin et al 1995 1999 2002 bussière et al 1998 2003 the results of the hydrogeological simulations are first presented in terms of degree of saturation and pore water pressures in critical profiles only the top 5 m of the tailings vertical profile are shown in the figures for clarity reactive tailings are actually 10 m thick in the models annual oxygen fluxes at the surface of the cover are also calculated as cumulated daily values over one year sum of oxygen fluxes calculated for each day of the simulations including a zero flux over the winter months 4 results 4 1 monolayer covers for different water table positions 4 1 1 hydrogeological behaviour the effect of the water table depth on the performance of 1 m thick monolayer covers was investigated for non acid generating tailings ca and till cb the water table depth was varied from 1 m for taca or 2 m for tbcb to 6 m below the tailings cover interface the simulated degree of saturation is shown over time at a position 10 cm above the tailings cover interface fig 4a results are shown for different water table depths over a one year period starting on january 1st day 1 the evolution of the degree of saturation in the cover follows several stages first during the winter months at the beginning of each year day 1 to 90 approximately the cover is frozen and it is assumed that there is no oxygen flux through the cover upon thawing in april day 90 the degree of saturation in the cover rapidly increases due to snowmelt and infiltration and reaches its maximum value within a few days or weeks the cover remains at that degree of saturation for up to about 20 days depending on the cases the degree of saturation then progressively decreases due to both downward drainage and evaporation this decrease lasts for about 50 to 80 days until mid summer day 200 the degree of saturation then oscillates for the rest of the year as it varies with water losses and rain events during autumn frost starts again in december day 330 the degree of saturation in the cover depends on the water table position as it tends to decrease when the water table depth increases for a 1 m thick monolayer cover the minimum value of the degree of saturation 10 cm above the tailings cover interface around mid summer day 200 for cover ca is about 50 when the water table is 6 m below the tailings cover interface 60 for a depth of 4 m and around 80 and 90 for a depth of 2 m and 1 m respectively the degree of saturation in the monolayer cover is also a function of the cover material properties the degree of saturation for cover cb sandy till is typically lower than for ca silty tailings for example around day 200 sr is between 10 and 20 lower in cb than in ca independently of the water table position the vertical profiles of the degree of saturation in mid summer around day 200 which corresponds to one of the lowest values of sr fig 4b indicate that covers are dryer closer to the surface the difference in degree of saturation between the top and the bottom of the cover can vary from only a few percent to 40 depending on the water table position and cover material results also show that reactive tailings ta and tb are close to saturation sr 95 at that point even when the water table is as deep as 6 m below the tailings cover interface the pore water pressure profiles fig 4c indicate that the effect of evaporation is significant creating high suctions close to the surface this suction produces an upward flow component that contributes to moisture loss to the atmosphere evaporation also has a major influence on the pore pressures throughout the cover but it may have a more limited effect on the underlying reactive tailings depending on the cover material with cover material ca the suction in tailings ta is much higher than at equilibrium for example the pore water pressure head at a depth of 1 m below the tailings cover interface wt 1 m is around 1 1 m 2 1 m at wt 2 m 4 1 m at wt 4 m and 5 9 m at wt 6 m while it should be in the absence of evaporation 0 m 1 m 3 m and 5 m respectively these values indicate that the 1 m thick monolayer cover ca which has hydrogeological properties similar to tailings ta fig 1 does not prevent evaporation and moisture loss from the underlying reactive tailings and that the positive effect of an ewt cannot be maintained under these conditions this explains why tailings ta are somewhat desaturated close to the surface even though their air entry value aev 6 8 m is higher than the depth to the water table in this case evaporation affects reactive tailings ta over a depth of several meters with cover material cb however the difference between the expected and simulated suction 1 m below the tailings cover interface is only a few centimetres these results confirm that cover material cb sandy till is more effective to prevent evaporation from the underlying tailings than ca silty tailings because of a stronger hydrogeological contrast between cb and tb than between ca and ta these results are in agreement with those of dagenais et al 2006 in the tbcb case evaporation affects only the top 70 cm or so of the monolayer cover in this instance desaturation of tailings tb is essentially due to downward drainage and to their relatively low aev 2 m 4 1 2 oxygen fluxes calculating the oxygen flux at the surface through a cover system can be performed to assess its efficiency to limit oxidation of the reactive tailings the oxygen flux through a cover varies over time depending on the local and global degree of saturation fig 5 while oxygen flux is zero during the winter when the ground is frozen it remains very low upon snow melting while the cover remains nearly saturated until around day 130 fig 4 oxygen flux then increases quickly when covers ca and cb desaturate the dryer the cover the greater the increase in oxygen flux the flux then varies during the summer and autumn increasing during dry spells and decreasing after rain events daily oxygen flux with ca can reach 10 g m2 day when the water table is located 6 m below the surface of tailings ta but remains below 1 g m2 day when it is 1 m deep daily oxygen fluxes with cb are between 3 and 5 g m2 day during the second half of the year and increase when the water table is deeper cumulative annual fluxes sum of daily values over one year for the different configurations of a monolayer cover are summarized in table 3 the simulated fluxes confirm the previous observations that a monolayer cover ca can be efficient i e oxygen flux 50 g m2 y when the water table is located 2 m below the reactive tailings cover interface a water table located 1 m or less below the interface can be very efficient with simulated oxygen fluxes 7 g m2 y even with a relatively thin 1 m cover for tailings tb the relatively coarse grain size of the till leads to desaturation of the cover cb the oxygen flux is then 50 g m2 y even though tailings tb are less reactive than ta additional calculations not shown here see pabst 2011 indicate that these two single layer covers are even less efficient during dry years due to more pronounced desaturation of covers ca and cb 4 1 3 water chemistry the assessment of the oxygen flux only partially accounts for the contribution of indirect oxidation which does not require oxygen to the generation of amd reactive transport simulations were therefore carried out to more accurately assess the effectiveness of the cover systems to prevent amd generation from the already partially oxidized tailings ta and tb these simulations were carried out over 10 years to properly assess the trends that may develop after installation of the cover the initial pore water chemistry assumed in the simulations was based on laboratory column tests pabst et al 2017b and the initial ph can therefore be relatively high as was observed in the column tests samples collected in situ contained buffering minerals table 2 but these were removed in the models and replaced by quartz to allow for a more direct comparison of the performance of the various cover systems in terms of amd generation in the longer term this also matches in situ observations showing that pore waters at sites a and b are already strongly acidic e g aubertin et al 1995 1999 pabst 2011 ethier et al 2014 2016 indicating that the buffer capacity has already been exhausted at these locations the behaviour of a 1 m thick monolayer cover ca or cb placed over reactive tailings ta fig 6 or tb fig 7 respectively was assessed results ph sulfate iron and zinc concentrations are presented at z 1 m reactive transport modelling partially confirms the hydrogeological simulations for tailings ta and cover ca the deeper the water table the more amd is generated for example when the water table is located 6 m below the tailings cover interface the simulated ph at z 1 m is as low as 1 8 and sulfate concentrations exceed 4000 ppm after 10 years when the water table is only 1 m below the interface the ph is 3 8 and sulfate concentrations are 80 mg l fig 6 zinc concentrations are below 4 mg l after 10 years when the water table is 1 m deep around 20 mg l when it is 2 m deep and 200 and 350 mg l when it is 4 m and 6 m deep respectively other dissolved metals and contaminants show similar trends pabst 2011 the hydrogeochemical simulations also provide additional insight compared to the hydrogeological modelling for instance it seems that variations in oxygen fluxes between the different cases for tbcb table 3 are not associated with significant changes in the water quality fig 7 the ph remains around 2 5 and sulfate concentrations around 2500 ppm after 10 years regardless of the water table depth also there is still significant amd production in the case of taca when the water table is shallower than 2 m even though the oxygen flux is 50 g m2 y the ph remains between 3 and 4 and sulfate concentrations still exceed 200 mg l this could indicate that the usual target of 50 g m2 y for the oxygen flux may not be sufficient or relevant in the case of pre oxidized tailings at least for the period simulated in the models 4 2 monolayer covers with different cover thicknesses 4 2 1 hydrogeological behaviour the simulations shown above indicated that evaporation was responsible for a large part of water losses in the monolayer covers made of either ca or cb a thicker cover usually may help reduce adverse effects of evaporation and other atmospheric conditions like freeze thaw cycles for example subsequent simulations were thus carried out to assess the effect of cover thickness on its performance for 1 m 2 m and 4 m thick covers made of non acid generating tailings ca and till cb the water table was set 4 m below the tailings cover interface a depth at which a 1 m monolayer cover was not sufficient to prevent oxygen diffusion and amd generation variations of the degree of saturation 10 cm above the tailings cover interface over one year are presented in fig 8 these results indicate that the monolayer cover thickness has a limited effect on the degree of saturation 10 cm above the tailings cover interface fig 8 the degree of saturation between the different simulated cases is relatively similar during most of the year independent of the cover thickness however variations of sr are more progressive for thicker covers and less dependent on rain events in general the increase in degree of saturation is less in thicker covers upon snow melting but the degree of saturation remains higher during the summer and autumn simulated profiles of the degree of saturation at day 200 not shown here but similar to fig 4 confirm the previous observations evaporation can significantly decrease the degree of saturation close to the surface but the bottom of thicker covers remains more saturated than thinner covers as an example at 50 cm above the interface considering a water table located at 4 m the degree of saturation of cover ca is 56 when the monolayer cover is 1 m thick 68 when it is 2 m thick and 78 when it is 4 m thick these monolayer covers independent of their thickness appear to be ineffective in maintaining the degree of saturation in the cover around or above 85 throughout the year when the water table is deeper than 4 m reactive tailings ta and tb remain close to saturation 95 independent of the cover thickness however pore pressures indicate that evaporation can affect the cover and the reactive tailings in the case of thin covers over several meters with a 1 m thick monolayer cover ca evaporation can affect the reactive tailings up to a depth of several meters while its effect does not exceed 1 m in the case of a 4 m thick cover with cb the effect of evaporation does not exceed 50 cm below the surface of the cover for all cases 4 2 2 oxygen fluxes the effect of different cover thicknesses on oxygen flux was also assessed table 4 results indicate that a thicker cover is generally more efficient at limiting oxygen ingress for example in the case of tailings ta and cover material ca with a water table located 4 m below the tailings cover interface the cumulative annual oxygen flux to the tailings is 552 g m2 y with a 1 m thick cover and 216 g m2 y when it is 4 m thick similar results were obtained in the case of tailings tb where cumulative annual oxygen flux to the tailings decreases when cover thickness increases in these cases however the oxygen flux generally remains above the usual target of 50 g m2 y thus confirming previous results suggesting that such a monolayer cover ca or cb would not be effective for preventing amd in the case of a relatively deep water table wt 2 m previous analyses indicate that keeping the cover ca close to saturation requires a water table no deeper than 2 m below the tailings cover interface increasing the cover thickness can also help decrease the oxygen flux from 62 g m2 y 1 m thick cover ca to 36 g m2 y 2 m thick cover and 28 g m2 y 4 m thick cover table 5 however a two month drought would significantly decrease the degree of saturation in the monolayer cover ca and the related annual oxygen flux to 179 100 and 49 g m2 y for a 1 2 and 4 m thick cover respectively table 5 such a monolayer cover coupled with an elevated water table therefore appears to be highly sensitive to droughts and has a high risk of failing to prevent amd generation during dry years 4 3 bilayer covers 4 3 1 hydrogeological behaviour the results obtained for monolayer covers shown above indicate that for tailings ta a single layer cover made of materials ca is susceptible to significant drying when the water table is located 2 m below the reactive tailings cover interface as measured during field surveys till cb is even more prone to desaturation as a result the oxygen flux is too high i e above the target of 50 g m2 y alternative solutions have also been considered to improve the water retention within the covers and reduce oxygen flux to the reactive tailings one option was to create a capillary barrier effect with the addition of an underlying 1 m thick layer made of coarse grained material fig 3 it can be expected that the tendency of the coarser material to desaturate because of it low aev would produce a capillary barrier effect that limits water loss by downward drainage e g nicholson et al 1989 aubertin et al 1996 2009 two waste rocks wr1 and wr2 whose properties are based on actual waste rock samples characterized for another project near mine site a table 1 and fig 1 were considered to create the capillary break simulations were conducted to assess the response of different bilayer cover configurations in these calculations the moisture retention layers ca and cb are 1 m and 3 m thick and the underlying coarse layer made of waste rock wr1 or wr2 is 1 m thick fig 3 the water table is located 4 m below the surface of the reactive tailings ta or tb results indicate that with a 3 m thick mrl made of non acid generating tailings ca the degree of saturation 10 cm above the bottom of the mrl i e 10 cm above ca wr interface remains above 85 throughout the year it is somewhat higher around 90 when wr2 is used as a capillary break fig 9 however the degree of saturation in a 1 m thick mrl becomes 80 after day 160 under the same conditions in the case of till cb the degree of saturation 10 cm above the tailings cover interface is around 50 to 60 for a large part of the year and cover thickness seems to have little influence on the results drying of cover cb is thus more pronounced than with cover ca the corresponding degree of saturation profiles confirmed by suction profiles not shown here indicate that a capillary barrier effect develops between the mrl and the coarse grained material layer the capillary break seems to be more efficient when using wr2 additional simulations with wr2 pabst 2011 indicate that there is no significant effect of the water table depth in this case nevertheless evaporation contributes to the desaturation of the cover 4 3 2 oxygen fluxes the oxygen flux was calculated for bilayer covers made of materials ca and cb and using waste rocks wr1 and wr2 table 6 the results for the different configurations and water table locations agree with the observations made on the degree of saturation fig 9 in these bilayer covers there is desaturation of the mrl resulting in high oxygen fluxes only a thick retention layer 3 m with a capillary break made of waste rock wr2 would keep the oxygen flux below 50 g m2 y a bilayer cover made of 1 m of wr2 and a 3 m thick ca mrl give an oxygen flux below 8 g m2 y 4 3 3 water chemistry the behaviour of bilayer cover systems was also simulated with the code min3p reactive transport modelling indicates improved water quality after 10 years 1 m below the tailings surface when the mrl is 3 m thick fig 10 for example the ph is around 3 8 for both tailings ta and tb while it is closer to 2 1 and 2 5 respectively for a 1 m thick layer sulfate iron and zinc concentrations are also lower with a 3 m thick mrl sometimes by orders of magnitude however the simulation results also indicate that oxidation and acid mine drainage continues below bilayer covers ph remains acidic and sulfate concentrations can exceed 1000 ppm even when the oxygen flux is below 50 g m2 y e g tb wr2 cb 3 m a bilayer cover made of a 1 m thick wr2 capillary break and a 3 m thick ca mrl can however decrease sulfate and heavy metal concentrations significantly nonetheless further simulations not shown here indicate that there would be a significantly decreased performance during dry spells following a stronger desaturation of the mrl due to evaporation 4 4 three layer covers with capillary barrier effects ccbe 4 4 1 hydrogeological behaviour the water flow simulations presented above have shown that evaporation is responsible for a large part of the moisture losses and consequent desaturation of the mrl in such cases a surface layer made of sufficiently coarse grained material e g waste rock kalonji kabambi 2016 kalonji kabambi et al 2017 can be used as an evaporation barrier to prevent water losses to the atmosphere barbour and yanful 1994 aubertin et al 1995 1999 2002 dagenais et al 2006 additional simulations were therefore conducted to evaluate this option for three layer covers consisting of a 1 m thick waste rock layer wr1 or wr2 placed on top of reactive tailings ta or tb a 1 m thick mrl ca or cb and another 0 5 m waste rock layer added on top fig 3 the latter thickness was shown to be sufficient to limit moisture loss by evaporation for such climatic conditions in previous studies dagenais 2005 dagenais et al 2006 in these simulations the water table is located 4 m below the tailings cover interface which is representative of field conditions with such a ccbe the degree of saturation in the mrl ca remains above 90 at all time fig 11a the two waste rock layers are desaturated θ θr as indicated by the degree of saturation profile fig 11b the two coarse layers capillary breaks thus create a strong contrast with the ca tailings the desaturated waste rock layer at the base prevents water from flowing down to the reactive tailings while the layer on top efficiently limits moisture rise waste rock wr2 which is slightly coarser than wr1 fig 1 appears to be more efficient in the role of a capillary break with till cb only the capillary break made of wr2 keeps the mrl sufficiently saturated above 85 the contrast between cb and wr1 is not pronounced enough and in this case the degree of saturation 10 cm above the bottom of the mrl is around 70 in the summer and autumn well below the target of 85 the effect of a dry year fig 2 was also investigated with additional simulations results dashed lines in fig 11a b show that the absence of precipitation during two months in the summer would only slightly affect the mrl the degree of saturation in the retention layer would remain high above 95 with waste rock wr2 used as a capillary break 4 4 2 oxygen fluxes with a three layer ccbe the cumulative annual oxygen flux through the cover table 7 is much less than in the previous simulated cases it is generally well below 50 g m2 y except for the case with waste rock wr1 and till cb in all cases the oxygen flux with cb is at least one order of magnitude greater than with ca which confirms that till cb is less suitable as a mrl than the non acid generating tailings ca results also indicate that the difference in fluxes for covers using wr1 or wr2 can be greater than two orders of magnitude the configuration ca and wr2 gives the best results with a simulated oxygen flux 0 1 g m2 y 4 4 3 water chemistry reactive transport modelling was carried out to assess the effect of well designed three layer ccbes on the water quality only cases where oxygen fluxes are below the target of 50 g m2 y are shown here the results shown in fig 12 indicate significant differences between the various configurations despite oxygen fluxes being low and below 50 g m2 y only the case where fo2 0 1 g m2 y tacawr2 allows for a ph around neutrality with a ph 6 which is close to that of infiltrating water in the model sulfate and iron concentrations are 1 mg l and zinc concentrations are around 0 01 mg l using wr1 as a capillary break instead of wr2 increases the oxygen flux by more than two orders of magnitude but it remains relatively low around 10 g m2 y in the latter case the ph after 10 years 1 m below the tailings cover interface remains below 4 while the sulfate and iron concentrations are around 10 mg l and the zinc concentrations exceed 2 mg l the case where cb is used with wr2 represents an intermediate case in which the water ph 1 m below the tailings cover interface is around 5 0 iron and zinc concentrations are low but sulfate concentrations remain above 400 mg l this suggests that oxidation of tailings tb is continuing the case tbwr1 was not simulated due to the very high oxygen fluxes 200 g m2 y table 7 the simulations also show that water quality 1 m below the tailings cover interface tends to stabilize after around 4 years this is in accordance with observations made for example at the lorraine mine site by dagenais 2005 and bussière et al 2009 5 discussion the numerical results shown here which include data supported by experimental observations pabst 2011 pabst et al 2014 2017a b indicate that a monolayer cover may not be efficient enough to prevent amd generation for the conditions considered here particularly where the water table is deeper than 2 m below the surface of the reactive tailings for reactive tailings ta monolayer covers ca became desaturated because of the combined effects of both drainage and evaporation reactive tailings are thus strongly affected by evaporation and even though they remain close to saturation their degree of saturation is lower than expected for reactive tailings tb material cb is a somewhat better evaporation barrier than material ca due to its relatively low aev but coarse grained tailings tb desaturate mainly because of downward drainage overall however both monolayer covers ca and cb appear to be too fine to efficiently play the role of an evaporation barrier and too coarse to develop an efficient capillary barrier effect with the underlying tailings ta and tb simulations of water distribution and oxygen fluxes combined with reactive transport modelling indicate that under such conditions oxygen would migrate relatively quickly to the reactive tailings and thus contribute to the generation of amd the contribution of evaporation to cover desaturation was further assessed by simulating bilayer covers in this case the top mrl does not remain close to saturation despite the presence of a strong capillary break formed by the underlying waste rocks wr1 and wr2 which prevents water losses by downward drainage three layer ccbes were also simulated based on recommended designs for such covers aubertin et al 1994 1995 1999 2002 ricard et al 1997 1999 nastev and aubertin 2000 dagenais et al 2006 i e a 1 m thick waste rock layer wr1 or wr2 placed between the reactive tailings and the mrl 1 m thick finer grained material ca or cb with another 0 5 m waste rock layer on top the simulation results clearly show that such a cover would better reduce the oxygen flux to the tailings even during fairly long drought periods these simulations indicate however that even with this configuration the till cb is not efficient enough as an mrl material with the waste rock wr1 because of its weak water retention characteristics this extensive numerical study also shows some of the advantages of combining hydrogeological and geochemical models to assess the performance of cover systems particularly when the tailings are already oxidized in this case relying only on typical targets for oxygen fluxes may be misleading even though the oxygen flux remains below 50 g m2 y which is a practical objective for cover design e g aubertin et al 1999 dagenais 2005 hydrogeochemical simulations indicate that significant amd generation may continue over time due to the pre oxidation state of the tailings and the already acidic and contaminated pore waters that promote indirect oxidation e g nicholson 1994 williamson and rimstidt 1994 kirby et al 1999 nordstrom 2000 these new results also indicate that recommendations made by ouangrawa et al 2009 2010 following previous investigations on fresh non oxidized tailings may not be appropriate in this case the design criterion based on maintaining the water table at a depth below one half of the aev of the reactive fresh tailings approximately 3 to 4 m and 1 m for ta and tb respectively would not be directly applicable to already oxidized tailings in such cases it would be preferable to elevate the water table closer to the surface of the reactive tailings as demonstrated also by the column tests conducted by bussière et al 2011 an oxygen flux of around 1 g m2 y also seems a better target to prevent further amd generation in the particular case of sites a and b table 7 and fig 12 therefore even in this case the simulations indicate that it could take several years before actually observing an improvement of the leachate quality which is not unusual for the reclamation of old mining sites e g dagenais 2005 bussière et al 2009 also geochemical simulation results were assessed 1 m below the tailings surface and it could take even longer before improvements are observed at the outflow the various simulated scenarios also confirmed the importance of carefully choosing the cover material s for the capillary break material waste rock wr2 appears significantly more efficient to prevent desaturation of the mrl and lower the oxygen flux through the 3 layer ccbe using a coarser waste rock may however increase the risk of developing localized flows under highly saturated conditions e g dawood and aubertin 2014 broda et al 2015 lahmira et al 2016 these effects are not considered in the numerical models applied here using a very coarse waste rock as a protection and evaporation layer may also induce local advective fluxes that could increase evaporation from the mrl it is therefore recommended to further investigate the optimal grain size before using waste rocks in layered cover systems kalonji kabambi 2016 kalonji kabambi et al 2017 much effort was devoted in this investigation to calibration of the models and exhaustive parametric analyses but some uncertainties nonetheless remain for example it is challenging and relatively uncertain to extrapolate laboratory results to field conditions especially when considering in situ heterogeneity and 2d or 3d effects particularly close to the boundaries of the tailings impoundments for instance tailings ta characterized here are relatively fine grained compared to some of the tailings sampled elsewhere on site a e g gosselin 2007 pabst 2011 and to typical hard rock tailings from other sites e g aubertin et al 2002 bussière 2007 thus tailings ta are only partly representative of the conditions on the site additional tests and simulations would be required to assess the responses for different grain sizes and compositions in situ also even though column tests were conducted over almost two years the required lifetime of the cover on such type of tailings impoundment could exceed hundreds of years e g vick 2001 aubertin et al 2002 2016 additional uncertainties are therefore related to the very long term evolution of physical properties and mineralogical and chemical composition of the materials as well as reaction kinetics also the indirect oxidation reactions were taken into account here through a calibration of the reactive transport models based on column tests pabst et al 2017b further work is recommended to improve reactive transport simulations especially in terms of reaction kinetics and ph dependency finally it was assumed in the simulations that the water table was constant throughout the year and independent of the cover systems in practice it may fluctuate seasonally and could vary depending on the type of cover larger 3d models of the site should therefore be used to assess the effect of varying water table position considering its importance in terms of cover performance broda et al 2014 several simplifications were also made when simulating climatic conditions mainly due to numerical constraints and lack of more accurate climatic data for the two abandoned mining sites given the importance of evaporation on the efficiency of a cover system more emphasis should therefore be placed on this aspect see for example wilson et al 1997 additional effort should also be devoted to address the effects of climate change which can be expected to affect the performance of cover systems at limiting oxygen ingress over the long term e g mend 2011 reinecke and brodie 2012 6 conclusion coupled hydrogeological and geochemical numerical simulations calibrated and validated on instrumented column tests were carried out to investigate the performance of different cover systems to reclaim pre oxidized sulfidic tailings at two impoundments the degree of saturation pore water pressure oxygen flux and leachate quality were considered to assess cover efficiency to limit amd generation the effect of various factors such as water table position material properties and cover layer thickness were investigated alternative reclamation options including monolayer covers and two or three layer covers with capillary barrier effect s were also simulated the simulations illustrated how the behaviour and efficiency of a monolayer cover placed over reactive tailings depend on specific factors such as its hydraulic properties its thickness and more importantly the water table position the covers at the two sites are prone to desaturation especially when the water table is deep below the tailings cover interface under the tested conditions the simulations tend to indicate that a monolayer cover would not be able to prevent oxygen ingress except possibly with a highly elevated water table or a very thick cover oxygen flux estimates and reactive transport modelling corroborated this conclusion simulation results also tended to indicate that under a given set of conditions bilayer covers that include a base capillary break layer would not significantly improve their performance compared to a monolayer cover due to water losses by evaporation three layer covers with capillary barrier effects ccbe appear much more efficient in reducing the oxygen flux and amd generation the results further indicate that a well designed ccbe could maintain its efficiency during relatively long dry spells with minimal water replenishment under the conditions considered here the simulations have also shown that choosing the proper materials for the moisture retaining layer and the capillary break is critical a rigorous program involving extensive characterization laboratory experiments and numerical simulations is recommended to properly design an efficient and long lasting cover system it is also important to take into account the effects of pre oxidation of the tailings and the initial porewater chemistry which may also affect cover performance this study has further highlighted how coupled hydrogeological and geochemical simulations can lead to important new insights and more realistic results especially when calibrated on representative experimental tests this project coupled with additional laboratory and field tests pabst 2011 bussière et al 2011 and large scale numerical simulations broda et al 2014 ethier et al 2018 contributed to the final design of the cover system for several portions of site a additional field work is

1655,the generation of acid mine drainage amd remains a major environmental challenge for the mining industry the reclamation of old mine sites with pre oxidized tailings is particularly challenging because of indirect oxidation reactions which can limit the overall effectiveness of an oxygen barrier to prevent amd the goal of this project was to quantitatively compare the effectiveness of different cover systems to reclaim two pre oxidized acid generating tailings sites located in quebec canada following laboratory column tests field measurements and observations coupled hydrogeological and geochemical numerical simulations were conducted to evaluate the effect of various system characteristics cover performance was assessed by simulating the evolution of the degree of water saturation pore water pressures oxygen fluxes and leachate quality several reclamation options including monolayer covers and two or three layer covers with capillary barrier effect s were simulated the simulations indicate that because of reduced cover effectiveness with pre oxidized tailings the general design targets developed for non oxidized tailings may not always be directly applicable to already oxidized tailings the simulations also illustrate how the behaviour and efficiency of a monolayer cover placed over reactive tailings depend on specific factors including water table position initial porewater chemistry and cover materials hydrogeological properties and thicknesses the results indicate that under a given set of conditions a bilayer cover with a capillary break above the reactive tailings would not significantly improve cover performance compared to a monolayer cover due to water losses by evaporation the simulations show however that a well designed three layer cover with capillary barrier effects ccbe would be efficient in reducing the oxygen flux and amd generation even in the case of highly pre oxidized tailings the outcomes from this investigation highlight some of the advantages of carrying out coupled hydrogeological and geochemical simulations to assess the long term behaviour of reclaimed mining sites keywords acid generating tailings multilayer cover systems ccbe monolayer elevated water table hydrogeological simulations reactive transport 1 introduction tailings produced by hard rock mines are usually stored in surface disposal facilities often called impoundments when they contain iron sulfides tailings can react with oxygen and water to generate acid mine drainage amd amd is usually characterized by a low ph and high concentrations of dissolved metals and sulfates e g aubertin et al 2002 blowes et al 2003 2014 lindsay et al 2015 nordstrom et al 2015 effluent treatment can be used during mine operations but this is neither a sustainable nor a viable solution in the long term aubertin et al 2015 2016 it is much more efficient to prevent the oxidation reactions from occurring at the source several control and reclamation approaches exist to control oxidation including various types of cover systems aiming at controlling oxygen and or water fluxes to the reactive tailings e g aubertin et al 2002 reclamation of reactive mine waste disposal sites is best achieved when it is planned in advance and integrated into the mining production cycle according to the principle of designing for closure e g srk 1989 aubertin and chapuis 1991 hutchison and ellison 1992 aubertin et al 2002 2016 this allows preventing the production of acidic waters however in some cases and especially for old mine sites tailings have been left exposed for decades and can produce large quantities of amd the pore water is then already acidic and heavily contaminated the reclamation of these sites is more complex due in large part to indirect oxidation reactions that occur when the ph is acidic nicholson 1994 williamson and rimstidt 1994 kirby et al 1999 nordstrom 2000 in this case fe iii remains in solution and can play the role of oxidant indirect oxidation reactions are typically much faster than direct oxidation reactions and they produce more acid e g williamson and rimstidt 1994 indirect oxidation can affect the overall effectiveness of an oxygen barrier to prevent amd and should be taken into account when designing a cover system for a pre oxidized tailings impoundment the goal of this paper is to quantitatively compare the effectiveness of different cover options to reclaim pre oxidized tailings impoundments the paper focuses on the behaviour of two acid generating tailings disposal sites sites a and b located in the abitibi region in quebec canada for site a the reclamation method initially considered involved the addition of a single layer of slightly alkaline non acid generating tailings produced at a nearby mine onto the pre oxidized reactive tailings with a limited rise of the water table position in the old impoundment to help increase the degree of saturation the tailings impoundment at site b has already been covered by 1 to 2 m of a widely graded and heterogeneous till extracted in the vicinity of the site the water table in this case is well below the reactive tailings surface the hydrogeological and geochemical behaviour of these two tailings cover systems was assessed experimentally and numerically to determine the efficiency of monolayer covers under the actual or anticipated field conditions the program included fieldwork and a series of column tests conducted in the laboratory pabst 2011 pabst et al 2014 2017a b the experimental data obtained from the laboratory tests were used to validate and calibrate numerical models constructed with vadose w geoslope int ltd version 2007 and min3p mayer and benner 1999 mayer et al 2002 the effect of various influence factors such as climatic conditions cover thickness depth of the water table and material properties were specifically addressed pabst 2011 pabst et al 2017a b in this paper alternative cover configurations are analysed using the same cover materials and other materials available locally the efficiency of the cover systems at limiting oxygen ingress is evaluated using different approaches first the oxygen flux reaching the reactive tailings is evaluated for each system and set of conditions using the code vadose w geo slope int ltd a cover is usually considered efficient when it can achieve at least the same performance as a 1 m thick still water cover with an oxygen flux equal to or less than about 50 g m2 y aubertin et al 1999 dagenais 2005 the degree of saturation sr in the moisture retaining layer mrl is also a good indicator for the efficiency of an oxygen barrier a degree of saturation sr 85 usually implies that oxygen diffusion will be low enough to prevent amd e g ricard et al 1997 1999 bussière et al 2003 mbonimpa et al 2003 dagenais et al 2006 finally the simulated water quality obtained from reactive transport modelling carried out with min3p mayer and benner 1999 mayer et al 2002 is also used as a direct indication of the cover performance the combination of these various indicators obtained using two different numerical codes helped assess the performance of these cover systems this paper presents and discusses the main results from this parametric analysis which complements previous experimental work and provides recommendations for the reclamation of pre oxidized tailings impoundments in relatively humid climates previous work mainly focused on monolayer covers coupled with an elevated water table pabst et al 2017a b this paper compares the performance of monolayer bilayer and multilayer covers to control amd generation from pre oxidized tailings this assessment is based on coupled hydrogeochemical simulations calibrated on experimental results the effect of climatic conditions water table depth tailings and cover material properties and cover thickness are specifically addressed the approach and results presented here have helped the decision process for selecting the final cover design at one of the targeted tailings disposal sites 2 background on reclamation of acid generating tailings sites under relatively humid climatic conditions i e where the water balance is positive most of the year prevention of amd usually relies on controlling oxygen flux with water or a nearly saturated porous medium e g collin 1987 nicholson et al 1989 aachib et al 1994 1998 2004 water covers typically consist of disposing reactive mine tailings under at least 1 m of water e g li 1997 yanful and catalan 2002 mbonimpa et al 2008 awoh et al 2013 the oxygen diffusive flux in water being approximately 10 000 times lower than in air the oxygen supply is then sufficiently small that the generation of amd remains negligible although generally effective for preventing the oxidation of reactive tailings this approach can be complex and costly to implement particularly for older artificial impoundments also building dikes that will last the indefinite lifetime of tailings ponds is a major challenge aubertin et al 1997 2016 vick 2001 another approach to control amd generation relies on the use of engineered soil covers these include multilayered covers made of several soils placed on top of each other aubertin and chapuis 1991 hutchison and ellison 1992 aubertin et al 2002 the number of layers can vary depending on the design the climate and the position of the water table aubertin et al 1995 1999 for instance a typical 3 layer cover is made of a 0 5 to 1 m thick mrl made of fine grained material sandwiched between two 30 to 50 cm thick coarse grained material layers aubertin et al 1994 1999 2006 bussière et al 2003 2006 bussière 2007 the coarser material layers are expected to drain easily and rapidly reaching a low volumetric water content and low unsaturated hydraulic conductivity thus preventing both water rise and loss by evaporation and drainage from the fine grained layer the mrl can therefore remain nearly saturated over a relatively long time hence limiting oxygen diffusion to the underlying reactive tailings over time this fine grained material could eventually desaturate but it can be expected that natural precipitation would provide sufficient recharge so it can remain highly saturated at all time these types of covers which are referred to as covers with capillary barrier effects ccbes have been proven efficient at several mine sites including les terrains aurifères lta mcmullen et al 1997 ricard et al 1999 bussière et al 2006 and lorraine dagenais et al 2002 2005 as an alternative to water covers and multilayered covers the elevated water table ewt approach relies on controlling the water table level and degree of saturation of the reactive tailings orava et al 1997 the technique essentially consists of raising and maintaining the water table to a depth less than the height of the capillary fringe dagenais 2005 ouangrawa et al 2006 2009 2010 a layer of granular material a monolayer cover is usually placed above the reactive tailings with an ewt a coarse grained material cover helps with the recharge and limits water loss by evaporation dagenais et al 2006 while a fine grained material cover may promote water retention through the capillary rise and prevent oxygen diffusion demers et al 2008 the efficiency of the monolayer cover is then highly dependent on the water table position e g cosset and aubertin 2010 dobchuk et al 2013 when well designed and implemented the ewt technique can be quite efficient to limit the generation of amd dagenais 2005 ouangrawa 2007 demers et al 2008 2009 ethier et al 2014 2016 while having been fairly well studied the performance of mono and multilayered cover systems has until now mainly been assessed for non oxidized tailings and the design recommendations e g layer thickness and properties water table position made only for fresh tailings at ongoing or recently closed mining sites one of the objectives of this paper is therefore to assess cover performance for pre oxidized tailings at two mine sites and to compare the results with general design targets developed for non oxidized tailings 3 methodology 3 1 materials four types of materials were considered in the present study reactive tailings ta and tb non reactive tailings ca and till cover material cb reactive tailings ta and tb were sampled from sites a and b respectively non acid generating tailings ca used as cover material on tailings ta were provided by the operating mine involved in the reclamation work the till cb used for the cover on site b was sampled at the same time as tailings tb these four materials have been extensively characterized in the laboratory pabst 2011 pabst et al 2014 while field data including in situ porosity reaction rate coefficient volumetric water content and water table depth were also measured pabst 2011 the water retention curve wrc was also evaluated for each material using modified tempe cells with the experimental results fitted with the van genuchten 1980 model the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat was measured in flexible wall permeameters the experimental ksat values obtained from these permeameter tests were compared and validated with predictive estimates obtained from the kozeny carman kc equation chapuis and aubertin 2003 and the kozeny carman modified kcm equation mbonimpa et al 2002 the permeability function was obtained using the mualem 1976 formulation based on the approximate analytical solution proposed by van genuchten 1980 the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the different materials under various degrees of saturation could thus be estimated the parameters used in the numerical models are summarized in fig 1 and table 1 in addition to the two reactive tailings ta and tb and the two cover materials ca non acid generating tailings and cb natural till two non acid generating waste rocks wr1 and wr2 were also considered in this study their coarse grain size distribution can be expected to contribute to the development of a capillary break with the finer materials ca and cb in two or three layer ccbes the properties of the waste rock wr1 and wr2 were taken from dawood et al 2011 fig 1 and table 1 both waste rocks have a hydraulic conductivity comparable to a sandy soil wr2 is slightly coarser than wr1 which has little effect on the saturated hydraulic conductivity but is more noticeable with the estimated water retention curves fig 1 the residual water content θr is relatively high around 0 06 i e sr 24 because of the significant proportion of fine grained particles in these waste rocks dawood et al 2011 also see peregoedova 2012 oxygen consumption tests conducted for this project gosselin 2007 gosselin et al 2012 gave a reaction rate coefficient kr 3 10 5 s 1 for tailings ta and kr 1 10 5 s 1 for tailings tb the cover materials ca and cb can be considered non reactive as no significant oxygen consumption was measured waste rocks wr1 and wr2 are also assumed to be non reactive the effective diffusion coefficient de was measured in diffusion cells following the procedures described by mbonimpa et al 2003 2011 and aachib et al 2004 experimental results indicate that the collin and rasmuson 1988 model used in vadose w and the related aachib et al 2004 model used in min3p accurately represent the effective diffusion coefficient de pabst et al 2014 the mineralogical compositions of reactive tailings ta and tb and cover materials ca and cb are given in table 2 these values were included in the hydrogeochemical model min3p reactive tailings ta and tb contain a relatively high proportion of pyrite respectively around 12 0 and 4 0 by weight cover material ca contains about 5 5 calcite and 2 0 dolomite while 2 0 calcite but no dolomite was measured in cover material cb both ca and cb are rich in albite respectively 47 0 and 28 5 by weight a relatively high content of anorthite 10 was identified in the cover material ca xrd measurements were repeated on each of these four materials before and after the column tests but no significant variations were observed waste rocks wr1 and wr2 not used in these column tests were assumed non reactive no sulfides and for the purpose of the models assumed made only of quartz 3 2 laboratory column tests large instrumented columns 230 cm high 14 5 cm internal diameter were set up in the laboratory to provide representative large scale experimental results for the validation and calibration if needed of numerical models columns contained 170 cm of reactive tailings ta or tb covered by 30 to 40 cm of cover materials ca or cb a total of 19 wetting and drying cycles were applied during the column tests the reference position of the water table was set at 90 cm below the base of the columns i e about 260 cm below the reactive tailings surface the top of each column was open to the atmosphere each column was instrumented with pore water pressure water content and oxygen sensors water was regularly added at the top of the columns and sampled at their base and analysed a detailed description of the column tests can be found in pabst 2011 and pabst et al 2014 the methodology is similar to that developed over several years by the authors research group aachib et al 1994 1998 aubertin et al 1995 1999

kalonji kabambi et al 2017 oxygen flux in vadose w is simulated using reaction rate coefficients reported above evaporation in vadose w is simulated using the penman wilson equation wilson 1990 reactive transport hydro geochemical simulations were conducted using min3p a 3d finite volume numerical model developed for simulating 3d reactive transport including variably saturated flow diffusive gas transport sulfide mineral oxidation and kinetic or equilibrium controlled geochemical reactions mayer and benner 1999 mayer et al 2002 the model has been previously tested verified and applied to several studies of acid mine drainage e g jurjovec et al 2004 molson et al 2005 2008 ouangrawa et al 2009 demers et al 2013 sulfide oxidation reactions and oxygen fluxes were simulated in min3p based in part on the input mineralogy table 2 although only direct oxidation is simulated in min3p indirect oxidation reactions were taken into account by calibrating the reactive transport model based on column tests pabst et al 2017b since min3p cannot simulate evaporation the same way as vadose w does water fluxes either positive or negative at the surface of the simulated columns were therefore imported from the vadose w simulation results and applied as boundary conditions in the min3p column models the resulting water content and suction profiles within the tailings and cover systems were identical to vadose w results also oxygen fluxes simulated in vadose w were input as boundary conditions in min3p to facilitate the comparison between the two codes 3 4 simulation of basic field conditions numerical models were validated and calibrated using the results from laboratory column tests a detailed description of the numerical modelling of the column tests and their calibration is presented by pabst et al 2017a for the hydrogeological behaviour simulations and pabst et al 2017b for the hydrogeochemical reactive transport response models after the numerical models were validated they were expanded to simulate alternate scenarios initially based on field conditions observed at the two mine sites abitibi region quebec a climatic boundary condition based on daily local field data including air temperatures relative humidity precipitation and wind speed obtained from environment canada fig 2 was applied at the surface of the model year 2009 was used as a reference case most of the fieldwork was carried out that year the simulations were run for ten years with the same climatic boundary conditions each year hydrogeological simulation results showed no significant variations from one year to the next and are thus only presented over a single year year 10 during the four winter months dec march the surface of the simulated site was considered frozen and consequently there was no water or gas movement in the cover during this period in some cases the environmental conditions applied in the model were altered to simulate a drought and to assess the corresponding response of the cover system s dry periods can significantly affect the performance of oxygen barriers that rely on precipitation recharge to replenish water losses and maintain a high degree of saturation for these simulations the imposed recharge in the months of july and august day 180 to day 240 was nil with the other parameters remaining unchanged in such cases the yearly precipitation was reduced to 631 mm while it is around 844 mm for a normal year a two month drought in this part of canada is rather extreme and has been considered a worst case scenario for cover design e g ricard et al 1997 1999 different cases with various water table elevations were simulated water table elevation in situ may vary over time and location the considered design in the various simulations was 2 m 4 m and 6 m below the tailings cover interface an additional case with a water table located 1 m below reactive tailings ta was also simulated such a situation is not representative of current or achievable conditions for site b the water table was imposed at the base of the models 10 m below the reactive tailings surface to avoid numerical conflicts between the climatic and hydrogeological boundary conditions the simulated water table during severe evaporative phases can therefore be deeper than imposed this allows for a more accurate assessment of the ewt technique and the performance of the monolayer cover as an evaporation barrier 3 5 simulated cover configurations three different types and configurations of oxygen barrier cover systems were simulated fig 3 monolayer covers made of non acid generating tailings ca or till cb with different thicknesses varying from 1 to 4 m bilayer covers with a 1 m to 3 m thick mrl made of ca or cb installed on top of 1 m of coarse grained material wr1 or wr2 which acts as a capillary break layer multilayer covers where a 1 m thick retention layer ca or cb is placed between two coarse grained material layers wr1 or wr2 the coarse layer at the base is 1 m thick and the coarse layer on top is 0 5 m this layered system represents a ccbe designed to act as an oxygen barrier e g aubertin et al 1995 1999 2002 bussière et al 1998 2003 the results of the hydrogeological simulations are first presented in terms of degree of saturation and pore water pressures in critical profiles only the top 5 m of the tailings vertical profile are shown in the figures for clarity reactive tailings are actually 10 m thick in the models annual oxygen fluxes at the surface of the cover are also calculated as cumulated daily values over one year sum of oxygen fluxes calculated for each day of the simulations including a zero flux over the winter months 4 results 4 1 monolayer covers for different water table positions 4 1 1 hydrogeological behaviour the effect of the water table depth on the performance of 1 m thick monolayer covers was investigated for non acid generating tailings ca and till cb the water table depth was varied from 1 m for taca or 2 m for tbcb to 6 m below the tailings cover interface the simulated degree of saturation is shown over time at a position 10 cm above the tailings cover interface fig 4a results are shown for different water table depths over a one year period starting on january 1st day 1 the evolution of the degree of saturation in the cover follows several stages first during the winter months at the beginning of each year day 1 to 90 approximately the cover is frozen and it is assumed that there is no oxygen flux through the cover upon thawing in april day 90 the degree of saturation in the cover rapidly increases due to snowmelt and infiltration and reaches its maximum value within a few days or weeks the cover remains at that degree of saturation for up to about 20 days depending on the cases the degree of saturation then progressively decreases due to both downward drainage and evaporation this decrease lasts for about 50 to 80 days until mid summer day 200 the degree of saturation then oscillates for the rest of the year as it varies with water losses and rain events during autumn frost starts again in december day 330 the degree of saturation in the cover depends on the water table position as it tends to decrease when the water table depth increases for a 1 m thick monolayer cover the minimum value of the degree of saturation 10 cm above the tailings cover interface around mid summer day 200 for cover ca is about 50 when the water table is 6 m below the tailings cover interface 60 for a depth of 4 m and around 80 and 90 for a depth of 2 m and 1 m respectively the degree of saturation in the monolayer cover is also a function of the cover material properties the degree of saturation for cover cb sandy till is typically lower than for ca silty tailings for example around day 200 sr is between 10 and 20 lower in cb than in ca independently of the water table position the vertical profiles of the degree of saturation in mid summer around day 200 which corresponds to one of the lowest values of sr fig 4b indicate that covers are dryer closer to the surface the difference in degree of saturation between the top and the bottom of the cover can vary from only a few percent to 40 depending on the water table position and cover material results also show that reactive tailings ta and tb are close to saturation sr 95 at that point even when the water table is as deep as 6 m below the tailings cover interface the pore water pressure profiles fig 4c indicate that the effect of evaporation is significant creating high suctions close to the surface this suction produces an upward flow component that contributes to moisture loss to the atmosphere evaporation also has a major influence on the pore pressures throughout the cover but it may have a more limited effect on the underlying reactive tailings depending on the cover material with cover material ca the suction in tailings ta is much higher than at equilibrium for example the pore water pressure head at a depth of 1 m below the tailings cover interface wt 1 m is around 1 1 m 2 1 m at wt 2 m 4 1 m at wt 4 m and 5 9 m at wt 6 m while it should be in the absence of evaporation 0 m 1 m 3 m and 5 m respectively these values indicate that the 1 m thick monolayer cover ca which has hydrogeological properties similar to tailings ta fig 1 does not prevent evaporation and moisture loss from the underlying reactive tailings and that the positive effect of an ewt cannot be maintained under these conditions this explains why tailings ta are somewhat desaturated close to the surface even though their air entry value aev 6 8 m is higher than the depth to the water table in this case evaporation affects reactive tailings ta over a depth of several meters with cover material cb however the difference between the expected and simulated suction 1 m below the tailings cover interface is only a few centimetres these results confirm that cover material cb sandy till is more effective to prevent evaporation from the underlying tailings than ca silty tailings because of a stronger hydrogeological contrast between cb and tb than between ca and ta these results are in agreement with those of dagenais et al 2006 in the tbcb case evaporation affects only the top 70 cm or so of the monolayer cover in this instance desaturation of tailings tb is essentially due to downward drainage and to their relatively low aev 2 m 4 1 2 oxygen fluxes calculating the oxygen flux at the surface through a cover system can be performed to assess its efficiency to limit oxidation of the reactive tailings the oxygen flux through a cover varies over time depending on the local and global degree of saturation fig 5 while oxygen flux is zero during the winter when the ground is frozen it remains very low upon snow melting while the cover remains nearly saturated until around day 130 fig 4 oxygen flux then increases quickly when covers ca and cb desaturate the dryer the cover the greater the increase in oxygen flux the flux then varies during the summer and autumn increasing during dry spells and decreasing after rain events daily oxygen flux with ca can reach 10 g m2 day when the water table is located 6 m below the surface of tailings ta but remains below 1 g m2 day when it is 1 m deep daily oxygen fluxes with cb are between 3 and 5 g m2 day during the second half of the year and increase when the water table is deeper cumulative annual fluxes sum of daily values over one year for the different configurations of a monolayer cover are summarized in table 3 the simulated fluxes confirm the previous observations that a monolayer cover ca can be efficient i e oxygen flux 50 g m2 y when the water table is located 2 m below the reactive tailings cover interface a water table located 1 m or less below the interface can be very efficient with simulated oxygen fluxes 7 g m2 y even with a relatively thin 1 m cover for tailings tb the relatively coarse grain size of the till leads to desaturation of the cover cb the oxygen flux is then 50 g m2 y even though tailings tb are less reactive than ta additional calculations not shown here see pabst 2011 indicate that these two single layer covers are even less efficient during dry years due to more pronounced desaturation of covers ca and cb 4 1 3 water chemistry the assessment of the oxygen flux only partially accounts for the contribution of indirect oxidation which does not require oxygen to the generation of amd reactive transport simulations were therefore carried out to more accurately assess the effectiveness of the cover systems to prevent amd generation from the already partially oxidized tailings ta and tb these simulations were carried out over 10 years to properly assess the trends that may develop after installation of the cover the initial pore water chemistry assumed in the simulations was based on laboratory column tests pabst et al 2017b and the initial ph can therefore be relatively high as was observed in the column tests samples collected in situ contained buffering minerals table 2 but these were removed in the models and replaced by quartz to allow for a more direct comparison of the performance of the various cover systems in terms of amd generation in the longer term this also matches in situ observations showing that pore waters at sites a and b are already strongly acidic e g aubertin et al 1995 1999 pabst 2011 ethier et al 2014 2016 indicating that the buffer capacity has already been exhausted at these locations the behaviour of a 1 m thick monolayer cover ca or cb placed over reactive tailings ta fig 6 or tb fig 7 respectively was assessed results ph sulfate iron and zinc concentrations are presented at z 1 m reactive transport modelling partially confirms the hydrogeological simulations for tailings ta and cover ca the deeper the water table the more amd is generated for example when the water table is located 6 m below the tailings cover interface the simulated ph at z 1 m is as low as 1 8 and sulfate concentrations exceed 4000 ppm after 10 years when the water table is only 1 m below the interface the ph is 3 8 and sulfate concentrations are 80 mg l fig 6 zinc concentrations are below 4 mg l after 10 years when the water table is 1 m deep around 20 mg l when it is 2 m deep and 200 and 350 mg l when it is 4 m and 6 m deep respectively other dissolved metals and contaminants show similar trends pabst 2011 the hydrogeochemical simulations also provide additional insight compared to the hydrogeological modelling for instance it seems that variations in oxygen fluxes between the different cases for tbcb table 3 are not associated with significant changes in the water quality fig 7 the ph remains around 2 5 and sulfate concentrations around 2500 ppm after 10 years regardless of the water table depth also there is still significant amd production in the case of taca when the water table is shallower than 2 m even though the oxygen flux is 50 g m2 y the ph remains between 3 and 4 and sulfate concentrations still exceed 200 mg l this could indicate that the usual target of 50 g m2 y for the oxygen flux may not be sufficient or relevant in the case of pre oxidized tailings at least for the period simulated in the models 4 2 monolayer covers with different cover thicknesses 4 2 1 hydrogeological behaviour the simulations shown above indicated that evaporation was responsible for a large part of water losses in the monolayer covers made of either ca or cb a thicker cover usually may help reduce adverse effects of evaporation and other atmospheric conditions like freeze thaw cycles for example subsequent simulations were thus carried out to assess the effect of cover thickness on its performance for 1 m 2 m and 4 m thick covers made of non acid generating tailings ca and till cb the water table was set 4 m below the tailings cover interface a depth at which a 1 m monolayer cover was not sufficient to prevent oxygen diffusion and amd generation variations of the degree of saturation 10 cm above the tailings cover interface over one year are presented in fig 8 these results indicate that the monolayer cover thickness has a limited effect on the degree of saturation 10 cm above the tailings cover interface fig 8 the degree of saturation between the different simulated cases is relatively similar during most of the year independent of the cover thickness however variations of sr are more progressive for thicker covers and less dependent on rain events in general the increase in degree of saturation is less in thicker covers upon snow melting but the degree of saturation remains higher during the summer and autumn simulated profiles of the degree of saturation at day 200 not shown here but similar to fig 4 confirm the previous observations evaporation can significantly decrease the degree of saturation close to the surface but the bottom of thicker covers remains more saturated than thinner covers as an example at 50 cm above the interface considering a water table located at 4 m the degree of saturation of cover ca is 56 when the monolayer cover is 1 m thick 68 when it is 2 m thick and 78 when it is 4 m thick these monolayer covers independent of their thickness appear to be ineffective in maintaining the degree of saturation in the cover around or above 85 throughout the year when the water table is deeper than 4 m reactive tailings ta and tb remain close to saturation 95 independent of the cover thickness however pore pressures indicate that evaporation can affect the cover and the reactive tailings in the case of thin covers over several meters with a 1 m thick monolayer cover ca evaporation can affect the reactive tailings up to a depth of several meters while its effect does not exceed 1 m in the case of a 4 m thick cover with cb the effect of evaporation does not exceed 50 cm below the surface of the cover for all cases 4 2 2 oxygen fluxes the effect of different cover thicknesses on oxygen flux was also assessed table 4 results indicate that a thicker cover is generally more efficient at limiting oxygen ingress for example in the case of tailings ta and cover material ca with a water table located 4 m below the tailings cover interface the cumulative annual oxygen flux to the tailings is 552 g m2 y with a 1 m thick cover and 216 g m2 y when it is 4 m thick similar results were obtained in the case of tailings tb where cumulative annual oxygen flux to the tailings decreases when cover thickness increases in these cases however the oxygen flux generally remains above the usual target of 50 g m2 y thus confirming previous results suggesting that such a monolayer cover ca or cb would not be effective for preventing amd in the case of a relatively deep water table wt 2 m previous analyses indicate that keeping the cover ca close to saturation requires a water table no deeper than 2 m below the tailings cover interface increasing the cover thickness can also help decrease the oxygen flux from 62 g m2 y 1 m thick cover ca to 36 g m2 y 2 m thick cover and 28 g m2 y 4 m thick cover table 5 however a two month drought would significantly decrease the degree of saturation in the monolayer cover ca and the related annual oxygen flux to 179 100 and 49 g m2 y for a 1 2 and 4 m thick cover respectively table 5 such a monolayer cover coupled with an elevated water table therefore appears to be highly sensitive to droughts and has a high risk of failing to prevent amd generation during dry years 4 3 bilayer covers 4 3 1 hydrogeological behaviour the results obtained for monolayer covers shown above indicate that for tailings ta a single layer cover made of materials ca is susceptible to significant drying when the water table is located 2 m below the reactive tailings cover interface as measured during field surveys till cb is even more prone to desaturation as a result the oxygen flux is too high i e above the target of 50 g m2 y alternative solutions have also been considered to improve the water retention within the covers and reduce oxygen flux to the reactive tailings one option was to create a capillary barrier effect with the addition of an underlying 1 m thick layer made of coarse grained material fig 3 it can be expected that the tendency of the coarser material to desaturate because of it low aev would produce a capillary barrier effect that limits water loss by downward drainage e g nicholson et al 1989 aubertin et al 1996 2009 two waste rocks wr1 and wr2 whose properties are based on actual waste rock samples characterized for another project near mine site a table 1 and fig 1 were considered to create the capillary break simulations were conducted to assess the response of different bilayer cover configurations in these calculations the moisture retention layers ca and cb are 1 m and 3 m thick and the underlying coarse layer made of waste rock wr1 or wr2 is 1 m thick fig 3 the water table is located 4 m below the surface of the reactive tailings ta or tb results indicate that with a 3 m thick mrl made of non acid generating tailings ca the degree of saturation 10 cm above the bottom of the mrl i e 10 cm above ca wr interface remains above 85 throughout the year it is somewhat higher around 90 when wr2 is used as a capillary break fig 9 however the degree of saturation in a 1 m thick mrl becomes 80 after day 160 under the same conditions in the case of till cb the degree of saturation 10 cm above the tailings cover interface is around 50 to 60 for a large part of the year and cover thickness seems to have little influence on the results drying of cover cb is thus more pronounced than with cover ca the corresponding degree of saturation profiles confirmed by suction profiles not shown here indicate that a capillary barrier effect develops between the mrl and the coarse grained material layer the capillary break seems to be more efficient when using wr2 additional simulations with wr2 pabst 2011 indicate that there is no significant effect of the water table depth in this case nevertheless evaporation contributes to the desaturation of the cover 4 3 2 oxygen fluxes the oxygen flux was calculated for bilayer covers made of materials ca and cb and using waste rocks wr1 and wr2 table 6 the results for the different configurations and water table locations agree with the observations made on the degree of saturation fig 9 in these bilayer covers there is desaturation of the mrl resulting in high oxygen fluxes only a thick retention layer 3 m with a capillary break made of waste rock wr2 would keep the oxygen flux below 50 g m2 y a bilayer cover made of 1 m of wr2 and a 3 m thick ca mrl give an oxygen flux below 8 g m2 y 4 3 3 water chemistry the behaviour of bilayer cover systems was also simulated with the code min3p reactive transport modelling indicates improved water quality after 10 years 1 m below the tailings surface when the mrl is 3 m thick fig 10 for example the ph is around 3 8 for both tailings ta and tb while it is closer to 2 1 and 2 5 respectively for a 1 m thick layer sulfate iron and zinc concentrations are also lower with a 3 m thick mrl sometimes by orders of magnitude however the simulation results also indicate that oxidation and acid mine drainage continues below bilayer covers ph remains acidic and sulfate concentrations can exceed 1000 ppm even when the oxygen flux is below 50 g m2 y e g tb wr2 cb 3 m a bilayer cover made of a 1 m thick wr2 capillary break and a 3 m thick ca mrl can however decrease sulfate and heavy metal concentrations significantly nonetheless further simulations not shown here indicate that there would be a significantly decreased performance during dry spells following a stronger desaturation of the mrl due to evaporation 4 4 three layer covers with capillary barrier effects ccbe 4 4 1 hydrogeological behaviour the water flow simulations presented above have shown that evaporation is responsible for a large part of the moisture losses and consequent desaturation of the mrl in such cases a surface layer made of sufficiently coarse grained material e g waste rock kalonji kabambi 2016 kalonji kabambi et al 2017 can be used as an evaporation barrier to prevent water losses to the atmosphere barbour and yanful 1994 aubertin et al 1995 1999 2002 dagenais et al 2006 additional simulations were therefore conducted to evaluate this option for three layer covers consisting of a 1 m thick waste rock layer wr1 or wr2 placed on top of reactive tailings ta or tb a 1 m thick mrl ca or cb and another 0 5 m waste rock layer added on top fig 3 the latter thickness was shown to be sufficient to limit moisture loss by evaporation for such climatic conditions in previous studies dagenais 2005 dagenais et al 2006 in these simulations the water table is located 4 m below the tailings cover interface which is representative of field conditions with such a ccbe the degree of saturation in the mrl ca remains above 90 at all time fig 11a the two waste rock layers are desaturated θ θr as indicated by the degree of saturation profile fig 11b the two coarse layers capillary breaks thus create a strong contrast with the ca tailings the desaturated waste rock layer at the base prevents water from flowing down to the reactive tailings while the layer on top efficiently limits moisture rise waste rock wr2 which is slightly coarser than wr1 fig 1 appears to be more efficient in the role of a capillary break with till cb only the capillary break made of wr2 keeps the mrl sufficiently saturated above 85 the contrast between cb and wr1 is not pronounced enough and in this case the degree of saturation 10 cm above the bottom of the mrl is around 70 in the summer and autumn well below the target of 85 the effect of a dry year fig 2 was also investigated with additional simulations results dashed lines in fig 11a b show that the absence of precipitation during two months in the summer would only slightly affect the mrl the degree of saturation in the retention layer would remain high above 95 with waste rock wr2 used as a capillary break 4 4 2 oxygen fluxes with a three layer ccbe the cumulative annual oxygen flux through the cover table 7 is much less than in the previous simulated cases it is generally well below 50 g m2 y except for the case with waste rock wr1 and till cb in all cases the oxygen flux with cb is at least one order of magnitude greater than with ca which confirms that till cb is less suitable as a mrl than the non acid generating tailings ca results also indicate that the difference in fluxes for covers using wr1 or wr2 can be greater than two orders of magnitude the configuration ca and wr2 gives the best results with a simulated oxygen flux 0 1 g m2 y 4 4 3 water chemistry reactive transport modelling was carried out to assess the effect of well designed three layer ccbes on the water quality only cases where oxygen fluxes are below the target of 50 g m2 y are shown here the results shown in fig 12 indicate significant differences between the various configurations despite oxygen fluxes being low and below 50 g m2 y only the case where fo2 0 1 g m2 y tacawr2 allows for a ph around neutrality with a ph 6 which is close to that of infiltrating water in the model sulfate and iron concentrations are 1 mg l and zinc concentrations are around 0 01 mg l using wr1 as a capillary break instead of wr2 increases the oxygen flux by more than two orders of magnitude but it remains relatively low around 10 g m2 y in the latter case the ph after 10 years 1 m below the tailings cover interface remains below 4 while the sulfate and iron concentrations are around 10 mg l and the zinc concentrations exceed 2 mg l the case where cb is used with wr2 represents an intermediate case in which the water ph 1 m below the tailings cover interface is around 5 0 iron and zinc concentrations are low but sulfate concentrations remain above 400 mg l this suggests that oxidation of tailings tb is continuing the case tbwr1 was not simulated due to the very high oxygen fluxes 200 g m2 y table 7 the simulations also show that water quality 1 m below the tailings cover interface tends to stabilize after around 4 years this is in accordance with observations made for example at the lorraine mine site by dagenais 2005 and bussière et al 2009 5 discussion the numerical results shown here which include data supported by experimental observations pabst 2011 pabst et al 2014 2017a b indicate that a monolayer cover may not be efficient enough to prevent amd generation for the conditions considered here particularly where the water table is deeper than 2 m below the surface of the reactive tailings for reactive tailings ta monolayer covers ca became desaturated because of the combined effects of both drainage and evaporation reactive tailings are thus strongly affected by evaporation and even though they remain close to saturation their degree of saturation is lower than expected for reactive tailings tb material cb is a somewhat better evaporation barrier than material ca due to its relatively low aev but coarse grained tailings tb desaturate mainly because of downward drainage overall however both monolayer covers ca and cb appear to be too fine to efficiently play the role of an evaporation barrier and too coarse to develop an efficient capillary barrier effect with the underlying tailings ta and tb simulations of water distribution and oxygen fluxes combined with reactive transport modelling indicate that under such conditions oxygen would migrate relatively quickly to the reactive tailings and thus contribute to the generation of amd the contribution of evaporation to cover desaturation was further assessed by simulating bilayer covers in this case the top mrl does not remain close to saturation despite the presence of a strong capillary break formed by the underlying waste rocks wr1 and wr2 which prevents water losses by downward drainage three layer ccbes were also simulated based on recommended designs for such covers aubertin et al 1994 1995 1999 2002 ricard et al 1997 1999 nastev and aubertin 2000 dagenais et al 2006 i e a 1 m thick waste rock layer wr1 or wr2 placed between the reactive tailings and the mrl 1 m thick finer grained material ca or cb with another 0 5 m waste rock layer on top the simulation results clearly show that such a cover would better reduce the oxygen flux to the tailings even during fairly long drought periods these simulations indicate however that even with this configuration the till cb is not efficient enough as an mrl material with the waste rock wr1 because of its weak water retention characteristics this extensive numerical study also shows some of the advantages of combining hydrogeological and geochemical models to assess the performance of cover systems particularly when the tailings are already oxidized in this case relying only on typical targets for oxygen fluxes may be misleading even though the oxygen flux remains below 50 g m2 y which is a practical objective for cover design e g aubertin et al 1999 dagenais 2005 hydrogeochemical simulations indicate that significant amd generation may continue over time due to the pre oxidation state of the tailings and the already acidic and contaminated pore waters that promote indirect oxidation e g nicholson 1994 williamson and rimstidt 1994 kirby et al 1999 nordstrom 2000 these new results also indicate that recommendations made by ouangrawa et al 2009 2010 following previous investigations on fresh non oxidized tailings may not be appropriate in this case the design criterion based on maintaining the water table at a depth below one half of the aev of the reactive fresh tailings approximately 3 to 4 m and 1 m for ta and tb respectively would not be directly applicable to already oxidized tailings in such cases it would be preferable to elevate the water table closer to the surface of the reactive tailings as demonstrated also by the column tests conducted by bussière et al 2011 an oxygen flux of around 1 g m2 y also seems a better target to prevent further amd generation in the particular case of sites a and b table 7 and fig 12 therefore even in this case the simulations indicate that it could take several years before actually observing an improvement of the leachate quality which is not unusual for the reclamation of old mining sites e g dagenais 2005 bussière et al 2009 also geochemical simulation results were assessed 1 m below the tailings surface and it could take even longer before improvements are observed at the outflow the various simulated scenarios also confirmed the importance of carefully choosing the cover material s for the capillary break material waste rock wr2 appears significantly more efficient to prevent desaturation of the mrl and lower the oxygen flux through the 3 layer ccbe using a coarser waste rock may however increase the risk of developing localized flows under highly saturated conditions e g dawood and aubertin 2014 broda et al 2015 lahmira et al 2016 these effects are not considered in the numerical models applied here using a very coarse waste rock as a protection and evaporation layer may also induce local advective fluxes that could increase evaporation from the mrl it is therefore recommended to further investigate the optimal grain size before using waste rocks in layered cover systems kalonji kabambi 2016 kalonji kabambi et al 2017 much effort was devoted in this investigation to calibration of the models and exhaustive parametric analyses but some uncertainties nonetheless remain for example it is challenging and relatively uncertain to extrapolate laboratory results to field conditions especially when considering in situ heterogeneity and 2d or 3d effects particularly close to the boundaries of the tailings impoundments for instance tailings ta characterized here are relatively fine grained compared to some of the tailings sampled elsewhere on site a e g gosselin 2007 pabst 2011 and to typical hard rock tailings from other sites e g aubertin et al 2002 bussière 2007 thus tailings ta are only partly representative of the conditions on the site additional tests and simulations would be required to assess the responses for different grain sizes and compositions in situ also even though column tests were conducted over almost two years the required lifetime of the cover on such type of tailings impoundment could exceed hundreds of years e g vick 2001 aubertin et al 2002 2016 additional uncertainties are therefore related to the very long term evolution of physical properties and mineralogical and chemical composition of the materials as well as reaction kinetics also the indirect oxidation reactions were taken into account here through a calibration of the reactive transport models based on column tests pabst et al 2017b further work is recommended to improve reactive transport simulations especially in terms of reaction kinetics and ph dependency finally it was assumed in the simulations that the water table was constant throughout the year and independent of the cover systems in practice it may fluctuate seasonally and could vary depending on the type of cover larger 3d models of the site should therefore be used to assess the effect of varying water table position considering its importance in terms of cover performance broda et al 2014 several simplifications were also made when simulating climatic conditions mainly due to numerical constraints and lack of more accurate climatic data for the two abandoned mining sites given the importance of evaporation on the efficiency of a cover system more emphasis should therefore be placed on this aspect see for example wilson et al 1997 additional effort should also be devoted to address the effects of climate change which can be expected to affect the performance of cover systems at limiting oxygen ingress over the long term e g mend 2011 reinecke and brodie 2012 6 conclusion coupled hydrogeological and geochemical numerical simulations calibrated and validated on instrumented column tests were carried out to investigate the performance of different cover systems to reclaim pre oxidized sulfidic tailings at two impoundments the degree of saturation pore water pressure oxygen flux and leachate quality were considered to assess cover efficiency to limit amd generation the effect of various factors such as water table position material properties and cover layer thickness were investigated alternative reclamation options including monolayer covers and two or three layer covers with capillary barrier effect s were also simulated the simulations illustrated how the behaviour and efficiency of a monolayer cover placed over reactive tailings depend on specific factors such as its hydraulic properties its thickness and more importantly the water table position the covers at the two sites are prone to desaturation especially when the water table is deep below the tailings cover interface under the tested conditions the simulations tend to indicate that a monolayer cover would not be able to prevent oxygen ingress except possibly with a highly elevated water table or a very thick cover oxygen flux estimates and reactive transport modelling corroborated this conclusion simulation results also tended to indicate that under a given set of conditions bilayer covers that include a base capillary break layer would not significantly improve their performance compared to a monolayer cover due to water losses by evaporation three layer covers with capillary barrier effects ccbe appear much more efficient in reducing the oxygen flux and amd generation the results further indicate that a well designed ccbe could maintain its efficiency during relatively long dry spells with minimal water replenishment under the conditions considered here the simulations have also shown that choosing the proper materials for the moisture retaining layer and the capillary break is critical a rigorous program involving extensive characterization laboratory experiments and numerical simulations is recommended to properly design an efficient and long lasting cover system it is also important to take into account the effects of pre oxidation of the tailings and the initial porewater chemistry which may also affect cover performance this study has further highlighted how coupled hydrogeological and geochemical simulations can lead to important new insights and more realistic results especially when calibrated on representative experimental tests this project coupled with additional laboratory and field tests pabst 2011 bussière et al 2011 and large scale numerical simulations broda et al 2014 ethier et al 2018 contributed to the final design of the cover system for several portions of site a additional field work is

1656,in the dynamic cycling of oxic and anoxic aqueous alluvial aquifer environments varying arsenic as concentrations are controlled by both abiotic and biotic factors studies have shown a significant form of toxic as iii being released through the reductive dissolution of iron oxy hydroxide minerals and microbial reduction mechanisms which leads to a serious health concern the present study was performed in order to assess the abiotic and biotic factors influencing as release into the alluvial aquifer groundwater in brahmaputra floodplain india the groundwater chemistry characterization of the sediments isolation identification and characterization of prominent as releasing indigenous bacterium were conducted the measured solid and liquid phases of total as concentration were ranged between 0 02 and 17 2 mg kg 1 and 8 to 353 μg l 1 respectively the morphology and mineralogy showed the presence of detrital and authigenic mineral assemblages whereas primary and secondary as bearing realgar and claudetite minerals were identified respectively furthermore significant non labile as fraction was found associated with the amorphous oxides of fe mn and al the observed groundwater chemistry and sediment color deduced a sub oxic reducing aquifer conditions in as contaminated regions in addition 16s rdna sequencing results of the isolated bacterium showed the prominent pseudomonas aeruginosa responsible for the mobilization of as reducing condition biomineralization and causing grey color to the sediments at the shallower and deeper aquifers in the study area these findings suggest that microbial metabolic activities are equally responsible in iron oxy hydroxide reductive dissolution controlling as mobilization in dynamic fluvial flood

arsenic as in an alluvial aquifer has exposed millions of peoples to the chronic poisoning by drinking contaminated groundwater smith et al 1992 bhattacharya et al 2002a mcarthur et al 2004 van geen et al 2008a fendorf et al 2010 sailo and mahanta 2016 the occurrence of toxic forms of inorganic as in drinking water even at relatively low concentration is considered as a serious health risk for the human beings wenzel et al 2001 the permissible limit of as concentration as per the world health organization who and u s environmental protection agency usepa is 10 μg l 1 for drinking water bhattacharya et al 2002a also the rising demand for secure and economical source for drinking domestic and irrigation water have made people dependent on the easily available shallow depth groundwater sources mahanta et al 2015 long term exposure to the arsenic contaminated water can cause the risks of bladder lung skin and prostate cancer in humans bhattacharya et al 2002a several other non cancerous effects can also be seen in humans such as anemia cardiovascular disease diabetes developmental and reproductive diseases immunological and neurological disorders bhattacharya et al 2002a the geogenic source of high as concentration in the alluvial aquifer sediments of brahmaputra floodplain bfp have threatened the life of several millions of people mahanta et al 2012 goswami et al 2014 mahanta et al 2015 mukherjee et al 2015 the palaeo channels and shallow depth alluvial aquifers of holocene age are highly susceptible for as contamination bhattacharya et al 2002b mcarthur et al 2004 the typical abundance of as in the sedimentary rocks such as sandstones vary in between 0 6 and 120 mg kg 1 whereas in clayey formation as concentration was measured up to 490 mg kg 1 bhattacharya et al 2002a the high surface area of fine sediments and negatively charged clay enhances the capacity of as adsorption on its surface therefore according to the earlier studies in parts of different aquifers suggested as mobilization were simultaneously controlled by both abiotic and biotic factors the reducing aquifer conditions adsorbed arsenate on amorphous fe and mn bearing minerals e g scorodite hematite goethite maghemite and manganite can be remobilized by the microbial activity during fe iii to fe ii transformations papassiopi et al 2003 eventually releasing fe ii and as iii into groundwater the groundwater extracted from brown sand aquifers were typically reported as as safe 10 μg l 1 compared to reduced grey color sandy aquifers van geen et al 2003 hoque et al 2012 however aquifers dominated in grey color sediments near brahmaputra river were also observed yielding low as concentration groundwater mahanta et al 2015 the predominant factors reported for as mobilization into the alluvial aquifer groundwater systems are 1 pyrite oxidation results in the release of arsenic das et al 1995 2 release of as by competitive adsorption of anions smedley and kinniburgh 2002 i e the competitive adsorption of anions viz po4 3 and so4 2 etc on fe oxy hydroxyl minerals surfaces and 3 as is released due to desorption from or fe and mn reductive dissolution into reducing aquifer condition bhattacharya et al 1997 ravenscroft et al 2009 moreover the predominant as mobilization factors reported by several researchers over southeast asia suggested the reductive dissolution of fe oxy hydroxides minerals as the prime cause of high as concentration in anoxic groundwater mcarthur et al 2004 nath et al 2005 van geen et al 2008b besides the abiotic factors several as iii oxidizing and as v reducing bacteria are also known for controlling as stimulation and mobilization via dissimilatory reduction or detoxification mechanisms bacteria viz clostridium pseudomonas brevundimonas rhodococcus agrobacterium staphylococcus enterobacter rhizobium bacillus geobacter desulfitobacterium exiguobacterium desulfocapsa etc are well known for their redox capability for as worldwide akai et al 2008 mirza et al 2014 cai et al 2016 sathe et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 chen et al 2017 jebelli et al 2017 ko et al 2017 table 1 enlists the list of few bacteria isolated from arsenic contaminated sites moreover to the best of our knowledge there are scarce reports on the studies over isolation and identification of microbes for as mobilization into groundwater over bfp hence the aim of this study was 1 to assess the mechanisms for heterogeneous distribution of dissolved as concentration in alluvial aquifer of bfp 2 to characterize and describe the fundamental mineralogical morphological and elemental composition of as contaminated sediments 3 to isolate identify and characterize the indigenous arsenic mobilizing bacterium 2 materials and

al 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater chemistry the groundwater ph was found to be in the range of 5 6 8 8 with a low do 0 56 to 2 4 mg l 1 concentration and also depicted a strong to moderate reducing orp 278 60 mv to 28 81 mv conditions table 2 presents the in situ and ex situ measured groundwater parameters in a total of 215 analyzed groundwater samples 173 samples i e 80 showed dissolved as concentration 10 μg l 1 whereas about 42 samples i e 20 were found to be within the who world health organization guidelines i e as 10 μg l 1 table 2 among all the three analyzed block samples tapattari block had shown the highest as contamination i e 100 whereas boitamari was found to be moderately as contaminated region i e 56 and srijangram possessed the least i e 46 contaminated region the analyses showed hco3 221 3 mg l 1 exhibiting highest anion concentration whereas highest ca 2 111 mg l 1 cation concentrations were observed in the groundwater analyzed samples table 2 depicted the predominance of cations in the order of ca 2 k na mg 2 concentration while the anions abundance follows the order hco3 po4 3 cl so4 2 in the high as concentration regions higher average fe 38 mg l 1 concentration was measured in average high as 55 μg l 1 concentration region whereas average high mn 1 mg l 1 concentration was recorded in low as contaminated region 3 1 1 major hydro geochemical facies and statistical correlation in this study the hydro geochemical composition of groundwater with major ions were represented using a trilinear diagram also known as a piper diagram piper 1944 winston 2000 fig 3 based on the piper plot water chemistry were classified into two major water facies as 1 ca2 hco3 and 2 ca2 na hco3 the results were well corroborated with the previous studies performed by mahanta et al 2015 henceforth these two water facies decipher the weathering dissolution precipitation mechanisms and freshwater recharge processes which were controlling the hydro geochemistry in the study area the lower concentration of cl clearly depicted that the groundwater aquifer was replenished by the surface water bodies sahu et al 2016 also it could be observed from fig 3 that the two regions namely tapatari and srijangram blocks fall under facie 2 whereas the facie 1 is common in the three blocks groundwater samples the pearson correlation ρ values calculated between dissolved as concentrations with fe mn and hco3 for the three studied block groundwater samples are shown in fig s1 here the positive correlation values 0 52 0 64 and 0 69 were observed between dissolved fe and as concentrations of tapatari boitamari and srijangram block groundwater samples respectively fig s1a these correlation values strongly support the reductive dissolution mechanism of fe oxy hydroxide minerals was the primary cause for the as mobilization in this study area regions mcarthur et al 2004 furthermore dissolved arsenic concentration depicted insignificant correlation with mn 0 22 0 08 and 0 05 and hco3 0 46 0 12 and 0 17 in tapatari boitamari and srijangram block groundwater samples respectively the lack of correlation between as with mn and hco3 observed especially for boitamari and srijangram blocks fig s1 b c suggested that the lack of ph dependent desorption at these regions whereas positive value depicted reductive dissolution mechanism mobilizes as at a regional scale mukherjee and fryar 2008 the weak correlation values were observed between fe and hco3 as 0 31 011 and 0 3 in tapatari boitamari and srijangram block groundwater samples fig s1 d respectively suggesting precipitation of siderite vaterite goethite and dolomite minerals mahanta et al 2015 earlier studies over ganga meghana brahmaputra floodplain have also observed the insignificant fe and hco3 correlation suggesting non conservative nature of siderite mineral leading to lower dissolved fe concentration in the groundwater aquifers mahanta et al 2015 3 1 2 saturation indices visual minteq 3 1 software was used to determine the mineral saturation indices si which show whether the groundwater will tend to dissolve or precipitate a particular minerals in these study area aquifers table 3 enlisted the range of si values for some of the important minerals and gases phase in to the groundwater of the study areas aquifers here the negative and positive values of si signifies the presence of unsaturated and oversaturated minerals respectively unsaturated conditions for realgar avg 69 orpiment avg 179 claudetite avg 23 8 and arsenolite avg 23 8 were found for as bearing minerals also other as associated minerals viz chalcocite avg 53 chalcopyrite avg 91 and pyrite avg 85 were found in the unsaturated state conditions and which may dissolve further in the conducive environment except for the saturated minerals of iron such as maghemite avg 8 3 lepidocrocite avg 6 magnetite avg 21 goethite avg 6 8 ferrihydrite avg 4 3 siderite avg 0 8 vivianite avg 4 4 and hematite avg 16 no other significant fe bearing minerals were found in the saturation state table 3 in the results only greigite avg 198 fe s bearing mineral was found among the highest unsaturated state condition table 3 moreover average partial pressure values for dissolved gases were observed in a decreasing order of co2 h2 nh3 o2 h2s ch4 showed nearly in an equilibrium condition significant average positive value of co2 0 02 0 08 0 03 gas was observed in tapatari boitamari and srijangram block respectively in the studied groundwater samples table 3 this results further suggests that an input from the organic matter oxidation and carbonate dissolution mechanism prevailing in these aquifer mukherjee and fryar 2008 3 2 sediment analysis 3 2 1 total elemental analysis and mineralogical composition non destructive xrf method was utilized to determine the total elemental concentration which showed significant concentrations of as avg 4 3 mg kg 1 fe avg 15 mn avg 0 2 mg kg 1 and ca 2 avg 5 1 mg kg 1 in sandy aquifers table s1 in grey color sediments relatively low as 0 02 mg kg 1 concentration was measured than the brown 17 2 mg kg 1 color sediments in deeper depth sediment sample i e 7 4 m depth showed the presence of high as concentration 17 1 mg kg 1 along with the other heavy metals in the yellow color fine sand sediment sample table s1 average as concentration in the sediment was found to be in the range of 1 15 mg kg 1 which were often found in dynamic fluvial sediments plant et al 2003 the observed average as concentration i e 4 3 mg kg 1 in the shallow aquifer sediments can be attributed to the change in surface layer of the sediments via the level of stratification and flow dynamics by overlying water bodies masson et al 2007 postma et al 2010 in oxic groundwater aquifer often as v was the predominant species while the less stable as iii prevailed in the anoxic zone cullen and reimer 1989 in presence of oxidizing and reducing conditions usually as i e as iii and as v was accompanied with fe oxy hydroxide viz goethite hematite and gibbsite ferrihydrite and clay minerals and carbonate or bicarbonate bearing minerals which might act as a main solid phase as carrier for aquifer contamination sengupta et al 2004 the mineralogical analysis by xrd fig 4 elucidated the presence of primary as bearing minerals at the corresponding d spacing values such as realgar 3 17 and 2 93 which was observed in the medium sand coarse sand and fine sand aquifer at a depth of 39 m 13 m and 23 m respectively secondary as bearing mineral claudetite 4 85 3 22 and 1 82 were observed in the sandy yellowish grey oxidized aquifer sediments at a depth of 13 m however the other rock forming and clay minerals mainly comprising of silicates quartz 2 26 and 1 54 mica group biotite 10 09 and 2 27 and illite 2 01 anorthoclase 2 12 dolomite 2 41 and 1 80 and kyanite 4 31 and 1 38 minerals were also found in all the depth samples fig 4 significant characteristic peaks of crystalline fe oxy hydroxides minerals such as lepidocrocite 2 47 maghemite 3 38 and 1 66 siderite 2 13 and hematite 3 68 were identified whereas jacobsite and birnessite mineral peaks were not detected in the analyzed sediment samples probably due to their amorphous nature aluminum hydroxide mineral such as gibbsite 3 36 and 2 24 along with graphite 7 24 mineral was observed in shallow and deeper depth sediments fig 4 results obtained from the geochemical model showed the si values for the selective minerals in the study area groundwater was observed near saturation with respect to fe iii and mn oxyhydroxides minerals with varying eh values furthermore bivariate plots fig 5 a c showed the dependency of modeled si values for rhodochrosite vivianite and siderite minerals versus dissolved concentration of fe and mn in the groundwater aquifer fig 5 a c clearly showed an increase in precipitation of the rhodochrosite vivianite and siderite minerals with the increase in mn and fe concentration thus it further infered that adsorption and desorption characteristics of these minerals in the conducive environment control the as mobilization in the shallow aquifer groundwater of the study area 3 2 2 selective sequential analysis the sequential extraction method was applied for as enriched sediments to measure as affinity with the respective fractions along with fe mn and al content table 4 following are the results of the sequential extraction for each successive fractions as follows fraction 1 in physisorbed outer sphere

and 23 m the chemisorbed fraction of as accounts for 3 2 3 4 3 3 and 2 wt of the total extractable as respectively was measured table 4 extractable mn fe and al fractions was measured between 0 to 4 wt 2 to 4 wt and 2 to 3 wt respectively fraction 3 the extractable concentration of total non labile arsenic associated with poorly crystallized and amorphous oxides of fe mn and al minerals surfaces were measured in between 0 45 to 13 2 wt in this fraction significant portion of the as associated with amorphous and poorly crystalline oxides of fe mn and al were extracted for example in sediments from the depths of 38 29 26 13 5 1 3 17 and 23 m in wt as extracted from this fractions were 25 28 26 24 25 29 and 25 respectively table 4 while the wt concentration of fe mn and al were measured in

between 1 1 to 6 5 μg g 1 from the analyzed sediment samples in comparison to above fractions in this fraction major as concentration was extracted moreover the extracted fractions of al mn and fe were measured in wt ranged between 10 to 16 wt 9 to 16 wt and 11 to 14 wt respectively fraction 5 in this final stage the residual total extracted as concentration was measured between 4 3 to 22 2 μg g 1 table 4 whereas in wt as extracted from the depths of 38 29 26 13 5 1 3 17 and 23 m was measured as 51 48 52 56 54 43 and 56 wt respectively moreover for mn fe and al extracted fraction was ranged between 44 to 52 wt 48 to 53 wt and 38 to 58 wt respectively table 4 3 3 morphological and elemental analysis of sediments morphological studies of the sediments by fesem analysis showed the presence of detrital and authigenic minerals crystal in the sediment samples fig 6 a c here the grains with broken and or rounded edges were classified as detrital fig 6 a c whereas grains with sharp edges indicated the presence of authigenic minerals fig 6 b in addition some abrasion could not be denied during the handling and drilling processes of the samples further fesem eds analyses validated the mineral composition and crystal systems such as aphrosiderite trigonal hexagonal quartz trigonal and jarosite trigonal and scorodite orthorhombic in selective depth bore well sediments eds results also depicted a close affinity of o al and si elements with arsenic which were common in all the analyzed samples whereas significant weight percentage wt of other elementals concentration such as br ti and cu were also detected the presence of significant weight ratio of o fe ranged from 0 7 to 12 6 suggested the role of iron oxy hydro xide minerals in adsorption or desorption of arsenic in the aquifer sediments matera et al 2003 furthermore the higher weight of o as ratio in the range of 9 5 to 56 4 was also been detected in the samples fig 6 whereas the ratio of fe as was found in the range of 1 1 to 34 1 suggested that these aquifer sediments were high enough to retain arsenic in near future due to increase in arsenic adsorption capacity of aquifer sediments in the study area matera et al 2003 3 4 color change of sand grains from brown to grey the experimental results showed that the light yellow color coarse sand which was exposed to the h2s gas for 10 min turned to grey color fig s2 a b it could further be concluded that these aquifers were vulnerable for the precipitation of fe s as bearing minerals in addition the aforesaid results also well supported the presence of low dissolved so4 2 concentration in shallow aquifer groundwater samples moreover because of the influence of h2s gas production brown color sand was surface coated by iron sulfide leading to the formation of grey color sand hagiwara et al 2011 thus the result inferred that presence of predominate grey color sandy clayey at the shallow aquifer were susceptible to color change with respect to time 3 4 1 isolation identification and morphology of the isolated bacterium pour plate technique was used to isolate and enumerate as reducing bacterium predominately white w1 colored colonies were observed on the cultured agar plates the indigenous bacterium strain isolated from as rich sediment was further identified as pseudomonas aeruginosa with a sequence similarity of nearly about 99 by the blast analysis of 16s rrna gene sequences 1453 bp the bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1000 replicates was taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed felsenstein 1985 the culture w1 showed similarity with pseudomonas aeruginosa strain based on nucleotide homology and phylogenetic analysis fig s3 the ncbi gen bank accession numbers obtained by the gene sequence for the arsenate reducing bacteria i e w1 is ku710761 fesem analysis of the bacterial isolate clearly depicted rod shaped morphology having a length of 1 6 3 2 μm and 0 5 0 69 μm in diameter fig 7 a b the obtained tem eds analysis results confirm the rod shaped morphology with bioaccumulation and precipitation of as on the bacterial surface fig 7 c d further the strain was characterized as aerobic and gram negative bacteria by the biochemical tests of the microorganism 3 4 2 effect of as on the bacterial growth the capability of pseudomonas aeruginosa to grow in the presence of different initial arsenic concentration with an initial arsenic concentration viz as iii range from 100 to 900 mg l 1 was studied and is shown in fig 8 the results revealed that in the presence of arsenic the bacterium showed a reduced biomass growth profile also p aeruginosa achieved the maximum biomass concentration with a delay of 12 h for all the arsenic contaminated flasks a clear decline could be observed in all the flasks having an initial as concentration range from 100 to 850 mg l 1 further the culture showed negligible growth in the flask possessing an initial as concentration of 900 mg l 1 inferring that the bacterial tolerance limit is 850 mg l 1 beyond this as concentration i e 900 mg l 1 p aeruginosa was not able to grow and inferring the lethal as concentration for the strain hence the strain isolated from this study area p aeruginosa is capable of tolerating arsenic concentration up to an initial concentration of 850 mg l 1 in an another study performed by ghosh and sar 2013 acidovorax strain collected from the groundwater samples of northern part of brahmaputra river were found to be hypertolerant to as v as well as as iii whereas brevundimonas sp was hypertolerant to both the forms i e as v and as iii capable of tolerating 550 mm and 50 mm concentrations respectively in addition the growth of the culture at and above an optical density of 0 4 value was used for the qualitative screening test salmassi et al 2002 a pink color of the mixture indicated positive arsenite oxidation reaction formation of as v and a yellow color indicated positive arsenate reduction reaction formation of as iii salmassi et al 2002 the screening test of the obtained culture showed yellow color suggests that positive arsenate reduction reaction prevailing and bacterium were capable to reduce arsenate fig s4 pseudomonas aeruginosa sp ars c microbe is a member of pseudomonadaceae family which was also found in the study area and is very well known for its respiration and reducing nature of as v in the natural environment cai et al 1998 zhang et al 2016 it was also been observed in several other studies that most of pseudomonas sp is a facultative anaerobic bacterium which uses nitrate as an electron acceptor and also belongs to the genera of manganese reducing bacteria gounot 1994 on the other hand dissimilatory arsenate reducing bacteria couples growth with as v as the terminal electron acceptor malasarn et al 2004 degradation of organic matter mediated by bacteria induces anoxic environment in the aquifer which further enhances as methylation bhattacharya et al 2002a these methylated as species adsorbs on fe oxide mineral surfaces bhattacharya et al 2002a which may further be reduced by facultative aerobic bacteria into soluble as species or form secondary as bearing mineral viz claudetite thus this study inferred that the oxic anoxic condition was prevailing in the shallow and deeper aquifers which enhanced the growth of aerobic facultative aerobic arsenate reducing bacteria the isolated indigenous microbial species p aeruginosa sp ars c had endowed the ability of biotransformation of inorganic as forms i e as iii and as v vicente et al 1990 pepi et al 2007 caroline 2017 this helped in the understanding of as mobilization bio mineralization and precipitation in the alluvial aquifers 4 conclusions in this study abiotic and biotic factors of as mobilization were observed in different as contaminated alluvial aquifers which were controlled by redox conditions and facultative microbes at shallow and deeper depth aquifers this study determined that there was no perceptible as enrichment differences observed in grey and yellow brown sands elevated dissolved fe concentration was found significantly correlated with as suggesting that reductive dissolution of fe oxide minerals equally increases dissolved as concentration in the groundwater further sse method explained that as was strongly associated with the amorphous and poorly crystalline oxides of fe mn and al solid phase in addition the geochemical modeling results probed the mechanism of precipitation and dissolution of particular minerals in the aquifer sediments the mineralogical and morphological results showed crystalline as fe al mn and clayey bearing minerals are pressent suggesting the pressence of detrital and authigenic minerals in selective depth sediments of the study area the phylogenetic and sequencing analysis of the isolated indigenous bacterium showed the predominance of facultative aerobic pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterium prevailing and reducing arsenate in the sub oxic groundwater conditions its phase diagram and qualitative test support that this bacterium use arsenate as the terminal electron acceptor and reduce arsenate by dissimilatory reduction mechanisms the findings of this study provide evidenced insights into as mobilization thus the results infered that reductive dissolution of fe oxy hydroxides coupled with the biogeochemical cycle of as iii and as v point towards prevalence of sub oxic to reducing alluvial aquifer conditions infested by indigenous bacterium which too play an important role in arsenic

1656,in the dynamic cycling of oxic and anoxic aqueous alluvial aquifer environments varying arsenic as concentrations are controlled by both abiotic and biotic factors studies have shown a significant form of toxic as iii being released through the reductive dissolution of iron oxy hydroxide minerals and microbial reduction mechanisms which leads to a serious health concern the present study was performed in order to assess the abiotic and biotic factors influencing as release into the alluvial aquifer groundwater in brahmaputra floodplain india the groundwater chemistry characterization of the sediments isolation identification and characterization of prominent as releasing indigenous bacterium were conducted the measured solid and liquid phases of total as concentration were ranged between 0 02 and 17 2 mg kg 1 and 8 to 353 μg l 1 respectively the morphology and mineralogy showed the presence of detrital and authigenic mineral assemblages whereas primary and secondary as bearing realgar and claudetite minerals were identified respectively furthermore significant non labile as fraction was found associated with the amorphous oxides of fe mn and al the observed groundwater chemistry and sediment color deduced a sub oxic reducing aquifer conditions in as contaminated regions in addition 16s rdna sequencing results of the isolated bacterium showed the prominent pseudomonas aeruginosa responsible for the mobilization of as reducing condition biomineralization and causing grey color to the sediments at the shallower and deeper aquifers in the study area these findings suggest that microbial metabolic activities are equally responsible in iron oxy hydroxide reductive dissolution controlling as mobilization in dynamic fluvial flood

arsenic as in an alluvial aquifer has exposed millions of peoples to the chronic poisoning by drinking contaminated groundwater smith et al 1992 bhattacharya et al 2002a mcarthur et al 2004 van geen et al 2008a fendorf et al 2010 sailo and mahanta 2016 the occurrence of toxic forms of inorganic as in drinking water even at relatively low concentration is considered as a serious health risk for the human beings wenzel et al 2001 the permissible limit of as concentration as per the world health organization who and u s environmental protection agency usepa is 10 μg l 1 for drinking water bhattacharya et al 2002a also the rising demand for secure and economical source for drinking domestic and irrigation water have made people dependent on the easily available shallow depth groundwater sources mahanta et al 2015 long term exposure to the arsenic contaminated water can cause the risks of bladder lung skin and prostate cancer in humans bhattacharya et al 2002a several other non cancerous effects can also be seen in humans such as anemia cardiovascular disease diabetes developmental and reproductive diseases immunological and neurological disorders bhattacharya et al 2002a the geogenic source of high as concentration in the alluvial aquifer sediments of brahmaputra floodplain bfp have threatened the life of several millions of people mahanta et al 2012 goswami et al 2014 mahanta et al 2015 mukherjee et al 2015 the palaeo channels and shallow depth alluvial aquifers of holocene age are highly susceptible for as contamination bhattacharya et al 2002b mcarthur et al 2004 the typical abundance of as in the sedimentary rocks such as sandstones vary in between 0 6 and 120 mg kg 1 whereas in clayey formation as concentration was measured up to 490 mg kg 1 bhattacharya et al 2002a the high surface area of fine sediments and negatively charged clay enhances the capacity of as adsorption on its surface therefore according to the earlier studies in parts of different aquifers suggested as mobilization were simultaneously controlled by both abiotic and biotic factors the reducing aquifer conditions adsorbed arsenate on amorphous fe and mn bearing minerals e g scorodite hematite goethite maghemite and manganite can be remobilized by the microbial activity during fe iii to fe ii transformations papassiopi et al 2003 eventually releasing fe ii and as iii into groundwater the groundwater extracted from brown sand aquifers were typically reported as as safe 10 μg l 1 compared to reduced grey color sandy aquifers van geen et al 2003 hoque et al 2012 however aquifers dominated in grey color sediments near brahmaputra river were also observed yielding low as concentration groundwater mahanta et al 2015 the predominant factors reported for as mobilization into the alluvial aquifer groundwater systems are 1 pyrite oxidation results in the release of arsenic das et al 1995 2 release of as by competitive adsorption of anions smedley and kinniburgh 2002 i e the competitive adsorption of anions viz po4 3 and so4 2 etc on fe oxy hydroxyl minerals surfaces and 3 as is released due to desorption from or fe and mn reductive dissolution into reducing aquifer condition bhattacharya et al 1997 ravenscroft et al 2009 moreover the predominant as mobilization factors reported by several researchers over southeast asia suggested the reductive dissolution of fe oxy hydroxides minerals as the prime cause of high as concentration in anoxic groundwater mcarthur et al 2004 nath et al 2005 van geen et al 2008b besides the abiotic factors several as iii oxidizing and as v reducing bacteria are also known for controlling as stimulation and mobilization via dissimilatory reduction or detoxification mechanisms bacteria viz clostridium pseudomonas brevundimonas rhodococcus agrobacterium staphylococcus enterobacter rhizobium bacillus geobacter desulfitobacterium exiguobacterium desulfocapsa etc are well known for their redox capability for as worldwide akai et al 2008 mirza et al 2014 cai et al 2016 sathe et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 chen et al 2017 jebelli et al 2017 ko et al 2017 table 1 enlists the list of few bacteria isolated from arsenic contaminated sites moreover to the best of our knowledge there are scarce reports on the studies over isolation and identification of microbes for as mobilization into groundwater over bfp hence the aim of this study was 1 to assess the mechanisms for heterogeneous distribution of dissolved as concentration in alluvial aquifer of bfp 2 to characterize and describe the fundamental mineralogical morphological and elemental composition of as contaminated sediments 3 to isolate identify and characterize the indigenous arsenic mobilizing bacterium 2 materials and

al 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater chemistry the groundwater ph was found to be in the range of 5 6 8 8 with a low do 0 56 to 2 4 mg l 1 concentration and also depicted a strong to moderate reducing orp 278 60 mv to 28 81 mv conditions table 2 presents the in situ and ex situ measured groundwater parameters in a total of 215 analyzed groundwater samples 173 samples i e 80 showed dissolved as concentration 10 μg l 1 whereas about 42 samples i e 20 were found to be within the who world health organization guidelines i e as 10 μg l 1 table 2 among all the three analyzed block samples tapattari block had shown the highest as contamination i e 100 whereas boitamari was found to be moderately as contaminated region i e 56 and srijangram possessed the least i e 46 contaminated region the analyses showed hco3 221 3 mg l 1 exhibiting highest anion concentration whereas highest ca 2 111 mg l 1 cation concentrations were observed in the groundwater analyzed samples table 2

geochemical facies and statistical correlation in this study the hydro geochemical composition of groundwater with major ions were represented using a trilinear diagram also known as a piper diagram piper 1944 winston 2000 fig 3 based on the piper plot water chemistry were classified into two major water facies as 1 ca2 hco3 and 2 ca2 na hco3 the results were well corroborated with the previous studies performed by mahanta et al 2015 henceforth these two water facies decipher the weathering dissolution precipitation mechanisms and freshwater recharge processes which were controlling the hydro geochemistry in the study area the lower concentration of cl clearly depicted that the groundwater aquifer was replenished by the surface water bodies sahu et al 2016 also it could be observed from fig 3 that the two regions namely tapatari and srijangram blocks fall under facie 2 whereas the facie 1 is common in the three blocks groundwater samples the pearson correlation ρ values calculated between dissolved as concentrations with fe mn and hco3 for the three studied block groundwater samples are shown in fig s1 here the positive correlation values 0 52 0 64 and 0 69 were observed between dissolved fe and as concentrations of tapatari boitamari and srijangram block groundwater samples respectively fig s1a these correlation values strongly support the reductive dissolution mechanism of fe oxy hydroxide minerals was the primary cause for the as mobilization in this study area regions mcarthur et al 2004 furthermore dissolved arsenic concentration depicted insignificant correlation with mn 0 22 0 08 and 0 05 and hco3 0 46 0 12 and 0 17 in tapatari boitamari and srijangram block groundwater samples respectively the lack of correlation between as with mn and hco3 observed especially for boitamari and srijangram blocks fig s1 b c suggested that the lack of ph dependent desorption at these regions whereas positive value depicted reductive dissolution mechanism mobilizes as at a regional scale mukherjee and fryar 2008 the weak correlation values were observed between fe and hco3 as 0 31 011 and 0 3 in tapatari boitamari and srijangram block groundwater samples fig s1 d respectively suggesting precipitation of siderite vaterite goethite and dolomite minerals mahanta et al 2015 earlier studies over ganga meghana brahmaputra floodplain have also observed the insignificant fe and hco3 correlation suggesting non conservative nature of siderite mineral leading to lower dissolved fe concentration in the groundwater aquifers mahanta et al 2015 3 1 2 saturation indices visual minteq 3 1 software was used to determine the mineral saturation indices si which show whether the groundwater will tend to dissolve or precipitate a particular minerals in these study area aquifers table 3 enlisted the range of si values for some of the important minerals and gases phase in to the groundwater of the study areas aquifers here the negative and positive values of si signifies the presence of unsaturated and oversaturated minerals respectively unsaturated conditions for realgar avg 69 orpiment avg 179 claudetite avg 23 8 and arsenolite avg 23 8 were found for as bearing minerals also other as associated minerals viz chalcocite avg 53 chalcopyrite avg 91 and pyrite avg 85 were found in the unsaturated state conditions and which may dissolve further in the conducive environment except for the saturated minerals of iron such as maghemite avg 8 3 lepidocrocite avg 6 magnetite avg 21 goethite avg 6 8 ferrihydrite avg 4 3 siderite avg 0 8 vivianite avg 4 4 and hematite avg 16 no other significant fe bearing minerals were found in the saturation state table 3 in the results only greigite avg 198 fe s bearing mineral was found among the highest unsaturated state condition table 3 moreover average partial pressure values for dissolved gases were observed in a decreasing order of co2 h2 nh3 o2 h2s ch4 showed nearly in an equilibrium condition significant average positive value of co2 0 02 0 08 0 03 gas was observed in tapatari boitamari and srijangram block respectively in the studied groundwater samples table 3 this results further suggests that an input from the organic matter oxidation and carbonate dissolution mechanism prevailing in these aquifer mukherjee and fryar 2008 3 2 sediment analysis 3 2 1 total elemental analysis and mineralogical composition non destructive xrf method was utilized to determine the total elemental concentration which showed significant concentrations of as avg 4 3 mg kg 1 fe avg 15 mn avg 0 2 mg kg 1 and ca 2 avg 5 1 mg kg 1 in sandy aquifers table s1 in grey color sediments relatively low as 0 02 mg kg 1 concentration was measured than the brown 17 2 mg kg 1 color sediments in deeper depth sediment sample i e 7 4 m depth showed the presence of high as concentration 17 1 mg kg 1 along with the other heavy metals in the yellow color fine sand sediment sample table s1 average as concentration in the sediment was found to be in the range of 1 15 mg kg 1 which were often found in dynamic fluvial sediments plant et al 2003 the observed average as concentration i e 4 3 mg kg 1 in the shallow aquifer sediments can be attributed to the change in surface layer of the sediments via the level of stratification and flow dynamics by overlying water bodies masson et al 2007 postma et al 2010 in oxic groundwater aquifer often as v was the predominant species while the less stable as iii prevailed in the anoxic zone cullen and reimer 1989 in presence of oxidizing and reducing conditions usually as i e as iii and as v was accompanied with fe oxy hydroxide viz goethite hematite and gibbsite ferrihydrite and clay minerals and carbonate or bicarbonate bearing minerals which might act as a main solid phase as carrier for aquifer contamination sengupta et al 2004 the mineralogical analysis by xrd fig 4 elucidated the presence of primary as bearing minerals at the corresponding d spacing values such as realgar 3 17 and 2 93 which was observed in the medium sand coarse sand and fine sand aquifer at a depth of 39 m 13 m and 23 m respectively secondary as bearing mineral claudetite 4 85 3 22 and 1 82 were observed in the sandy yellowish grey oxidized aquifer sediments at a depth of 13 m however the other rock forming and clay minerals mainly comprising of silicates quartz 2 26 and 1 54 mica group biotite 10 09 and 2 27 and illite 2 01 anorthoclase 2 12 dolomite 2 41 and 1 80 and kyanite 4 31 and 1 38 minerals were also found in all the depth samples fig 4 significant characteristic peaks of crystalline fe oxy hydroxides minerals such as lepidocrocite 2 47 maghemite 3 38 and 1 66 siderite 2 13 and hematite 3 68 were identified whereas jacobsite and birnessite mineral peaks were not detected in the analyzed sediment samples probably due to their amorphous nature aluminum hydroxide mineral such as gibbsite 3 36 and 2 24 along with graphite 7 24 mineral was observed in shallow and deeper depth sediments fig 4 results obtained from the geochemical model showed the si values for the selective minerals in the study area groundwater was observed near saturation with respect to fe iii and mn oxyhydroxides minerals with varying eh values furthermore bivariate plots fig 5 a c showed the dependency of modeled si values for rhodochrosite vivianite and siderite minerals versus dissolved concentration of fe and mn in the groundwater aquifer fig 5 a c clearly showed an increase in precipitation of the rhodochrosite vivianite and siderite minerals with the increase in mn and fe concentration thus it further infered that adsorption and desorption characteristics of these minerals in the conducive environment control the as mobilization in the shallow aquifer groundwater of the study area 3 2 2 selective sequential analysis the sequential extraction method was applied for as enriched sediments to measure as affinity with the respective fractions along with fe mn and al content table 4 following are the results of the sequential extraction for each successive fractions as follows fraction 1 in physisorbed outer sphere surface complexes fraction concentrations of total extractable as was ranged from 0 6 to 3 6 μg g 1 table 4 the physisorbed fractions weight percentage in wt of as account for 6 8 7 6 6 8 and 6 out of the total as concentrations obtained from 38 29 26 13 5 1 3 17 and 23 m depth sediments respectively moreover the lowest concentrations of the total extractable as was measured in physisorbed portion table 4 extractable average fractions wt of mn fe al were measured as 7 6 and 7 respectively fraction 2 in this chemisorbed extractable fraction inner sphere surface complexes concentrations of total as was measured from 0 2 to 1 4 μg g 1 table 4 in this chemisorbed fraction less as was extracted in proportions of physisorbed fractions for example in sediments from depths of 38 29 26 13 5 1 3 17 and 23 m the chemisorbed fraction of as accounts for 3 2 3 4 3 3 and 2 wt of the total extractable as respectively was measured table 4 extractable mn fe and al fractions was measured between 0 to 4 wt 2 to 4 wt and 2 to 3 wt respectively fraction 3 the extractable concentration of total non labile arsenic associated with poorly crystallized and amorphous oxides of fe mn and al minerals surfaces were measured in between 0 45 to 13 2 wt in this fraction significant portion of the as associated with amorphous and poorly crystalline oxides of fe mn and al were extracted for example in sediments from the depths of 38 29 26 13 5 1 3 17 and 23 m in wt as extracted from this fractions were 25 28 26 24 25 29 and 25 respectively table 4 while the wt concentration of fe mn and al were measured in between as 24 28 wt 22 32 wt and 22 35 wt respectively in this fraction fraction 4 the total extractable concentration of as bound to well crystallized fe mn and al oxide minerals were measured in between 1 1 to 6 5 μg g 1 from the analyzed sediment samples in comparison to above fractions in this fraction major as concentration was extracted moreover the extracted fractions of al mn and fe were measured in wt ranged between 10 to 16 wt 9 to 16 wt and 11 to 14 wt respectively fraction 5 in this final stage the residual total extracted as concentration was measured between 4 3 to 22 2 μg g 1 table 4 whereas in wt as extracted from the depths of 38 29 26 13 5 1 3 17 and 23 m was measured as 51 48 52 56 54 43 and 56 wt respectively moreover for mn fe and al extracted fraction was ranged between 44 to 52 wt 48 to 53 wt and 38 to 58 wt respectively table 4 3 3 morphological and elemental analysis of sediments morphological studies of the sediments by fesem analysis showed the presence of detrital and authigenic minerals crystal in the sediment samples fig 6 a c here the grains with broken and or rounded edges were classified as detrital fig 6 a c whereas grains with sharp edges indicated the presence of authigenic minerals fig 6 b in addition some abrasion could not be denied during the handling and drilling processes of the samples further fesem eds analyses validated the mineral composition and crystal systems such as aphrosiderite trigonal hexagonal quartz trigonal and jarosite trigonal and scorodite orthorhombic in selective depth bore well sediments eds results also depicted a close affinity of o al and si elements with arsenic which were common in all the analyzed samples whereas significant weight percentage wt of other elementals concentration such as br ti and cu were also detected the presence of significant weight ratio of o fe ranged from 0 7 to 12 6 suggested the role of iron oxy hydro xide minerals in adsorption or desorption of arsenic in the aquifer sediments matera et al 2003 furthermore the higher weight of o as ratio in the range of 9 5 to 56 4 was also been detected in the samples fig 6 whereas the ratio of fe as was found in the range of 1 1 to 34 1 suggested that these aquifer sediments were high enough to retain arsenic in near future due to increase in arsenic adsorption capacity of aquifer sediments in the study area matera et al 2003 3 4 color change of sand grains from brown to grey the experimental results showed that the light yellow color coarse sand which was exposed to the h2s gas for 10 min turned to grey color fig s2 a b it could further be concluded that these aquifers were vulnerable for the precipitation of fe s as bearing minerals in addition the aforesaid results also well supported the presence of low dissolved so4 2 concentration in shallow aquifer groundwater samples moreover because of the influence of h2s gas production brown color sand was surface coated by iron sulfide leading to the formation of grey color sand hagiwara et al 2011 thus the result inferred that presence of predominate grey color sandy clayey at the shallow aquifer were susceptible to color change with respect to time 3 4 1 isolation identification and morphology of the isolated bacterium pour plate technique was used to isolate and enumerate as reducing bacterium predominately white w1 colored colonies were observed on the cultured agar plates the indigenous bacterium strain isolated from as rich sediment was further identified as pseudomonas aeruginosa with a sequence similarity of nearly about 99 by the blast analysis of 16s rrna gene sequences 1453 bp the bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1000 replicates was taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed felsenstein 1985 the culture w1 showed similarity with pseudomonas aeruginosa strain based on nucleotide homology and phylogenetic analysis fig s3 the ncbi gen bank accession numbers obtained by the gene sequence for the arsenate reducing bacteria i e w1 is ku710761 fesem analysis of the bacterial isolate clearly depicted rod shaped morphology having a length of 1 6 3 2 μm and 0 5 0 69 μm in diameter fig 7 a b the obtained tem eds analysis results confirm the rod shaped morphology with bioaccumulation and precipitation of as on the bacterial surface fig 7 c d further the strain was characterized as aerobic and gram negative bacteria by the biochemical tests of the microorganism 3 4 2 effect of as on the bacterial growth the capability of pseudomonas aeruginosa to grow in the presence of different initial arsenic concentration with an initial arsenic concentration viz as iii range from 100 to 900 mg l 1 was studied and is shown in fig 8 the results revealed that in the presence of arsenic the bacterium showed a reduced biomass growth profile also p aeruginosa achieved the maximum biomass concentration with a delay of 12 h for all the arsenic contaminated flasks a clear decline could be observed in all the flasks having an initial as concentration range from 100 to 850 mg l 1 further the culture showed negligible growth in the flask possessing an initial as concentration of 900 mg l 1 inferring that the bacterial tolerance limit is 850 mg l 1 beyond this as concentration i e 900 mg l 1 p aeruginosa was not able to grow and inferring the lethal as concentration for the strain hence the strain isolated from this study area p aeruginosa is capable of tolerating arsenic concentration up to an initial concentration of 850 mg l 1 in an another study performed by ghosh and sar 2013 acidovorax strain collected from the groundwater samples of northern part of brahmaputra river were found to be hypertolerant to as v as well as as iii whereas brevundimonas sp was hypertolerant to both the forms i e as v and as iii capable of tolerating 550 mm and 50 mm concentrations respectively in addition the growth of the culture at and above an optical density of 0 4 value was used for the qualitative screening test salmassi et al 2002 a pink color of the mixture indicated positive arsenite oxidation reaction formation of as v and a yellow color indicated positive arsenate reduction reaction formation of as iii salmassi et al 2002 the screening test of the obtained culture showed yellow color suggests that positive arsenate reduction reaction prevailing and bacterium were capable to reduce arsenate fig s4 pseudomonas aeruginosa sp ars c microbe is a member of pseudomonadaceae family which was also found in the study area and is very well known for its respiration and reducing nature of as v in the natural environment cai et al 1998 zhang et al 2016 it was also been observed in several other studies that most of pseudomonas sp is a facultative anaerobic bacterium which uses nitrate as an electron acceptor and also belongs to the genera of manganese reducing bacteria gounot 1994 on the other hand dissimilatory arsenate reducing bacteria couples growth with as v as the terminal electron acceptor malasarn et al 2004 degradation of organic matter mediated by bacteria induces anoxic environment in the aquifer which further enhances as methylation bhattacharya et al 2002a these methylated as species adsorbs on fe oxide mineral surfaces bhattacharya et al 2002a which may further be reduced by facultative aerobic bacteria into soluble as species or form secondary as bearing mineral viz claudetite thus this study inferred that the oxic anoxic condition was prevailing in the shallow and deeper aquifers which enhanced the growth of aerobic facultative aerobic arsenate reducing bacteria the isolated indigenous microbial species p aeruginosa sp ars c had endowed the ability of biotransformation of inorganic as forms i e as iii and as v vicente et al 1990 pepi et al 2007 caroline 2017 this helped in the understanding of as mobilization bio mineralization and precipitation in the alluvial aquifers 4 conclusions in this study abiotic and biotic factors of as mobilization were observed in different as contaminated alluvial aquifers which were controlled by redox conditions and facultative microbes at shallow and deeper depth aquifers this study determined that there was no perceptible as enrichment differences observed in grey and yellow brown sands elevated dissolved fe concentration was found significantly correlated with as suggesting that reductive dissolution of fe oxide minerals equally increases dissolved as concentration in the groundwater further sse method explained that as was strongly associated with the amorphous and poorly crystalline oxides of fe mn and al solid phase in addition the geochemical modeling results probed the mechanism of precipitation and dissolution of particular minerals in the aquifer sediments the mineralogical and morphological results showed crystalline as fe al mn and clayey bearing minerals are pressent suggesting the pressence of detrital and authigenic minerals in selective depth sediments of the study area the phylogenetic and sequencing analysis of the isolated indigenous bacterium showed the predominance of facultative aerobic pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterium prevailing and reducing arsenate in the sub oxic groundwater conditions its phase diagram and qualitative test support that this bacterium use arsenate as the terminal electron acceptor and reduce arsenate by dissimilatory reduction mechanisms the findings of this study provide evidenced insights into as mobilization thus the results infered that reductive dissolution of fe oxy hydroxides coupled with the biogeochemical cycle of as iii and as v point towards prevalence of sub oxic to reducing alluvial aquifer conditions infested by indigenous bacterium which too play an important role in arsenic

1657,the reactive solute transport in a single fracture bounded by upper and lower matrixes is a classical problem that captures the dominant factors affecting transport behavior beyond pore scale a parallel fracture matrix system which considers the interaction among multiple paralleled fractures is an extension to a single fracture matrix system the existing analytical or semi analytical solution for solute transport in a parallel fracture matrix simplifies the problem to various degrees such as neglecting the transverse dispersion in the fracture and or the longitudinal diffusion in the matrix the difficulty of solving the full two dimensional 2 d problem lies in the calculation of the mass exchange between the fracture and matrix in this study we propose an innovative green s function approach to address the 2 d reactive solute transport in a parallel fracture matrix system the flux at the interface is calculated numerically it is found that the transverse dispersion in the fracture can be safely neglected due to the small scale of fracture aperture however neglecting the longitudinal matrix diffusion would overestimate the concentration profile near the solute entrance face and underestimate the concentration profile at the far side the error caused by neglecting the longitudinal matrix diffusion decreases with increasing peclet number the longitudinal matrix diffusion does not have obvious influence on the concentration profile in long term the developed model is applied to a non aqueous phase liquid dnapl contamination field case in new haven arkose of connecticut in usa to estimate the trichloroethylene tce behavior over 40 years the ratio of tce mass stored in the matrix and the injected tce mass increases above 90 in less than 10 years 1 introduction great efforts have been made to investigate the process of solute transport in a multi layered porous media of one permeable zone bounded by upper and lower impermeable or much less permeable zones tang et al 1981 sudicky and frind 1982 tang and aral 1992 west et al 2004 zhu et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 such a multi layered system may have different physical meaning at different scales for example a fracture matrix system is at millimeter scale with respect to the fracture aperture and an aquifer aquitard system is at meter scale with respect to the aquifer thickness the motivation of investigating such a system is that it captures the dominant characteristics of solute transport beyond pore scale and can provide a quick assessment of long term behavior of solute transport for screening purpose many analytical models proposed to investigate such a system have to make a few necessary simplifications to obtain the analytical or semi analytical solutions for example the transverse dispersion in the permeable zone is usually neglected for a fracture matrix system due to the fast mixing within the thin fracture 10 4 m after solutes injection sudicky and frind 1982 west et al 2004 zhou et al 2017 however the transverse dispersion plays an important role for the vertical concentration profile if the permeable zone is thick thus it cannot be neglected for solute transport in an aquifer aquitard system zhan et al 2009 regardless of the fracture matrix system or the aquifer aquitard system a common simplification is to neglect the diffusion in the matrix or aquitard along the flow direction in other words the transport in the matrix or aquitard is treated as a one dimensional 1 d diffusion problem rezaei et al 2016 quantitatively analyzed the influence of longitudinal diffusion in the aquitard for a two layered aquifer aquitard system for a more generalized three layered model there is no quantitative evaluation for this assumption of neglecting the longitudinal diffusion in the low permeability zone the difficulty of solving the full two dimensional 2 d multi layered problem lies in how to evaluate the mass exchange between the adjacent zones the continuity across the interface requires that the concentration and mass flux of the permeable and impermeable zone are equal at the interface which can be represented by a double integral equation time integral and space integral using green s function method roubinet et al 2012 proposed a numerical scheme to solve the single space integral equation namely fredholm equation in the laplace domain for conservative solute transport in a single fracture matrix system martínez et al 2014 proposed an analytical solution in the fourier laplace domain using green s function method for heat transport in a single fracture matrix system which avoids solving the integral equation considering the difficulty of obtaining a closed form analytical solution for full 2 d problem in real time domain the objective of this study is to propose a green s function based solution in real time domain for a parallel fracture matrix system with sorption and first order biodegradation or decay in consideration by solving the double integral equation numerically numerical treatments such as numerical laplace inversion or integral have been widely applied while proposing a semi analytical solution when the closed form analytical solution is unattainable if the studied system is too complex the significance of investigating a parallel fracture matrix system is that it moves further to represent the multiple fractures observed at field site compared with the single fracture matrix system although the fractures are assumed to be parallel with each other and are equally spaced over the domain the proposed approach can be easily applied to multi layered problems of solute transport or heat transport with the fracture matrix system or the aquifer aquitard system as two examples 2 methods fig 1 shows the conceptual model of the parallel fracture matrix system upper and lower matrixes are equally spaced along the fracture over the domain the origin is set at the intersection point of the solute entrance face and the symmetric line of the fracture in which the solute is introduced the x and z axes are the longitudinal and transverse dispersion directions respectively steady state saturated flow with a constant velocity occurs in fractures but not in matrixes solutes are injected into the fracture at x 0 the fracture and matrix are assumed to extend to infinity in the direction perpendicular to the xz plane thus the problem becomes two dimensional in nature because of the symmetry of the problem one only needs to consider a finite domain along the z axis with 0 z b b where b and b are half aperture and half matrix thickness respectively the solution in the rest of the parallel fracture matrix system can be easily obtained using the law of symmetry solute transport in the fracture follows the 2 d advection dispersion equation ade with sorption and first order decay in consideration eq 1 the flow velocity is assumed to be constant without considering the influence of varying aperture the transport process in a complex fracture network with varying aperture and irregular fracture direction is beyond the scope of this study injected solutes diffuse into the adjacent matrix following fick s law and the transport in the matrix follows the 2 d diffusion equation with sorption and first order decay in consideration eq 2 the governing equation of solute transport in the fracture is 1a r f c f t u c f x d x f 2 c f x 2 d z f 2 c f z 2 λ r f c f 1b c f x 0 z t c 0 c f x z t 0 1c c f x z t z z 0 0 1d c f x z 0 c f 0 where the subscript or

groundwater flow in the fracture d x f and d z f are longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients in the fracture respectively r f is a retardation factor associated with a linear sorption

0 are resident concentration and initial concentration in the matrix respectively d x m and d z m are longitudinal and transverse diffusion coefficients in the matrix respectively r m is a retardation

knowledge there is only 1 d solution proposed for the parallel fracture matrix system up to date which is insufficient to validate our 2 d solution therefore a numerical model is build up using comsol comsol inc burlington ma usa for comparison purpose the parameters in eqs 4 and 5 are set as pe 0 05 η 1 1 η 2 10 θ m 0 2 b b 10 r f r m 1 μ 0 fig 2 displays the dimensionless concentration profiles at t d 103 104 and 105 the numerical solution agrees well with the green s function solution for t d 103 and 104 the concentration distribution curves are in convex shape because injected solutes diffuse to the matrix as time evolves the concentration near the solute entrance face reaches the injected concentration as the mass transfer between the fracture and adjacent matrix reaches local equilibrium 3 2 comparison with the 1 d analytical solution of sudicky and frind 1982 sudicky and frind 1982 proposed a 1 d analytical solution for solute transport in a parallel fracture matrix system excluding the transverse dispersion in fracture and the longitudinal diffusion in matrix this section investigates the influence of neglecting these terms in sudicky and frind 1982 the longitudinal matrix diffusion is assumed to be zero this assumption neglects the diffusion that is caused by the concentration gradient in matrix along the flow direction fig 3 compares the 1 d solution of sudicky and frind 1982 and 2 d solution of this study with different η 1 which is linearly proportional to the longitudinal matrix diffusion see table 1 the 1 d solution agrees well with the 2 d solution at a smaller η 1 102 the concentration distribution curve with η 1 104 is higher than that with η 1 102 over distance three points are notable first the difference between the concentration profiles with different η 1 decreases with rising pe because longitudinal concentration gradient in matrix is minimized with more solutes diffusing into the matrix under larger pe condition second the longitudinal matrix diffusion can be safely ignored for the problem of solute transport in the fracture matrix system cases with η 1 102 which is a common assumption made in previous works tang et al 1981 sudicky and frind 1982 tang and aral 1992 zhan et al 2009 rezaei et al 2016 this is because the matrix diffusion coefficient is usually small 10 10 m2 s and the concentration gradient that drives the diffusion process is primarily perpendicular to the interface between fracture and matrix third eqs 11 and 12 can also be applied to the heat transport problem in a fracture matrix system because the governing equation of solute transport is equivalent to that of the heat transport in terms of the mathematical form martínez et al 2014 however the longitudinal heat conduction in matrix has a large impact on the temperature profile in the fracture and cannot be neglected because the thermal diffusivity is usually two order of magnitude higher than the matrix diffusion coefficient cases η 1 104 and neglecting the longitudinal matrix conduction usually results in underestimation of temperature profile in the fracture bear 1972 cheng et al 2001 taking the transverse dispersion in the fracture into consideration does not introduce obvious concentration difference along the vertical direction in the fracture based on our tests which is not shown here for trivial comparison this is because the aperture is too small and the corresponding pe is only at the scale of 10 3 for such a small pe the assumption of well mixing in the transverse direction of the fracture is valid roubinet et al 2012 also found that transverse dispersion in a single fracture did not affect the vertical concentration profile zhan et al 2009 stated that the consideration of transverse dispersion in the aquifer affected the vertical concentration profile of an aquifer aquitard system because the pe of the aquifer aquitard system was much larger than the pe of the fracture matrix system for the aquifer aquitard system the aquifer thickness is usually at the scale of meter or tens of meters and the corresponding pe is larger than 1 for such a large pe the well mixing assumption is not valid 3 3 mass flux between the fracture and matrix the mass flux between the fracture and matrix is governed by the dimensionless number η 2 a larger η 2 indicates a higher transverse diffusion in the matrix thus a lower concentration in the fracture at a specific time fig 4 shows the flux variation over time at different locations at the proximal point to the solute entrance face x d 20 the peak flux is reached first and it increases with the increasing η 2 now if looking at the flux variation over time at different locations of x d 20 50 and 150 with a given η 2 one can see two features firstly the peak flux decreases with distance secondly the time to reach the peak flux increases with distance note that the fluxes at different locations converge at late time until local equilibrium is reached for the diffusion between the fracture and matrix 3 4 fracture density for the parallel fracture matrix system the fracture density can be quantified by the ratio of the matrix thickness and fracture thickness b b the smaller the value the denser the fractures in unit thickness fig 5 shows the concentration profile with varying b b at different pe a larger fracture density b b 1 leads a higher concentration distribution at a specific time because more solutes are retained in the fractures with a smaller diffusive distance 4 application the dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl site at the triassic new haven arkose in connecticut of u s is suitable for the application of the parallel fractures model of this study in two senses rogers 1985 west et al 2004 lipson et al 2005 west and kueper 2010 firstly many parallel bedding plane fractures develop at this site which serve as the main pathway for solute transport although those bedding plane fractures may not be equally spaced the parallel fracture model can do a decent job for screening purpose secondly the study site is relatively large hundreds of meters thus a simple geometry for the fracture matrix system is preferred a complex numerical model is impossible without detailed information of fractures and fissures lipson et al 2005 used the 1 d solution of sudicky and frind 1982 to estimate the long term evolution 40 years of trichloroethylene tce in the bedding fractures west et al 2004 and west and kueper 2010 extended the 1 d model by considering a strip source both models neglected the longitudinal matrix diffusion and transverse fracture dispersion the prediction from the 1 d model thus can be revisited using the fully 2 d model proposed in this study properties of the fracture matrix system are obtained from lipson et al 2005 and west and kueper 2010 and are listed in table 3 fig 6 displays the predictions by the 1 d without longitudinal matrix diffusion and 2 d with longitudinal matrix diffusion models after 40 years injection of tce it is found that the difference caused by the longitudinal matrix diffusion is negligible in long term with a very small pe 0 0035 one reason is that the large matrix retardation factor r m 15 7 greatly slows down the matrix diffusion process the other reason is that the concentration difference in the matrix along the flow direction is weakened due to decay the amount of mass stored in the matrix over time is another concern for contaminant remediation the stored mass can be estimated using the mass balance equation 16 m m m inj m f 2 ubt inj c 0 2 b 0 c f x t inj dx where m m m inj m f are tce mass in the matrix per unit width total injected tce mass at time

reasonable based on previous discussion fig 7 shows the ratio of tce mass stored in the matrix over time with different b b ratios it is found that the ratio of tce mass stored in the matrix over the total mass increases to above 90 in hundreds of days at the site the larger the fracture density smaller b b the slower the matrix mass ratio increases zhou et al 2017 also found that the increasing rate of matrix mass ratio is inversely proportional to the fracture aperture because a smaller aperture can hold less solute within a certain time interval 5 conclusions this study proposes a green s

1657,the reactive solute transport in a single fracture bounded by upper and lower matrixes is a classical problem that captures the dominant factors affecting transport behavior beyond pore scale a parallel fracture matrix system which considers the interaction among multiple paralleled fractures is an extension to a single fracture matrix system the existing analytical or semi analytical solution for solute transport in a parallel fracture matrix simplifies the problem to various degrees such as neglecting the transverse dispersion in the fracture and or the longitudinal diffusion in the matrix the difficulty of solving the full two dimensional 2 d problem lies in the calculation of the mass exchange between the fracture and matrix in this study we propose an innovative green s function approach to address the 2 d reactive solute transport in a parallel fracture matrix system the flux at the interface is calculated numerically it is found that the transverse dispersion in the fracture can be safely neglected due to the small scale of fracture aperture however neglecting the longitudinal matrix diffusion would overestimate the concentration profile near the solute entrance face and underestimate the concentration profile at the far side the error caused by neglecting the longitudinal matrix diffusion decreases with increasing peclet number the longitudinal matrix diffusion does not have obvious influence on the concentration profile in long term the developed model is applied to a non aqueous phase liquid dnapl contamination field case in new haven arkose of connecticut in usa to estimate the trichloroethylene tce behavior over 40 years the ratio of tce mass stored in the matrix and the injected tce mass increases above 90 in less than 10 years 1 introduction great efforts have been made to investigate the process of solute transport in a multi layered porous media of one permeable zone bounded by upper and lower impermeable or much less permeable zones tang et al 1981 sudicky and frind 1982 tang and aral 1992 west et al 2004 zhu et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 such a multi layered system may have different physical meaning at different scales for example a fracture matrix system is at millimeter scale with respect to the fracture aperture and an aquifer aquitard system is at meter scale with respect to the aquifer thickness the motivation of investigating such a system is that it captures the dominant characteristics of solute transport beyond pore scale and can provide a quick assessment of long term behavior of solute transport for screening purpose many analytical models proposed to investigate such a system have to make a few necessary simplifications to obtain the analytical or semi analytical solutions for example the transverse dispersion in the permeable zone is usually neglected for a fracture matrix system due to the fast mixing within the thin fracture 10 4 m after solutes injection sudicky and frind 1982 west et al 2004 zhou et al 2017 however the transverse dispersion plays an important role for the vertical concentration profile if the permeable zone is thick thus it cannot be neglected for solute transport in an aquifer aquitard system zhan et al 2009 regardless of the fracture matrix system or the aquifer aquitard system a common simplification is to neglect the diffusion in the matrix or aquitard along the flow direction in other words the transport in the matrix or aquitard is treated as a one dimensional 1 d diffusion problem rezaei et al 2016 quantitatively analyzed the influence of longitudinal diffusion in the aquitard for a two layered aquifer aquitard system for a more generalized three layered model there is no quantitative evaluation for this assumption of neglecting the longitudinal diffusion in the low permeability zone the difficulty of solving the full two dimensional 2 d multi layered problem lies in how to evaluate the mass exchange between the adjacent zones the continuity across the interface requires that the concentration and mass flux of the permeable and impermeable zone are equal at the interface which can be represented by a double integral equation time integral and space integral using green s function method roubinet et al 2012 proposed a numerical scheme to solve the single space integral equation namely fredholm equation in the laplace domain for conservative solute transport in a single fracture matrix system martínez et al 2014 proposed an analytical solution in the fourier laplace domain using green s function method for heat transport in a single fracture matrix system which avoids solving the integral equation considering the difficulty of obtaining a closed form analytical solution for full 2 d problem in real time domain the objective of this study is to propose a green s function based solution in real time domain for a parallel fracture matrix system with sorption and first order biodegradation or decay in consideration by solving the double integral equation numerically numerical treatments such as numerical laplace inversion or integral have been widely applied while proposing a semi analytical solution when the closed form analytical solution is unattainable if the studied system is too complex the significance of investigating a parallel fracture matrix system is that it moves further to represent the multiple fractures observed at field site compared with the single fracture matrix system although the fractures are assumed to be parallel with each other and are equally spaced over the domain the proposed approach can be easily applied to multi layered problems of solute transport or heat transport with the fracture matrix system or the aquifer aquitard system as two examples 2 methods fig 1 shows the conceptual model of the parallel fracture matrix system upper and lower matrixes are equally spaced along the fracture over the domain the origin is set at the intersection point of the solute entrance face and the symmetric line of the fracture in which the solute is introduced the x and z axes are the longitudinal and transverse dispersion directions respectively steady state saturated flow with a constant velocity occurs in fractures but not in matrixes solutes are injected into the fracture at x 0 the fracture and matrix are assumed to extend to infinity in the direction perpendicular to the xz plane thus the problem becomes two dimensional in nature because of the symmetry of the problem one only needs to consider a finite domain along the z axis with 0 z b b where b and b are half aperture and half matrix thickness respectively the solution in the rest of the parallel fracture matrix system can be easily obtained using the law of symmetry solute transport in the fracture follows the 2 d advection dispersion equation ade with sorption and first order decay in consideration eq 1 the flow velocity is assumed to be constant without considering the influence of varying aperture the transport process in a complex fracture network with varying aperture and irregular fracture direction is beyond the scope of this study injected solutes diffuse into the adjacent matrix following fick s law and the transport in the matrix follows the 2 d diffusion equation with sorption and first order decay in consideration eq 2 the governing equation of solute transport in the fracture is 1a r f c f t u c f x d x f 2 c f x 2 d z f 2 c f z 2 λ r f c f 1b c f x 0 z t c 0 c f x z t 0 1c c f x z t z z 0 0 1d c f x z 0 c f 0 where the subscript or

groundwater flow in the fracture d x f and d z f are longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients in the fracture respectively r f is a retardation factor associated with a linear sorption

knowledge there is only 1 d solution proposed for the parallel fracture matrix system up to date which is insufficient to validate our 2 d solution therefore a numerical model is build up using comsol comsol inc burlington ma usa for comparison purpose the parameters in eqs 4 and 5 are set as pe 0 05 η 1 1 η 2 10 θ m 0 2 b b 10 r f r m 1 μ 0 fig 2 displays the dimensionless concentration profiles at t d 103 104 and 105 the numerical solution agrees well with the green s function solution for t d 103 and 104 the concentration distribution curves are in convex shape because injected solutes diffuse to the matrix as time evolves the concentration near the solute entrance face reaches the injected concentration as the mass transfer between the fracture and adjacent matrix reaches local equilibrium 3 2 comparison with the 1 d analytical solution of sudicky and frind 1982 sudicky and frind 1982 proposed a 1 d analytical solution for solute transport in a parallel fracture matrix system excluding the transverse dispersion in fracture and the longitudinal diffusion in matrix this section investigates the influence of neglecting these terms in sudicky and frind 1982 the longitudinal matrix diffusion is assumed to be zero this assumption neglects the diffusion that is caused by the concentration gradient in matrix along the flow direction fig 3 compares the 1 d solution of sudicky and frind 1982 and 2 d solution of this study with different η 1 which is linearly proportional to the longitudinal matrix diffusion see table 1 the 1 d solution agrees well with the 2 d solution at a smaller η 1 102 the concentration distribution curve with η 1 104 is higher than that with η 1 102 over distance three points are notable first the difference between the concentration profiles with different η 1 decreases with rising pe because longitudinal concentration gradient in matrix is minimized with more solutes diffusing into the matrix under larger pe condition second the longitudinal matrix diffusion can be safely ignored for the problem of solute transport in the fracture matrix system cases with η 1 102 which is a common assumption made in previous works tang et al 1981 sudicky and frind 1982 tang and aral 1992 zhan et al 2009 rezaei et al 2016 this is because the matrix diffusion coefficient is usually small 10 10 m2 s and the concentration gradient that drives the diffusion process is primarily perpendicular to the interface between fracture and matrix third eqs 11 and 12 can also be applied to the heat transport problem in a fracture matrix system because the governing equation of solute transport is equivalent to that of the heat transport in terms of the mathematical form martínez et al 2014 however the longitudinal heat conduction in matrix has a large impact on the temperature profile in the fracture and cannot be neglected because the thermal diffusivity is usually two order of magnitude higher than the matrix diffusion coefficient cases η 1 104 and neglecting the longitudinal matrix conduction usually results in underestimation of temperature profile in the fracture bear 1972 cheng et al 2001 taking the transverse dispersion in the fracture into consideration does not introduce obvious concentration difference along the vertical direction in the fracture based on our tests which is not shown here for trivial comparison this is because the aperture is too small and the corresponding pe is only at the scale of 10 3 for such a small pe the assumption of well mixing in the transverse direction of the fracture is valid roubinet et al 2012 also found that transverse dispersion in a single fracture did not affect the vertical concentration profile zhan et al 2009 stated that the consideration of transverse dispersion in the aquifer affected the vertical concentration profile of an aquifer aquitard system because the pe of the aquifer aquitard system was much larger than the pe of the fracture matrix system for the aquifer aquitard system the aquifer thickness is usually at the scale of meter or tens of meters and the corresponding pe is larger than 1 for such a large pe the well mixing assumption is not valid 3 3 mass flux between the fracture and matrix the mass flux between the fracture and matrix is governed by the dimensionless number η 2 a larger η 2 indicates a higher transverse diffusion in the matrix thus a lower concentration in the fracture at a specific time fig 4 shows the flux variation over time at different locations at the proximal point to the solute entrance face x d 20 the peak flux is reached first and it increases with the increasing η 2 now if looking at the flux variation over time at different locations of x d 20 50 and 150 with a given η 2 one can see two features firstly the peak flux decreases with distance secondly the time to reach the peak flux increases with distance note that the fluxes at different locations converge at late time until local equilibrium is reached for the diffusion between the fracture and matrix 3 4 fracture density for the parallel fracture matrix system the fracture density can be quantified by the ratio of the matrix thickness and fracture thickness b b the smaller the value the denser the fractures in unit thickness fig 5 shows the concentration profile with varying b b at different pe a larger fracture density b b 1 leads a higher concentration distribution at a specific time because more solutes are retained in the fractures with a smaller diffusive distance 4 application the dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl site at the triassic new haven arkose in connecticut of u s is suitable for the application of the parallel fractures model of this study in two senses rogers 1985 west et al 2004 lipson et al 2005 west and kueper 2010 firstly many parallel bedding plane fractures develop at this site which serve as the main pathway for solute transport although those bedding plane fractures may not be equally spaced the parallel fracture model can do a decent job for screening purpose secondly the study site is relatively large hundreds of meters thus a simple geometry for the fracture matrix system is preferred a complex numerical model is impossible without detailed information of fractures and fissures lipson et al 2005 used the 1 d solution of sudicky and frind 1982 to estimate the long term evolution 40 years of trichloroethylene tce in the bedding fractures west et al 2004 and west and kueper 2010 extended the 1 d model by considering a strip source both models neglected the longitudinal matrix diffusion and transverse fracture dispersion the prediction from the 1 d model thus can be revisited using the fully 2 d model proposed in this study properties of the fracture matrix system are obtained from lipson et al 2005 and west and kueper 2010 and are listed in table 3 fig 6 displays the predictions by the 1 d without longitudinal matrix diffusion and 2 d with longitudinal matrix diffusion models after 40 years injection of tce it is found that the difference caused by the longitudinal matrix diffusion is negligible in long term with a very small pe 0 0035 one reason is that the large matrix retardation factor r m 15 7 greatly slows down the matrix diffusion process the other reason is that the concentration difference in the matrix along the flow direction is weakened due to decay the amount of mass stored in the matrix over time is another concern for contaminant remediation the stored mass can be estimated using the mass balance equation 16 m m m inj m f 2 ubt inj c 0 2 b 0 c f x t inj dx where m m m inj m f are tce mass in the matrix per unit width total injected tce mass at time t inj per unit width and tce mass in the fracture per unit width respectively this mass balance assumes that the concentration does not vary in the transverse direction of the fracture which is reasonable based on previous discussion fig 7 shows the ratio of tce mass stored in the matrix over time with different b b ratios it is found that the ratio of tce mass stored in the matrix over the total mass increases to above 90 in hundreds of days at the site the larger the fracture density smaller b b the slower the matrix mass ratio increases zhou et al 2017 also found that the increasing rate of matrix mass ratio is inversely proportional to the fracture aperture because a smaller aperture can hold less solute within a certain time interval 5 conclusions this study proposes a green s function based semi analytical solution for the full 2 d reactive solute transport in a parallel fracture matrix system the approach of numerically calculating the flux at the interface between two layers with different properties is not only suitable for the parallel fracture matrix system but also can be applied to problems such as reactive transport in aquifer aquitard system as long as the

1658,a set of column experiments was conducted to investigate the chemical and physical heterogeneity effect on colloid facilitated transport under slow pore velocity conditions pore velocities were kept below 100 cm d 1 for all experiments glass beads were packed into columns establishing four different conditions 1 homogeneous 2 mixed physical heterogeneity 3 sequentially layered physical heterogeneity and 4 chemical heterogeneity the homogeneous column was packed with glass beads diameter 500 600 μm and physical heterogeneities were created by sequential layering or mixing two sizes of glass bead 500 600 μm and 300 400 μm a chemical heterogeneity was created using 25 of the glass beads coated with hydrophobic molecules 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorooctyltrichlorosilane mixed with 75 pristine glass beads all 500 600 μm input solution with 0 5 mm csi and 50 mg l 1 colloids 1 μm diameter sio2 was pulsed into columns under saturated conditions the physical heterogeneity in the packed glass beads retarded the transport of colloids compared to homogeneous r 25 0 but showed only slight differences between sequentially layered r 60 7 and mixed heterogeneity r 62 4 the column with the chemical hydrophobic hydrophilic heterogeneity removed most of the colloids from the input solution all column conditions stripped cs from colloids onto the column matrix of packed glass beads keywords colloid facilitated transport cesium physical heterogeneity chemical heterogeneity colloids 1 introduction mobility of contaminants in the subsurface is known to be facilitated by colloids transported with groundwater de jonge et al 2004 jacobsen et al 1997 karathanasis 1999 kretzschmar et al 1995 while contaminants strongly adsorb on the surface of colloids this is a concern as it can lead to more and faster spreading of contamination than conventional model prediction in environmentally sensitive waters contaminants of interest can form strong bonds with silicate materials including colloids and be transported to environmentally sensitive systems these contaminants include radionuclides such as cesium 137cs which have been released to the environment at several doe sites flury et al 2004 mckinley et al 2001 much research has focused on colloid facilitated transport of cs with significant interest on the influence of interfacial phenomena including unsaturated transport and transport through complex natural sediments chen et al 2005 flury et al 2004 mohanty et al 2014 saiers and hornberger 1996 turner et al 2006 xu et al 2008 for example at the hanford site in richland washington cs has contaminated the subsurface from leaking underground storage tanks spilling high ionic strength radioactive leachate as the leachate wets the initially dry vadose zone sediment it mobilizes colloids and can contain 137cs flury et al 2002 though with decreasing pore velocity and decreasing ionic strength as leachate reacts with surrounding media and mixes with more dilute groundwater cs can be stripped off of colloids onto the stationary sediment flury et al 2002 chemical and physical heterogeneities found in natural sediment can further retard cs transport especially at locations with certain minerals such as mica on which cs will form a strong chemical bond to edge sites mckinley et al 2001 it has been shown that slight changes in chemical and physical fabric of natural sediment and sand can have profound influence on transport of colloids mcnew et al 2017 shani et al 2008 at interfaces within the sediment pores the colloids will transport into a new pore network where they will more likely move through or into smaller pores or dead end pores bradford et al 2005 and can then be strained reducing transport crist et al 2005 the straining can be further exasperated by colloids bridging between grains in pores crist et al 2005 subtle changes in surface characteristic of the sediment or colloid will also change the transport of colloids when chemical heterogeneities such as natural organic matter in sediment or on colloid surfaces exist the transport of colloids increase compared to mineral surfaces free of organic matter due to the increased complexities on the surface kretzschmar et al 1995 mcnew et al 2017 however if the organic material makes the sediment s surface hydrophobic the transport of hydrophilic colloids can be slowed or stopped in the porous matrix zhang et al 2014 often studies simplify the colloid systems to better understand the effects of heterogeneities on colloid transport and colloid facilitated transport by using columns packed with quartz sand bradford et al 2005 shani et al 2008 however sand matrix such as this have heterogeneities on their surfaces and the influence of subtle differences of heterogeneities can be obscured a more controlled transport environment involves colloid transport through micro fluidic devices with an etched matrix baumann and werth 2004 2005 these matrices are designed to be effectively two dimensional and do not have natural channel narrowing where colloid bridging occurs to produce a microfluidic environment which can be in some capacity replicated in a column environment guo et al 2016 performed a colloid transport experiment using a matrix of beads rather than having a fabricated porous matrix such an experimental design allows for comparisons with column research when similar matrix geometries are scaled to the larger condition the objectives of this research are 1 to investigate the influence of physical heterogeneities on the fate of cs and colloids through a porous media subjected to low pore velocity 2 to investigate the influence of hydrophobic hydrophilic chemical heterogeneity on transport of cs and colloids 3 to compare our results to microfluidic experiments performed with similar conditions using 1 μm sio2 colloids and csi spiked solution we investigated the influence of colloid facilitated cs transport under relevant physicochemical porous media conditions in columns packed with glass beads 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the solution used for column experiments was deionized water spiked with csi to 0 5 mm chen et al 2005 and 1 μm colloids sio2 microspheres corpuscular co cold spring ny were added to a concentration of 50 mg l 1 an observed concentration from hanford sediments liu et al 2013 the colloids were received from the manufacturer suspended in a brine solution with a ph 8 0 before adding the colloids to the experimental solution the colloid suspension was washed repeatedly with deionized water until the remaining colloid suspension in water became ph 6 1 which was the same ph as 0 5 mm csi in deionized water this was achieved by centrifugation of the colloids in brine solution then removing the solution with pipette and replacing with deionized water at least nine times keeping the colloid concentration constant until ph 6 1 was achieved the matrices used in the

columns were flushed with deionized water from bottom to top before the start of experiments to reduce the possibility of trapped air to minimize the influence of gravity on the colloid transport the columns were kept horizontal and solution saturated throughout the experiment chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 initially all columns were filled with deionized water at the onset of experiments as

results and disscusion 3 1 matrix before packing into columns the glass beads were characterized for density surface area and cs partitioning coefficient particle densities of the glass beads ranged from 2 46 to 2 47 g cm 3 table 1 which is similar to reported values of 2 45 2 5 g cm 3 for glass pierce et al 2010 specific surface areas of the beads were compared to estimated surface areas based on geometry of the spheres the calculated specific surface area for the average 550 μm bead was 0 004 m2 g 1 which is close to the measured value 0 0039 m2 g 1 for surface modified glass beads table 1 the pristine glass beads had a measured specific surface area 0 0094 m2 g 1 table 1 2 4 times larger than the calculated similarly the measured specific surface area for the average 350 μm beads of 0 0176 m2 g 1 table 1 was 2 5 times that of surface area calculated from geometry this suggests that there is additional surface from micro porosity and other complexities to the glass spheres which may contribute to adsorption of cs and colloids the chemical coating appears to reduce the influence of these effects partitioning coefficients for cs for the 550 μm 350 μm and 550 μm coated beads were 1 00 ml g 1 1 53 ml g 1 and 4 06 ml g 1 respectively table 1 when normalized by bead surface area the large beads were slightly more adsorptive than the smaller beads with the large beads adsorption 106 ml m 2 compared to the small beads 87 ml m 2 the chemically coated glass beads however yielded an order of magnitude greater adsorption capacity for cs coated beads of 1041 ml m 2 which is opposite of organic polymer added to clay dumat et al 2000 and influence of organic carbon in natural clay containing soil fan et al 2014 where the adsorption is reduced in these cases clay is the primary mineral surface to which cs adsorbs well colloids were silicate based similar to the glass beads composing the packed column matrix a calculated surface area for colloids was 2 74 m2 g 1 table 1 and a normalization of the colloid partitioning coefficient of 1154 ml g 1 table 1 by surface area gives rise to 421 ml m 2 this surface area normalized partitioning coefficient is four times the normalized values for glass beads suggesting that the surface charge of the sio2 colloids would be selective over the sio2 glass beads allowing for colloid facilitated transport the resultant porosity of the packed columns fig 1 was 0 32 for homogeneous and sequentially layered heterogeneity columns and 0 35 for mixed heterogeneity and chemical heterogeneity columns table 2 from the xct images fig 1 some of the void spaces appear black which could be trapped air whereas most voids are medium to dark grey which is most likely water based on a visual comparison of the xct images there seems to be no significant differences between columns relative to the occurrence or concentration of black voids based on these images it is not possible to determine if the hydrophobic coating on beads fig 1g and h has an influence on amount of trapped air as mentioned in the methods the mass of each type of glass beads packed into each column was carefully tallied allowing for cs partitioning coefficient to be reasonably estimated for each column the calculations yielded cs kd of 1 00 ml g 1 for the homogeneous column 1 26 ml g 1 for both physical heterogeneity columns and 1 76 ml g 1 for chemical heterogeneity column table 2 these weighted average partitioning coefficients were used to develop models of cs transport though the columns 3 2 colloid transport all four columns displayed significant retardation of colloid transport figs 2 5 pore velocity for the colloid and cs laden water in the columns 89 5 99 9 cm d 1 table 3 was kept at a rate sufficient to keep colloids in suspension and flowing through the matrix figs 2 5 at slow pore velocities there can be increased bridging of colloids sen and khilar 2006 resulting in increased straining and reduced transport comparing the homogeneous column colloid breakthrough with retardation coefficient of 25 0 table 3 fig 2 to a similar microfluidic model test where retardation was 5 08 guo et al 2016 the difference in transport is likely in part due to colloid bridging and associated straining of colloids by the packed glass beads this increased retardation of colloid transport due to bridging in the columns bradford et al 2005 is a reasonable explanation since there is an order of magnitude difference in the pore velocity and lower residence time for the microfluidic experiment of 800 cm d 1 compared to 99 cm d 1 table 3 for the homogenous column the two systems are comparable since although the beads are smaller 15 μm diameter and as is the packed channel 21 μm 840 μm 2000 μm the beads and the colloids 1 μm 0 0031 are from the same source and have similar surface properties physical straining and adsorption of colloids were similar for both the sequentially layered and mixed physical heterogeneity columns figs 3 and 4 table 3 the retardation coefficient of 62 4 was similar for the mixed column compared to 60 7 for the sequentially layered column table 3 similarly the deposition coefficient was higher 0 8 d 1 for mixed column than for layered heterogeneity 0 6 d 1 table 3 this first order deposition coefficient is similar to a decay function and represents the fraction of colloids effectively deposited on the packed glass beads matrix the mixed heterogeneity column would have more contact points between the small beads packed amongst the large beads creating more small pore interfaces which would contribute to the slight increase in adsorptive straining of the colloids such small pore interfaces were less present in the homogeneous column where the glass beads were more uniform in diameter resulting in colloid retardation of 40 less than the retardation in columns with physical heterogeneity table 3 colloid transport through the hydrophobic chemical heterogeneity column resulted in only 25 colloid in the effluent compared to the near 100 colloid recovery in the effluents for the other columns fig 5 table 3 retardation of 20 6 in the chemical heterogeneity column was similar to the colloid s retardation of 25 0 for the homogeneous bead column but the deposition coefficient was 2 4 d 1 compared to 0 2 d 1 table 3 the combination of straining bridging and van der waals forces due to instantaneous dipoles horvolgyi et al 1993 are contributing to the more permanent removal of the colloids in the chemical heterogeneity column 3 3 cesium transport aqueous cs transport through the columns was modeled using cs portioning coefficient data table 2 velocity from column discharge table 2 and dispersion data based on i transport fig 6 through columns tables 2 3 figs 2 5 the fit of the aqueous cs breakthrough data to the cde model ranged from r2 0 86 for the mixed physical heterogeneity to r2 0 94 for chemical heterogeneity column table 3 these fits are reasonable for the aqueous cs data generated where the noise in the data can be attributed to the small pore size of the column and resultant samples which were subsampled total cs was 5 greater than aqueous cs values which is within the experimental quality limits so it is not definitive that cs transport was being facilitated by colloids beyond the cs already adsorbed in the csi colloid suspension which at its maximum is 7 of the total cs based on maximum adsorbed cs from partitioning coefficients it can be seen that after the colloid suspension is flushed out with deionized water containing no colloids figs 2 5 that the colloids no longer are associated with cs in the effluent the homogeneous column total surface area of the packed beads was 0 07 m2 whereas the colloid total surface area was 0 008 m2 for total colloids introduced so in this case there was an order of magnitude more surface area for the packed glass bead matrix compared to the colloid s total surface area with increased interaction with bead surfaces due to adsorption straining and bridging of colloids it is reasonable that cs would be stripped from the colloids in experimental conditions where natural sediment known to strongly sorb cs forms the matrix 30 40 colloid facilitated transport of cs has been documented in the effluent of a column with pore velocities of 1400 14 000 cm d 1 chen et al 2005 this is more pronounced with the delayed breakthrough of colloids such as with the physical heterogeneity columns where effluent cs was below detection limits when the bulk of the colloids were flushed from the columns figs 3 and 4 at this slow pore velocity and with the surface adsorption normalized to surface area kd sa for colloids 421 ml m 2 being of similar magnitude with large uncoated glass beads 106 ml m 2 cs is striped from colloids and remains on the glass beads the sa normalized partitioning coefficient for the chemically coated beads 1026 ml m 2 is an order of magnitude greater than the uncoated beads and the colloids so this striping would occur in addition to the retention of the colloids in the glass bead matrix making colloid facilitated transport of metals like cs unlikely to occur 4 conclusion when the colloids and porous matrix have similar surface properties at slow pore velocity conditions contaminants such as cs will exhibit no facilitated transport by colloids this is due to the striping of cs from the colloids onto the stationary matrix the transport of colloids through heterogeneously packed columns will also be retarded more than through homogenous matrices sequentially layered physical heterogeneity will retard colloid transport through the stationary porous media similar to mixed physical heterogeneities and the cs originally adsorbed to the colloids will be stripped when a hydrophobic chemical heterogeneity is present in the stationary matrix silica based colloids will be significantly removed due to fast deposition of colloids and not hydraulically transported through the matrix even with long flushing times unless high flow rate is maintained acknowledgements funding for this work was through the us

1658,a set of column experiments was conducted to investigate the chemical and physical heterogeneity effect on colloid facilitated transport under slow pore velocity conditions pore velocities were kept below 100 cm d 1 for all experiments glass beads were packed into columns establishing four different conditions 1 homogeneous 2 mixed physical heterogeneity 3 sequentially layered physical heterogeneity and 4 chemical heterogeneity the homogeneous column was packed with glass beads diameter 500 600 μm and physical heterogeneities were created by sequential layering or mixing two sizes of glass bead 500 600 μm and 300 400 μm a chemical heterogeneity was created using 25 of the glass beads coated with hydrophobic molecules 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorooctyltrichlorosilane mixed with 75 pristine glass beads all 500 600 μm input solution with 0 5 mm csi and 50 mg l 1 colloids 1 μm diameter sio2 was pulsed into columns under saturated conditions the physical heterogeneity in the packed glass beads retarded the transport of colloids compared to homogeneous r 25 0 but showed only slight differences between sequentially layered r 60 7 and mixed heterogeneity r 62 4 the column with the chemical hydrophobic hydrophilic heterogeneity removed most of the colloids from the input solution all column conditions stripped cs from colloids onto the column matrix of packed glass beads keywords colloid facilitated transport cesium physical heterogeneity chemical heterogeneity colloids 1 introduction mobility of contaminants in the subsurface is known to be facilitated by colloids transported with groundwater de jonge et al 2004 jacobsen et al 1997 karathanasis 1999 kretzschmar et al 1995 while contaminants strongly adsorb on the surface of colloids this is a concern as it can lead to more and faster spreading of contamination than conventional model prediction in environmentally sensitive waters contaminants of interest can form strong bonds with silicate materials including colloids and be transported to environmentally sensitive systems these contaminants include radionuclides such as cesium 137cs which have been released to the environment at several doe sites flury et al 2004 mckinley et al 2001 much research has focused on colloid facilitated transport of cs with significant interest on the influence of interfacial phenomena including unsaturated transport and transport through complex natural sediments chen et al 2005 flury et al 2004 mohanty et al 2014 saiers and hornberger 1996 turner et al 2006 xu et al 2008 for example at the hanford site in richland washington cs has contaminated the subsurface from leaking underground storage tanks spilling high ionic strength radioactive leachate as the leachate wets the initially dry vadose zone sediment it mobilizes colloids and can contain 137cs flury et al 2002 though with decreasing pore velocity and decreasing ionic strength as leachate reacts with surrounding media and mixes with more dilute groundwater cs can be stripped off of colloids onto the stationary sediment flury et al 2002 chemical and physical heterogeneities found in natural sediment can further retard cs transport especially at locations with certain minerals such as mica on which cs will form a strong chemical bond to edge sites mckinley et al 2001 it has been shown that slight changes in chemical and physical fabric of natural sediment and sand can have profound influence on transport of colloids mcnew et al 2017 shani et al 2008 at interfaces within the sediment pores the colloids will transport into a new pore network where they will more likely move through or into smaller pores or dead end pores bradford et al 2005 and can then be strained reducing transport crist et al 2005 the straining can be further exasperated by colloids bridging between grains in pores crist et al 2005 subtle changes in surface characteristic of the sediment or colloid will also change the transport of colloids when chemical heterogeneities such as natural organic matter in sediment or on colloid surfaces exist the transport of colloids increase compared to mineral surfaces free of organic matter due to the increased complexities on the surface kretzschmar et al 1995 mcnew et al 2017 however if the organic material makes the sediment s surface hydrophobic the transport of hydrophilic colloids can be slowed or stopped in the porous matrix zhang et al 2014 often studies simplify the colloid systems to better understand the effects of heterogeneities on colloid transport and colloid facilitated transport by using columns packed with quartz sand bradford et al 2005 shani et al 2008 however sand matrix such as this have heterogeneities on their surfaces and the influence of subtle differences of heterogeneities can be obscured a more controlled transport environment involves colloid transport through micro fluidic devices with an etched matrix baumann and werth 2004 2005 these matrices are designed to be effectively two dimensional and do not have natural channel narrowing where colloid bridging occurs to produce a microfluidic environment which can be in some capacity replicated in a column environment guo et al 2016 performed a colloid transport experiment using a matrix of beads rather than having a fabricated porous matrix such an experimental design allows for comparisons with column research when similar matrix geometries are scaled to the larger condition the objectives of this research are 1 to investigate the influence of physical heterogeneities on the fate of cs and colloids through a porous media subjected to low pore velocity 2 to investigate the influence of hydrophobic hydrophilic chemical heterogeneity on transport of cs and colloids 3 to compare our results to microfluidic experiments performed with similar conditions using 1 μm sio2 colloids and csi spiked solution we investigated the influence of colloid facilitated cs transport under relevant physicochemical porous media conditions in columns packed with glass beads 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the solution used for column experiments was deionized water spiked with csi to 0 5 mm chen et al 2005 and 1 μm colloids sio2 microspheres corpuscular co cold spring ny were added to a concentration of 50 mg l 1 an observed concentration from hanford sediments liu et al 2013 the colloids were received from the manufacturer suspended in a brine solution with a ph 8 0 before adding the colloids to the experimental solution the colloid suspension was washed repeatedly with deionized water until the remaining colloid suspension in water became ph 6 1 which was the same ph as 0 5 mm csi in deionized water this was achieved by centrifugation of the colloids in brine solution then removing the solution with pipette and replacing with deionized water at least nine times keeping the colloid concentration constant until ph 6 1 was achieved the matrices used in the

pore interfaces which would contribute to the slight increase in adsorptive straining of the colloids such small pore interfaces were less present in the homogeneous column where the glass beads were more uniform in diameter resulting in colloid retardation of 40 less than the retardation in columns with physical heterogeneity table 3 colloid transport through the hydrophobic chemical heterogeneity column resulted in only 25 colloid in the effluent compared to the near 100 colloid recovery in the effluents for the other columns fig 5 table 3 retardation of 20 6 in the chemical heterogeneity column was similar to the colloid s retardation of 25 0 for the homogeneous bead column but the deposition coefficient was 2 4 d 1 compared to 0 2 d 1 table 3 the combination of straining bridging and van der waals forces due to instantaneous dipoles horvolgyi et al 1993 are contributing to the more permanent removal of the colloids in the chemical heterogeneity column 3 3 cesium transport aqueous cs transport through the columns was modeled using cs portioning coefficient data table 2 velocity from column discharge table 2 and dispersion data based on i transport fig 6 through columns tables 2 3 figs 2 5 the fit of the aqueous cs breakthrough data to the cde model ranged from r2 0 86 for the mixed physical heterogeneity to r2 0 94 for chemical heterogeneity column table 3 these fits are reasonable for the aqueous cs data generated where the noise in the data can be attributed to the small pore size of the column and resultant samples which were subsampled total cs was 5 greater than aqueous cs values which is within the experimental quality limits so it is not definitive that cs transport was being facilitated by colloids beyond the cs already adsorbed in the csi colloid suspension which at its maximum is 7 of the total cs based on maximum adsorbed cs from partitioning coefficients it can be seen that after the colloid suspension is flushed out with deionized water containing no colloids figs 2 5 that the colloids no longer are associated with cs in the effluent the homogeneous column total surface area of the packed beads was 0 07 m2 whereas the colloid total surface area was 0 008 m2 for total colloids introduced so in this case there was an order of magnitude more surface area for the packed glass bead matrix compared to the colloid s total surface area with increased interaction with bead surfaces due to adsorption straining and bridging of colloids it is reasonable that cs would be stripped from the colloids in experimental conditions where natural sediment known to strongly sorb cs forms the matrix 30 40 colloid facilitated transport of cs has been documented in the effluent of a column with pore velocities of 1400 14 000 cm d 1 chen et al 2005 this is more pronounced with the delayed breakthrough of colloids such as with the physical heterogeneity columns where effluent cs was below detection limits when the bulk of the colloids were flushed from the columns figs 3 and 4 at this slow pore velocity and with the surface adsorption normalized to surface area kd sa for colloids 421 ml m 2 being of similar magnitude with large uncoated glass beads 106 ml m 2 cs is striped from colloids and remains on the glass beads the sa normalized partitioning coefficient for the chemically coated beads 1026 ml m 2 is an order of magnitude greater than the uncoated beads and the colloids so this striping would occur in addition to the retention of the colloids in the glass bead matrix making colloid facilitated transport of metals like cs unlikely to occur 4 conclusion when the colloids and porous matrix have similar surface properties at slow pore velocity conditions contaminants such as cs will exhibit no facilitated transport by colloids this is due to the striping of cs from the colloids onto the stationary matrix the transport of colloids through heterogeneously packed columns will also be retarded more than through homogenous matrices sequentially layered physical heterogeneity will retard colloid transport through the stationary porous media similar to mixed physical heterogeneities and the cs originally adsorbed to the colloids will be stripped when a hydrophobic chemical heterogeneity is present in the stationary matrix silica based colloids will be significantly removed due to fast deposition of colloids and not hydraulically transported through the matrix even with long flushing times unless high flow rate is maintained acknowledgements funding for this work was through the us

1659,this research assesses the ability of a gc scm to simulate uranium transport under variable geochemical conditions typically encountered at uranium in situ recovery isr sites sediment was taken from a monitoring well at the srh site at depths 192 and 193 m below ground and characterized by xrd xrf toc and bet duplicate column studies on the different sediment depths were flushed with synthesized restoration waters at two different alkalinities 160 mg l caco3 and 360 mg l caco3 to study the effect of alkalinity on uranium mobility uranium breakthrough occurred 25 30 earlier in columns with 360 mg l caco3 over columns fed with 160 mg l caco3 influent water a parameter estimation program pest was coupled to phreeqc to derive site densities from experimental data significant parameter fittings were produced for all models demonstrating that the gc scm approach can model the impact of carbonate on uranium in flow systems derived site densities for the two sediment depths were between 141 and 178 μmol sites kg soil demonstrating similar sorption capacities despite heterogeneity in sediment mineralogy model sensitivity to alkalinity and ph was shown to be moderate compared to fitted site densities when calcite saturation was allowed to equilibrate calcite kinetics emerged as a potential source of error when fitting parameters in flow conditions fitted results were compared to data from previous batch and column studies completed on sediments from the smith ranch highland srh site to assess variability in derived parameters parameters from batch experiments were lower by a factor of 1 1 to 3 4 compared to column studies completed on the same sediments the difference was attributed to errors in solid solution ratios and the impact of calcite dissolution in batch experiments column studies conducted at two different laboratories showed almost an order of magnitude difference in fitted site densities suggesting that experimental methodology may play a bigger role in column sorption behavior than actual sediment heterogeneity our results demonstrate the necessity for isr sites to remove residual pco2 and equilibrate restoration water with background geochemistry to reduce uranium mobility in addition the observed variability between fitted parameters on the same sediments highlights the need to provide standardized guidelines and methodology for regulators and industry when the gc scm approach is used for isr risk assessments keywords transport modeling uranium adsorption in situ recovery surface complexation modeling 1 introduction in situ recovery isr of uranium is a non intrusive method to extract uranium from the subsurface and accounts for most of uranium produced worldwide mudd 2014 isr alters the geochemistry of the ore zone significantly during operation and mobilizes contaminants such as arsenic radon and uranium hall 2009 while industry restoration practices manage to significantly reduce contaminant concentrations they rarely bring groundwater chemistry back to pre mining conditions borch et al 2012 hall 2009 consequently industry may be faced with applying for alternate concentration limits acls for contaminants of concern by assessing the risk of residual contaminants to human health and environment borch et al 2012 hall 2009 risk assessments normally employ reactive fate and transport models to approximate uranium movement though the aquifer a plethora of geochemical and hydrological processes can affect uranium transport sorption to mineral surfaces remains an important mechanism that can lead to a significant retardation of uranium in groundwater davis et al 2004 and is an important focus of reactive transport models davis and curtis 2007 however currently neither the u s environmental protection agency epa nor the nuclear regulatory commission nrc provide any guidelines to assess and model aquifer s sorption capacity the lack of accepted modeling assumptions and practices such as which thermodynamic databases to include what kind of sorption models to apply and what methods to use to determine important parameters can produce significant variability with computational errors and uncertainties for final model predictions in addition inherent variability in experimental designs and scale dependent uncertainty can introduce further errors when transferring bench scale experiments to the field scale miller et al 2010 these challenges pose liability issues for regulators industry and the public if or when models fail to predict observed plume behavior at a later time research literature has demonstrated that the speciation of aqueous uranium is highly dependent on alkalinity and ph due to the preferred formation of stable ternary uranyl carbonate complexes with calcium and magnesium bargar et al 2000 bernhard et al 2001 dong and brooks 2006 fox et al 2006 guillaumont and mompean 2003 the effect of these species on sorption have been investigated by others nair and merkel 2011a nair and merkel 2011b stewart et al 2010 and indicate that uranyl calcium carbonate species can reduce total sorption by as much as 90 nair and merkel 2011b calcite and calcite saturation also have emerged as a component that affects uranium mobility dangelmayr et al 2017 dong et al 2005 hyun et al 2009 influent waters under saturated with regards to calcite may cause mineral dissolution and increase ph alkalinity and calcium concentrations thereby favoring aqueous uranium species over sorbed complexes as a consequence assessing the variability of alkalinity carbonate systems and ph while concurrently addressing the presence of mineral calcite phases within field restoration sites appear to be critical for accurate uranium predictive behavior and thus should be accounted for during the derivation of modeling parameters moreover a standardized thermodynamic database that accounts for these critical parameters that influence aqueous uranium speciation will be crucial for providing more robust risk assessments at former isr sites a range of theoretical models of varying complexity and accuracy have been proposed to simulate metal sorption onto mineral surfaces generalized surface complexation models gc scm have become favored by many researchers due to their semi empirical nature and the relative ease with which they can be incorporated into transport calculations davis and curtis 2003 davis et al 2004 kohler et al 1996 zhang et al 2009 gc scm models rely on experimental data to estimate important sorption parameters such as sorption site density and equilibrium constants this approach has the advantage of incorporating experimental verifications of the model from the beginning compared to component additive surface complexation models ca scm that rely on assumed sorption mechanisms based on the observed mineralogy of soil cores davis et al 2004 davis et al 2009 payne et al 2004 however experimentally derived sorption parameters are highly dependent on experimental designs and methods of parameterization miller et al 2010 payne et al 2013 which can make them difficult to transfer between systems of different mineralogy or geochemistry and introduce experimental uncertainties and errors this work attempts to determine variability in experimentally derived sorption parameters and investigates the sensitivity of parameters to experimental conditions by comparing the results of several column and batch studies completed on cores collected from the smith ranch highland srh isr facility near douglas wyoming us our research focuses on three key aspects 1 determining whether our conceptual model can accurately simulate uranium transport behavior due to changes in alkalinity and ph 2 assessing the sensitivity of model outputs to changes in ph alkalinity and derived sorption parameters and 3 investigating the inherent variability that may exists between sorption parameters obtained in different experiments on the same soil materials data from column experiments conducted on soil cores taken from the smith ranch highland isr facility were compared with two other studies column and batch experiments dangelmayr et al 2017 truax 2015 to address these questions 2 methods 2 1 site description and core sampling a full description of the smith ranch highland site and its geology can be found in hunter 1999 while a map of the relevant core location can be found in dangelmayr et al 2017 sediment samples were obtained from an observation well at the srh isr site located downgradient from mine unit 3 in the fort union formation the location from which the core was taken ensured that no mining activity had altered the sediments the collection and preservation of relevant sediment samples for depths 192 and 193 m below ground are described elsewhere dangelmayr et al 2017 truax 2015 briefly sediment cores were partitioned and sealed anaerobically 98 n2 2 h2 and preserved at 4 c during transport and storage the core sections used came from a depth of 192 3 to 192 6 m referred to 192 herein and 193 2 to 193 5 m below ground referred to as 193 x ray diffraction rigaku s ultimate plus scottsdale az and x ray fluorescence bruker s tracer iv billerica ma analyses were conducted on sediment depths to determine dominant mineralogy and elemental make up the sediment samples were fractionated using a humboldt riffle splitter and mixed and pulverized in a shaker mill using ball bearings prior to x ray analysis sediment characterization also included brunauer emmet teller bet analysis using a micrometrics gemini iii 2375 surface area analyzer norcross ga to determine surface area as well as total organic carbon toc and inorganic carbon analysis ic by coulometric titration with a uic inc co2 coulometry module joliet il a detailed description of results for of pertinent sediment characteristics for three core sections depths 191 m 192 m and 193 m below ground are presented in tables 1 and 2 all characterization was performed on the fine fractions 2 mm dia of the sediments 2 2 column preparation four columns were run simultaneously two columns were filled with material from a depth of 192 m while the other two columns were filled with sediment from depth 193 m previous sorption experiments reported in truax 2015 and dangelmayr et al 2017 were completed at los alamos national laboratory lanl and south dakota school of mines and technology sdsm t and replicate sorption results from those studies were further analyzed to determine whether sorption parameters can be transferred between experiments with variable geochemical conditions prior to column filling sediment sections were homogenized by mixing and stirring with a spatula to break up pieces sediments were then wet packed with synthesized background water according to methods adopted from lewis and sjöstrom 2010 compacting the slurry at one cm intervals during filling based on dry weight measurements and column volumes porosities for the four columns were between 0 24 and 0 29 assuming an average solids bulk density of 2 65 g cm3 influent solutions were delivered to the columns by four programmable ne 1000 single syringe pumps new era pump systems farmingdale ny at a rate of 1 ml per hour syringes were filled every 46 49 h with new influent solutions prepared on the same day prior to the actual experiments sediment columns were flushed with synthesized background water shown in table 3 with an alkalinity adjusted to 360 mg l caco3 over the course of 25 days to elute any remaining uranium from the sediments and equilibrate the sediment with the influent solutions the columns pumps and fraction collector were kept in a glovebox at 2 h2 98 n2 atmosphere to maintain anoxic conditions in the columns and influent 2 3 column operation and water analysis columns were fed a solution of synthesized restoration water at a rate of 1 ml h for 143 h after which influent was switched to simulated background water water chemistries for both influent solutions are presented in table 3 the column tracer consisted of 640 mg l bromide added to the restoration water as cabr2 the two columns at replicate depths were run at two different alkalinities to determine the replicability of column tests between different geochemical conditions and investigate the effect alkalinity has on uranium breakthrough one set of columns received restoration water at an alkalinity of 320 380 mg l caco3 with an average of 360 mg l caco3 the other set of columns was fed restoration water with an alkalinity of 160 180 mg l caco3 which is the typical range for post treatment water at the smith ranch highland site the high and low alkalinity waters are referred to as haw and law from here on the alkalinity of the influent waters was prepared by sparging 250 ml of synthetic groundwater with a mixture of 100 n2 and 80 n2 20 co2 gases in a sealed container for 6 or more hours flow rates of co2 and n2 into the container were controlled by rotameters to achieve an approximate headspace pco2 of 10 and 5 for the haw and law waters respectively the feed solution was measured at 30 min intervals for alkalinity hach method 8203 and ph and was adjusted with a 106 mg l na2co3 solution prepared anew each day to produce the desired water chemistry two hundred microliters of 0 5 m mes buffer were added to the restoration water after the sparging period to stabilize the ph at approximately 6 5 and to maintain saturation with respect to calcite s i of 0 14 to 0 69 after the feed solutions were prepared 48 ml of solution was transferred to 60 ml syringes and loaded onto the syringe pumps all columns received the same background water table 3 after 143 h of operation background waters were prepared in the same fashion as restoration water with a target ph of 7 2 7 8 and an alkalinity that ranged from 140 to 200 mg l caco3 mes buffer was not added to the background water since the feed solutions were relatively at equilibrium with calcite s i of 0 49 0 88 a summary graph for the ph and alkalinity of the influent waters over the duration of the experiments is shown in fig 1 effluent samples were collected with a teledyne isco foxy 200 fraction collector lincoln ne over 12 h intervals and tested for ph bromide and alkalinity immediately upon collection bromide was measured with a cole parmer combination ion selective electrode vernont hill il while alkalinity was determined via the hach method 8023 cations were analyzed for iron calcium uranium and magnesium by icp ms agilent 7800 santa clara ca to assess recoveries for uranium and calcium 2 4 modeling and parameter fitting a transport model was developed in phreeqc to simulate uranium transport through the column details on transport modeling used by phreeqc can be found in parkhurst and appelo 2013 while the modeling process is described in dangelmayr et al 2017 and johnson et al 2016 a parameter estimation software pest produced by doherty and hunt 2010 was coupled to phreeqc to derive the best fits for transport and sorption parameters based on the lowest sum of squared residuals sors and r values prior to applying uranium sorption the dispersivities and grid sizes for each column were fitted to the breakthrough curves of the tracers using phreeqc s 1 d advection dispersion function in order to describe the complex aqueous chemistry of uranium phreeqc s default database was updated with the uranium speciation reactions from guillaumont and mompean 2003 the complete dataset can be found in the supporting information appendix d updated equilibrium constants for calcium carbonate uranyl ternary species dong and brooks 2006 and surface complexation reactions davis et al 2004 are shown in table 4 the mes buffer was added manually into phreeqc as a master species using a pka value of 6 15 interactions between mes and uranium were considered negligible based on the review of metal buffer complexes by ferreira et al 2015 input for influent water was modeled using the measured ph and alkalinity for each newly prepared syringe redox chemistry was ignored and uranium was not allowed to precipitate the kinetics of uraninite precipitation were assumed to be too slow to affect transport and were not observed in previous column studies conducted at similar flow velocities dangelmayr et al 2017 calcite dissolution kinetics were included using phreeqc s default model based on plummer et al 1978 the mechanisms of calcite precipitation are still an active field of research andersson et al 2016 cao et al 2018 heberling et al 2016 and dependent on a variety of physical and chemical characteristics of the systems studied morse et al 2007 as a consequence no attempts were made to include a mechanistic calcite precipitation models into phreeqc simulations since doing so would require adding additional condition specific fitting parameters instead our primary conceptual model assumed calcite precipitation would occur to slowly for our 37 h residence time and was consequently disabled additional models were run with calcite precipitation enabled to test the possible effect that precipitation kinetics could have on model outputs for our column experiments other solid phases were excluded from our model for simplicity a non electrostatic generic composite surface complexation model gc scm was used to simulate sorption of uranium to sediment surfaces surface complexation models have been examined extensively in the literature and details on fundamental concepts can be found in dzombak and morel 1990 waite et al 1994 and davis et al 1998 scms incorporate adsorption through mass action equations wherein cations form surface species with negatively charged sorption sites on the surface of minerals the formation of these surface species is governed by equilibrium constants similar to aqueous speciation reactions eqs 1 and 2 depict how the formation of uranium surface complexes is dependent on both the equilibrium constant of the surface species and the number of sorption sites available for the strong and very strong sites respectively 1 k soh sou o 2 2 h soh u o 2 2 2 k ssoh ssou o 2 2 h ssoh u o 2 2 in complex mineral assemblages found in natural sediments determining the number of reactive sorption sites can be difficult if not impossible davis et al 2004 if both the number of sorption sites and the k values are not available then solutions to surface complexation equations are inherently non unique the gc scm does not intend to accurately represent stoichiometries and interactions occurring at the molecular scale and ignores electrostatic effects of mineral surfaces neither does it tie sorption reactions to specific mineral surfaces instead it takes a semi empirical approach to surface complexation where many molecular scale processes are combined into a few experimentally derived parameters goodness of fit and simplicity have been suggested as criteria for using the gc scm approach for risk assessment waite et al 1994 payne et al 2013 previous studies johnson et al 2016 dangelmayr et al 2017 showed that best fits for soils were achieved with a 2 pk model including a weak site did not improve the model fits significantly while adding another degree of non uniqueness to the fitting process our model used two generic metal oxide surfaces a strong sorption site soh and a very strong sorption site ssoh the pk values for those two theoretical sites were based on davis et al 2004 and are provided in table 4 while the number of sorption sites for the soh and ssoh sites were used as fitting parameters fixing pk to literature values not only reduced the number of optimal solutions but also allowed us to compare fitted parameters between the different columns and previous experiments since the goal of this project was to understand the inherent variability in this process rather than finding the best solution to an individual data set both parameters were constrained to no 5 and 0 5 of the total number of sorption sites available to maintain an approximate 10 1 ratio between soh and ssoh sites as suggested by davis et al 2004 no weights were applied to the objective function experimental data from previous column experiments dangelmayr et al 2017 on sediments 191 4 m and 192 3 m below ground referred to as 191 and 192 respectively was fitted with the models explained earlier and used to compare fitted parameters from different column experiments on similar sediment sections experiments in dangelmayr et al 2017 were conducted with different influent chemistries and column preparation methods but employed a similar conceptual model as described herein in addition the results of batch experiments completed at sdsmt on sediments 191 m and 193 m truax 2015 were fitted with the same process outlined in this section to derive site densities the experimental methods and results of truax 2015 are provided in the supporting information appendix c the fitted site densities of those three different data sets were compared to each other to determine the variability of fitted parameters between the different methodologies employed a sensitivity analysis was performed on our models by varying input ph alkalinity and site densities to determine shifts in uranium breakthrough time t 50 variables were changed one at a time at percentile increments and plotted versus the percentile change in t 50 the increments were compared to a baseline alkalinity of 320 a ph of 6 5 and 0 1 by weight calcite content similar to the 192 haw experimental setup calcite precipitation was enabled during the sensitivity analysis to simulate field conditions where equilibrium conditions predominate a second sensitivity analysis was performed on ph and alkalinity with calcite precipitation and dissolution excluded to test the possible effect that calcite kinetics might have on experimental setups dependent parameters ph and alkalinity were not fixed during the analysis to simulate how uncertainties in influent chemistries compared to model input parameter could affect uranium transport after equilibration with the aquifer geochemistry 3 results 3 1 experimental results bet analysis on sediments from depth 192 m and 193 m showed surface areas of 4 7 0 58 m2 g and 9 4 0 38 m2 g respectively consistent with the observation that 192 contained coarser material xrf results table 1 indicated the presence of 0 74 and 0 275 mol kg soil of iron for depths 193 and 192 m respectively which according to xrd analyses may have been present as impurities in feldspar sediment characterization revealed a generally similar mineralogy between 192 and 193 except for toc content and the presence of montmorillonite in sediment 192 porosities calculated from tracer breakthroughs and flow rates were between 0 204 and 0 27 the lower effective porosity of tracer breakthrough compared to porosities derived from soil weights used represented in table 6 can be attributed to the presence of trapped air that was introduced during packing subsequent unit conversions and calculations all use the effective porosity derived from tracer data breakthrough curves for the bromide tracer and uranium effluent are provided in figs 2 5 models using best fit parameters are shown over the uranium breakthrough curve uranium breakthrough experienced significant retardation in all columns by a factor of 2 3 over tracer breakthrough changing the alkalinity of restoration waters from approximately 160 to 320 mg l caco3 increased t 50 by 25 and 30 for the 193 and 192 set respectively retardation factors and pore volumes for each experiment are shown in table 5 while effluent alkalinity for all four columns are provided in fig 6 total recoveries for uranium and calcium are provided in table 7 recoveries were above 90 for uranium in all columns and between 94 and 103 for calcium sediments from depth 192 m below ground provided slightly lower uranium recoveries than sediments from depth 193 m the discrepancy can be attributed to minute 1 mg l but persistent residual uranium that was still eluting from those columns after the experiment was terminated compared to the 193 columns sediment from depth 192 was finer grained than sediment from 193 and had a higher porosity as well hence the residual tail observed post injection could be explained by the diffusion of uranium into dead end pores and interstitial spaces influent waters were almost continuously over saturated with respect to calcite with a saturation index si varying between 0 14 and 1 24 with a median of 0 64 only the 160 mg l alkalinity experiments were slightly under saturated with a saturation index si of 0 14 to 0 04 during the uranium injection period for a total of 48 out of 143 h as a result very little calcite dissolution would be expected during the column experiment effluent ph produced significantly higher values compared to influent ph increasing by as much as 1 5 units the ph difference likely indicates micromolar amounts of co2 outgassing from the uncapped sampling vials during collection since the vials were left exposed to the atmosphere of the anaerobic chamber for 12 24 h prior to analysis effluent si calculated from measured effluent ph and alkalinity were also significantly higher than influent si as a result of the elevated ph in the sample vials alkalinity and calcium concentrations remained relatively stable between influent and effluent figs 1 and 6 table 7 visual inspection of influent in the syringes and effluent in the sampling vials did not reveal any visible calcite precipitation but small amounts of air bubbles did form in the syringes over the 48 h injection period 3 2 modeling and fitting results phreeqc produced generally good model fits with coefficients of determination r2 of 0 98 and 0 96 for the high and low alkalinity experiments using sediment depth 192 and 0 95 and 0 98 for high and low alkalinity influent for sediments from depth 193 respectively table 5 fitting parameters for strong and very strong binding sites are shown in table 5 together with the experiment s r2 and sors normalized to influent uranium the number of fitted sites involved in uranium sorption were between 141 and 178 μmol kg soil for soh and 9 56 and 16 3 μmol kg soil for ssoh sediment from depth 193 m below ground had a slightly reduced sorption capacity with a soh mean of 148 μmol sites kg soil compared to 160 μmol sites kg soil for sediment from depth 192 however fitted site densities were generally similar between the two sediments the higher delay in observed breakthrough for the 193 sediments can be attributed to a higher surface area to solution ratio table 6 rather than inherent differences in sorption capacity due to mineralogy this would suggest that geochemical heterogeneity at the srh site plays a less significant role in uranium retention than variability in aquifer porosities and sediment surface area the fitted number of sorption sites represents only between 0 79 and 1 96 of total sorption sites based on a generic site density of 3 84 μmol nm2 bidentate bonds dzombak and morel 1990 and bet results figs 2 5 show experimental uranium breakthrough together with models using the best fit values derived through pest the ph of the model outputs varied between 6 8 and 7 5 which was consistently lower by about 0 7 ph unit compared to measured effluent ph 7 5 8 3 modeled alkalinity varied by 20 of measured alkalinity and produced r2 values between 0 529 and 0 719 predicted calcite dissolution in phreeqc was consistently below 100 nm with the exception of ph modeled carbonate dynamics corresponded generally well to measured data figures for sensitivity analyzes are shown in figs 7 and 8 site density and alkalinity had a linear relationship between parameter increments and t 50 the sensitivity of ph showed lowest retardation at a ph of 6 5 in the presence of calcite while increasing or decreasing the ph by one unit increased breakthrough time by up to 15 modeling the system without allowing calcite to precipitate produced characteristic sorption behavior with a significant drop in uranium retardation past ph 6 5 of the three parameters investigated changes in site density had the greatest effect on uranium retardation when calcite was allowed to regulate alkalinity and ph 4 discussion 4 1 modeling effects of carbonate dynamics on uranium as shown in figs 2 5 and table 5 doubling the influent alkalinity increased uranium breakthrough time t 50 by 25 30 compared to the tracer this trend has been observed in prior literature as well kohler et al 1996 curtis et al 2006 dangelmayr et al 2017 models fits were generally accurate and close in all four columns r2 0 9 despite variability in both influent ph 0 4 ph units and alkalinity 40 mg l caco3 between syringe replacements fig 1 all experiments show two uranium peaks in the model one during the slug injection and the other shortly after switching to background water the second uranium peak was likely caused by the restoration water having a slightly higher alkalinity during the first injection 240 mg l caco3 than the subsequent influent water 160 mg l caco3 in addition to a higher ph 7 5 versus 6 5 our results demonstrate that the gc scm approach can effectively model the behavior of uranium induced by shifts in geochemistry typically encountered at isr restoration sites when high alkalinity restoration waters come into contact with background water the close model fits indicate that similar de sorption events due to changes in alkalinity and ph can be predicted in field systems provided carbonate dynamics in the field are well described in the model effluent alkalinity experienced mild deviations from model predictions 20 during all column runs we considered this deviation negligible the hach titration method can only measure alkalinity in steps of 20 mg l which would represent an inherent 5 17 instrumental error for the alkalinity ranges examined in addition r2 values were between 0 529 and 0 719 for the modeled and measured alkalinity however phreeqc consistently underestimated effluent ph from measured values by approximately 0 9 ph units figs s1 s4 the discrepancy is likely due to the prolonged time 12 24 h the uncapped sampling vials were exposed to the atmosphere of the anaerobic chamber mining waters at isr operations are significantly oversaturated with co2 g which is often the sole source of acidity micro to nanomolar amounts of co2 g evolution in the sampling vials could drive up the ph without any noticeable effect on total alkalinity it is possible that calcite precipitation kinetics could also have influenced the effluent ph phreeqc assumed equilibrium conditions with respect to calcite which would decrease the ph in the model output while calcite precipitation may have been kinetically limited in the columns however neither enabling nor disabling calcite precipitation in our model managed to produce effluent ph that resembled the measured data and overall did not change the alkalinity ph or uranium breakthrough significantly there also not any observed calcite precipitation within the syringes or during vial sampling as a consequence it is assumed the elevated ph is primarily an artefact of the experimental sampling procedures and does not reflect a deficiency within the conceptual model presented it should be noted that calcite kinetics could impact experimental designs and field models where water moves at velocities at which kinetic limitations become significant while models assume equilibrium conditions if calcite precipitates slowly then the ph and co3 2 in the model would be lower than observed in experimental conditions as a consequence fewer sorption sites would be required to fit the observed data and derived parameters would underestimate an aquifer s actual sorption capacity it is advisable to assess the potential impact calcite dissolution precipitation kinetics could have on gc scm parameters when designing sorption tests on actual sediments and keep track of effluent ph calcium and alkalinity to validate model assumptions regarding calcite dynamics 4 2 model sensitivity to carbonate dynamics a sensitivity analysis on ph and alkalinity was performed on the 192 column run with high alkalinity influent and results are presented in figs 7 and 8 despite the significant impact of alkalinity on uranium transport observed in the column experiment the model showed linear but low sensitivity to alkalinity relative change in t 50 only increased by 10 after reducing influent alkalinity to 160 mg l from 360 mg l while a 25 30 earlier uranium breakthrough in the haw columns occurred phreeqc corrected this discrepancy by fitting a slightly higher number of sorption sites to the law columns compared to the haw columns 1 31 mmol l solution and 1 04 mmol l solution compared to 1 46 mmol l solution and 1 32 mmol l solution for the 192 and 193 sediments respectively values shown in table 5 are in units of μmol kg sediment since the law columns also had lower porosities the reported site densities do not exhibit this trend the sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the impact of influent ph was not only more significant than influent alkalinity but also produced higher variability reducing the ph by half a unit from 6 5 increased t 50 by 10 while increasing the ph also increased breakthrough times fig 7 lowest sorption was observed in the ph range of 6 5 6 7 the effect of ph on the sorptive behavior of uranium has been well studied waite et al 1994 kohler et al 1996 echevarria et al 2001 davis et al 2004 curtis et al 2006 and generally show uranyl sorption to be maximum between ph 6 and 7 in batch experiments contrary to our simulations this discrepancy can be explained by the addition of calcite precipitation in the sensitivity simulations in our case influent waters were close to calcite saturation at ph 6 5 and alkalinity 320 mg l caco3 reducing the ph below 6 in the simulation caused significant calcite dissolution which equilibrated at a ph of 6 0 according to phreeqc even though alkalinity doubled from the baseline after equilibration the resulting ph of around 6 0 likely produced insufficient carbonate ions to form ternary uranium complexes necessary to reduce sorption meanwhile a higher ph induced calcite precipitation and subsequently lowered total alkalinity ph and dissolved calcium increasing sorption excluding calcite in the sensitivity simulations produced characteristic sorption behavior with a sharp drop in uranium retention past ph 6 5 due to the preference of uranium to form ternary complexes fig 8 an increase of one ph unit from 6 5 to 7 5 reduced uranium breakthrough time by 50 in our sensitivity analysis the transport models for the haw columns produce a consistently lower ph during restoration water flush than the law columns despite the fact that column effluents show similar experimental ph values between the two systems if the ph in the columns was only 0 3 units higher than predicted in the transport model due to kinetics errors in calcite content or ph measurements then that could explain together with the effect of alkalinity the observed 25 30 differences in t 50 between the haw and law columns if we assume that calcite precipitation was kinetically prohibitive the sensitivity analyses indicate that the effect of alkalinity and ph on uranium breakthrough can be regulated by calcite dynamics and is highly sensitive to small variations in ph 0 5 ph units in the 6 5 7 5 ph range groundwater velocities at the srh site are significantly lower than those used within our experiments 2 3 m per year as a consequence purely thermodynamic models may be inappropriate for column studies where calcite kinetics would produce additional uncertainty however they might be sufficient for isr sites and batch experiments that are completed over a longer equilibration period 4 3 significance of calcium carbonate dynamics on isr restoration practices the alkalinity of post mining groundwater at isr sites can reach up to 800 mg l caco3 while background waters may drop to 120 mg l caco3 typical post mining ph values are 6 5 to 6 8 before groundwater restoration is completed while background waters range in ph from 7 5 to 8 2 the necessity of reducing pco2 during isr restoration has been well documented davis and curtis 2007 proven methods for removing dissolved carbon dioxide as a part of the restoration process are available and commonly used such as air stripping or vacuum degassing and their use can significantly reduce alkalinity in the restoration zone and thus decrease dissolved uranium mobility the results discussed here underscore the importance of including one or more of these removal methods during restoration our research indicates that restoration practices also need to account for calcium concentrations and ph calcium hardness at the shr site can reach 400 mg l and background calcite is approximately 0 1 1 0 by weight significant amounts of dissolved calcium are removed during the reverse osmosis process typically employed during restoration removing co2 must therefore be done with respect to calcite s i as well as ph since under saturated restoration water may dissolve sediment calcite and increase uranium mobility outside of the restoration zone blending treated effluent with background water may alleviate this effect and bring restoration water into equilibrium with sediment mineralogy high sensitivity to ph and calcite kinetics can also produces significant errors and uncertainty in model predictability due to unknown field conditions as a consequence any risk assessments based on the results of forward models should assess uranium mobility over a range of plausible ph ranges and evaluate the impact of calcite kinetic to capture uncertainty in field and experimental conditions 4 4 modeling desorption hysteresis uranium breakthrough and uranium behavior during the slug injection were accurately captured by the gc scm model however a significant discrepancy in uranium desorption was observed between models and experimental results figs 2 5 hysteresis between sorption and desorption has been observed in prior literature dangelmayr et al 2017 dittrich and reimus 2015 kohler et al 1996 liu et al 2013 liu et al 2015 miller et al 2013 and is a common phenomenon of uranium transport the tailing behavior has been ascribed to mass transfer limitations at the pore scale and differences in sorption desorption kinetics liu et al 2013 liu et al 2015 as well as heterogeneity in sediment hydraulic conductivity miller et al 2013 prior attempts to predict the tailing behavior of uranium also found that the model fits depend highly on the number of sorption sites used dittrich and reimus 2015 noted that a 3 site model with an additional weak sorption site performed better than a 2 site or 1 site model even though all three models were able to capture initial uranium breakthrough the presence of a small number of very strong sorption sites was found to be responsible for the tailing behavior for our experiments desorption was actually overestimated by the model past 280 h while the model under predicted uranium retention during the early stages of the elution phase 200 280 h our fitting procedures did not assign weights to different parts of the breakthrough curves and restricted ssoh sites to no 0 05 of the soh sites as a consequence pest prioritized the initial breakthrough curve and behavior of the uranium slug over the desorption tailing since those would produce higher residuals the sensitivity of the model to the number of ssoh sites would also be lower since their influence on uranium desorption appeared during the latter stages of the experiment furthermore our design applied a simple model with few fitting parameters to the experimental data to reduce the non uniqueness of our solution space and simplify the application to field systems however the effect of soh to ssoh ratios and the possible need for a third site in the fitting process calls for further investigations as their effect on the long term behavior of uranium at actual isr sites could be significant when compared to short term laboratory experiments 4 5 cross comparisons between experiments one goal of our study was to assess the variability in sorption parameters obtained from the gc scm fitting process between different experimental set ups to this end select data from prior experiments on the same sediment cores were analyzed and their parameters re fitted if necessary to the model developed for in this research the previous column and batch experiments are described in detail in dangelmayr et al 2017 and truax 2015 site densities from prior experiments were recalculated with our updated conceptual model detailed in section 2 4 table 8 summarizes site densities obtained for each experimental setup for the strong binding sites soh and sorts them according to sediment depth and alkalinity fitted parameters completed on the same sediment section within the same experiment group varied by a factor 15 33 providing replicable results given the inherent uncertainty in the experimental data parameter comparisons on the same sediments between experimental setups yielded significantly higher variability in site densities column experiments produced average site densities that were higher by a factor of 1 46 for sediment depth 193 and 3 57 for sediment depth 191 compared average site densities of the corresponding batch experiments it should be noted that the presence of calcite in the batch experiment completed at 0 pco2 could be responsible for the low site densities produced during the fitting process the complete dissolution of an uncertain amount of calcite would have raised the alkalinity and ph to a higher value than predicted in the model and as a result under predict actual sorption capacity when the batch experiments completed at 0 pco2 were excluded from the averages fitted results for sediment depth 193 become identical between batch and column experiments and reduced by a factor of 2 8 for sediment 191 variability in batch to column scaling has been reported in several other studies and consensus on the causes as well as extent for these observations is in dispute kohler et al 1996 porro et al 2000 phillippi et al 2007 miller et al 2010 huber et al 2016 one study showed that sorption capacity derived from column experiments deviated by a factor of 2 6 times from that of batch experiments huber et al 2016 dispersion as well as diffusion into immobile phases are processes that occur exclusively in flow through systems and have been implicated in increasing apparent sorption capacity huber et al 2016 miller et al 2010 porro et al 2000 in addition phillippi et al 2007 and porro et al 2000 postulated that a solid concentration effect could impact and underestimate sorption in batch experiments compared to column studies specifically errors in solution to sediment ratios in the batch experiments can produce high variability in resulting site densities miller et al 2010 porro et al 2000 at a solid solution ratio of 0 047 a 5 error in porosity sediment volume to total volume can change the total number of sorption sites available for batch experiments by a factor of 2 on the other hand column experiments are conducted at solid solution ratios where errors in porosity produce equivalent errors in total number of sorption sites uncertainties in alkalinity ph and calcite s i would compound the observed discrepancies and thus could explain the variability between batch and column experiments the highest variability by a factor of 9 6 however was observed between two column experiments completed on sediment 192 table 8 our sensitivity analyses show that uncertainties in alkalinity ph or sediment calcite cannot fully account for the differences in the estimated parameters in addition errors in porosity cannot explain the significantly lower sorption site density in the lanl column experiment partial oxidation of pyrite into oxidized fe phases could account for the higher sorption capacity in the sdsm t experiments despite best efforts to preserve sediments anaerobically during transport and experimental set up more importantly the two different column studies used different methods of packing sediment and mounting the column the sdsm t study employed wet packing with compaction to produce saturated conditions while the lanl columns were dry packed saturated with co2 and flushed with background to dissolve co2 out of the columns dangelmayr et al 2017 the effect of packing methods on flow properties has been reviewed in lewis and sjöstrom 2010 different propensities for creating preferential flow paths and immobile pore spaces in the two packing methods could impact apparent retardation between the two columns in addition the sdsmt columns utilized a bottom to top flow while the lanl columns were placed sideways which could have produced different flow paths during sediment settling our study demonstrates the need for guidelines for conducting and assessing sorption experiments that employ either column or batch studies methodology with regards to packing mineral phases present chemistry and sediment solution ratios can produce fitted sorption parameters that vary by a factor of almost an order of magnitude the uncertainty associated with methodology outweighs any uncertainty in sediment mineralogy at the srh site the industry and regulators would benefit from a better development of best practices when designing sorption studies that intend to utilize the gc scm approach 4 6 uncertainty in upscaling modeling parameters the gc scm does not assume modeled sorption sites to be specific to any one mineral phase or metal oxide davis et al 2004 however when applying the gc scm approach to field systems a scaling factor needs to be used common scaling factors that have been suggested in the literature include fe content gustafsson et al 2009 johnson and tutu 2015 papynov et al 2016 waite et al 1994 and surface area bertetti et al 1998 jang et al 2007 johnson and tutu 2015 loganathan et al 2009 papynov et al 2016 prikryl et al 2001 xrf results showed around 3 iron for the two sediment depths studied fe at the srh site is also predominantly found in reduced forms downgradient of the mining zone while partial oxidation of fe minerals may have occurred when sediments were prepared for laboratory experiments if we assume uranium binding to ferrinol sites as the primary surface complexation mechanism then only 0 035 to 0 049 of iron actually participated in uranium sorption xrd did not detect any crystalline iron bearing minerals and bet results are relatively low for the presence of significant amounts of amorphous fe if the measured 3 of fe content was really in the form of amorphous ferric oxides then one would expect an almost 5 fold higher surface area for our sediments assuming a surface area of 600 m2 g for ferryhidrite dzombak and morel 1990 the lack of definite fe mineral phases makes it uncertain to what degree fe occurs as amorphous material or as substitutions in feldspar which would be unavailable for surface complexation as a consequence sediment fe represents a problematic scaling factor that could potentially add significant uncertainty into the model if an unknown fraction of fe actually participates in uranium sorption two other studies pointed out that total or extractable fe produce poor scaling parameters for predicting uranium sorption to mineral phases johnson and tutu 2015 loganathan et al 2009 prior studies have suggested that metal sorption to aluminosilicates can be scaled to field systems through surface area estimates bertetti et al 1998 prikryl et al 2001 srh sediments were primarily composed of quartz 73 74 k feldspar 8 8 19 4 and albite 6 6 14 suggesting that aluminol and silanol sites could dominate uranium sorption despite a measurable amount of clay content 5 7 montmorillonite and more toc table 5 found in the 192 material both sediments showed similar uranium sorption behavior bet results provided a surface area of 4 7 and 9 4 m2 g for both sediments 192 and 193 respectively table 6 together with an assumed site density of 3 84 μmol m2 dzombak and morel 1990 and bidentate uranyl complexation the total percentage of sites involved in uranyl sorption constitutes only 0 79 to 1 96 of the total sites available in five prior column experiments completed on materials from wells at the srh site the fitted site densities represented only between 0 24 and 1 09 of the total bet derived surface sites dangelmayr et al 2017 the variability in reactive surface sites as a percentage of total surface sites observed in our two laboratory studies presents a challenge when trying upscale gc scm results to the field scale based on these two studies on the same sediments upscaling the gc scm to the field would require a factor of safety of almost an order of magnitude between the upper and lower sorption density estimates 5 conclusion uranium sorption plays a key role in inhibiting uranium mobility at the srh isr facility reducing uranium breakthrough by a factor of 2 3 compared to tracer velocities alkalinity and ph have shown to impact uranium mobility increasing uranium breakthrough by 25 30 when average influent alkalinity was doubled this study demonstrates the applicability of gc scm to model uranium behavior under shifting geochemical conditions representable fits were produced for all columns when using a 2 surface site non electrostatic surface complexation model accounting for variability in influent ph and alkalinity sensitivity analyses showed that influent alkalinity or ph have a moderate effect on uranium transport while calcite saturation may have an indirect effect on uranium transport by regulating ph and alkalinity calcite kinetics may also be a source of error in observed sorption parameters in flow conditions when effluent ph is underestimated in the model outputs these results highlight the inherent need of isr restoration procedures to remove dissolved co2 and blend restored effluent with background water in addition site risk assessment should incorporate calcite saturation and kinetics within appropriate transport models a comparison of fitted site densities between three experimental studies showed a 1 5 to 3 6 fold difference between parameters derived from batch experiments and column experiments these discrepancies can be explained by uncertainties in experiment ph alkalinity and calcite content and demonstrate the importance of porosity and solid solution ratios when upscaling laboratory parameters to field scale models separate column studies completed on the same sediments produced almost an order of magnitude difference in fitted sorption site densities methodology in column packing was found to have a greater impact on fitted parameters than heterogeneity in sediment mineralogy addressing the uncertainties associated with gc scm models can inform both regulators and industry as to the number of core s that should be collected for laboratory testing the importance of parameters such as porosity and the degree to which a standard model construction procedure can be transferred to other hydrological and geochemical environments this research shows the potential of gc scm in fate and transport modeling under variable geochemical conditions but also highlights the need for standardized guidelines for regulators and industry when applying the gc scm to isr sites acknowledgments this research was supported by a grant from power

1659,this research assesses the ability of a gc scm to simulate uranium transport under variable geochemical conditions typically encountered at uranium in situ recovery isr sites sediment was taken from a monitoring well at the srh site at depths 192 and 193 m below ground and characterized by xrd xrf toc and bet duplicate column studies on the different sediment depths were flushed with synthesized restoration waters at two different alkalinities 160 mg l caco3 and 360 mg l caco3 to study the effect of alkalinity on uranium mobility uranium breakthrough occurred 25 30 earlier in columns with 360 mg l caco3 over columns fed with 160 mg l caco3 influent water a parameter estimation program pest was coupled to phreeqc to derive site densities from experimental data significant parameter fittings were produced for all models demonstrating that the gc scm approach can model the impact of carbonate on uranium in flow systems derived site densities for the two sediment depths were between 141 and 178 μmol sites kg soil demonstrating similar sorption capacities despite heterogeneity in sediment mineralogy model sensitivity to alkalinity and ph was shown to be moderate compared to fitted site densities when calcite saturation was allowed to equilibrate calcite kinetics emerged as a potential source of error when fitting parameters in flow conditions fitted results were compared to data from previous batch and column studies completed on sediments from the smith ranch highland srh site to assess variability in derived parameters parameters from batch experiments were lower by a factor of 1 1 to 3 4 compared to column studies completed on the same sediments the difference was attributed to errors in solid solution ratios and the impact of calcite dissolution in batch experiments column studies conducted at two different laboratories showed almost an order of magnitude difference in fitted site densities suggesting that experimental methodology may play a bigger role in column sorption behavior than actual sediment heterogeneity our results demonstrate the necessity for isr sites to remove residual pco2 and equilibrate restoration water with background geochemistry to reduce uranium mobility in addition the observed variability between fitted parameters on the same sediments highlights the need to provide standardized guidelines and methodology for regulators and industry when the gc scm approach is used for isr risk assessments keywords transport modeling uranium adsorption in situ recovery surface complexation modeling 1 introduction in situ recovery isr of uranium is a non intrusive method to extract uranium from the subsurface and accounts for most of uranium produced worldwide mudd 2014 isr alters the geochemistry of the ore zone significantly during operation and mobilizes contaminants such as arsenic radon and uranium hall 2009 while industry restoration practices manage to significantly reduce contaminant concentrations they rarely bring groundwater chemistry back to pre mining conditions borch et al 2012 hall 2009 consequently industry may be faced with applying for alternate concentration limits acls for contaminants of concern by assessing the risk of residual contaminants to human health and environment borch et al 2012 hall 2009 risk assessments normally employ reactive fate and transport models to approximate uranium movement though the aquifer a plethora of geochemical and hydrological processes can affect uranium transport sorption to mineral surfaces remains an important mechanism that can lead to a significant retardation of uranium in groundwater davis et al 2004 and is an important focus of reactive transport models davis and curtis 2007 however currently neither the u s environmental protection agency epa nor the nuclear regulatory commission nrc provide any guidelines to assess and model aquifer s sorption capacity the lack of accepted modeling assumptions and practices such as which thermodynamic databases to include what kind of sorption models to apply and what methods to use to determine important parameters can produce significant variability with computational errors and uncertainties for final model predictions in addition inherent variability in experimental designs and scale dependent uncertainty can introduce further errors when transferring bench scale experiments to the field scale miller et al 2010 these challenges pose liability issues for regulators industry and the public if or when models fail to predict observed plume behavior at a later time research literature has demonstrated that the speciation of aqueous uranium is highly dependent on alkalinity and ph due to the preferred formation of stable ternary uranyl carbonate complexes with calcium and magnesium bargar et al 2000 bernhard et al 2001 dong and brooks 2006 fox et al 2006 guillaumont and mompean 2003 the effect of these species on sorption have been investigated by others nair and merkel 2011a nair and merkel 2011b stewart et al 2010 and indicate that uranyl calcium carbonate species can reduce total sorption by as much as 90 nair and merkel 2011b calcite and calcite saturation also have emerged as a component that affects uranium mobility dangelmayr et al 2017 dong et al 2005 hyun et al 2009 influent waters under saturated with regards to calcite may cause mineral dissolution and increase ph alkalinity and calcium concentrations thereby favoring aqueous uranium species over sorbed complexes as a consequence assessing the variability of alkalinity carbonate systems and ph while concurrently addressing the presence of mineral calcite phases within field restoration sites appear to be critical for accurate uranium predictive behavior and thus should be accounted for during the derivation of modeling parameters moreover a standardized thermodynamic database that accounts for these critical parameters that influence aqueous uranium speciation will be crucial for providing more robust risk assessments at former isr sites a range of theoretical models of varying complexity and accuracy have been proposed to simulate metal sorption onto mineral surfaces generalized surface complexation models gc scm have become favored by many researchers due to their semi empirical nature and the relative ease with which they can be incorporated into transport calculations davis and curtis 2003 davis et al 2004 kohler et al 1996 zhang et al 2009 gc scm models rely on experimental data to estimate important sorption parameters such as sorption site density and equilibrium constants this approach has the advantage of incorporating experimental verifications of the model from the beginning compared to component additive surface complexation models ca scm that rely on assumed sorption mechanisms based on the observed mineralogy of soil cores davis et al 2004 davis et al 2009 payne et al 2004 however experimentally derived sorption parameters are highly dependent on experimental designs and methods of parameterization miller et al 2010 payne et al 2013 which can make them difficult to transfer between systems of different mineralogy or geochemistry and introduce experimental uncertainties and errors this work attempts to determine variability in experimentally derived sorption parameters and investigates the sensitivity of parameters to experimental conditions by comparing the results of several column and batch studies completed on cores collected from the smith ranch highland srh isr facility near douglas wyoming us our research focuses on three key aspects 1 determining whether our conceptual model can accurately simulate uranium transport behavior due to changes in alkalinity and ph 2 assessing the sensitivity of model outputs to changes in ph alkalinity and derived sorption parameters and 3 investigating the inherent variability that may exists between sorption parameters obtained in different experiments on the same soil materials data from column experiments conducted on soil cores taken from the smith ranch highland isr facility were compared with two other studies column and batch experiments dangelmayr et al 2017 truax 2015 to address these questions 2 methods 2 1 site description and core sampling a full description of the smith ranch highland site and its geology can be found in hunter 1999 while a map of the relevant core location can be found in dangelmayr et al 2017 sediment samples were obtained from an observation well at the srh isr site located downgradient from mine unit 3 in the fort union formation the location from which the core was taken ensured that no mining activity had altered the sediments the collection and preservation of relevant sediment samples for depths 192 and 193 m below ground are described elsewhere dangelmayr et al 2017 truax 2015 briefly sediment cores were partitioned and sealed anaerobically 98 n2 2 h2 and preserved at 4 c during transport and storage the core sections used came from a depth of 192 3 to 192 6 m referred to 192 herein and 193 2 to 193 5 m below ground referred to as 193 x ray diffraction rigaku s ultimate plus scottsdale az and x ray fluorescence bruker s tracer iv billerica ma analyses were conducted on sediment depths to determine dominant mineralogy and elemental make up the sediment samples were fractionated using a humboldt riffle splitter and mixed and pulverized in a shaker mill using ball bearings prior to x ray analysis sediment characterization also included brunauer emmet teller bet analysis using a micrometrics gemini iii 2375 surface area analyzer norcross ga to determine surface area as well as total organic carbon toc and inorganic carbon analysis ic by coulometric titration with a uic inc co2 coulometry module joliet il a detailed description of results for of pertinent sediment characteristics for three core sections depths 191 m 192 m and 193 m below ground are presented in tables 1 and 2 all characterization was performed on the fine fractions 2 mm dia of the sediments 2 2 column preparation four columns were run simultaneously two columns were filled with material from a depth of 192 m while the other two columns were filled with sediment from depth 193 m previous sorption experiments reported in truax 2015 and dangelmayr et al 2017 were completed at los alamos national laboratory lanl and south dakota school of mines and technology sdsm t and replicate sorption results from those studies were further analyzed to determine whether sorption parameters can be transferred between experiments with variable geochemical conditions prior to column filling sediment sections were homogenized by mixing and stirring with a spatula to break up pieces sediments were then wet packed with synthesized background water according to methods adopted from lewis and sjöstrom 2010 compacting the slurry at one cm intervals during filling based on dry weight measurements and column volumes porosities for the four columns were between 0 24 and 0 29 assuming an average solids bulk density of 2 65 g cm3 influent solutions were delivered to the columns by four programmable ne 1000 single syringe pumps new era pump systems farmingdale ny at a rate of 1 ml per hour syringes were filled every 46 49 h with new influent solutions prepared on the same day prior to the actual experiments sediment columns were flushed with synthesized background water shown in table 3 with an alkalinity adjusted to 360 mg l caco3 over the course of 25 days to elute any remaining uranium from the sediments and equilibrate the sediment with the influent solutions the columns pumps and fraction collector were kept in a glovebox at 2 h2 98 n2 atmosphere to maintain anoxic conditions in the columns and influent 2 3 column operation and water analysis columns were fed a solution of synthesized restoration water at a rate of 1 ml h for 143 h after which influent was switched to simulated background water water chemistries for both influent solutions are presented in table 3 the column tracer consisted of 640 mg l bromide added to the restoration water as cabr2 the two columns at replicate depths were run at two different alkalinities to determine the replicability of column tests between different geochemical conditions and investigate the effect alkalinity has on uranium breakthrough one set of columns received restoration water at an alkalinity of 320 380 mg l caco3 with an average of 360 mg l caco3 the other set of columns was fed restoration water with an alkalinity of 160 180 mg l caco3 which is the typical range for post treatment water at the smith ranch highland site the high and low alkalinity waters are referred to as haw and law from here on the alkalinity of the influent waters was prepared by sparging 250 ml of synthetic groundwater with a mixture of 100 n2 and 80 n2 20 co2 gases in a sealed container for 6 or more hours flow rates of co2 and n2 into the container were controlled by rotameters to achieve an approximate headspace pco2 of 10 and 5 for the haw and law waters respectively the feed solution was measured at 30 min intervals for alkalinity hach method 8203 and ph and was adjusted with a 106 mg l na2co3 solution prepared anew each day to produce the desired water chemistry two hundred microliters of 0 5 m mes buffer were added to the restoration water after the sparging period to stabilize the ph at approximately 6 5 and to maintain saturation with respect to calcite s i of 0 14 to 0 69 after the feed solutions were prepared 48 ml of solution was transferred to 60 ml syringes and loaded onto the syringe pumps all columns received the same background water table 3 after 143 h of operation background waters were prepared in the same fashion as restoration water with a target ph of 7 2 7 8 and an alkalinity that ranged from 140 to 200 mg l caco3 mes buffer was not added to the background water since the feed solutions were relatively at equilibrium with calcite s i of 0 49 0 88 a summary graph for the ph and alkalinity of the influent waters over the duration of the experiments is shown in fig 1 effluent samples were collected with a teledyne isco foxy 200 fraction collector lincoln ne over 12 h intervals and tested for ph bromide and alkalinity immediately upon collection bromide was measured with a cole parmer combination ion selective electrode vernont hill il while alkalinity was determined via the hach method 8023 cations were analyzed for iron calcium uranium and magnesium by icp ms agilent 7800 santa clara ca to assess recoveries for uranium and calcium 2 4 modeling and parameter fitting a transport model was developed in phreeqc to simulate uranium transport through the column details on transport modeling used by phreeqc can be found in parkhurst and appelo 2013 while the modeling process is described in dangelmayr et al 2017 and johnson et al 2016 a parameter estimation software pest produced by doherty and hunt 2010 was coupled to phreeqc to derive the best fits for transport and sorption parameters based on the lowest sum of squared residuals sors and r values prior to applying uranium sorption the dispersivities and grid sizes for each column were fitted to the breakthrough curves of the tracers using phreeqc s 1 d advection dispersion function in order to describe the complex aqueous chemistry of uranium phreeqc s default database was updated with the uranium speciation reactions from guillaumont and mompean 2003 the complete dataset can be found in the supporting information appendix d updated equilibrium constants for calcium carbonate uranyl ternary species dong and brooks 2006 and surface complexation reactions davis et al 2004 are shown in table 4 the mes buffer was added manually into phreeqc as a master species using a pka value of 6 15 interactions between mes and uranium were considered negligible based on the review of metal buffer complexes by ferreira et al 2015 input for influent water was modeled using the measured ph and alkalinity for each newly prepared syringe redox chemistry was ignored and uranium was not allowed to precipitate the kinetics of uraninite precipitation were assumed to be too slow to affect transport and were not observed in previous column studies conducted at similar flow velocities dangelmayr et al 2017 calcite dissolution kinetics were included using phreeqc s default model based on plummer et al 1978 the mechanisms of calcite precipitation are still an active field of research andersson et al 2016 cao et al 2018 heberling et al 2016 and dependent on a variety of physical and chemical characteristics of the systems studied morse et al 2007 as a consequence no attempts were made to include a mechanistic calcite precipitation models into phreeqc simulations since doing so would require adding additional condition specific fitting parameters instead our primary conceptual model assumed calcite precipitation would occur to slowly for our 37 h residence time and was consequently disabled additional models were run with calcite precipitation enabled to test the possible effect that precipitation kinetics could have on model outputs for our column experiments other solid phases were excluded from our model for simplicity a non electrostatic generic composite surface complexation model gc scm was used to simulate sorption of uranium to sediment surfaces surface complexation models have been examined extensively in the literature and details on fundamental concepts can be found in dzombak and morel 1990 waite et al 1994 and davis et al 1998 scms incorporate adsorption through mass action equations wherein cations form surface species with negatively charged sorption sites on the surface of minerals the formation of these surface species is governed by equilibrium constants similar to aqueous speciation reactions eqs 1 and 2 depict how the formation of uranium surface complexes is dependent on both the equilibrium constant of the surface species and the number of sorption sites available for the strong and very strong sites respectively 1 k soh sou o 2 2 h soh u o 2 2 2 k ssoh ssou o 2 2 h ssoh u o 2 2 in complex mineral assemblages found in natural sediments determining the number of reactive sorption sites can be difficult if not impossible davis et al 2004 if both the number of sorption sites and the k values are not available then solutions to surface complexation equations are inherently non unique the gc scm does not intend to accurately represent stoichiometries and interactions occurring at the molecular scale and ignores electrostatic effects of mineral surfaces neither does it tie sorption reactions to specific mineral surfaces instead it takes a semi empirical approach to surface complexation where many molecular scale processes are combined into a few experimentally derived parameters goodness of fit and simplicity have been suggested as criteria for using the gc scm approach for risk assessment waite et al 1994 payne et al 2013 previous studies johnson et al 2016 dangelmayr et al 2017 showed that best fits for soils were achieved with a 2 pk model including a weak site did not improve the model fits significantly while adding another degree of non uniqueness to the fitting process our model used two generic metal oxide surfaces a strong sorption site soh and a very strong sorption site ssoh the pk values for those two theoretical sites were based on davis et al 2004 and are provided in table 4 while the number of sorption sites for the soh and ssoh sites were used as fitting parameters fixing pk to literature values not only reduced the number of optimal solutions but also allowed us to compare fitted parameters between the different columns and previous experiments since the goal of this project was to understand the inherent variability in this process rather than finding the best solution to an individual data set both parameters were constrained to no 5 and 0 5 of the total number of sorption sites available to maintain an approximate 10 1 ratio between soh and ssoh sites as suggested by davis et al 2004 no weights were applied to the objective function experimental data from previous column experiments dangelmayr et al 2017 on sediments 191 4 m and 192 3 m below ground referred to as 191 and 192 respectively was fitted with the models explained earlier and used to compare fitted parameters from different column experiments on similar sediment sections experiments in dangelmayr et al 2017 were conducted with different influent chemistries and column preparation methods but employed a similar conceptual model as described herein in addition the results of batch experiments completed at sdsmt on sediments 191 m and 193 m truax 2015 were fitted with the same process outlined in this section to derive site densities the experimental methods and results of truax 2015 are provided in the supporting information appendix c the fitted site densities of those three different data sets were compared to each other to determine the variability of fitted parameters between the different methodologies employed a sensitivity analysis was performed on our models by varying input ph alkalinity and site densities to determine shifts in uranium breakthrough time t 50 variables were changed one at a time at percentile increments and plotted versus the percentile change in t 50 the increments were compared to a baseline alkalinity of 320 a ph of 6 5 and 0 1 by weight calcite content similar to the 192 haw experimental setup calcite precipitation was enabled during the sensitivity analysis to simulate field conditions where equilibrium conditions predominate a second sensitivity analysis was performed on ph and alkalinity with calcite precipitation and dissolution excluded to test the possible effect that calcite kinetics might have on experimental setups dependent parameters ph and alkalinity were not fixed during the analysis to simulate how uncertainties in influent chemistries compared to model input parameter could affect uranium transport after equilibration with the aquifer geochemistry 3 results 3 1 experimental results bet analysis on sediments from depth 192 m and 193 m showed surface areas of 4 7 0 58 m2 g and 9 4 0 38 m2 g respectively consistent with the observation that 192 contained coarser material xrf results table 1 indicated the presence of 0 74 and 0 275 mol kg soil of iron for depths 193 and 192 m respectively which according to xrd analyses may have been present as impurities in feldspar sediment characterization revealed a generally similar mineralogy between 192 and 193 except for toc content and the presence of montmorillonite in sediment 192 porosities calculated from tracer breakthroughs and flow rates were between 0 204 and 0 27 the lower effective porosity of tracer breakthrough compared to porosities derived from soil weights used represented in table 6 can be attributed to the presence of trapped air that was introduced during packing subsequent unit conversions and calculations all use the effective porosity derived from tracer data breakthrough curves for the bromide tracer and uranium effluent are provided in figs 2 5 models using best fit parameters are shown over the uranium breakthrough curve uranium breakthrough experienced significant retardation in all columns by a factor of 2 3 over tracer breakthrough changing the alkalinity of restoration waters from approximately 160 to 320 mg l caco3 increased t 50 by 25 and 30 for the 193 and 192 set respectively retardation factors and pore volumes for each experiment are shown in table 5 while effluent alkalinity for all four columns are provided in fig 6 total recoveries for uranium and calcium are provided in table 7 recoveries were above 90 for uranium in all columns and between 94 and 103 for calcium sediments from depth 192 m below ground provided slightly lower uranium recoveries than sediments from depth 193 m the discrepancy can be attributed to minute 1 mg l but persistent residual uranium that was still eluting from those columns after the experiment was terminated compared to the 193 columns sediment from depth 192 was finer grained than sediment from 193 and had a higher porosity as well hence the residual tail observed post injection could be explained by the diffusion of uranium into dead end pores and interstitial spaces influent waters were almost continuously over saturated with respect to calcite with a saturation index si varying between 0 14 and 1 24 with a median of 0 64 only the 160 mg l alkalinity experiments were slightly under saturated with a saturation index si of 0 14 to 0 04 during the uranium injection period for a total of 48 out of 143 h as a result very little calcite dissolution would be expected during the column experiment effluent ph produced significantly higher values compared to influent ph increasing by as much as 1 5 units the ph difference likely indicates micromolar amounts of co2 outgassing from the uncapped sampling vials during collection since the vials were left exposed to the atmosphere of the anaerobic chamber for 12 24 h prior to analysis effluent si calculated from measured effluent ph and alkalinity were also significantly higher than influent si as a result of the elevated ph in the sample vials alkalinity and calcium concentrations remained relatively stable between influent and effluent figs 1 and 6 table 7 visual inspection of influent in the syringes and effluent in the sampling vials did not reveal any visible calcite precipitation but small amounts of air bubbles did form in the syringes over the 48 h injection period 3 2 modeling and fitting results phreeqc produced generally good model fits with coefficients of determination r2 of 0 98 and 0 96 for the high and low alkalinity experiments using sediment depth 192 and 0 95 and 0 98 for high and low alkalinity influent for sediments from depth 193 respectively table 5 fitting parameters for strong and very strong binding sites are shown in table 5 together with the experiment s r2 and sors normalized to influent uranium the number of fitted sites involved in uranium sorption were between 141 and 178 μmol kg soil for soh and 9 56 and 16 3 μmol kg soil for ssoh sediment from depth 193 m below ground had a slightly reduced sorption capacity with a soh mean of 148 μmol sites kg soil compared to 160 μmol sites kg soil for sediment from depth 192 however fitted site densities were generally similar between the two sediments the higher delay in observed breakthrough for the 193 sediments can be attributed to a higher surface area to solution ratio table 6 rather than inherent differences in sorption capacity due to mineralogy this would suggest that geochemical heterogeneity at the srh site plays a less significant role in uranium retention than variability in aquifer porosities and sediment surface area the fitted number of sorption sites represents only between 0 79 and 1 96 of total sorption sites based on a generic site density of 3 84 μmol nm2 bidentate bonds dzombak and morel 1990 and bet results figs 2 5 show experimental uranium breakthrough together with models using the best fit values derived through pest the ph of the model outputs varied between 6 8 and 7 5 which was consistently lower by about 0 7 ph unit compared to measured effluent ph 7 5 8 3 modeled alkalinity varied by 20 of measured alkalinity and produced r2 values between 0 529 and 0 719 predicted calcite dissolution in phreeqc was consistently below 100 nm with the exception of ph modeled carbonate dynamics corresponded generally well to measured data figures for sensitivity analyzes are shown in figs 7 and 8 site density and alkalinity had a linear relationship between parameter increments and t 50 the sensitivity of ph showed lowest retardation at a ph of 6 5 in the presence of calcite while increasing or decreasing the ph by one unit increased breakthrough time by up to 15 modeling the system without allowing calcite to precipitate produced characteristic sorption behavior with a significant drop in uranium retardation past ph 6 5 of the three parameters investigated changes in site density had the greatest effect on uranium retardation when calcite was allowed to regulate alkalinity and ph 4 discussion 4 1 modeling effects of carbonate dynamics on uranium as shown in figs 2 5 and table 5 doubling the influent alkalinity increased uranium breakthrough time t 50 by 25 30 compared to the tracer this trend has been observed in prior literature as well kohler et al 1996 curtis et al 2006 dangelmayr et al 2017 models fits were generally accurate and close in all four columns r2 0 9 despite variability in both influent ph 0 4 ph units and alkalinity 40 mg l caco3 between syringe replacements fig 1 all experiments show two uranium peaks in the model one during the slug injection and the other shortly after switching to background water the second uranium peak was likely caused by the restoration water having a slightly higher alkalinity during the first injection 240 mg l caco3 than the subsequent influent water 160 mg l caco3 in addition to a higher ph 7 5 versus 6 5 our results demonstrate that the gc scm approach can effectively model the behavior of uranium induced by shifts in geochemistry typically encountered at isr restoration sites when high alkalinity restoration waters come into contact with background water the close model fits indicate that similar de sorption events due to changes in alkalinity and ph can be predicted in field systems provided carbonate dynamics in the field are well described in the model effluent alkalinity experienced mild deviations from model predictions 20 during all column runs we considered this deviation negligible the hach titration method can only measure alkalinity in steps of 20 mg l which would represent an inherent 5 17 instrumental error for the alkalinity ranges examined in addition r2 values were between 0 529 and 0 719 for the modeled and measured alkalinity however phreeqc consistently underestimated effluent ph from measured values by approximately 0 9 ph units figs s1 s4 the discrepancy is likely due to the prolonged time 12 24 h the uncapped sampling vials were exposed to the atmosphere of the anaerobic chamber mining waters at isr operations are significantly oversaturated with co2 g which is often the sole source of acidity micro to nanomolar amounts of co2 g evolution in the sampling vials could drive up the ph without any noticeable effect on total alkalinity it is possible that calcite precipitation kinetics could also have influenced the effluent ph phreeqc assumed equilibrium conditions with respect to calcite which would decrease the ph in the model output while calcite precipitation may have been kinetically limited in the columns however neither enabling nor disabling calcite precipitation in our model managed to produce effluent ph that resembled the measured data and overall did not change the alkalinity ph or uranium breakthrough significantly there also not any observed calcite precipitation within the syringes or during vial sampling as a consequence it is assumed the elevated ph is primarily an artefact of the experimental sampling procedures and does not reflect a deficiency within the conceptual model presented it should be noted that calcite kinetics could impact experimental designs and field models where water moves at velocities at which kinetic limitations become significant while models assume equilibrium conditions if calcite precipitates slowly then the ph and co3 2 in the model would be lower than observed in experimental conditions as a consequence fewer sorption sites would be required to fit the observed data and derived parameters would underestimate an aquifer s actual sorption capacity it is advisable to assess the potential impact calcite dissolution precipitation kinetics could have on gc scm parameters when designing sorption tests on actual sediments and keep track of effluent ph calcium and alkalinity to validate model assumptions regarding calcite dynamics 4 2 model sensitivity to carbonate dynamics a sensitivity analysis on ph and alkalinity was performed on the 192 column run with high alkalinity influent and results are presented in figs 7 and 8 despite the significant impact of alkalinity on uranium transport observed in the column experiment the model showed linear but low sensitivity to alkalinity relative change in t 50 only increased by 10 after reducing influent alkalinity to 160 mg l from 360 mg l while a 25 30 earlier uranium breakthrough in the haw columns occurred phreeqc corrected this discrepancy by fitting a slightly higher number of sorption sites to the law columns compared to the haw columns 1 31 mmol l solution and 1 04 mmol l solution compared to 1 46 mmol l solution and 1 32 mmol l solution for the 192 and 193 sediments respectively values shown in table 5 are in units of μmol kg sediment since the law columns also had lower porosities the reported site densities do not exhibit this trend the sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the impact of influent ph was not only more significant than influent alkalinity but also produced higher variability reducing the ph by half a unit from 6 5 increased t 50 by 10 while increasing the ph also increased breakthrough times fig 7 lowest sorption was observed in the ph range of 6 5 6 7 the effect of ph on the sorptive behavior of uranium has been well studied waite et al 1994 kohler et al 1996 echevarria et al 2001 davis et al 2004 curtis et al 2006 and generally show uranyl sorption to be maximum between ph 6 and 7 in batch experiments contrary to our simulations this discrepancy can be explained by the addition of calcite precipitation in the sensitivity simulations in our case influent waters were close to calcite saturation at ph 6 5 and alkalinity 320 mg l caco3 reducing the ph below 6 in the simulation caused significant calcite dissolution which equilibrated at a ph of 6 0 according to phreeqc even though alkalinity doubled from the baseline after equilibration the resulting ph of around 6 0 likely produced insufficient carbonate ions to form ternary uranium complexes necessary to reduce sorption meanwhile a higher ph induced calcite precipitation and subsequently lowered total alkalinity ph and dissolved calcium increasing sorption excluding calcite in the sensitivity simulations produced characteristic sorption behavior with a sharp drop in uranium retention past ph 6 5 due to the preference of uranium to form ternary complexes fig 8 an increase of one ph unit from 6 5 to 7 5 reduced uranium breakthrough time by 50 in our sensitivity analysis the transport models for the haw columns produce a consistently lower ph during restoration water flush than the law columns despite the fact that column effluents show similar experimental ph values between the two systems if the ph in the columns was only 0 3 units higher than predicted in the transport model due to kinetics errors in calcite content or ph measurements then that could explain together with the effect of alkalinity the observed 25 30 differences in t 50 between the haw and law columns if we assume that calcite precipitation was kinetically prohibitive the sensitivity analyses indicate that the effect of alkalinity and ph on uranium breakthrough can be regulated by calcite dynamics and is highly sensitive to small variations in ph 0 5 ph units in the 6 5 7 5 ph range groundwater velocities at the srh site are significantly lower than those used within our experiments 2 3 m per year as a consequence purely thermodynamic models may be inappropriate for column studies where calcite kinetics would produce additional uncertainty however they might be sufficient for isr sites and batch experiments that are completed over a longer equilibration period 4 3 significance of calcium carbonate dynamics on isr restoration practices the alkalinity of post mining groundwater at isr sites can reach up to 800 mg l caco3 while background waters may drop to 120 mg l caco3 typical post mining ph values are 6 5 to 6 8 before groundwater restoration is completed while background waters range in ph from 7 5 to 8 2 the necessity of reducing pco2 during isr restoration has been well documented davis and curtis 2007 proven methods for removing dissolved carbon dioxide as a part of the restoration process are available and commonly used such as air stripping or vacuum degassing and their use can significantly reduce alkalinity in the restoration zone and thus decrease dissolved uranium mobility the results discussed here underscore the importance of including one or more of these removal methods during restoration our research indicates that restoration practices also need to account for calcium concentrations and ph calcium hardness at the shr site can reach 400 mg l and background calcite is approximately 0 1 1 0 by weight significant amounts of dissolved calcium are removed during the reverse osmosis process typically employed during restoration removing co2 must therefore be done with respect to calcite s i as well as ph since under saturated restoration water may dissolve sediment calcite and increase uranium mobility outside of the restoration zone blending treated effluent with background water may alleviate this effect and bring restoration water into equilibrium with sediment mineralogy high sensitivity to ph and calcite kinetics can also produces significant errors and uncertainty in model predictability due to unknown field conditions as a consequence any risk assessments based on the results of forward models should assess uranium mobility over a range of plausible ph ranges and evaluate the impact of calcite kinetic to capture uncertainty in field and experimental conditions 4 4 modeling desorption hysteresis uranium breakthrough and uranium behavior during the slug injection were accurately captured by the gc scm model however a significant discrepancy in uranium desorption was observed between models and experimental results figs 2 5 hysteresis between sorption and desorption has been observed in prior literature dangelmayr et al 2017 dittrich and reimus 2015 kohler et al 1996 liu et al 2013 liu et al 2015 miller et al 2013 and is a common phenomenon of uranium transport the tailing behavior has been ascribed to mass transfer limitations at the pore scale and differences in sorption desorption kinetics liu et al 2013 liu et al 2015 as well as heterogeneity in sediment hydraulic conductivity miller et al 2013 prior attempts to predict the tailing behavior of uranium also found that the model fits depend highly on the number of sorption sites used dittrich and reimus 2015 noted that a 3 site model with an additional weak sorption site performed better than a 2 site or 1 site model even though all three models were able to capture initial uranium breakthrough the presence of a small number of very strong sorption sites was found to be responsible for the tailing behavior for our experiments desorption was actually overestimated by the model past 280 h while the model under predicted uranium retention during the early stages of the elution phase 200 280 h our fitting procedures did not assign weights to different parts of the breakthrough curves and restricted ssoh sites to no 0 05 of the soh sites as a consequence pest prioritized the initial breakthrough curve and behavior of the uranium slug over the desorption tailing since those would produce higher residuals the sensitivity of the model to the number of ssoh sites would also be lower since their influence on uranium desorption appeared during the latter stages of the experiment furthermore our design applied a simple model with few fitting parameters to the experimental data to reduce the non uniqueness of our solution space and simplify the application to field systems however the effect of soh to ssoh ratios and the possible need for a third site in the fitting process calls for further investigations as their effect on the long term behavior of uranium at actual isr sites could be significant when compared to short term laboratory experiments 4 5 cross comparisons between experiments one goal of our study was to assess the variability in sorption parameters obtained from the gc scm fitting process between different experimental set ups to this end select data from prior experiments on the same sediment cores were analyzed and their parameters re fitted if necessary to the model developed for in this research the previous column and batch experiments are described in detail in dangelmayr et al 2017 and truax 2015 site densities from prior experiments were recalculated with our updated conceptual model detailed in section 2 4 table 8 summarizes site densities obtained for each experimental setup for the strong binding sites soh and sorts them according to sediment depth and alkalinity fitted parameters completed on the same sediment section within the same experiment group varied by a factor 15 33 providing replicable results given the inherent uncertainty in the experimental data parameter comparisons on the same sediments between experimental setups yielded significantly higher variability in site densities column experiments produced average site densities that were higher by a factor of 1 46 for sediment depth 193 and 3 57 for sediment depth 191 compared average site densities of the corresponding batch experiments it should be noted that the presence of calcite in the batch experiment completed at 0 pco2 could be responsible for the low site densities produced during the fitting process the complete dissolution of an uncertain amount of calcite would have raised the alkalinity and ph to a higher value than predicted in the model and as a result under predict actual sorption capacity when the batch experiments completed at 0 pco2 were excluded from the averages fitted results for sediment depth 193 become identical between batch and column experiments and reduced by a factor of 2 8 for sediment 191 variability in batch to column scaling has been reported in several other studies and consensus on the causes as well as extent for these observations is in dispute kohler et al 1996 porro et al 2000 phillippi et al 2007 miller et al 2010 huber et al 2016 one study showed that sorption capacity derived from column experiments deviated by a factor of 2 6 times from that of batch experiments huber et al 2016 dispersion as well as diffusion into immobile phases are processes that occur exclusively in flow through systems and have been implicated in increasing apparent sorption capacity huber et al 2016 miller et al 2010 porro et al 2000 in addition phillippi et al 2007 and porro et al 2000 postulated that a solid concentration effect could impact and underestimate sorption in batch experiments compared to column studies specifically errors in solution to sediment ratios in the batch experiments can produce high variability in resulting site densities miller et al 2010 porro et al 2000 at a solid solution ratio of 0 047 a 5 error in porosity sediment volume to total volume can change the total number of sorption sites available for batch experiments by a factor of 2 on the other hand column experiments are conducted at solid solution ratios where errors in porosity produce equivalent errors in total number of sorption sites uncertainties in alkalinity ph and calcite s i would compound the observed discrepancies and thus could explain the variability between batch and column experiments the highest variability by a factor of 9 6 however was observed between two column experiments completed on sediment 192 table 8 our sensitivity analyses show that uncertainties in alkalinity ph or sediment calcite cannot fully account for the differences in the estimated parameters in addition errors in porosity cannot explain the significantly lower sorption site density in the lanl column experiment partial oxidation of pyrite into oxidized fe phases could account for the higher sorption capacity in the sdsm t experiments despite best efforts to preserve sediments anaerobically during transport and experimental set up more importantly the two different column studies used different methods of packing sediment and mounting the column the sdsm t study employed wet packing with compaction to produce saturated conditions while the lanl columns were dry packed saturated with co2 and flushed with background to dissolve co2 out of the columns dangelmayr et al 2017 the effect of packing methods on flow properties has been reviewed in lewis and sjöstrom 2010 different propensities for creating preferential flow paths and immobile pore spaces in the two packing methods could impact apparent retardation between the two columns in addition the sdsmt columns utilized a bottom to top flow while the lanl columns were placed sideways which could have produced different flow paths during sediment settling our study demonstrates the need for guidelines for conducting and assessing sorption experiments that employ either column or batch studies methodology with regards to packing mineral phases present chemistry and sediment solution ratios can produce fitted sorption parameters that vary by a factor of almost an order of magnitude the uncertainty associated with methodology outweighs any uncertainty in sediment mineralogy at the srh site the industry and regulators would benefit from a better development of best practices when designing sorption studies that intend to utilize the gc scm approach 4 6 uncertainty in upscaling modeling parameters the gc scm does not assume modeled sorption sites to be specific to any one mineral phase or metal oxide davis et al 2004 however when applying the gc scm approach to field systems a scaling factor needs to be used common scaling factors that have been suggested in the literature include fe content gustafsson et al 2009 johnson and tutu 2015 papynov et al 2016 waite et al 1994 and surface area bertetti et al 1998 jang et al 2007 johnson and tutu 2015 loganathan et al 2009 papynov et al 2016 prikryl et al 2001 xrf results showed around 3 iron for the two sediment depths studied fe at the srh site is also predominantly found in reduced forms downgradient of the mining zone while partial oxidation of fe minerals may have occurred when sediments were prepared for laboratory experiments if we assume uranium binding to ferrinol sites as the primary surface complexation mechanism then only 0 035 to 0 049 of iron actually participated in uranium sorption xrd did not detect any crystalline iron bearing minerals and bet results are relatively low for the presence of significant amounts of amorphous fe if the measured 3 of fe content was really in the form of amorphous ferric oxides then one would expect an almost 5 fold higher surface area for our sediments assuming a surface area of 600 m2 g for ferryhidrite dzombak and morel 1990 the lack of definite fe mineral phases makes it uncertain to what degree fe occurs as amorphous material or as substitutions in feldspar which would be unavailable for surface complexation as a consequence sediment fe represents a problematic scaling factor that could potentially add significant uncertainty into the model if an unknown fraction of fe actually participates in uranium sorption two other studies pointed out that total or extractable fe produce poor scaling parameters for predicting uranium sorption to mineral phases johnson and tutu 2015 loganathan et al 2009 prior studies have suggested that metal sorption to aluminosilicates can be scaled to field systems through surface area estimates bertetti et al 1998 prikryl et al 2001 srh sediments were primarily composed of quartz 73 74 k feldspar 8 8 19 4 and albite 6 6 14 suggesting that aluminol and silanol sites could dominate uranium sorption despite a measurable amount of clay content 5 7 montmorillonite and more toc table 5 found in the 192 material both sediments showed similar uranium sorption behavior bet results provided a surface area of 4 7 and 9 4 m2 g for both sediments 192 and 193 respectively table 6 together with an assumed site density of 3 84 μmol m2 dzombak and morel 1990 and bidentate uranyl complexation the total percentage of sites involved in uranyl sorption constitutes only 0 79 to 1 96 of the total sites available in five prior column experiments completed on materials from wells at the srh site the fitted site densities represented only between 0 24 and 1 09 of the total bet derived surface sites dangelmayr et al 2017 the variability in reactive surface sites as a percentage of total surface sites observed in our two laboratory studies presents a challenge when trying upscale gc scm results to the field scale based on these two studies on the same sediments upscaling the gc scm to the field would require a factor of safety of almost an order of magnitude between the upper and lower sorption density estimates 5 conclusion uranium sorption plays a key role in inhibiting uranium mobility at the srh isr facility reducing uranium breakthrough by a factor of 2 3 compared to tracer velocities alkalinity and ph have shown to impact uranium mobility increasing uranium breakthrough by 25 30 when average influent alkalinity was doubled this study demonstrates the applicability of gc scm to model uranium behavior under shifting geochemical conditions representable fits were produced for all columns when using a 2 surface site non electrostatic surface complexation model accounting for variability in influent ph and alkalinity sensitivity analyses showed that influent alkalinity or ph have a moderate effect on uranium transport while calcite saturation may have an indirect effect on uranium transport by regulating ph and alkalinity calcite kinetics may also be a source of error in observed sorption parameters in flow conditions when effluent ph is underestimated in the model outputs these results highlight the inherent need of isr restoration procedures to remove dissolved co2 and blend restored effluent with background water in addition site risk assessment should incorporate calcite saturation and kinetics within appropriate transport models a comparison of fitted site densities between three experimental studies showed a 1 5 to 3 6 fold difference between parameters derived from batch experiments and column experiments these discrepancies can be explained by uncertainties in experiment ph alkalinity and calcite content and demonstrate the importance of porosity and solid solution ratios when upscaling laboratory parameters to field scale models separate column studies completed on the same sediments produced almost an order of magnitude difference in fitted sorption site densities methodology in column packing was found to have a greater impact on fitted parameters than heterogeneity in sediment mineralogy addressing the uncertainties associated with gc scm models can inform both regulators and industry as to the number of core s that should be collected for laboratory testing the importance of parameters such as porosity and the degree to which a standard model construction procedure can be transferred to other hydrological and geochemical environments this research shows the potential of gc scm in fate and transport modeling under variable geochemical conditions but also highlights the need for standardized guidelines for regulators and industry when applying the gc scm to isr sites acknowledgments this research was supported by a grant from power
